Developing countries already in dire situations can simply not afford skyrocketing prices of food, fuel and other essential goods. — António Guterres (@antonioguterres) March 8, 2022

Amid the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, strict sanctions are being imposed on Russia for its military offensive, raising the price of crude oil in the global market. The price of crude oil has reached $130 per barrel as of Wednesday. Russia is the third-largest producer of petroleum globally, only behind the United States and Saudi Arabia.

On Tuesday, President of US Joe Biden imposed more sanctions on Russia and announced his decision to ban all imports of Russian gas, oil, and energy. He said that sanctions would cause significant damage to Russia's economy.

""We're banning all imports of Russian gas, oil, and energy. We're moving forward with this ban understanding that many of our European allies and partners may not be in a position to join us,"" Biden said adding that ""We are enforcing the most significant package of economic sanctions in history, and it's causing significant damage to Russia's economy.""

Biden's ban on Russian energy would likely be minimal as the US imports a small share of Russia's oil and does not buy any of its natural gas. Last year, imports of Russian oil and petroleum products represented about 8% of the US's total oil and petroleum imports. Biden also spoke about his European allies that would not participate in banning Russian energy. Germany and Hungary have already rejected sanctioning on Russian energy.

Rising Prices

In his tweet, David Beasley, the head of the World Food Programme (WFP), warned the world to prepare to face soaring food prices, catastrophic hunger, and growing instability as Russia and Ukraine together export 30% of the world's wheat. With Biden banning the import of Russian petroleum products, the price of crude oil is expected to rise amid these sanctions. Speaking to CNN, US Senator Chris Coons said, ""We are going to see increased gas prices here in the United States."" Coons also spoke about the effect of prices in Europe and said, ""In Europe, they will see dramatic increases in prices. That's the cost of standing up for freedom and standing alongside the Ukrainian people, but it's going to cost us. ""

Guterres tweeted: “The war in Ukraine not only has a dramatic impact on the lives of civilians but also has global repercussions. Developing countries already in dire situations can simply not afford skyrocketing prices of food, fuel and other essential goods.”

Prof. Herman Musahara, an economist who is a senior member of the at Economic Policy Research Network (EPRN) in Rwanda, on Wednesday gave The New Times his views on the impact of the conflict which is now “the talk of everybody from Twitter spaces to the UN Security Council” and also noted that the impact is certainly global now as stated by the UN chief.

Musahara said: “Like the crisis of 1973 the most affected sector is energy and commodity prices. The price of a barrel is now, for the foreseeable future, above $100. So, definitely we get imported inflation. Wheat, barley and corn prices are going up also. Russia and Ukraine account for 30 per cent of global supply. These are intermediate goods and the UN Secretary-General is right with imported inflation and, after the Covid-19 impact, developing countries, children and women will feel the effect of what is happening there.”

“The supply chains like during the Covid-19 have started being disturbed. Trade and financial systems are not affected by the conflict only but also by the sanctions by the US and the NATO partners. Imports of raw materials and final goods will be expensive and make lives [hard] in developing countries which are still struggling to recover from Covid-19.”

Musahara also said there is a possibility of resources being diverted.

“You can expect that grants on support and even education on youth, children and poor will now go to victims of the conflict.:

The East African Community (EAC) on March 2 issued a statement stating that it was deeply concerned by the ongoing conflict between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Ukraine. The bloc called for restraint and an immediate ceasefire by the two sides to avoid further loss of life and damage to property. At the time, the regional bloc shared the deep concern earlier expressed by the African Union Commission on the reported discrimination of Africans seeking safe exit from the conflict zone in Ukraine.

According to reports, around 4.5 percent of the population has left Ukraine, less than two weeks after Russia’s invasion began, on February 24. On Tuesday, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said two million people have fled from the war in Ukraine, country of approximately 44 million people.

Most refugees head to neighboring countries including Hungary, Slovakia, Moldova and Poland.

Grandi reported that UNHCR is supporting coordination of the humanitarian response.

The UN refugee chief called for the international community to step up to provide more support for refugees and host communities, particularly in Moldova where some 250,000 people found refuge.

“All European states must continue to show generosity. Other countries, beyond Europe, also have an important role to play to help people in need and share the international responsibility for millions of refugees,” said Grandi.

While in the region, the UN refugee chief also raised concerns about discrimination and racism against some communities fleeing Ukraine.

According to media reports, Russia and Ukraine earlier agreed on the need for humanitarian corridors to deliver aid and help civilians exit besieged Ukrainian cities, in the first apparent sign of progress in talks between the warring sides.

“We welcome public communications by the two sides regarding their intention to facilitate safe passage for civilians out of conflict areas including Mariupol, Kharkiv and Sumy,” UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric on Tuesday told journalists during his daily briefing in New York.

The United Nations on Tuesday moved to squash reporting that it had directed all staff to avoid using terms like ""war"" and ""invasion"" when referring to the fighting in Ukraine.

""It is simply not the case that staff have been instructed not to use words like ‘war’ and ‘invasion’ to describe the situation,"" Stéphane Dujarric, a spokesman for the secretary-general, told Fox News.

Dujarric said it was a ""mistaken impression"" after the Irish Times reported Tuesday that the chief international agency had directed its staff to instead use wording like ""military operation.""

The email was reportedly distributed internally among a regional office to employees, advising them to be mindful that they are ""international civil servants"" and ""have a responsibility to be impartial.""

But the email caused a stir Tuesday as Russian continues its illegal assault on Ukraine.

""One email from a local office to their local staff is not representative of instructions given to U.N. staff worldwide,"" Dujarric said.

PUTIN MAINTAINS 95% OF AVAILABLE COMBAT POWER IN UKRAINE AS WAR PERSISTS: DOD OFFICIAL WARNS

The chief spokesman pointed to language still being used by top U.N. officials like Under-Secretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo, who on Monday condemned actions taken by Russian President Vladimir Putin against Ukrainian civilians and said, ""This war is senseless.""

""Nearly two weeks on, it is painfully clear that those suffering the most after Russia's invasion of Ukraine are civilians - killed, wounded, displaced. This war is senseless,"" she said in a tweet. ""We are ready to support all good-faith efforts at negotiation to end the bloodshed.""

Fox News also obtained an email that was distributed by the U.N. globally that directed all staffers to abide by U.N. policies when engaging on social media and to frame communication on Ukraine ""in a manner that is consistent with the position of the Organization and the statements of the Secretary-General.""

The release followed a rare trip by a high-level U.S. delegation to Venezuela over the weekend to meet with President Nicolás Maduro, part of a broader Biden administration agenda in autocratic countries that may be rethinking their ties with President Vladimir V. Putin in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The talks with Venezuela, which has enormous proven oil reserves, assumed new urgency after President Biden announced Tuesday that the United States would ban Russian oil and gas imports because of the invasion. That move is expected to further tighten the availability of crude oil on the global market, and could raise gas prices at a moment when inflation has climbed at its fastest pace in 40 years.

“This is a step that we’re taking to inflict further pain on Putin, but there will be costs as well here in the United States,” Mr. Biden said of the ban on Russian oil.

American officials said that the prisoner release was not part of a deal with Venezuela to restart oil sales to the United States, which were banned under the Trump administration. For weeks, American business people who have worked in Venezuela have had back-channel discussions about resuming America’s oil trade with Mr. Maduro’s government.

Venezuela could eventually help make up some of the shortfall caused by the ban on Russian oil. But industry experts warned that Venezuelan oil supplies would do little to tame American gas prices and inflation quickly. Increasing the country’s production may take time after the years of mismanagement and underinvestment that have decimated the country’s energy sector.

Prominent members of Congress have also come out against efforts to thaw relations with Mr. Maduro, whose government has been accused by the United Nations of systematic human rights violations.

“Nicolás Maduro is a cancer to our hemisphere and we should not breathe new life into his reign of torture and murder,” Senator Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat who leads the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Monday in a statement.

The released men are Gustavo Cárdenas, an executive at the American branch of Venezuela’s state oil company who was detained in 2017, and Jorge Alberto Fernández, Mr. Biden said in a statement.

“These men are fathers who lost precious time with their children and everyone they love, and their families have suffered every day of their absence,” he said, adding, “We also remember the names and the stories of every American who is being unjustly held against their will — in Venezuela, in Russia, in Afghanistan, Syria, China, Iran and elsewhere around the world.”

Mr. Fernández, a Cuban American, was a tourist who was accused of terrorism for bringing a drone into Venezuela in February 2021, according to his lawyer.

At least eight other U.S. nationals remain jailed in Caracas on charges ranging from embezzlement to terrorism.

The purpose of the American officials’ visit to Venezuela was to discuss “energy security” and the status of imprisoned Americans, the White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a news conference.

Mr. Maduro said he received the American delegation at the presidential palace and called the meeting “respectful, cordial, very diplomatic.” The talks, he said, would continue. He also said he would restart talks with the country’s opposition.

The Venezuelan government wants to resume oil sales to the United States to take advantage of high oil prices and to replace the revenues from trade channels it built through the Russian financial system that have been frozen by Western nations to punish Russian aggression against Ukraine, according to officials and oil businessmen in the country.

Selling directly to the United States would also allow Mr. Maduro to reap full profits from the highest oil prices in more than a decade, instead of selling the crude at deep discount to a network of middlemen used to bypass the U.S. ban, they said.

Before that ban, Venezuela exported most of its oil to the United States, whose Gulf refineries were built to process the country’s heavy crude.

In 2017, Venezuelan security forces arrested six executives from Citgo Petroleum, the American branch of the state oil company, after the Maduro government summoned them to meetings in Caracas. The State Department has said that all six detainees are U.S. nationals.

The executives were charged with financial crimes and jailed. Their former boss, Nelson Martínez, the head of the state oil company, was detained soon after them and died in custody a year later.

The executives’ families and their lawyers have said that the men, who have come to be known as the Citgo 6, are innocent and that they were lured to Caracas to be used by Mr. Maduro as pawns in his negotiations with the United States.

Venezuela’s treatment of the executives varied as U.S.-Venezuelan relations warmed and cooled. Sometimes the detainees were held in prison, other times in house arrest. Since last year, they have been held in a single cell in the Venezuela’s secret police’s underground prison, where the United Nations has documented irregularities and human rights abuses in the case of at least one of them.

Among the other Americans held in Venezuela is Matthew Heath, a Marine veteran who was detained in Venezuela’s northern state of Falcon in 2020. The Venezuelan government claims he was spying on critical infrastructure. Mr. Heath’s family and the U.S. government said that he was innocent and that he was detained because of his nationality.

Two other Americans still detained, former Special Forces members Airan Berry and Luke Denman, were arrested in 2020 after they tried to invade Venezuela by boat as part of a failed plot to overthrow Mr. Maduro.

The Trump administration cut off diplomatic relations with Venezuela in 2019, closing the United States Embassy in Caracas and imposing the ban on Venezuelan oil. A year later, the Justice Department indicted Mr. Maduro and more than a dozen other Venezuelan officials on drug trafficking charges, accusing them of facilitating cocaine shipments to the United States.

The misery wrought by Russia’s Ukraine invasion on Feb. 24 deepened further in both countries — destruction and deprivation in Ukraine, and the toll of the West’s tightening vise grip on Russia’s economy.

Perilous conditions were getting worse in several Ukrainian cities where Russian forces were closing in, increasingly striking civilian targets and leaving people trapped without basic needs like water, food, heat and medicines. In the halting efforts to evacuate, thousands of people were able to flee the city of Sumy, but in other cities, for the fourth day in a row, Ukrainian officials said that Russian shelling thwarted most attempts to create safe corridors for escaping civilians.

Things were especially dire in the southern port of Mariupol, where Russian strikes hit several civilian buildings on Wednesday, including a maternity hospital, sending bloodied pregnant women fleeing into the cold. Hundreds of casualties have been reported, people have taken to cutting down trees to burn for heat and cooking, trenches have been dug for mass graves and local authorities have instructed residents on how to dispose of dead family members — wrap the bodies, tie the limbs and put them on the street.

At the defunct Chernobyl nuclear power plant, seized by Russian troops in the days after President Vladimir V. Putin ordered the invasion, the outside electricity supply was cut off, threatening the ability to safeguard the nuclear waste stored there, the International Atomic Energy Agency said. For now, the plant has backup power and no radiation leaks have been detected, the agency said, but its warnings signaled that Chernobyl, site of the worst nuclear accident in history, could once again pose a threat to the region.

The foreign ministers of Ukraine and Russia were expected to meet on Thursday for the first time since the invasion. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, host of the meeting, said Wednesday that he hoped it would “crack the door open to a permanent cease-fire,” but such a prospect remained uncertain at best.

Mr. Putin, seeking to regain Moscow’s lost sway over Ukraine, continued to demand that his neighbor unilaterally disarm and guarantee that it would never join the NATO alliance, conditions that Ukrainian and NATO officials have described as unacceptable.

The war has claimed thousands of lives and prompted more than two million people to leave Ukraine in less than two weeks, one of the swiftest and biggest refugee flows ever seen. The United Nations said Wednesday that its monitors had confirmed 516 civilian deaths and 908 injuries, acknowledging the figures were doubtless too low, partly because of the inability to count casualties in and around southeastern cities, like Mariupol, where fighting has been intense.

An estimated 5,000 to 6,000 Russian troops have been killed during the two-week invasion, U.S. official said on Wednesday, up sharply from an estimate of 3,000 days ago. The higher number reflects fierce fighting in the past several days and updated intelligence estimates. Experts caution that casualty numbers are difficult to assess, and numbers on both sides have varied widely.

Russia has acknowledged only hundreds of military deaths, while Ukrainian officials have said the true numbers are in the thousands on both sides.

U.S. intelligence agencies say Mr. Putin has been frustrated by the slow pace of the military advance and is likely to double down on using brute force, which could mean far more destruction and much higher civilian casualties. Russian forces have stepped up rocket, artillery and air attacks on cities, hitting a growing number of civilian targets; Ukrainian officials say the Kremlin, so far unable to win military victory, is instead trying to destroy Ukrainian morale.

Hospitals like the one in Mariupol have become exceedingly dangerous places to work or seek care. The World Health Organization has verified at least 18 attacks on Ukrainian health facilities and health workers, the organization’s director, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said Wednesday.

Russia’s Defense Ministry acknowledged that conscripts had been sent into battle in Ukraine, and that some were taken prisoner, contradicting Mr. Putin’s pledge that conscripts “are not participating and will not participate” in a war that he insists is not a war. There have been widespread reports of ill-prepared Russian soldiers not knowing until the last minute that they were to take part in an invasion.

To the surprise of Russian leaders, Western governments and even some Ukrainian commanders, Kyiv’s forces have resisted tenaciously. Russia’s formidable military had apparently not prepared for an extended fight, expecting a quick capitulation, and has run into repeated logistical problems.

Russia has sent mixed signals on whether its aims have shifted. Over the weekend, Mr. Putin said that continued resistance “called into question the very future of Ukrainian statehood” — an especially ominous warning from a leader who has claimed that Ukraine is a phony country and rightfully should be united with Russia.

But on Wednesday, Maria Zakharova, spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, insisted that Russia does not plan to “occupy Ukraine, destroy its statehood or overthrow its government.”

A day after President Biden prohibited energy imports from Russia to the United States, the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri Peskov, accused Washington, which has hit Russia with an escalating series of sanctions, of declaring “an economic war” and told reporters, “you see the bacchanalia, the hostile bacchanalia, which the West has sown.”

U.S. and European financial penalties and restrictions are throttling banks and other businesses in Russia and in Belarus, its ally, limiting the Russian government’s ability to use its enormous foreign currency reserves, and impeding millions of Russians from using their credit cards, accessing their bank deposits or traveling abroad. Foreign assets of wealthy individuals and businesses allied with the Kremlin have been frozen. The European Union on Wednesday expanded the list of directly sanctioned people and organizations to nearly 1,000.

Rating agencies have sharply downgraded the Russian government’s credit, signaling that it may be unable to pay creditors. Fitch Ratings warned on Tuesday that in its view, “default is imminent.”

Hundreds of Western businesses — manufacturers, oil companies, retailers and fast-food chains like McDonald’s — have suspended operations in Russia; Mr. Peskov said Wednesday that he hoped the number of Russians left unemployed by the exodus “would not be in the millions.” Russian lawmakers are considering nationalizing the assets of foreign companies that leave in response to the war.

The ruble has dropped to its lowest levels in history — on Wednesday it traded around 130 to the dollar, compared to 76 a week before the invasion. The Russian stock market, which plummeted in response to the invasion and resulting sanctions, has been closed by regulators since the following day.

Russia’s central bank, trying to prop up the ruble’s value, limited withdrawals of foreign currency from Russian banks and prohibited banks from selling foreign currency.

In Washington, leaders of Congress on Wednesday finalized a $13.6 billion package of military and humanitarian aid for Ukraine, as the Western powers continued to funnel weapons into the country, and strengthen NATO defenses in countries bordering Russia. The International Monetary Fund also approved $1.4 billion in emergency financing support for Ukraine. “The fund expresses its deepest sympathy to the Ukrainian people in these extraordinarily difficult times and will remain closely engaged with the Ukrainian authorities,” the announcement said.

Vice President Kamala Harris left for a three-day trip to Poland and Romania, where she was to meet with some of the NATO leaders who have so far maintained a remarkably united front on countering Russia.

Britain said it would send more than 3,600 antitank weapons to Ukraine, and the Pentagon announced plans to position Patriot air defense missile batteries in Poland, relocating them from elsewhere in Europe. The allies have discussed whether and how to supply warplanes to Ukraine.

But NATO members have consistently said they would not send their own military forces into Ukraine, which would place them directly into a war with Russia, and for the same reason they have refused Ukraine’s request that they enforce a no-fly zone to deprive Russia of control of Ukrainian skies.

6,44b9c6a9-6ed8-4dda-9ac1-33f97315de93,[],,"A previous version of this article, citing a report from The Irish Times, incorrectly stated that the United Nations banned staff members from using the words “war” or “invasion.” The ban applied to a regional office at the United Nations, not the United Nations itself.

A United Nations regional office has told staff members to avoid referring to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a “war” or “invasion” in an email sent on Monday, according to a new report.

The Irish Times first reported the information, citing a U.N. communications department email to employees. The email also warned against the use of the Ukrainian flag to personal or social media accounts.

“Some specific examples of language to use/not use at the moment,” the Irish Times revealed that the email read. “[Use] ‘conflict’ or ‘military offensive’ and NOT ‘war’ or ‘invasion’ when referring to the situation in Ukraine.”

Regarding the Ukrainian flag, the email noted, “Do NOT add the Ukrainian flag to personal or official social media accounts or websites,” the email read. The policy was explained as a “reputational risk.”

“This is an important reminder that we, as international civil servants, have a responsibility to be impartial,” the email added. “There is a serious possibility of reputational risk that has been flagged by senior officials recently.”

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, however, has continued to refer to the war in Ukraine as a war in public statements.

The war in Ukraine not only has a dramatic impact on the lives of civilians but also has global repercussions. Developing countries already in dire situations can simply not afford skyrocketing prices of food, fuel and other essential goods. — António Guterres (@antonioguterres) March 8, 2022

The war in Ukraine is also an assault on the world’s most vulnerable people and countries. Food, fuel & fertilizer prices are skyrocketing – hitting the poorest the hardest and planting the seeds for political instability and unrest around the world. — António Guterres (@antonioguterres) March 15, 2022

The regional office’s staff guidance closely resembled the language used by Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin has continued to use the term “special military operation” in regard to its invasion of Ukraine after initially referring to its invasion as a peacekeeping mission.

On Friday, Russia’s parliament also passed a law that threatened a jail term of up to 15 years for spreading so-called fake news about the military conflict in Ukraine.

“If the fakes lead to serious consequences then imprisonment of up to 15 years threatens,” the lower house of parliament, known as the Duma in Russian, said in a statement, according to Reuters.

“Literally by tomorrow, this law will force punishment – and very tough punishment – on those who lied and made statements which discredited our armed forces,” Duma chairman Vyacheslav Volodin said in the report.

According to the report Russia claims that “Western media have failed to report on what they cast as the ‘genocide’ of Russian-speaking people in Ukraine.”

The new law has led to many media outlets and social media platforms suspending operations in Russia.

Netflix and TikTok announced on Sunday that they have suspended their services inside Russia, following suspended services by Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and networks such as the BBC and CNN. The Daily Wire previously reported:

“Given the circumstances on the ground, we have decided to suspend our service in Russia,” a spokesperson for Netflix said in a statement. The Verge added: Last week, Netflix said it wouldn’t comply with a new Russian law that requires large streamers to host 20 Russian propaganda channels, such as NTV and the state-backed Channel One. The streaming giant later announced that it’s halting all productions and acquisitions in Russia — Netflix had been working on four Russian originals at the time. According to Bloomberg, Netflix currently has around 1 million subscribers in Russia. TikTok announced on Sunday that it was suspending its services inside Russia for safety reasons.

8,44b9c6a9-6ed8-4dda-9ac1-33f97315de93,[],,"The war in Ukraine is threatening to cut global grain supplies and worsen food insecurity, leading to proposals to ramp up agricultural production in the United States and Europe by planting crops this year on conservation acreage.

Ukraine is a major global supplier of wheat, corn and vegetable oil. It's unclear at this point how much of the country's winter wheat crop can be harvested and exported or how much of the nation's corn and sunflower crops can be planted this spring.

European farmers, who have consistently pushed back against some of the strictest restraints in the European Union's Farm to Fork and Biodiversity Strategy programs, are pressuring the European Commission — the EU's governmental arm — to allow cultivation of all available land this spring as farmers in Ukraine prepare to harvest wheat and struggle to ready fields for spring crops amid the growing violence that’s tearing the country apart.

“Since the Russian government is using food security as a weapon, we must counter it with a food shield,” says Christiane Lambert, president of the European farm and co-op organization Copa and Cogeca.

The latest data from the European Commission shows that there are roughly 5 million acres of idled farm land that could be planted in the EU.

Meanwhile, a leading agricultural economist in the United States last week proposed to open the 22-million-acre Conservation Reserve Program to emergency cropping this year. “I am convinced (the Ukraine crisis) is going to be the biggest supply shock to global grain markets in my lifetime,"" said Scott Irwin of the University of Illinois.

Commodity prices have risen sharply due to the crisis. Chicago wheat futures closed at $12.87 a bushel Tuesday, up from about $8 in mid-February. Corn futures are up about a dollar a bushel over that period to $7.55. Soybean futures are up from $15.74 since Feb. 14 to $16.90.

A spokesperson for USDA said there were no discussions about opening CRP, and it's not clear how much of the land farmers would be willing to plant, especially since much of the southern and central Plains is in the grip of a drought. But the top Republican on the Senate Agriculture Committee, John Boozman of Arkansas, said the idea should be on the table. ""I think we very much need to look at that,"" Boozman told Agri-Pulse.

In a letter to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack on Tuesday, Boozman stopped short of calling for cropping of CRP acres but did ask Vilsack to delay enrollment for new contracts.

In response to the Boozman letter, USDA said Tuesday ""there has been no change in our position.""

But Kip Tom, a former U.S. ambassador to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and World Food Program during the Trump administration, said the impact of the crisis on poor countries ""is going to get much worse than what most of us understand at this point in time.""

He supports allowing farming of conservation acres on both sides of the Atlantic. ""If there was ever a time we need to open up CRP in the United States, and Europe, it's now,"" he said. He added, ""I would rather them do that than try to restrict ethanol production, biofuel production.""

Ukraine has become a critical part of the global food supply in recent years. USDA's February forecast for global grain markets estimated Ukraine would produce 33 million metric tons of wheat for the 2021-2022 marketing year, only slightly less than Australia, with 24 million tons expected to be exported. Meanwhile, Ukraine was forecast to export 33.5 million of the 42 million metric tons of corn it produced in 2021.

Ukraine farmers have tripled their corn acreage over the past 15 years and yields have doubled, according to USDA's Economic Research Service. Ukraine is now one of the world's four major exporters of corn, “on par with Brazil and Argentina,” ERS says.

EU farm group: Time for 'paradigm shift'

EU Agriculture Commissioner Janusz Wojciechowski says that what little Ukraine can harvest will go towards feeding people still in the country and no exports are expected. That’s going to affect nearby countries like Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia and Poland the most. Those countries and others need grain and oilseeds to make bread and livestock feed.

“A paradigm shift is needed in the way Brussels thinks about agriculture, starting with the objectives set out in the Farm to Fork,” Copa and Cogeca said in a statement released Sunday.

The European Union is attempting through Farm to Fork to overhaul the way its 27 nations farm and produce food by cutting the use of pesticides on farms by 50%, reducing fertilizer usage by 20% and requiring that 25% of its farmland shift to organic.

While the proposal may be more sustainable, studies like one performed by USDA stress they will also slash European production.

European agricultural production would decline by as much as 4%, and food prices would rise by as much as 60% as a result of Farm to Fork and the Biodiversity Strategy, according to the ERS economists, who evaluated multiple scenarios.

EU politicians, who have been preoccupied for years with making agriculture greener, need to also recognize, farmers say, that the situation in Ukraine means that EU farmers will have to produce more.

“We don’t have a problem with sustainability, but we underline the importance that we need to produce sufficient volumes to supply the market needs,” said Pekka Pesonen, secretary general of Copa and Cogeca, the EU farm organization.

At a minimum, European farmers need to be able to plant on all of the arable land that’s available and that means the 27 EU countries need to drop environmental restrictions that idle farmable land, the group said.

“Copa and Cogeca are asking to be able to cultivate all available land in 2022 to compensate for the blockage of Russian and Ukrainian production,” the group said. “Everything must be done to prevent disruptions in supply chains, which will inevitably lead to shortages in certain parts of the world. This is an essential question of food sovereignty and democratic stability.”

The European Commission formally adopted its next common agricultural policy, or CAP, in December. CAP, which is the equivalent of the U.S. farm bill, will require every farm to set aside at least 3% of arable land in order to qualify for subsidies.

The shortage of crops expected as a result of Russia’s war on Ukraine should take precedence over protection of the EU's 5 million acres of idled land, said Pesonen.

Copa and Cogeca Chief Policy Advisor Paulo Gouveia tells Agri-Pulse that “sustainability is and remains a key priority” for the EU’s farmers, but “the recent invasion of Ukraine by Russia has effectively changed the landscape. Productions costs that were already on the rise have seen steeper increases in the past few days while EU production will either stagnate or decrease.”

European farmers don’t want to rely even more on imports, so politicians are going to have to reassess Farm to Fork, he said

And it looks like politicians are listening.

“The terrible events taking place in Ukraine cast a tragic light on the need for us to strengthen our food sovereignty so as to ensure food security in times of crisis, both within the European Union and around the world,” French Agriculture Minister Julien Denormandie said during a Brussels press conference last week.

Denormandie, speaking after a meeting of Europe’s ag ministers, called directly for EU member countries to allow fallow land to be planted. He stressed that several ag ministers in the meeting last Wednesday “suggested we could use set-aside land” to grow more grains and oilseeds in order to feed livestock.

Wojciechowski promised that it’s an option under consideration, but he went even further. The EU’s ag ministers, he said, are beginning to discuss the Farm to Fork strategy in the context of the Ukrainian crisis.

“If food security is in danger, then we need to have another look at the objectives (of Farm to Fork) and possibly correct them,” Wojciechowski said. “I think we are in that situation now, which is why there’s a need for analysis.”

That comes close to what the EU’s farmers are saying, and Pesonen says there’s a very good reason for that. Ag ministers, he stressed, “know perfectly well that they will get the blame if we have shortages and consequently higher prices in the marketplace.”

Senate Democrat says CRP should be left alone

High prices are likely to fall hardest on the poor in developing countries who pay a larger share of their income for food. Countries in the Middle East and North Africa where wheat is a staple food will be among the hardest hit, economists say.

“You won't see a global food shortage. Unfortunately, what you're going to see is globally many many millions of people, even billions, might not be able to afford to buy the food, but the food will be available,” Sal Gilbertie, president of Teucrium Trading LLC, told Yahoo! Finance.

But the biggest hit to the global food supplies could be the effect of the crisis on fertilizer supplies, said James Thurlow, a development economist at the International Food Policy Research Institute. Fertilizer prices were skyrocketing even before the crisis, and the Russian government last week moved to suspend exports from its fertilizer manufacturers.

""What happens next season when the fertilizer is far more expensive and productivity begins to fall? I think that's when we're going to start worrying about broad-based impacts on the global food system,"" Thurlow said.

Irwin, the University of Illinois economist, believes there is a dire and immediate need for additional grain acreage this spring, and he argues that the Conservation Reserve Program is the only ""policy lever"" available to the Biden administration.

""The world desperately needs additional acres for grain production in 2022,"" Irwin wrote on his Twitter feed. ""Basically nothing that can be done in the short run except to run up the price of grain high enough to ration demand. Market will work but could take wildly high price.""

Texas has the most land in CRP, about 2.3 million acres, followed by Colorado with 2 million, South Dakota with 1.75 million and Kansas with 1.74 million.

Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer, whose home state of North Dakota has 1.2 million acres enrolled, also thinks CRP should be an option for cropping this year.

""Everyone should be deeply concerned about global food prices hitting record highs at the same time an agricultural powerhouse like Ukraine is mired in a struggle for its freedom. Directing USDA to examine whether Conservation Reserve Program acres should be opened for cropping to avoid a global food shortage is just one of several considerations for the Biden administration,"" he said in a statement to Agri-Pulse.

Opening CRP to cropping this year would almost certainly face strong opposition from environmental groups, and some Democrats told Agri-Pulse they don't think it's justified.

“Investing in the conservation programs that help producers prevent runoff is good for farmers, it’s good for taxpayers, and it’s good for our environment. Ohio farmers – whether they grow corn, soybeans, or wheat – respond to market dynamics and there’s no reason to roll back CRP and other critical conservation protections,"" Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, said in a statement to Agri-Pulse.
