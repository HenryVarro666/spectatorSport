American intelligence officials offered an assessment of the Russian air campaign, estimating that invading pilots are averaging 200 sorties a day, compared with five-to-10 for Ukrainian forces, which are focusing more on surface-to-air missiles, rocket-propelled grenades and drones to take out Russian aircraft.

New commercial satellite images appeared to capture artillery firing on residential areas between Russian forces and the capital. The images from Maxar Technologies showed muzzle flashes and smoke from the big guns, as well as impact craters and burning homes in the town of Moschun, outside Kyiv, the company said.

In a devastated village east of the capital, villagers climbed over toppled walls and flapping metal strips in the remnants of a pool hall, restaurant and theatre freshly blown apart by Russian bombs.

Russian President Vladimir Putin ""created this mess, thinking he will be in charge here,"" 62-year-old Ivan Merzyk said. In temperatures sinking below freezing, villagers quickly spread plastic wrap or nailed plywood over blown out windows of their homes.

""We are not going away from here,"" Merzyk said.

On the economic and political front, the U.S. and its allies moved to further isolate and sanction Russia. U.S. President Joe Biden announced the U.S. will dramatically downgrade its trade status with Russia and also ban imports of Russian seafood, alcohol and diamonds.

The move to revoke Russia's ""most favoured nation"" status was taken in co-ordination with the European Union and G7 countries.

""The free world is coming together to confront Putin,"" Biden said.

On the ground, Russian forces appeared to be trying to regroup and regain momentum after encountering heavier losses and stiffer resistance than anticipated over the past two weeks. Britain's Ministry of Defence said Russia is trying to ""reset and re-posture"" its troops, gearing up for operations against Kyiv.

'Going to get worse'

""It's ugly already, but it's going to get worse,"" said Nick Reynolds, a land warfare analyst at Royal United Services Institute, a British think-tank.

With the invasion in its 16th day, Russian President Vladimir Putin said there had been ""certain positive developments"" in Russia-Ukraine talks, but gave no details.

For his part, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukrainian forces had ""reached a strategic turning point,"" though he did not elaborate.

""It's impossible to say how many days we will still need to free our land, but it is possible to say that we will do it,"" Zelensky said via video from Kyiv.

Zelensky said authorities were working on establishing 12 humanitarian corridors and trying to ensure food, medicine and other basics get to people across the country. Thousands of civilians and soldiers are believed to have been killed in the invasion.

He accused Russia of kidnapping the mayor of one city, Melitopol, calling the abduction ""a new stage of terror."" The Biden administration had warned before the invasion of Russian plans to detain and kill targeted people in Ukraine. Zelensky himself is a likely top target.

Biggest advances in east, south

So far, the Russians have made the biggest advances on cities in the east and south while struggling in the north and around Kyiv.

Russia said it used high-precision long-range weapons to put military airfields in Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk in the west ""out of action."" The attack on Lutsk killed four Ukrainian servicemen, the city's mayor said.

Russian airstrikes also targeted for the first time the eastern city of Dnipro, a major industrial hub in the east and Ukraine's fourth-largest city, with about one million people. One person was killed, Ukrainian officials said.

In images of the aftermath released by Ukraine's emergency agency, firefighters doused a flaming building, and ash fell on bloodied rubble. Smoke billowed over shattered concrete where buildings once stood.

The bombardment continued in Mariupol, where a deadly strike on a maternity hospital this week sparked international outrage and war-crime allegations.

No burials for Mariupol's dead

Unrelenting attacks have thwarted repeated attempts to send in food and medicine and evacuate civilians from Mariupol, a city of 430,000. In a statement, the Mariupol mayor's office said Friday that the toll of people killed during the now 12-day siege had risen to 1,582.

In the face of the unrelenting bombing, ""the dead aren't even being buried,"" the mayor's office said.

Elsewhere, temperatures were forecast to hit -13 C in the eastern city of Kharkiv, which has come under heavy bombardment.

About 400 apartment buildings in Kharkiv lost heat, and Mayor Ihor Terekhov appealed to remaining residents to descend into the subway or other underground shelters where blankets and hot food were being distributed.

The latest assaults came a day after satellite photos appeared to show that the huge armoured column that was stalled for over a week outside Kyiv had spread out near the capital.

Russian convoy fans out

Military analysts were divided over whether the manoeuvring by the Russian convoy signalled the imminent start of a siege of Kyiv or was just an effort by the troops to disperse some vehicles to more protected positions.

The photos showed howitzers newly set up in firing position, and armoured units staged near the Antonov Airport north of the city, according to Maxar.

The 64-kilometre line of tanks and other vehicles had massed outside Kyiv early last week. Its advance appeared to stop amid reports of food and fuel shortages, muddy roads and attacks by Ukrainian troops with anti-tank missiles.

Mathieu Boulegue, a researcher at the London think-tank Chatham House, said the redeployment means the battle for Kyiv is just hours or days away. He predicted a drawn-out siege.

""This is going to be a very long battle of attrition. This is going to be an atrociously casualty-heavy battle and a siege, the likes of which we have rarely seen in modern history,"" Boulegue said.

U.S. officials saw the breakup of the convoy headed toward Kyiv as less significant.

A U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the U.S. military assessment, said that the convoy had not made any substantial progress toward the city and that the vehicles' moves are not part of a tactical effort to advance on Kyiv.

The U.S. also says Russia has launched nearly 810 missiles into Ukraine.

Meanwhile, the United Nations political chief said the international organization had received credible reports that Russian forces were using cluster bombs in populated areas. The bombs scatter smaller explosives over a wide area and are prohibited in cities and towns under international law.

Repeated rounds of negotiations between Russia and Ukraine have taken place along the Belarus border, and the two countries' foreign ministers held talks on Thursday with no apparent progress, while various third countries have also made attempts to broker a stop to the fighting.

Appeal for help with 'migration crisis'

Some 2.5 million people have fled Ukraine since the invasion began, the International Organization for Migration said Friday, with more than half of those going to Poland.

The International Monetary Fund said it will increase financial support to Moldova to help it withstand the extra pressure created by the arrival of over 270,000 refugees from Ukraine, the agency said Friday. Around 105,000 of those refugees have stayed in Moldova, according to government figures from Thursday.

The southeastern European country of Romania, a nation of about 19 million residents, had taken in more than 84,000 displaced people as of Tuesday, according to United Nations data. Other countries on NATO's eastern flank, including Hungary, Moldova and Slovakia, have also welcomed tens of thousands of refugees.

In Berlin, Interior Ministry spokesperson Marek Wede said Friday that federal police so far have recorded 109,183 people coming from Ukraine entering the country, more than 99,000 of them Ukrainian citizens.

He noted that the number may be higher because Germany doesn't have full regular border checks on its eastern frontiers with Poland and the Czech Republic.

This has led to the Kremlin's forces suffering significant losses in armored and unarmored vehicles, aircraft, and personnel, and prompted a shift in tactics to encircling and laying siege to key cities. As the fighting on the ground has entered this grueling phase, the information war appears to be ramping up and there are growing concerns that the Russian government will stage various provocations to try to change the tenor of the conflict. At the same time, Russian forces now appear to be expanding their stand-off strikes to include targets that had previously been left relatively untouched in far western Ukraine.

Readers can first bring themselves up to speed on how the conflict Ukraine has evolved so far with our previous rolling coverage here and then dive into the latest news below.

The Latest

UPDATED: 4:55 PM EST—

The video below reportedly shows one of Ukraine's Turkish-made TB2 armed drones strike a Russian command vehicle. The Tweet also makes a reference to ""Ctrl+Z"" operations, a clear reference to the ""Z"" markings that many Russian forces have applied to their vehicles to differentiate themselves from Ukrainian forces. The ""Z"" has become a symbol of support for the invasion among some Russians and others.

Another video, seen below and shot using a drone, has emerged that reportedly shows Ukrainian forces ambushing a column of largely unsupported Russian tanks and other armored vehicles moving down a road outside of Kyiv.

A local team working for the BBC in Ukraine has shot some excellent on-the-ground footage in and around the eastern city of Kharkiv, which has been the site of heavy fighting for days now.

Satellite imagery all but confirms that a dam on the Irpin River near Kyiv was either destroyed or deliberately open, flooding a wide swath of terrain.

Another set of pictures showing German-made Panzerfaust 3 shoulder-fired anti-armor weapons, one of a number of types being supplied by Ukraine's international partners, in the hands of Ukrainian forces is seen below.

The Pentagon says that military aid continues to flow to Ukraine unhindered by the Russian government and that, with a few exceptions, a deconfliction line established to help reduce the chance of any incidents from those shipments arising has been working as intended.

There are reports that Russian President Putin has fired a number of generals over the state of the conflict in Ukraine and that he is also upset with the performance of the country's Federal Service Service, or FSB.

Anecdotal reports about the flagging morale of Russian forces in Ukraine continue to appear.

POSTED: 1:45 PM EST—

The Russian Ministry of Defense said today that it had employed unspecified ""high precision long-range weapons"" to strike two Ukrainian air bases and other nearby targets in the cities of Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk in the western part of the country. Both of these airfields, which the Russian military said it had put out of action, are relatively close to Ukraine's western borders with NATO members Poland and Slovakia. Russia has previously refrained from striking any targets in this part of Ukraine.

It's not entirely clear what weapons Russia employed in these strikes, but a Ukrainian official reportedly said that this operation at least included cruise missiles fired from Russian bombers. These bases would be well within the range of Russian Iskander-M ballistic missiles fired from neighboring Belarus, as well. A senior U.S. defense official said today that Russian forces have now fired almost 810 ballistic and cruise missiles at Ukrainian targets since the conflict began.

These strikes come amid indications that the Kremlin may be making a new push to neutralize the Ukrainian military's aerial combat capacity, which has continued to be a threat to their operations even after more than two weeks of fighting. The Ukrainian Air Force has been able to preserve much of its combat jet fleets, no doubt in part by operating from bases in the western end of the country, according to U.S. defense officials. Those aircraft have been an important factor, together with ground-based air defenses, in preventing Russian forces from gaining air superiority so far.

Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk have reportedly been important logistical hubs, too. Lutsk is notably home to Ukraine's only maintenance depot for servicing the RD-33 engines that power its MiG-29 Fulcrum fighter jets, which was one of the targets that was reportedly struck.

When it comes to the air war over Ukraine, earlier today, the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine issued a statement that said two Russian Su-25 Frogfoot ground attack aircraft had been observed entering Ukrainian airspace from Belarus to the north. Per that release, those aircraft struck targets in Ukraine before heading back into Belarus' airspace. They then conducted additional strikes in that country. Ukrainian authorities released a video as evidence of this allegation and a picture reportedly of smoke rising somewhere within Belarus following the strikes there is now also circulating online.

This allegation is now being widely circulated on social media, including from official Ukrainian government accounts and by members of the country's parliament, or Rada, often with the additional detail that the Russian aircraft initially launched from Dubrovitsa (Dubrovytsya) in Belarus and that they struck targets near the Belarusian village of Kopani (Kopany).

However, it has already been pointed out that there is no suitable military airfield near Dubrovitsa. At the time of writing, there does not appear to be any independent confirmation from the Belarusian side, either.

With regards to the airfield issue, the original statement from Ukraine's Border Guard Service only appears to say its personnel in the Ukrainian region of Dubrovytsya were the ones to call in the report about the Su-25s. It does not appear to mention Kopani at all. It's not entirely clear where those additional details might have come from originally.

The Ukrainian city of Dubrovytsya is notably just around 50 miles south of Luninets Air Base, which saw a large influx of Russian Su-25s prior to the launch of the invasion and where those aircraft have been flying since then.

All told, the allegations remain very much unconfirmed. At the same time, Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko did tell Russian President Vladimir Putin at a meeting in Moscow today that he had evidence Ukrainian forces were about to attack his country. A provocation like this could provide a pretext for the Belarusian military to become more directly involved in the conflict. This is something U.S. intelligence analysts had expected to happen quickly after the invasion started, but that has not yet materialized, reportedly in part due to resistance from within the Belarusian military.

The U.S. government has continued to separately warn that wholly unsubstantiated claims from the Kremlin about U.S. and Ukrainian work on chemical and biological weapons may be a possible attempt to create some kind of possible pretext for Russian forces to use those weapons or to lay the groundwork for a false flag operation. The Ukrainian government has made its own additional allegations that Russia may be planning to do something similar with regards to the now-defunct Chernobyl nuclear power plant.

A senior U.S. defense official has confirmed reports that a large Russian convoy north of Kyiv appears to have dispersed off the road. American authorities assess that this is to help protect against strikes and that these units remain stalled. Russian forces have appeared to make some gain along other axes toward the Ukrainian capital.

Pictures and videos highlighting Russian forces' use of unmanned aircraft are increasingly emerging from both sides of the conflict.

A new video reportedly showing Ukrainian forces shooting down a Russian Mi-24/35 Hind attack helicopter has appeared online, but it's not immediately clear if this footage shows a new loss or offers a different view of an older one. Ukraine's National Guard has also now indicated that a recently delivered Polish-made Piorun shoulder-launched surface-to-air missile system was among the weapons used to bring down a Russian Su-25 on March 6.

A third Russian general officer appears to have been killed in the fighting in Ukraine. Maj. Gen. Andrei Kolesnikov was the commander of Russia's 29th Combined Arms Army (CAA).

A video reportedly shows Russian forces having captured a Command Launch Unit (CLU) for the U.S.-made Javelin guided anti-tank missile, a weapon Ukrainian forces have been using to great effect in the conflict.

Legendary Syrian rebel Suheil Hammoud, more commonly known by the nom de guerre Abu Tow, who is credited with destroying hundreds of tanks in Syria, continues to say he is trying to get to Ukraine to take the fight to the Russians there. The Ukrainian government has actively welcomed foreigners into the country who wish to volunteer to fight, including a reported top Canadian military sniper known by the nickname ""Wali,"" as part of the country's Territorial Defense Forces.

The Kremlin is courting its own foreign volunteers to fight in Ukraine, including from Syria and the Central African Republic.

Someone has apparently spoofed or otherwise tricked online flight tracking software into showing an aircraft claiming to be the now-destroyed An-225 Mriya heavy-lift aircraft flying a perfect circle around Ukraine's capital Kyiv with the callsign ""FCKPUTIN.""

NATO troops in Poland are a scant 25 kilometers away.

The military base, not far from Lviv, is where NATO units train with Ukrainian troops and where western military instructors conduct training.

Russia’s military continued to pound cities across Ukraine with artillery and airstrikes.

Seven civilians, including a child, were killed Saturday in a designated humanitarian corridor when Russia struck the convoy, forcing the civilians to turn around, Ukraine’s Defense Ministry said.

Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said only nine of 14 humanitarian corridors were open Saturday. Vereshchuk said about 13,000 people were evacuated along the routes that had been agreed upon as safe passage exits for civilians.

Also Saturday, a Russian missile attack destroyed a Ukrainian air base in the city of Vasylkiv, according to Mayor Natalia Balasynovych who said an oil depot also was destroyed.

Russia’s Interfax News Agency quoted Balasynovych as saying Russian rockets also destroyed an ammunition depot near Vasylkiv.

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly address Saturday that Russia is trying to create new “pseudo-republics” in Ukraine to break his country apart. ""Ukraine will stand this test,” the president said. “We need time and strength to break the war machine that has come to our land.”

French and German leaders spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin Saturday, but France said in a statement they did not detect “a willingness on Putin’s part to end the war.”

Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry tweeted Saturday that Russian forces shelled a mosque in Mariupol where 80 people were sheltering. The ministry did not disclose the timing of the attack, but it said some of those in the mosque were from Turkey.

Ukraine’s military has reportedly said Russian forces have captured Mariupol’s eastern outskirts, and Ukrainian authorities have warned of a humanitarian catastrophe in the besieged southern port city.

Ukrainian officials in Mariupol said Friday more than 1,500 people have been killed since Russia began its assault on the city, a figure that has not been independently confirmed.

On Friday, a senior U.S. defense official said Russia had widened its war in Ukraine by targeting areas in the west of the country and appears to be regrouping troops near the capital, Kyiv, as the United States and its allies increase sanctions on Moscow.

The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss intelligence, confirmed Russia had begun targeting sites in western Ukraine, hitting airfields in Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk, part of a salvo of more than 800 missiles launched since the start of the invasion.

Ukrainian forces were continuing to mount ""an adaptive and nimble"" defense that was frustrating Russian forces, the U.S. defense official said.

The official also told reporters the U.S. is seeing signs that Russian forces, and the Russian air force in particular, are displaying a ""general risk aversion"" while also showing their inexperience.

""This is not a military that has great expeditionary capability and experience,"" the official said. ""Nothing on this scale.""

But the official also warned there are indications Russian forces are learning from their early missteps.

Russian forces are about 10 miles (16 km) outside Kyiv's city center, according to the most recent Pentagon assessment.

Russia’s slow, grinding apparent attempt to encircle the city and the bombardment of other population centers with artillery and air strikes mirror tactics that Russian forces have previously used in other campaigns, notably in Syria and Chechnya, to crush armed resistance.

Artillery pounded Kyiv’s northwestern outskirts. To the city’s southwest, two columns of smoke – one black and one white -- rose in the town of Vaslkyiv after a strike on an ammunition depot. The strike on the depot caused hundreds of small explosions from detonating ammunition.

As of Friday, the death toll in Mariupol passed 1,500 during 12 days of attack, the mayor’s office said. A strike on a maternity hospital in the city of 446,000 this week that killed three people sparked international outrage and war-crime allegations.

The ongoing bombardment forced crews to stop digging trenches for mass graves, so the “dead aren’t even being buried,” the mayor said.

Russian forces have hit at least two dozen hospitals and medical facilities since they invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, according to the World Health Organization. Ukrainian officials reported Saturday that heavy artillery damaged a cancer hospital and several residential buildings in Mykolaiv, a city 304 miles west of Mariupol.

The hospital’s head doctor, Maksim Beznosenko, said several hundred patients were in the facility during the attack but no one was killed.

The invading Russian forces have struggled far more than expected against determined Ukrainian fighters. But Russia’s stronger military threatens to grind down the defending forces, despite an ongoing flow of weapons and other assistance from the West for Ukraine’s westward-looking, democratically elected government.

The conflict has already sent 2.5 million people fleeing the country. Thousands of soldiers on both sides are believed to have been killed along with many Ukrainian civilians.

On the ground, the Kremlin’s forces appeared to be trying to regroup and regain momentum after encountering tough resistance and amassing heavy losses over the past two weeks. Britain’s Ministry of Defense said Russia is trying to reset and “re-posture” its troops, gearing up for operations against Kyiv.

“It’s ugly already, but it’s going to get worse,” said Nick Reynolds, a warfare analyst at Royal United Services Institute, a British think tank.

Russian forces were blockading Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, even as efforts have been made to create new humanitarian corridors around it and other urban centers so aid can get in and residents can get out.

Ukraine’s emergency services reported Saturday that the bodies of five people - two women, a man and two children - were pulled from an apartment building that was struck by shelling in Kharkiv,

The Russians’ also stepped up attacks on Mykolaiv, located 292 miles south of Kyiv, in an attempt to encircle the city.

As part of a multi-front attack on the capital, the Russians’ push from the northeast appeared to be advancing, a U.S. defense official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to give the U.S. assessment of the fight. Combat units were moved up from the rear as the forces advanced to within 19 miles of Kyiv.

New commercial satellite images appeared to capture artillery firing on residential areas that stood between the Russians and the capital. The images from Maxar Technologies showed muzzle flashes and smoke from big guns, as well as impact craters and burning homes in the town of Moschun, 20.5 miles from Kyiv, the company said.

Residents in a devastated village east of the capital climbed over toppled walls and flapping metal strips in the remnants of a pool hall, restaurant and theater freshly blown apart by Russian bombs.

With temperatures sinking below freezing, villagers quickly spread plastic wrap or nailed plywood over blown-out windows of their homes.

Russian President Vladimir Putin “created this mess, thinking he will be in charge here,” 62-year-old Ivan Merzyk said. He added: “We are not going away.”

On the economic and political front, the U.S. and its allies moved to further isolate and sanction the Kremlin. President Joe Biden announced that the U.S. will dramatically downgrade its trade status with Russia and ban imports of Russian seafood, alcohol and diamonds.

The move to revoke Russia’s “most favored nation” status was taken in coordination with the European Union and Group of Seven countries.

“The free world is coming together to confront Putin,” Biden said.

With the invasion in its 16th day, Putin said Friday that there had been “certain positive developments” in ongoing talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators. He gave no details.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appeared on video to encourage his people to keep fighting.

“It’s impossible to say how many days we will still need to free our land, but it is possible to say that we will do it,” he said from Kyiv.

Zelenskyy said authorities were working on establishing 12 humanitarian corridors and trying to ensure food, medicine and other urgently needed basics get to people across the country.

He also accused Russia of kidnapping the mayor of one city, Melitopol, calling the abduction “a new stage of terror.” The Biden administration had warned before the invasion of Russian plans to detain and kill targeted people in Ukraine. Zelenskyy himself is a likely top target.

American defense officials said Russian pilots are averaging 200 sorties a day, compared with five to 10 for Ukrainian forces, which are focusing more on surface-to-air missiles, rocket-propelled grenades and drones to take out Russian aircraft.

The U.S. also said Russia has launched nearly 810 missiles into Ukraine.

Until recently, Russia’s troops had made their biggest advances on cities in the east and south while struggling in the north and around Kyiv. They also have started targeting areas in western Ukraine, where large numbers of refugees have fled.

Russia said Friday it used high-precision long-range weapons to put military airfields in the western cities of Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk “out of action.” The attack on Lutsk killed four Ukrainian servicemen, the mayor said.

Russian airstrikes also targeted for the first time Dnipro, a major industrial hub in the east and Ukraine’s fourth-largest city, with about 1 million people. One person was killed, Ukrainian officials said.

LVIV, Ukraine--Russia's airplanes and artillery widened their assault on Ukraine on Friday, striking airfields in the west and a major industrial hub in the east, as Moscow's forces tried to regroup from recent losses and their onslaught fast reduced crowded cities to rubble.

American intelligence officials offered an assessment of the Russian air campaign, estimating that invading pilots are averaging 200 sorties a day, compared with five to 10 for Ukrainian forces, which are focusing more on surface-to-air missiles, rocket-propelled grenades and drones to take out Russian aircraft.

New commercial satellite images appeared to capture artillery firing on residential areas between Russian forces and the capital. The images from Maxar Technologies showed muzzle flashes and smoke from the big guns, as well as impact craters and burning homes in the town of Moschun, outside Kyiv, the company said.

In a devastated village east of the capital, villagers climbed over toppled walls and flapping metal strips in the remnants of a pool hall, restaurant and theater freshly blown apart by Russian bombs.

Russian President Vladimir Putin “created this mess, thinking he will be in charge here,” 62-year-old Ivan Merzyk said. In temperatures sinking below freezing, villagers quickly spread plastic wrap or nailed plywood over blown out windows of their homes.

“We are not going away from here,” Merzyk said.

On the economic and political front, the U.S. and its allies moved to further isolate and sanction the Kremlin. President Joe Biden announced that the U.S. will dramatically downgrade its trade status with Russia and also ban imports of Russian seafood, alcohol and diamonds.

The move to revoke Russia's “most favored nation” status was taken in coordination with the European Union and Group of Seven countries.

“The free world is coming together to confront Putin,” Biden said.

On the ground, the Kremlin’s forces appeared to be trying to regroup and regain momentum after encountering heavier losses and stiffer resistance than anticipated over the past two weeks. Britain's Ministry of Defense said Russia is trying to “re-set and re-posture” its troops, gearing up for operations against Kyiv.

“It’s ugly already, but it’s going to get worse,” said Nick Reynolds, a warfare analyst at Royal United Services Institute, a British think tank.

With the invasion in its 16th day, Putin said there had been “certain positive developments” in Russia-Ukraine talks, but gave no details.

For his part, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukrainian forces had “reached a strategic turning point,"" though he did not elaborate.

“It’s impossible to say how many days we will still need to free our land, but it is possible to say that we will do it,"" he said via video from Kyiv.

Zelenskyy said authorities were working on establishing 12 humanitarian corridors and trying to ensure food, medicine and other basics get to people across the country. Thousands of soldiers on both sides are believed to have been killed in the invasion, along with Ukrainian civilians.

He accused Russia of kidnapping the mayor of one city, Melitopol, calling the abduction “a new stage of terror.” The Biden administration had warned before the invasion of Russian plans to detain and kill targeted people in Ukraine. Zelenskyy himself is a likely top target.

So far, the Russians have made the biggest advances on cities in the east and south while struggling in the north and around Kyiv.

Russia said it used high-precision long-range weapons to put military airfields in Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk in the west “out of action.” The attack on Lutsk killed four Ukrainian servicemen, the mayor said.

Russian airstrikes also targeted for the first time Dnipro, a major industrial hub in the east and Ukraine’s fourth-largest city, with about 1 million people. One person was killed, Ukrainian officials said.

In images of the aftermath released by Ukraine’s emergency agency, firefighters doused a flaming building, and ash fell on bloodied rubble. Smoke billowed over shattered concrete where buildings once stood.

The bombardment continued in Mariupol, where a deadly strike on a maternity hospital this week sparked international outrage and war-crime allegations.

Unrelenting attacks have thwarted repeated attempts to send in food and medicine and evacuate civilians from Mariupol, a city of 430,000. In a statement, the Mariupol mayor's office said Friday that the toll of people killed during the now 12-day siege had risen to 1,582.

In the face of the unrelenting bombing, “the dead aren't even being buried,"" the mayor's office said.

Elsewhere, temperatures were forecast to hit -13 degrees Celsius (8 Fahrenheit) in the eastern city of Kharkiv, which has come under heavy bombardment.

About 400 apartment buildings in Kharkiv lost heat, and Mayor Ihor Terekhov appealed to remaining residents to descend into the subway or other underground shelters where blankets and hot food were being distributed.

The latest assaults came a day after satellite photos appeared to show that the huge armored column that was stalled for over a week outside Kyiv had spread out near the capital.

Military analysts were divided over whether the maneuvering by the Russian convoy signaled the imminent start of a siege of Kyiv or was just an effort to disperse some vehicles to more protected positions. The photos showed howitzers newly set up in firing position, and armored units staged near the Antonov Airport north of the city, according to Maxar.

The 40-mile (about 65-kilometer) line of tanks and other vehicles had massed outside Kyiv early last week. Its advance appeared to stop amid reports of food and fuel shortages, muddy roads and attacks by Ukrainian troops with anti-tank missiles.

Mathieu Boulegue, a researcher at the London think tank Chatham House, said the redeployment means the battle for Kyiv is just hours or days away. He predicted a drawn-out siege.

“This is going to be a very long battle of attrition. This is going to be an atrociously casualty-heavy battle and a siege, the likes of which we have rarely seen in modern history,” Boulegue said.

U.S. officials saw the breakup of the convoy headed toward Kyiv as less significant. A U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the American military assessment, said that the convoy had not made any substantial progress toward the city and that the vehicles’ moves were not part of a tactical effort to advance on Kyiv.

Americans point instead to other forces that are moving toward Kyiv from the northeast and are now about 20 to 30 kilometers (about 10 to 20 miles) east of the city center.

The U.S. also says Russia has launched nearly 810 missiles into Ukraine.

Meanwhile, the United Nations political chief said the international organization had received credible reports that Russian forces were using cluster bombs in populated areas. The bombs scatter smaller explosives over a wide area and are prohibited in cities and towns under international law.

Russians and Ukrainians have held multiple rounds of talks near the Belarus border, and the two countries' foreign ministers met again Thursday with no apparent progress. Various third countries have also made attempts to broker a stop to the fighting.

(WASHINGTON) -- The Pentagon has been providing daily updates on the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine's efforts to resist.

Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters on Friday:

Russia flying 20 times as many sorties as Ukraine

Russian military planes are flying an average of 200 sorties per day, compared to only about 10 per day flown by Ukraine, according to the official.

Much of the airspace above Ukraine is heavily guarded by both Ukrainian and Russian surface-to-air missiles, making air operations risky for both sides.

But Russian aircraft don't have to enter Ukrainian airspace to do damage.

""You can launch cruise missiles from aircraft from a great distance away. And if your target is relatively close, you don't need to enter the airspace,"" the official said.

For the first time, the official gave details on the total number of functioning Ukrainian fighter jets and how much they're being used.

""They have 56 available to them now, fully operational, and they're only flying them five to 10 hours a day,"" the official said.

Ukraine needs drones, not jets: Official

Noting Russia's vast umbrella of anti-aircraft capability over Ukraine and its larger air force, the official repeated some of the arguments we heard from the Pentagon earlier this week about the relative ineffectiveness of sending more aircraft to Ukraine.

""It makes little sense to us that additional fixed-wing aircraft is going to have somehow solve all these problems. What they need are surface-to-air missile systems, they need MANPADS, they need anti-armor, and they need small arms and ammunition, and they need these drones, because that's what they're using with great effect. And so, that's what we're focused on,"" the official said.

Ukrainian forces are making ""terrific"" use of drones, especially against Russian ground movements, according to the official. The drones can be also used both for reconnaissance and surveillance.

""They're trained on how to use them, they can fly below radar coverage by the Russians,"" the official said.

They are also much cheaper than fighter aircraft, and being unmanned, don't risk pilots being killed or captured.

Chemical weapons and false flags

The official said that despite claims from China and Russia, the U.S. is not helping Ukraine create or use any chemical or biological weapons.

""This is bio research with regard to two things: One, helping Ukraine over the years decrease the pathogen inventory that they had under Soviet years, and then to develop strategies to defeat pathogens going forward,"" the official said. ""It's scientific research, it's not bio-weapons capabilities.""

The official said the U.S. has nothing to hide, and that information on its role in scientific work in Ukraine was already publicly available.

""The only reason why we elevated the discussion is because the Russians and the Chinese decided to lie about it -- just flat out lie,"" the official said.

The official would not offer any U.S. intelligence assessment of the likelihood of Russian President Vladimir Putin deploying chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine.

""We know that the Russians have had -- and we assess that they still have -- a sophisticated chemical and biological weapons program. I'm not going to talk about intelligence assessments about what they may do with that program or what, if any, designs they might have on Ukraine in that regard,"" the official said.

The official said Russia's ""ridiculous narrative"" could possibly ""be building a pretext for some sort of false flag event.""

State of the invasion

The push to Kyiv: Russians have not moved any closer to Kyiv from the northwest since yesterday, still approximately 9 miles from city center. But the U.S. has seen rear elements move up closer to those advance troops. Russians advancing on the capital from northeast now 12-19 miles out.

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters Friday that the Russians coming from the east, while further from Kyiv, are gaining more ground than those to the northwest near the Hostomel Airport.

""We do assess that the Russians are beginning to make more momentum on the ground towards Kyiv, particularly from the east, not quite so much from the north,"" Kirby said.

Kharkiv: Russians are ""closing in,"" but the city is well defended and hasn't been taken yet.

Mariupol: The port city is under increasing pressure today. It is surrounded from northeast and southwest, under heavy bombardment, but Ukrainians are fighting back there.

Kherson: The city remains under Russian control: ""We continue to assess that they have Kherson,"" the official said.

Mykolayiv: Russian forces remain to the northeast of the city, though it is under increasing pressure. ""We've observed the Ukrainians are continuing to defend the city, and the Russians are just outside the city,"" the official said.

Lutsk and Ivano-Frankovsk: The Russians struck airfields in each city Friday.

""Obviously, they wanted to eliminate the Ukrainians' ability to use these airfields,"" the official said.

The official did not know how much the Ukrainians were using these two airfields or how extensive the damage was.

""What's unusual about it is that [the Russians] haven't been striking in western Ukraine,"" the official said of the strikes.

Russian missile strikes

The Russians have now launched nearly 810 missiles against Ukraine -- almost half have been fired from within Ukraine using mobile platforms. The rest have been fired from Russia, Belarus, and a small number from the Black Sea. This is up from an estimate of 775 missiles offered by the official Thursday.

Majority of combat power intact

Russia still has roughly 90% of its invading combat power still viable, with Ukraine falling just under 90%, the official said.
