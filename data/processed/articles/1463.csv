On Day 23 of the war, Russian troops did not make any significant gains on any front on Thursday. Ukrainian counterattacks, particularly in the Kyiv area, inflicted “heavy casualties” on the Kremlin’s forces, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW).

Incessant Ukrainian counterattacks are forcing Russia to divert a large number of troops to defend their own supply lines, said the United Kingdom’s Defence Ministry in its daily update. “This is severely limiting Russia’s offensive potential.”

“Reluctance to maneuver cross-country, lack of control of the air and limited bridging capabilities are preventing Russia from effectively resupplying their forward troops with even basic essentials such as food and fuel,” added the report.

Ukrainian forces continued to repel Russian efforts to encircle Kyiv and the southern city of Mykolaiv. But the cities of Kharkiv, Chernihov, Sumy and Mariupol are encircled and under constant shelling.

In the west, the mayor of Lviv said that several missiles had struck near the airport before dawn on Friday. A plume of smoke could be seen in the area, reported EL PAÍS correspondent Luis de Vega. Lviv, a city of 700,000 residents, is located near the border with Poland and until now it had been considered a safe place for Ukrainians fleeing other parts of the country.

In the south, some reserve forces of the Russian naval fleet that is stationed near the port city of Odessa were deployed to Mariupol in what appears to be an effort to support the ongoing assault there, said the ISW.

In the east, Russia said on Thursday that separatist forces in the Donbas region captured several towns after making limited territorial gains.

March 17 | The Russian invasion has stalled

The Russian invasion of Ukraine has “largely stalled on all fronts,” according to the United Kingdom Defense Ministry’s latest intelligence report. Moscow’s forces have made minimal progress on land, sea and air in recent days and continue to suffer heavy losses, said the report. “Ukrainian resistance remains staunch and well coordinated. The vast majority of Ukrainian territory, including all major cities, remains in Ukrainian hands.”

Russian troops failed to make any progress on any of their four fronts: the attempt to encircle the capital Kyiv, the assault on Kharkiv, the advance on Donetsk and the capture of Mariupol. There were also no significant gains in the push west from Kherson.

Russian troops conducted several unsuccessful attacks northwest of Kyiv on Wednesday, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). There were no major ground operations in Chernihiv, Sumy or Kharkov, three cities that the Russian army is attempting to encircle.

In the meantime, Russian forces continued to pound civilian targets. According to Ukrainian authorities, a theater in Mariupol that was being used as a shelter was struck on Wednesday, and at least 10 people died while lining up for bread in Chernihiv. Before dawn on Thursday emergency services also reported an attack against a residential building in Kyiv.

The United States estimates that 7,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in Ukraine in these past three weeks, according to information published by The New York Times. There could be an additional 14,000 to 21,000 injured out of a total of 150,000 troops, according to the Pentagon’s calculations. This casualty rate could make it difficult for combat units to carry out their tasks.

March 16 | Advances in the Kherson province

The Russian advance in Ukraine has been slowing for several days now when compared to the early stages of the offensive. The Russian troops have not carried out simultaneous attacks on the different fronts since March 4, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). The biggest Russian advances in the last day were in the south of the country, where Russian troops have been mounting a series of attacks from Kherson, toward Zaporizhzhia.

In the south, the Russian Defense Ministry stated on Tuesday that it had taken control of the Kherson province, although the ISW limited that advance to certain areas in the northeast of that area. This move could be aimed at surrounding Zaporizhzhia, something that seems unlikely, at least until this front can receive reinforcements from the Russian troops that are currently trying to force the surrender of Mariupol, in the east of the country.

Russian troops are encountering difficulties in replacing the losses that they are suffering, according to British intelligence services. This difficulty is impeding the invading troops from consolidating positions that they have secured as well as from carrying out multiple offensive operations, given the Ukrainian resistance.

In the east, the outskirts of Mariupol – which is located on the coast of the Sea of Azov – have suffered constant Russian air and artillery attacks, both in residential areas and on civil infrastructure. The ISW believes that the surrender of Mariupol will be the next turning point in the conflict, given that the Ukrainian defenders of the city are likely to be left without ammunition or drinking water in “the near future.”

The capture of this city, which has been under siege practically since the start of the offensive, would free up Russian troops that the army could send to the east of Zaporizhzhia and toward the area of the Ukrainian coast that Russia is yet to control: Odessa. This port city was bombed last night by a number of Russian ships, according to Anton Yuriiovych, an advisor at the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs.

On the outskirts of Kyiv, the Russian troops launched a number of attacks on different areas in the northwest of the capital, while on the eastern flank of the city, the combat units continued to receive reinforcements.

March 15 | Russian troops make no progress towards Kyiv

There were no significant changes to the situation on the ground. Russian forces launched several attacks northwest of the capital, Kyiv, and unsuccessfully attempted to bridge the Irpin river, according to the ISW.

The Russian army did not advance east of Kyiv and might be lacking sufficient troops to renew the offensive on that front for a few days. According to Rochan Consulting, an independent defense consulting firm, Russian soldiers were held back by Ukrainian forces in Brovary, northeast of the capital.

Airstrikes on Kyiv continued on Monday, when a projectile hit a residential building in the northern neighborhood of Obolon. There were more strikes on Tuesday and two residential buildings in the districts of Podilsk (northwest) and Osokorky (southeast) were reportedly hit, according to Ukrainian emergency services.

In southern Ukraine, Russian troops resumed their attacks from Kherson toward Mykolaiv but Ukrainian forces were able to contain them, according to the ISW.

In recent days, Ukrainian citizens have staged public protests in Kherson, Melitopol and Berdiansk against the Russian occupation. According to the UK Defense Ministry, Russia may be trying to organize a “referendum” in Kherson in a bid to legitimize the area as a “separatist republic” similar to Donetsk or Luhansk, in eastern Ukraine, which Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized as republics shortly before launching the invasion.

March 14 | Russia secures positions in the Donbas region

The Russian army conducted few ground offensives on Sunday save for the Donbas region, where it secured new positions in Donetsk and Luhansk, according to the latest report by the ISW. Operations were renewed on Monday, however, when Ukrainian emergency services reported that two people were killed in an airstrike against a residential building northwest of the capital, Kyiv.

In the east, Moscow’s forces launched several attacks in the area extending north of the besieged city of Mariupol. The Ukrainian army said the Russians have captured several towns but that their own forces were able to repel an offensive in Volnovaja, a town of 21,000 residents located between the Sea of Azov and the city of Donetsk, around 40 miles (65 km) from Mariupol. Volnovaja has been hard hit by airstrikes in recent days.

In the south, the British Defense Ministry said that Russia has established a distant blockade of Ukraine’s Black Sea coast, thereby isolating the country from international maritime trade. Russian naval forces are continuing to carry out missile strikes against targets in Ukraine, said the ministry in its latest intelligence update. “Russia has already conducted one amphibious landing in the Sea of Azov and could look to conduct further such operations in the coming weeks,” said the report.

In the west, there were Russian airstrikes against military facilities near the border with Poland.

March 13 | Airstrikes hit western Ukraine

Russian airstrikes hit targets around 15 miles (25 km) from the border with Poland, which is a member of the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Ukrainian authorities said Russia launched around 30 missiles against a military base in Yavoriv, near Lviv, a major city in western Ukraine. Following the Friday attacks on Ivano-Frankivsk and Lutsk, this represents the third Russian offensive in an area that up until this weekend had been deemed relatively safe for Ukrainians fleeing the country as well as for the delivery of Western resources to the local army.

Around Kyiv, Russian troops renewed their attacks with the goal of encircling the city. The New York Times reported on street-by-street battles in suburbs such as Irpin, west of the capital.

Even so, the Russian army did not appear to have gained new territory. Logistical problems, growing losses and Ukrainian counter-attacks have been slowing down Russian forces’ advance, according to the ISW. This would explain why they have not launched a major attack on Kyiv in recent days, although new troops appeared to be deploying on this front.

There was no progress towards Kyiv from other directions, either. Russian forces have for days been trying to capture Chernihiv (north). Near Sumy (northeast), Ukrainian forces said they had attacked and destroyed several Russian vehicles. In Kharkiv (east), the second largest city in the country, the front had barely moved while the fighting and the Russian airstrikes continued.

In the south, Ukrainian authorities said Russian troops have captured suburbs east of Mariupol, which has been under intense attack for days. It is here that Russian bombs destroyed a hospital’s maternity ward. According to the ISW, the Kremlin’s goal is not to march into the city with its troops, but to keep up the airstrikes and isolate the city in order to force its citizens to surrender. Ukraine said that a convoy carrying 90 tons of food and medicine is already on its way to Mariupol.

March 12 | The Russians are massing forces to encircle Kyiv

Russian troops have made no progress for a week. In the last 48 hours they tested the Ukrainian defenses west of Kyiv without success. They failed to take Kharkiv, made no progress on their path towards Mykolaiv or Zaporizhzhia, and same near Donetsk and Luhansk, according to the ISW.

In Kyiv, Putin’s troops continued to try to encircle the city, attacking on three flanks. The fighting continued in the northwest, with Russian soldiers around 15 miles from the city center, according to a British Defense Ministry intelligence report from Saturday. The vehicles in the enormous convoy that was detected 10 days ago appear to have dispersed, either to surround Kyiv or to be less vulnerable to Ukrainian attacks.

The Russians are also approaching Kyiv from the east, around Brovary. However, according to the ISW, their forces have not secured new territory and part of the contingent appears to have fallen back to defend against Ukrainian counterattacks in the Sumy region.

The cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Mariupol remain under siege and air bombardments. On Friday, Ukrainian authorities reported bombing in Mykolaiv.

In the south, Ukrainian forces halted Russian advances from Crimea, in the north and the west. Russian forces have been dealing with growing problems with supplies and troop morale, according to the ISW.

March 11 | “Limited” progress and new airstrikes

Russian troops have been making “limited” progress in Ukraine in recent days, according to British Defense Ministry intelligence reports. The invading ground forces have been dealing with logistical problems and with “strong Ukrainian resistance.” This pushback throughout the north of the country, from eastern Kyiv to the city of Sumy, continues to disrupt the Russian army’s efforts to move more troops towards Kyiv in order to encircle the city, according to the ISW.

On the 16th day of fighting, British intelligence reports said it was “highly unlikely that Russia has achieved the objectives outlined in its pre-invasion plan.” But Moscow is still expected to reorganize its forces for a renewed offensive, probably including attacks against the capital.

In eastern Ukraine, Russian troops bombed civilian areas in Dnipro, a city that had so far not come under attack, said Ukrainian emergency services. In the northwest, Russia claimed to have bombed and rendered inoperative the airbases of Ivano-Frankivsk and Lutsk. Local authorities in the latter municipality, which is near the Polish border, said they heard explosions during the night. Mikhaílo Podoliak, an advisor to the president of Ukraine, confirmed attacks on all three cities.

Meanwhile, Russian troops continued to put pressure on besieged cities like Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol. Ukrainian resistance in these enclaves is forcing Russia to devote more resources to them, slowing down their advance to other parts of the country, said the United Kingdom. The Russian Defense Ministry on Friday announced it will declare a ceasefire in the capital and in those four cities. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an overnight address that around 40,000 people had been evacuated on Thursday via humanitarian corridors.

March 10 | Russian troops test Kyiv’s defenses

Russian troops did not make significant progress. According to the British Defense Ministry intelligence reports, there was a notable drop in air operations thanks to an efficient Ukrainian defense.

In the north, Russian troops renewed their attempt to encircle Kyiv, and on Wednesday they tested the Ukrainian defenses at several points, as confirmed by the ISW and Rochan Consulting. According to Ukrainian information gathered on Tuesday, five Russian battalions launched an attack near Bucha, around 15 miles northwest of Kyiv. Four more battalions reportedly advanced on Yasnohorodka, 23 miles southwest of the capital’s center, in a bid to reach Kyiv from that direction as well. British intelligence on Thursday provided an update on a convoy of Russian vehicles first spotted northwest of Kyiv a few days ago, and which has made little progress over the past week; the convoy has reportedly suffered continuous losses.

Russian forces are besieging five cities, according to British intelligence reports: Chernihiv, Sumy, Konotop, Kharkiv and Mariupol. Hundreds of thousands of people are trapped in these locations without food, water, electricity or medicines.

After several unsuccessful attempts to establish a safe route to evacuate residents from Mariupol, Ukraine and Russia held another meeting on Thursday, but it ended without agreement. “Ukraine has proposed a humanitarian corridor to and from Mariupol and a ceasefire of at least one day to address the humanitarian problems of civilians. The Russian side did not agree. I am willing to continue negotiations,” said Ukraine‘s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba.

Satellite images published on Thursday by the private US company Maxar Technologies show the damage caused by Russia’s bombardment of key infrastructure in Mariupol, which has been in a critical situation for days.

March 9 | Few advances and new bombings

The Russian army continued to bomb Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Mariupol, some of Ukraine’s main cities, as it prepared for a siege of Kyiv.

The humanitarian crisis led both sides to agree to a 12-hour ceasefire starting early on Wednesday to provide some relief for the hundreds of thousands of people trapped in cities under attack. Ukrainian authorities said that they were only able to carry out evacuations in Sumy and Energodar.

In the south, Russian troops were apparently trying to reach Odessa, the main port on the Black Sea. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on social media that Russia has bombed a children’s hospital in Mariupol, a city where the situation is “apocalyptic” according to the Red Cross. The hospital has been destroyed, as seen in footage verified by this newspaper, and local authorities said that 17 people have been injured.

Near the capital, the most active front was in Irpin, in the western outskirts of Kyiv, where civilians have been hit by shelling in recent days. Russian troops did not make any gains, but they were reportedly concentrating their forces ahead of new operations. All analysts agree that Russia’s goal is to encircle Kyiv and force it to surrender.

In northeastern Ukraine, there was fighting in Chernihiv and in Sumy, two cities from which Russian troops are trying to create a communication line to Kyiv. In the east, British Defense Ministry intelligence reports talked about shelling in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second biggest city. From here, it is believed that Russian forces are seeking to connect with the troops currently deployed in the Donetsk and Donbas regions to create a large front in this part of the country.

March 8 | Supplies and reinforcements for the siege

Russian troop movement around Kyiv has several goals: surrounding the capital from several sides, accumulating supplies and reinforcements, and cutting off the city’s links to the outside world, according to the ISW. The Kremlin is reportedly massing tanks and men on two flanks: the northwest one, where it is trying to gain control of the cities of Irpin, 15 miles from the capital, and Bucha, three miles further north. On the eastern flank, the target is Brovary, a small town on the outskirts of Kyiv. In both cases, Russian soldiers are running into resistance from Ukrainians.

Shelling has also been reported in the last two days around 59 miles south of the capital, in the city of Bila Tserkva. This could be an attempt to reach Kyiv from a front where there was little activity in previous days, according to the Rochan Institute and The Guardian.

Irpin, a dormitory town of around 60,000 residents, has become a containment wall against Russia’s advance west of the capital. It was targeted for bombing at the beginning of the invasion and it has been the scene of fighting over the past week.

Russian soldiers may be using “siege-and-starve” tactics on the city, using a strategy that was already used in Syria, according to the ISW. The goal is to get the population to surrender by preventing water and food from coming in, said Ukrainian authorities.

Last Sunday, images of civilians killed by artillery fire as they were trying to flee Irpin created greater pressure for humanitarian corridors to evacuate people and bring in supplies. Attempts at establishing safe passages failed on Monday, but were established on Tuesday in Sumy and Irpin. Around 150 people had fled the latter city in the early morning hours, according to local authorities.

In the east, fighting continued in major cities such as Kharkiv and Sumy, where a bomb attack killed at least 10 people according to Ukrainian authorities. The city of Mariupol is reportedly surrounded by Russian troops.

In the south, a bloody battle took place on Monday for control over the city of Mykolaiv, according to The New York Times. This is a key port on the Black Sea and would help Moscow prepare its attack on Odessa. If it manages to take both cities, Russia will have almost total control over the country’s access to the sea.

The word “children” had been written in large white letters in Russian in front of the building and behind it.

KYIV, Ukraine — A day after a Russian strike reduced to rubble a theater in southern Ukraine where hundreds of people had been huddling for shelter, rescuers wading through the debris — even as Russian shells kept falling — began pulling out survivors one by one.

“Adults and children are emerging from there alive,” Ukraine’s human rights ombudsman, Lyudmila Denisova, reported early Thursday as the rescue effort continued at the Drama Theater in Mariupol, a southern port city under siege by Russian forces.

But information was scarce from the desperate city, which has been squarely in Moscow’s cross hairs since the invasion began three weeks ago. With as many as a thousand people, many of them children, reported to have taken shelter at the theater and still unaccounted for, fears remained that whatever hope emerged from the rescue scene Thursday would eventually be eclipsed by despair.

“Our hearts are broken by what Russia is doing to our people, to our Mariupol,” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said in an overnight public address.

The rescue efforts at the theater came against a fearsome backdrop of thousands of civilian casualties across much of Ukraine. Taking heavy losses on the battlefield, Russian forces have increasingly been aiming bombs and missiles at towns and cities. Unable to capture urban centers, they are leveling them instead, and the toll on civilians is worsening.

In Mariupol, it was people sheltering in a theater where the word “children” was written in huge letters on the pavement on both sides of the building, clearly visible from the air. In Chernihiv, it was people waiting in a bread line. In Kyiv, it was a 16-story apartment building pierced by a missile fragment, and, amid the debris and broken glass outside, a man with a sweatshirt pulled over his head kneeling silently beside a body under a bloody sheet, holding a lifeless hand for several minutes and then staggering away in grief.

As a fourth consecutive day of peace talks Thursday yielded no announcements, and the United Nations Security Council held an emergency session on the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, Western officials portrayed the Russian advance as bogged down.

While Russian forces have made a bit of progress in the south and east, said one of the officials, they are stalled outside Kyiv, the capital, where they have taken heavy casualties and — perhaps most surprising — have failed to achieve dominance in the air. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence assessments.

Given all the setbacks, the Western officials said they were no longer confident that Russia planned a ground assault on Kyiv, a major objective. “An ill-judged assault on a city as well-prepared and well-defended as Kyiv would be a very costly business,” one said. They cautioned that Russia could still decide to assault the city or, failing that, strangle it in a prolonged siege.

As cruise missiles hammered their capital, Ukrainian fighters described several successful, if modest, counteroffensives against Russian forces.

To the east of Kyiv, in the suburban town of Brovary, the thrust of the counterattack focused on artillery, according to Lt. Pavlo Proskochilo, the military commander in the town. He said Ukrainian artillery strikes had in some places forced the Russians to dig in, assuming more of a defensive than offensive posture.

“We hit them in the teeth,” he said. “They are now waiting for reinforcements.”

It was not clear whether Ukrainian forces had actually forced the Russians to pull back in any location, and in outlying towns, the regular booms and thuds of artillery fire were constant through the day.

But it was not just soldiers vowing to take the fight to the invaders.

Outside the apartment building in Kyiv damaged by the missile, Tetiana Vaskovska, a 58-year-old lawyer, angrily surveyed the wreckage of what had been her home of 25 years.

“I know how to shoot,” she said. “Give me a gun.”

In recent days, an increasingly brutal war of attrition has been unfolding on the ground and in the air, with fierce battles raging in the suburbs of Kyiv, and Russian warships on the Black Sea launching missiles at towns around the southern city of Odessa. Eyewitness accounts, official statements and satellite imagery paint a picture of destruction on a vast scale. More than three million people have fled the country.

On Thursday, President Biden heaped unrestrained scorn on President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who ordered the invasion. A day after labeling Mr. Putin a war criminal, Mr. Biden, speaking at the Capitol, called him a “murderous dictator, a pure thug who is waging an immoral war against the people of Ukraine.” On Friday, Mr. Biden will speak with the president of China, Xi Jinping, and plans to warn Beijing not to aid Moscow, his spokeswoman said.

Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken suggested that Mr. Putin “may be growing more desperate,” and warned that Moscow might be preparing to use chemical weapons and had begun to kidnap local officials in Ukraine and replace them with Mr. Putin’s allies.

The House of Representatives voted, 424 to 8, to suspend normal trade relations with Russia, another blow to a country whose economy is already staggering under Western economic penalties.

In recent days, Mr. Zelensky has been taking his case directly to Western lawmakers, urging them to help Ukraine fight Russia. To the British Parliament he recalled the Nazis’ campaign of terror. To Congress, he spoke of Pearl Harbor. On Thursday, it was Germany’s turn: Mr. Zelensky, addressing the Bundestag, offered multiple references to German atrocities inflicted on Ukraine and Russia, among others, in World War II, and analogies to the Berlin Wall.

“You are like behind the wall again,” he said. “Not the Berlin Wall but in the middle of Europe, between freedom and slavery.”

A British intelligence report said that Russian forces have “made minimal progress on land, sea or air in recent days,” and that they “continue to suffer heavy losses.” U.S. assessments have put Russian military deaths at 7,000, though the figure cannot be independently confirmed.

If Russia has miscalculated, the cost may not be limited to the battlefields of Ukraine. On Thursday, President Emmanuel Macron of France, who once famously accused NATO of “brain death,” said that the war had reinvigorated it, giving the military alliance “an electric shock, a wake-up call.”

But for all their struggles, Russian forces are reported to have taken control of large sections of Ukraine, particularly in the east and south. In eastern cities controlled by Russia, witnesses described desolation and ruin, as well as looting by Russian troops, where tens of thousands of people had once lived.

In the eastern city of Volnovakha, the Russian defense ministry declared it “liberated,” but after weeks of bombardment, Moscow’s prize was a landscape of rubble and ash.

About 200 miles north of Mariupol, the city of Izyum has been surrounded by Russian forces for two weeks.

“No water, no light, no heat, no food, no medicine, no communication. The situation is no better than Mariupol,” the deputy mayor, Volodymyr Matsokin, wrote on Facebook. “There is no one to bury the dead.”

Russia now pursuing 'strategy of attrition,' U.K. defense ministry says The British defense ministry believes the Kremlin has ""been surprised"" by the resistance of Ukrainian forces to its attack and invasion of the country, and is now pursuing a strategy likely to increase harm to civilians. The United Kingdom in an intelligence update Saturday said that Russia ""is now pursuing a strategy of attrition."" ""This is likely to involve the indiscriminate use of firepower resulting in increased civilian casualties, destruction of Ukrainian infrastructure, and intensify the humanitarian crisis,"" the U.K. defense ministry said. Cities in Ukraine have been bombarded since Russia invaded the country in what Western countries have condemned as an unprovoked and unjustified attack. The United Nations has recorded 2,149 civilian casualties in Ukraine since Russia attacked Feb. 24, including 816 killed — 59 of which were children.The U.N. human rights office says the actual number of civilian casualties is ""much higher."" Russia has denied targeting civilians. More than 3 million refugees have fled the country, according to the U.N. Share this -







Celebrated Ukrainian actor Oksana Shvets is killed in Kyiv Celebrated Ukrainian actor Oksana Shvets was killed in Kyiv when a residential building was hit by Russian shelling, her theater company announced Thursday. She was 67. The Molodyi Theater, where Shvets had been a troupe member for decades, said in a Facebook post that there was “unrepairable grief in the family of Molodyi Theater,"" according to an NBC News translation. “There is no forgiveness for the enemy that has come to our land,” the post said. Shvets, who studied at the Ivan Franko Drama Theater and the Institute of Theater Arts, appeared in dozens of roles at the Young Theater, including a recent production of the play “Enchanted.” She was awarded the Merited Artist of Ukraine, an honorary title for outstanding achievement in performing arts. Shvets was killed as Russian forces advanced on Ukraine’s capital and appeared to target civilians. Kyiv's city council said Friday that since the invasion began, Russian attacks have damaged 36 residential buildings, five homes and 11 schools, including four kindergartens, according to an NBC News translation. The officials said that 222 people, including four children, have been killed. NBC News has not been able to independently verify those claims. Russia has denied targeting civilians.

Russian cosmonauts arrive at International Space Station in flight suits in colors of Ukraine flag Three Russian cosmonauts have arrived at the International Space Station wearing flight suits in yellow and blue colors that match the Ukrainian flag. The men were the first new arrivals on the space station since the start of the Russian war in Ukraine last month. Video of one of the cosmonauts taken as the capsule prepared to dock with the space station showed him wearing a blue flight suit. It was unclear what, if any, message the yellow uniforms they changed into were intended to send. Oleg Artemyev was asked about the yellow flight suits when the newly arrived cosmonauts were able to talk to family back on Earth. He said every crew chooses its own flight suits, so that they are not all the same. “It became our turn to pick a color. But in fact, we had accumulated a lot of yellow material so we needed to use it. So that’s why we had to wear yellow,” he said. Artemyev, Denis Matveyev and Sergey Korsakov blasted off successfully from the Russia-leased Baikonur launch facility in Kazakhstan in their Soyuz MS-21 spacecraft at 8:55 p.m. Friday. They smoothly docked at the station just over three hours later, joining two Russians, four Americans and a German on the orbiting outpost. Share this -







Ukraine says it’ll take years to defuse mines KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine’s interior minister said Friday that it will take years to defuse unexploded ordnances after the Russian invasion. Denys Monastyrsky said that the country will need Western assistance to cope with the massive task once the war is over. “A huge number of shells and mines have been fired at Ukraine and a large part haven’t exploded, they remain under the rubble and pose a real threat,” Monastyrsky said. “It will take years, not months, to defuse them.” In addition to the unexploded Russian ordnances, the Ukrainian troops also have planted land mines at bridges, airports and other key infrastructure to prevent Russians from using them. “We won’t be able to remove the mines from all that territory, so I asked our international partners and colleagues from the European Union and the United States to prepare groups of experts to demine the areas of combat and facilities that came under shelling,” Monastyrsky said. He noted that another top challenge is dealing with fires caused by the relentless Russian barrages. He said there’s a desperate shortage of personnel and equipment to deal with the fires amid the constant shelling. Share this -







Macron, Scholz press for cease-fire in calls with Putin PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday asked Russian President Vladimir Putin to lift the siege of Mariupol, allow humanitarian access and order an immediate cease-fire, Macron’s office said. Macron spoke with the Russian leader on the phone for 70 minutes. Earlier in the day, Putin had a conversation with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who also pressed for an immediate cease-fire. Macron, who has spoken numerous times with Putin, revisited complaints over repeated attacks on civilians and Russia’s failure to respect human rights in Ukraine, the presidential Elysee Palace said. It said that Putin, in turn, laid the blame for the war on Ukraine. Macron, who is campaigning to renew his mandate in April elections, said during a town hall-style meeting shortly before the call that he talks to Putin because he believes there is a way toward peace, between the Ukrainian resistance, tough Western sanctions and diplomatic pressure. “We must do everything to find it,” he said.

Over 9,100 Ukrainians evacuated through humanitarian corridors More than 9,100 Ukrainians were evacuated from the war-torn country on Friday through humanitarian corridors, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said in a video posted to Telegram. At least 500 people were transported by bus, while others fled by car. Ten evacuation buses will be available Saturday from the port city of Berdyansk, Vereshchuk said. The evacuees, the majority from the northeastern region of Sumy, used seven of nine previously established humanitarian corridors. They were less effective in the Kharkiv region, Vereshchuk said, adding that Ukraine is working to establish new corridors in the regions of Kharkiv, Kherson and Luhansk. Share this -







Ukrainian engineers repairing power lines at nuclear plant Engineers repairing one of three damaged power lines linking Europe's largest nuclear power plant to Ukraine's electricity grid expect work to be completed by early next week, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency. Russian forces took control of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant on March 4, damaging two high-voltage external power lines. A third lost connection last week but is expected to be reconnected Tuesday. All safety systems at the plant remain fully functional, and there are no safety concerns, IAEA said. In Kharkiv, a nuclear research facility previously damaged by shelling continues to have no external power supply. Personnel remain at the facility, which is used for research, development and radioisotope production for medical and industrial applications. Overall, eight of Ukraine's 15 reactors are operational, the agency said, and radiation levels are in the normal range. Share this -

Xi tells Biden that China committed to international norms, ministry says Biden holds call with Chinese President Xi Jinping March 18, 2022 03:29 In a Friday morning video call, Chinese President Xi Jinping told President Joe Biden that China is committed to international norms regarding Ukraine, the Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement. It said the two leaders spoke about the situation in Ukraine, on which China has taken a neutral position. The U.S. has been concerned that China is considering supplying Russia with military equipment to bolster its invasion. ""China stands for peace and opposes war. This is embedded in China’s history and culture. China makes a conclusion independently based on the merits of each matter. China advocates upholding international law and universally recognized norms governing international relations. China adheres to the UN Charter and promotes the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security,"" the ministry said. Xi told Biden the U.S. and NATO should have a dialogue with Russia about what precipitated Russia's invasion into Ukraine, the ministry said, and Xi also expressed concerns about sanctions. ""Sweeping and indiscriminate sanctions would only make the people suffer,"" he said, in part, according to the ministry. If further escalated, they could trigger serious crises in global economy and trade, finance, energy, food, and industrial and supply chains, crippling the already languishing world economy and causing irrevocable losses.""

Ukrainian negotiator tells experts to 'take a break,' says, 'We have everything in order' Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian presidential adviser and negotiator in the peace talks with Russia, told experts on Friday to ""take a break"" from commenting on how to wage war against and negotiate with Russia, suggesting that doing so implies Ukraine's leaders are unclear about what actions to take. ""Please, stop the 'experts' blabbering about how to wage a war or negotiate properly while hiding in an unknown place,"" he tweeted. ""We know what we’re doing & we‘ll correct all their mistakes."" ""We have everything in order,"" Podolyak said in a video posted with the tweet. ""We are absolutely defending our freedom."" ""If we continue what we have been doing for many years, when we split our country, we can get a very insignificant result, and we only need a winning result,"" he added. Podolyak said the war has united Ukraine and shows the country's strength. ""Look, we all know, we understand very well what values are in Ukraine now, what a powerful country Ukraine is, and we will definitely not give up any interest, especially for our children who are sitting in basements under Russian fire and for our heroes who die in the battles,"" he said.

Some big name firms are balking at shunning Russia, despite Ukraine invasion While hundreds of well-known companies like McDonald's and Coca-Cola are shutting down or suspending their operations in Russia in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine, a Kansas-based oil, gas and manufacturing giant is sitting tight for now. Koch Industries, whose subsidiary Guardian Industries operates two glass-manufacturing plants in Russia that employ 600 people, said closing up shop now would put its workers there “at greater risk and do more harm than good.” “The horrific and abhorrent aggression against Ukraine is an affront to humanity,” Koch Industries President Dave Robertson said in a statement, adding that the company is “complying with all applicable sanctions, laws and regulations governing our relationships and transactions within all countries where we operate.” But Koch Industries, which has contributed millions of dollars to the Republican Party and has a couple of other operations in Moscow that employs a dozen more people, is hardly the only well-known firm bucking the tide of iconic companies exiting Russia, according to a list compiled by Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a senior professor at the Yale University School of Management. As of Friday, there were 26 other companies that Sonnenfeld has categorized as “digging in” and defying international calls to get out of Russia. Read the full story. Share this -

U.S. ambassador: Moscow's bioweapons allegations 'malarky,' like a 'chain email from some dark corner of the internet' The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, denounced Russia on Friday for what she called false allegations that Ukraine performs biological weapons research and has U.S. support for the effort. At a U.N. Security Council meeting, she said the Russian representative to the United Nations went on a ""tirade of bizarre conspiracy theories"" last week and this week ""we're hearing a whole lot more where that came from — things that sound like they were forwarded to him on a chain email from some dark corner of the internet."" ""President Biden has a word for this kind of talk: malarkey,"" she said. Thomas-Greenfield reiterated that despite Russia's claims, Ukraine does not have a biological weapons program. ""There are no Ukrainian biological weapons laboratories — not near Russia's border, not anywhere. There are only public health facilities, proudly — and I say proudly — supported and recognized by the U.S. government, the World Health Organization, and other governments and international institutions,"" she said. ""In fact, it is Russia that has long maintained a biological weapons program in violation of international law. It is Russia that has a well-documented history of using chemical weapons. It is Russia who is the aggressor here."" The ambassador said the U.S. has deep concerns that Russia's decision to call Friday's meeting over the allegations ""is a potential false flag effort in action."" ""Russia has repeatedly — repeatedly — accused other countries of the very violations it plans to perpetrate. We continue to believe it is possible that Russia may be planning to use chemical or biological agents against the Ukrainian people,"" she said. Share this -

Burger King partner in Russia refuses to close 800 locations Burger King is moving to divest its 15 percent stake in its Russian business, but the burger chain said it can’t legally suspend operations in the market right away. The Restaurant Brands International chain announced last week it was suspending all corporate support for its 800-plus franchised locations in Russia in response to the Kremlin’s ongoing attacks on Ukraine. The suspension includes refusing approvals for further investment or expansion and pausing operations, marketing and its supply chain. But the company’s International President David Shear laid out in an open letter to employees on Thursday that the structure of the company’s Russian business hampers its ability to shutter restaurants in the market like some of its competitors. “Would we like to suspend all Burger King operations immediately in Russia? Yes. Are we able to enforce a suspension of operations today? No,” Shear said. Burger King entered Russia through a joint venture with businessperson Alexander Kolobov, Investment Capital Ukraine and VTB Capital, which has been hit by U.S. sanctions as an affiliate of a major Russian bank.

Facing resistance in Ukraine, Putin turns to a familiar playbook: Bombing civilians It was a desperate plea from a city under siege: ""CHILDREN"" in huge bold letters. Satellite images from Maxar Technologies, a U.S. Defense contractor, this week showed the word clearly written in front of and behind a theater that Ukraine says was sheltering women and children in the port city of Mariupol. But on Wednesday, the building was blown up with hundreds of civilians inside, according to the Mariupol City Council. ""Russians could not have not known this was a civilian shelter,"" Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said. The number of casualties is not yet known — and the Kremlin denies targeting civilians — but experts say the incident is an indication that Russian President Vladimir Putin has turned to a familiar and pitiless playbook. With his troops bogged down in the mud, running out of food and fuel and hemorrhaging casualties, many analysts believe that Putin's battle plan is in the mire — and in desperation he has pivoted to the brutal tactics used in the Russian republic of Chechnya in 1999 and in Syria in 2015.

Ukrainians take a page from Tolkien in nickname for Russian troops Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko on Friday referred to Russian forces as ""orcs."" Ukrainian resistance fighters and protesters are using the term, too. The nickname appears to be a reference to the brutish monsters of the same name from J.R.R. Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" fantasy series. In the books (and their film adaptations), the Dark Lord Sauron dispatches the orcs to do his bidding on the battlefield. In the decades since Tolkien's novels were published, orcs have taken root in the popular consciousness — but the author's conception of the malevolent goblins has also drawn accusations of racism.

More than a thousand remain in Mariupol theater shelter, official says Some civilians have emerged from the rubble of the Mariupol theater, where hundreds were seeking safety in its bomb shelter when it was leveled by a Russian attack Wednesday. “I emphasized that 130 people have already been evacuated from the drama theater in Mariupol destroyed by the occupiers, but 1,300 people are still in the basements,” Ukraine’s human rights ombudswoman, Liudmyla Denisova, said in a televised address, according to a translation by NBC News. The shelter housed mostly women and children. Around 173,500 people have been evacuated via the humanitarian corridors since the beginning of the invasion, she added. Share this -







Russian shelling in Kyiv leaves 1 dead, 19 injured KYIV, Ukraine — Russian forces attacked the Ukrainian capital Friday, shelling residential buildings and a school in an assault that left one person dead and another 19 injured, including four children, according to the mayor. ""The enemy continues to attack the capital. In the morning, a residential area in the Podil district was shelled by orcs,"" Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko said in a post on Telegram, using a Ukrainian nickname for Russian troops.

3.1 million refugees fled Ukraine, 13 million more affected, U.N. says More than 3 million refugees have fled Ukraine with around 13 million affected in the hardest hit areas of the country, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said Friday. “The pace and magnitude of the internal displacement and refugee exodus from Ukraine, as well as resulting humanitarian needs, will only increase if the situation deteriorates,” UNHCR spokesperson Matthew Saltmarsh said in a press briefing in Geneva. The agency appealed to neighboring countries to keep their borders open for those fleeing the war. In the cities of Mariupol and Sumy, residents are facing “critical and potentially fatal shortages of food, water and medicines,” he said. “Targeted attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure and lack of safe passage” pose serious threats to the lives of thousands of civilians, he said.

Democrats link Ukraine’s democracy struggle to one closer to home WASHINGTON — Top Democrats are drawing parallels between the existential fight for democracy in Ukraine and the struggle to protect American democracy, citing the war to reaffirm their desire for new guardrails around institutions like free and fair elections. “I’m hoping that seeing the Ukrainians come under attack because they’re a democracy and defend their country so bravely because they believe in democracy increases faith in ours here at home,” Rep. Colin Allred, D-Texas, said in an interview. “I feel very strongly that we’ve had, really, an unprecedented period of questioning our own small-d democratic values and, culminating in January 6, an attempt to overthrow a presidential election here. “The best thing we can do for the world is to present an example of a functioning democracy at a time when, around the world, autocracies are on the rise and are literally attacking democracies like in Ukraine,” Allred said, suggesting that the death and destruction inflicted by Russian leader Vladimir Putin will give pause to Americans who may want to ""put our faith in a strongman.""

Biden and Xi to hold call as U.S. steps up pressure on China U.S. President Joe Biden will hold a phone call with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, on Friday as Washington raises concerns over China’s growing ties with Russia. The direct talks, which are the first between the two leaders since November, will be held at 9 a.m. ET. On Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Biden “will make clear that China will bear responsibility for any actions it takes to support Russia’s aggression, and we will not hesitate to impose costs.” Beijing has so far avoided direct condemnation of the Russian invasion and has criticized the wide-ranging sanctions imposed on Moscow by the West. Some U.S. lawmakers have raised the idea of sanctioning China as well if it is found to be supporting Russia’s war effort. “China opposes all forms of unilateral sanctions and ‘long-arm jurisdiction’ by the U.S.,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said at a news briefing on Wednesday. “We will resolutely defend the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies and individuals.” “If the U.S. insists on having its own way, China will definitely take strong countermeasures,” he added.

India reportedly bought 3 million barrels of oil from Russia India has reportedly bought 3 million barrels of crude oil from Russia, according to The Associated Press. Eighty-five percent of oil in India is imported, and the country is under strain to meet demand domestically. Russia reportedly offered India a discounted price of 20 percent below global benchmark prices, according to the AP. “India imports most of its oil requirements. We are exploring all possibilities in the global energy market. I don’t think Russia has been a major oil supplier to India,” External Affairs Minister Arindam Bagchi told AP about the sale. Countries including the United States have called on India to suspend trade relations with Moscow and to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Earlier this month, India abstained from a United Nations vote censuring Russia. “Think about where you want to stand when history books are written at this moment in time. Support for Russian leadership is support for an invasion which has a devastating impact,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said after earlier reports of India buying discounted oil.

Russian forces attacking Ukraine are likely turning to less precise heavy weapons that are less effective from a military standpoint and more likely to kill civilians, a European government said.

The U.K. Defence Ministry said late Wednesday local time that Russia has expended more of its ""stand-off air launched weapons"" than it had expected, because it has failed to achieve its objectives or to gain control of Ukrainian airspace.

""Stand-off"" weaponry refers to missiles that Russian aircraft can fire from a long distance without exposing themselves to Ukrainian anti-aircraft weapons. Ukraine's anti-aircraft capabilities are still active and taking down Russian helicopters and jets.

""As a result, it is likely Russia is resorting to the use of older, less precise weapons, which are less militarily effective and more likely to result in civilian casualties,"" the ministry said in an intelligence update.

In response to a request for comment, the Russian Ministry of Defense directed CNBC to a statement from more than two weeks ago which said in part that Russian forces carry out strikes only on military targets ""using high-precision weapons.""

However, overwhelming photographic and video evidence, as well as official assessments from the United States, United Kingdom and others, show that Russia is in fact striking civilian targets with unguided weapons.

Weapons like rockets, ""dumb"" unguided bombs, and long-range artillery are less accurate and therefore more likely to hit unintended targets.

According to the most recent confirmed UN figures, more than 700 Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the invasion began, but the actual number is likely to be much higher.

Death tolls from cities under artillery bombardment, such as Kharkiv and Mariupol, are unknown.

Eduard Lysovysk spent days in a crowded bomb shelter with his thigh bone smashed by Russian bullets, and the only treatment was a makeshift splint.

Two days after the construction worker was wounded and he lay immobile in a bomb shelter, he was visited by Russian soldiers wielding guns, who told him they had ""come to protect"" him, The Guardian reported.

Lysovysk was shot on March 4 by Russian soldiers as he attempted to get his wife and elderly neighbor out of their apartment building in Hostomel, a town neighboring a cargo air base that Russia tried to seize on the first day of the invasion.

Lysovysk's wife, Iryna, told The Guardian that it felt ""awful"" to have the soldiers at her husband's sickbed. But with her husband's mangled leg bound together with a makeshift splint and torn bedsheets, and with no painkillers available, she had to seek assistance begrudgingly.

She told the soldiers, ""We have been injured and need things like blankets and duvets."" She was briefly allowed to return to the couple's home, which she told The Guardian was occupied by 10 Russian officers. A Russian medic changed her husband's bandages, administered one antibiotic dose, and left, she said.

Lysovysk told the newspaper that the Russian soldiers insisted Ukrainian snipers injured him.

""I had seen the sniper eye to eye, 20 meters away from us. He was in the next apartment block over, the construction block,"" he told The Guardian.

The ferocity of the Russian assault has only intensified as the advances have slowed, with Russia substituting harsh bombardments of civilian populations for progress on the battlefield. Regular Ukrainians living in cities surrounded, or partially surrounded, by Russian troops are paying the price for a war effort that began to go wrong in the first hours.

But in the absence of substantive progress on the ground and given the scale of the losses being inflicted on its ranks, Russia’s military campaign could soon become unsustainable, with troops unable to advance because they lack sufficient manpower, supplies and munitions, analysts and officials say.

The next two weeks could be critical in determining the outcome of the entire war, they say. Unless Russia can swiftly improve its supply lines, bring reinforcements and bolster the flagging morale of the troops on the ground, its goals may become impossible to achieve.

“I don’t think Ukraine forces can push Russian forces out of Ukraine, but I also don’t think Russian forces can take that much more of Ukraine,” said Rob Lee, a former U.S. Marine who is now a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute.

An assessment Saturday by the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) went further. “Ukrainian forces have defeated the initial Russian campaign of this war,” it said. The conflict, it said, has now reached “a stalemate.”

Events on the battlefield could yet tilt in a different direction: for example, if the Russians succeed in capturing the besieged and desperate city of Mariupol, freeing up their forces to bolster their offensive elsewhere.

But in a widely shared March 14 article, a retired U.S. general and a European military academic argue that the Russian force is close to reaching what military strategists call the “culminating point” of its offensive, meaning that it will have reached the limits of its capacity to wage the war it set out to prosecute.

“The Russian war of conquest in Ukraine is now entering a critical phase; a race to reach the culminating point of Russia’s offensive capacity and Ukraine’s defensive capacity,” wrote retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges and Julian Lindley-French, who chairs the Alphen Group think tank in the Netherlands. They advocate a sustained effort by the United States and its allies to provide military supplies to Ukraine in hopes that Ukrainian forces can take advantage of this “window of opportunity” to win concessions at the negotiating table.

“I believe that Russia does not have the time, manpower or ammunition to sustain what they are doing now,” Hodges, who is now with the Washington-based Center for European Policy Analysis, said in an interview. The assessment assumes, he says, that the West continues to step up military support for Ukraine, thereby enabling Ukrainian forces to sustain the tempo of their resistance.

The Russian military still has overwhelming superiority in terms of numbers and equipment compared with the smaller and more lightly armed Ukrainian military. Russia could yet turn the fight around if it is able to replenish its manpower and supplies, cautioned Lindley-French.

“It would be a big mistake to think that Russia cannot sustain this war,” he said. “They can’t now, but they could fix it” by adjusting tactics and bringing in reinforcements.

However, he added, “Unless the Russians can really improve their game and start rotating [troop] formations into the front line, this particular force is facing a problem.”

U.S. officials decline to make public predictions about the course of the war but say there are clear indications that the Russians are struggling to sustain the existing forces they have and are scrambling to find reinforcements and resolve their logistical difficulties.

Appeals to China for military assistance, a so far fruitless attempt to recruit Syrians and talk of bringing in reinforcements from other parts of Russia and the breakaway territory of South Ossetia in Georgia have not yet produced evidence that fresh troops are on the way, the officials say.

“Just that they’re talking about resupply and re-sourcing tells you they are beginning to get concerned about longevity here,” said a senior U.S. Defense Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive subjects.

“It’s quite extraordinary, three weeks in, that they are still having these same logistical and sustainment issues, and that they are considering additional ways to overcome these shortages from outside Ukraine,” the official added.

The Russian troops that initially surged into Ukraine from at least four directions had expected to be welcomed as liberators and came unprepared for a long fight, officials and experts say. Instead, the Russians encountered fierce resistance, and now they are strung out along multiple fronts, bogged down in manpower-intensive sieges and without preplanned supply lines to sustain a protracted war, the officials and experts say.

The current map of the battlefield points to the scale of the difficulties, Lee said.

It was clear from the way Russian forces moved in the first hours of the war, he said, that their key objectives were to take Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv, link up the occupied Donbas region with the port city of Odessa along Ukraine’s southern coast, and — most crucially — capture the capital, Kyiv, with a lightning push from the north.

More than three weeks on, Russian troops still haven’t achieved any of those goals.

They have failed to fully encircle the northeastern city of Kharkiv, even though it lies just a few miles from the Russian border. Their push to take the port city of Odessa has been halted by fierce Ukrainian resistance at the gates of Mykolaiv. Their effort to link the Russian-annexed territory of Crimea has become ensnared by the grinding and increasingly bloody siege of Mariupol.

The Russians have been making gains in the east, in the oblasts of Luhansk and Donetsk, which Russia recognized as independent republics on the eve of the war and which have been partially occupied by Russian-backed forces since 2014. But those advances fall far short of the initial ambitious goal of the invasion.

The Russians’ hopes of encircling Kyiv, let alone capturing it, are starting to recede, Lee said. Russian forces remain stuck about 15 miles outside the city, and though U.S. officials say Russia is moving rear forces toward the front in anticipation of a renewed push on the capital, the front line hasn’t shifted.

Meanwhile, Russians are dying at a rate that is increasingly unsustainable, Lee said. Although Russia still has vast reserves of manpower, it has already committed the bulk of its combat-ready forces, and they are the ones that are almost certainly bearing the brunt of the casualties, he said.

There are no confirmed casualty figures, and Russia has not updated the figure of 498 dead that it announced a week into the war. But of the Russian army’s 168 battalion tactical groups, 120 are already fighting on the ground, making up about 100,000 soldiers out of the total 190,000 sent into Ukraine. That means Russia has already committed 75 percent of its combat-ready force, U.S. officials say.

Western intelligence estimates say it is likely that at least 7,000 Russians have been killed and as many as 20,000 injured, and assuming that the combat forces are bearing the brunt of the casualties, that could mean up to a third of the main combat force is now out of action, Lee said.

“That’s a huge loss, and you can’t readily replace that,” he said. Russia can bring in new conscripts or call up more reservists, but that will dilute the capabilities of the overall force, “and that is not in Russia’s interest,” he said.

Ukrainian forces have been taking casualties, too, though how many isn’t publicly known because they also have not released any numbers. The longer the war drags on, the more perilous their position will become, too, and the greater the chance that Russia will overcome its initial mistakes, said Jack Watling of the London-based Royal United Services Institute.

But, he noted, the Ukrainian forces appear to remain highly motivated, while there are clear signs that morale continues to diminish among the Russian troops, he said. Russian forces continue to surrender, abandon their vehicles and show few signs of initiative in the areas they do control, signs “that this is not a force that is well motivated,” he said.

As Russia’s offensive capabilities slow, the risk is high that civilian casualties will mount. A stalemate is likely to become “very violent and bloody,” the ISW assessment said, because Russian troops are more likely to rely on the bombardment of cities to apply pressure.

There are signs that Russia is running out of precision missiles, U.S. officials say, which means Russian forces will also increasingly resort to the use of “dumb bombs” indiscriminately dropped on civilian areas in an effort to cow them into submission.

Ukraine is unlikely to have the capacity to push Russia out of the territory it has taken so far, officials and analysts say. But the Russians’ current difficulties open up the possibility that the Ukrainians could at least fight them to a standstill, thereby exerting pressure on Russia to accept a negotiated solution.

The main question now has shifted from how long it would take the Russians to conquer Ukraine to “can Ukraine fight Russia to a stalemate?” said a Western official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “They’re doing pretty well at the moment.”

“The next two weeks are going to be pretty decisive,” Watling said. The war won’t be over in two weeks, he predicted, and all the signals from Moscow suggest the Russians are more likely to double down than climb down, making the war more deadly for Ukrainians even as it moves at a slower pace.

“The odds are stacked heavily in the Russians’ favor. This is their war to lose. The reason they are not achieving their objective is largely about their own incompetence, their lack of coordination,” he said.

“What this really comes down to is whether the Russians are going to get their act together.”

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

an official said, noting that Russian forces had been trying to encircle the Ukrainian capital for many days but had failed to make any real progress in either the north-west or the east.

“I think there is a question as to whether Moscow now intends to try to assault Kyiv or not, and I don’t know the answer to that,” the official added.

To do so, in my judgment, with or without bombardment, would be very costly.

It may even be possible for Ukraine to fight Russia to a standstill, the official added, and the growing possibility of a military stalemate could help bring a successful conclusion to the ongoing peace negotiations on both sides.

Britain and other western countries believe those discussions are becoming increasingly serious, but it remains unclear if Russia is “in a compromising mood” at the moment, after Vladimir Putin claimed on Wednesday night that it was possible “the pro-Nazi regime in Kyiv” could have “got its hands on weapons of mass destruction”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/mar/17/russia-ukraine-war-latest-kremlin-anger-after-biden-calls-putin-a-war-criminal-us-to-send-more-military-aid-live?page=with:block-62336c118f081efd3276e3a6

After the war broke out, Minnesota native James Hill remained in the besieged northeastern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, very near Russia's border, to look after his partner Irina, who was being treated at a local hospital for multiple sclerosis.

An adviser to Ukraine's interior minister identified Hill as one of the victims of a Russian attack on Thursday morning that targeted people lining up for food in Chernihiv. There were conflicting reports as to whether the civilians were hit by gun or artillery fire. The city is among the major population centers in eastern and southern Ukraine that have been decimated by Russian shelling for days as Vladimir Putin's ground forces remain bogged down by logistical problems and fierce Ukrainian resistance.

Hill's sister Katya, in Pennsylvania, told CBS Pittsburgh that her brother had been living in the capital city of Kyiv, but traveled to Chernihiv for his partner's MS treatment.

""When I was warning him about the dangers, he did not feel that the world would let this happen, because my parents raised us to see the good in peoples' hearts, and that's how he lived,"" Katya told CBS Pittsburgh.

Speaking overnight to CBS News, she said the last time she spoke with her brother, she could hear explosions in the background.

""He was going out on a daily basis searching for food. The hospital lost electricity. The hospital lost gas. There was no heat,"" she said. ""My brother was a peacemaker, and he was a giver, and he just felt everybody in the world should love each other.""

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed earlier Thursday that another American had died in Ukraine, though he provide no further detail. A State Department spokesperson confirmed the death had occurred on March 17 and offered ""our sincerest condolences to the family on their loss.""

Hill, who leaves behind two children, was the second U.S. citizen to die in Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion. Filmmaker Brent Renaud, 50, was killed when Russian troops opened fire on him and colleagues in the town of Irpin, just outside Kyiv, as they were traveling to film refugees on March 13. One of his associates was injured in the attack.

Veteran Fox News video journalist Pierre Zakrzewski and his local producer Oleksandra ""Sasha"" Kuvshynova were killed just two days later, on March 15, when their vehicle ""was struck by incoming fire"" near Kyiv. Zakrzewski was a European national based in London for Fox, while Kuvshynova was one of the many native Ukrainians who have joined foreign news crews to help report on the war in their country.

Katya Hill told CBS Pittsburgh that her brother had been sharing updates with her every day since Putin ordered his military to invade Ukraine on February 24. She hadn't spoken to him for a few days, however. She said the family learned of Hill's death from the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine.

""After he said that he had no way to charge his phone, then I knew it was a matter of, are we going to hear he's in Poland safe or are we going to get the news that we didn't want to hear?"" Katya Hill said.

""A good person gone too soon,"" U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said in a tweet, offering her ""deepest sympathies"" to Hill's family.

Jim Hill grew up in Minnesota. His friends knew Jim as a dreamer and a helper — a good person gone too soon. Putin’s senseless war is resulting in so much needless tragedy. My deepest sympathies go out to Jim’s family and loved ones.https://t.co/zeuOEjK2jC — Amy Klobuchar (@amyklobuchar) March 17, 2022

""Putin's senseless war is resulting in so much needless tragedy,"" the lawmaker added.

The United Nations has confirmed at least 816 civilian deaths in Ukraine since Russia launched its war, with most of the deaths blamed on shelling and airstrikes. That figure includes 59 children, and the U.N.'s human rights agency acknowledges the ""actual toll is much higher.""
