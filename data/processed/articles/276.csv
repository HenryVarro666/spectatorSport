Updating MPs on the Ukraine war in the Commons, he told MPs that the UK has delivered 3,615 anti-tank (NLAW) weapons and will soon be supplying a ""small consignment"" of Javelin anti-tank missiles.

He said the Russians are ""changing their tactics and so the Ukrainians need to too"", to help Ukraine forces tackle President Putin's air force.

Mr Wallace said that the UK is exploring the possibility of donating Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles to Ukraine.

Supplies of rations, medical equipment and other non-lethal military aid will also be increased, the defence secretary said.

Starstreak missiles travel at more than three times the speed of sound, according to the British Army, and can be shoulder-mounted or attached to a vehicle.

NLAWs are a portable, shoulder-mounted missile system weighing just 12.5kg. They have a range of up to 600 metres.

The British Army says the missile can destroy ""any main battle tank in just one shot by striking it from above"".

Also, the Javelin is a medium-range missile that can strike targets at up to 1.5 miles (2.5km) away.

It is heavier than an NLAW, at 24.3kg, and is a ""fire and forget"" system, allowing the user to lock on to a target, fire and then focus on a different target.

UK explores donation of Starstreak systems

It comes as the Russian invasion enters its 14th day.

Mr Wallace said: ""In response to a Ukrainian request, the government has taken the decision to explore the donation of Starstreak high-velocity manned portable anti-air missiles.

""We believe that this system will remain within the definition of defensive weapons but will allow the Ukrainian force to better defend their skies.

""We shall also be increasing the supplies of rations, medical equipment and other non-lethal military aid.""

Earlier today, Grant Shapps said the UK is ""not inadvertently doing something which escalates this war in a way that would be unacceptable to the entire world"" as he seemingly confirmed that a deal with Poland to supply fighter jets to Ukraine is off.

The transport secretary told Sky News that all NATO partners ""work together"" on the situation in Ukraine, adding: ""It is important that we are a defensive organisation which means we won't be getting directly involved in the war.""

Mr Shapps said the reported deal to loan fighter jets is ""not something which is going to develop"", but that the UK ""are providing huge amounts of support"".

PM resists calls to drop visa requirements

It comes as Boris Johnson has continued to resist calls from Kyiv and MPs across the House to drop visa requirements for Ukrainians fleeing the violence, insisting the security checks are necessary to ensure the UK's safety.

The prime minister said a thousand visas had been granted under the scheme allowing relatives of people in Britain to flee the war zone to join their families and he promised another programme allowing individuals to offer a home to Ukrainians would be set out in ""the next few days"".

The UK would also continue to supply NLAW short-range anti-tank weapons, Ben Wallace told the Commons, and has already given Ukraine 3,615 of the portable missile systems – nearly double the 2,000 figure previously disclosed.

Wallace said Ukraine had already received “900 man-portable anti-air missiles” – a reference to Stingers supplied by other Nato countries – but was desperately seeking more arms as Russian forces attempted to encircle Kyiv.

“The capability needs strengthening,” Wallace said. “So in response to Ukrainian requests, the government has taken a decision to explore the donation of Starstreak high-velocity man-portable anti-air missiles.”

Later, in response to questions from MPs as to how long the supply decision would take, Wallace said: “We are in principle going to do it.” He acknowledged Ukrainian soldiers would need to be trained in how to use the missiles. “How we are doing it [training] is sensitive,” he added.

Starstreak is the British army’s equivalent to the better known US-made Stinger ground-to-air missiles that have been supplied to Ukraine by the US, Germany and the Netherlands among others since the Russian invasion. They are laser-guided with a range of 7km (unlike Stingers, which rely on infrared) and are designed to be harder to jam.

Both Labour and the SNP urged Wallace to send the Starstreak and other missiles promptly. John Healey, Labour’s shadow defence secretary, called for the supply decision to be made “as quickly as possible”. A near identical plea followed from the SNP’s Stewart McDonald.

“This is only still week two,” Healey said. “Russia has such crushing firepower. Putin has such utter ruthlessness that we must expect more than one of his military objectives to be taken over the next few weeks.”

Wallace told MPs that “the estimated number of Ukrainian civilians killed or injured now stands at over 1,000” and that “the true figure is expected to be much higher”. British funding to Ukraine would increase to £220m, of which £120m would be humanitarian aid, the minister said.

People had been “without power and water for almost a week” in the south-eastern city of Mariupol, while unguided bombs had been dropped on Chernihiv, to the north-east of Kyiv, Wallace added. Russian forces were trying to encircle Kyiv, moving troops into the capital’s eastern Brovary suburb.

The minister was also pressed on if he would support Poland supplying its 28 MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, with the Conservative bankbencher John Baron asking whether such an agreement would not represent a dangerous escalation of western involvement against Russia. “A wider war would not serve the interests of any population,” the MP said.

In reply, Wallace said the decision was a matter for Poland, it was up to Warsaw to consider if it was a calibrated response to the crisis: “If the Polish government feels the security threat is so acute that it requires itself to do that, then I would fully understand their decision and stand by them.”

On Wednesday, an apparent deal to send the MiGs to Ukraine via the US collapsed when the Pentagon said: “We do not believe Poland’s proposal is a tenable one.” Poland had not wanted to send the jets directly for fear of provoking the Kremlin.

Discussions about a possible supply of the fighter jets continued, the US said, although Wallace said in an earlier answer to McDonald he was not directly involved in those talks.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/09/uk-plans-to-send-anti-aircraft-weapons-to-ukraine-says-ben-wallace

Ben Wallace has revealed the UK is looking at sending anti-air missiles to Ukraine, warning Putin that the West “will not back down”.

The defence secretary said they were “exploring” a donation of Starstreak high-velocity manned portable anti-air missiles to the country.

They are a close-range weapons system, used by the British Army, that can target helicopters and high-speed ground attack aircraft.

Starstreak can be fired from a launcher rested on the shoulder of an operator on the ground or mounted on an armoured vehicle.

The senior Tory said the Russians were “changing their tactics” so the Ukrainians needed to do so too.

He highlighted the “horrific devastation” inflicted on civilian areas by Russian artillery and air strikes, describing it as “indiscriminate and murderous”.

However, Wallace stressed that the UK government is “bound by the decision to supply defensive systems” to prevent an escalation of war.

The defence secretary also told MPs the latest UK military intelligence showed that Moscow had only been successful in one of its main military objectives since the invasion began 14 days ago.

While he described the situation in Ukraine as “grave”, he insisted the Kremlin had failed in its mission of targeting air defence, “preventing total air dominance”.

Mr Wallace said that in response to a request from the Ukrainian government, ministers have “taken the decision to explore the donation of Starstreak high-velocity manned portable anti-air missiles.

“We believe that this system will remain within the definition of defensive weapons but will allow the Ukrainian force to better defend their skies.

“We shall also be increasing the supplies of rations, medical equipment and other non-lethal military aid.”

According to arms manufacturer Thales, the Starkstreak high-velocity anti-air missiles were designed to “provide close air defence against conventional air threats such as fixed wing fighters and late unmasking helicopter targets”.

They are capable of being launched from “lightweight land, sea and air platforms”.

It comes after UK, along with its Western allies, continue to resist calls from the Ukrainian government to implement a no-fly zone, insisting it would risk Nato forces entering direct conflict with the Russian military.

On Tuesday, in a historic address to the House of Commons, the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky repeated the demand, pleading for Britain to “make sure that our Ukrainian skies are safe”.

However, the defence secretary reiterated on Wednesday that the UK government was “bound by the decision to supply defensive systems” and not escalate the war, and would continue to supply humanitarian and lethal aid.

Britain is sending more weapons to Ukraine to help in the defensive effort against Russia’s invasion, the Defence Secretary has told MPs.

Ben Wallace said Vladimir Putin’s forces are ‘changing their tactics and so the Ukrainians need to too’, with the UK exploring the possible donation of Starstreak portable anti-air missiles.

He also confirmed 3,615 anti-tank weapons, known as NLAWs, have been delivered, and will shortly be followed by a ‘small consignment’ of Javelin anti-tank missiles.

Speaking in the House of Commons, Mr Wallace highlighted the ‘horrific devastation’ inflicted on civilian areas by Russian artillery and air strikes, describing it as ‘indiscriminate and murderous’.

He told MPs: ‘It is vital that Ukraine maintains its ability to fly and to suppress Russian air attack.

‘To date the international community has donated over 900 manned portable air defence missiles and thousands of anti-tank guided weapons of varying type, as well as various small arms.

‘But the capability needs strengthening.

Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces said in a statement that it was bolstering defences in cities in the north, south and east.

Forces around Kyiv were resisting the Russian offensive with unspecified strikes and ‘holding the line’, it added.

Members of Ukraine’s Territorial Defence Forces have been getting to grips with the weaponry in preparation for a Russian assault on the capital while civilians fled.

Residents awoke there on Wednesday to the sound of back-to-back sirens urging them to get to a bomb shelter amid fears of an imminent missile attack.

Such alerts are intermittent, keeping people on edge. The city has been relatively quiet in recent days, though Russian artillery has pounded the outskirts.

Kyiv regional administration head Oleksiy Kuleba said the crisis for civilians was growing in the capital, with the situation particularly critical in the city’s suburbs.

He said: ‘Russia is artificially creating a humanitarian crisis in the Kyiv region, frustrating the evacuation of people and continuing shelling and bombing small communities.’

Earlier, Mr Wallace stressed the Government is ‘bound by the decision to supply defensive systems’ and not escalate the war.

He later told MPs a no-fly zone could hamper Ukrainian efforts to deal with Russian artillery and missiles.

Mr Wallace said: ‘At the moment the balance is I don’t think it suits actually the Ukrainian disposition given the amounts of heavy armour and missiles in the Russian stocks.

‘If you had a no-fly zone, the Russians have a massive advantage with shells and missiles and they would not stop in a no-fly zone, whereas the few things that the Ukrainians have to reach the Russians at depth are in the air and I think you’d actually hamper one.’

Labour former minister Hilary Benn asked about the donation of Polish jets to Ukraine and questioned if it would be considered a defensive system.

Mr Wallace said: ‘I think it depends on how you use aircraft. If you are close air support to Kyiv then it’s obviously defensive, if you’re seeking to enter another sovereign territory, like the Russian air force, then it’s not; I think that is important to recognise.

‘I think it’s a deeply bilateral decision for those countries but as a friend and ally of Poland we will stand by their decision.’

Mr Wallace told the House of Commons the Government is 'exploring' donating UK-made Starstreak high-velocity, man-portable weapons.

He said Ukraine's anti-air capability 'needs strengthening' because Russian forces are 'changing their tactics' to focus more on shelling and air strikes.

The Cabinet minister revealed Britain has now given Ukraine 3,615 light anti-tank weapons as well as other small arms and ammunition.

The Defence Secretary also said Russia has only achieved one of its major objectives since it began its invasion almost two weeks ago.

Britain has been supplying Ukraine with light anti-tank weapons known as NLAWs. The UK has now donated 3,615 of the weapons. A Ukrainian Territorial Defence Forces member is pictured today holding an NLAW in the outskirts of Kyiv

What are Starstreak missiles? The Starstreak high-velocity surface-to-air missile is designed to defend against conventional air threats like fixed wing fighter planes and helicopters. It is made in Belfast by the company Thales Air Defence. The missile has a range of more than 7km and carries a three dart payload. It uses a laser beam guidance system which the manufacturer says is 'immune to all known countermeasures'. The weapon can be launched from lightweight land, sea or air platforms and can be unleashed as soon as a target is detected - there is no wait for 'lock on'. It accelerates to a speed of more than Mach 3 - approximately 2,300mph - in a 'fraction of a second'. Once hitting full speed it releases its three 'hittiles' which are then guided to the target. It is a man-portable air-defence system - known by the MANPADS acronym. The missiles are similar to the US-made Stinger which is already being used by Ukrainian forces. Advertisement

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been leaning on the UK as well as other Western allies for military support.

He is said to have presented Boris Johnson with a 'shopping list' of arms requests, with Britain thought to be sending anti-tank missile shipments almost daily.

Ukraine has been pushing for the West to impose a no-fly zone but the UK and others have ruled out the move on the grounds it could spark a full-blown war between Russia and NATO.

Mr Wallace announced this afternoon that Britain is looking to bolster Ukraine's air defences.

'As the conflict intensifies, the Russians are changing their tactics and so the Ukrainians need to too,' he told the Commons.

'We can all see the horrific devastation inflicted on civilian areas by Russian artillery and air strikes - indiscriminate and murderous.

'It is vital therefore that Ukraine maintains its ability to fly and to suppress Russian air attack.

'To date the international community has donated over 900 man-portable air defence missiles and thousands of anti-tank guided weapons of varying types as well as various small arms.

'But the capability needs strengthening so in response to Ukrainian requests the Government has taken the decision to explore the donation of Starstreak high-velocity, man portable anti-air missiles.

'We believe that this system will remain within the definition of defensive weapons but will allow the Ukrainian force to better defend their skies.

Starstreak surface to air missiles can be used against fixed wing fighter aircraft and helicopters.

They are similar to US-made Stinger missiles which are already being used by Ukrainian forces.

Mr Wallace stressed the UK is only providing Ukraine with 'defensive systems'.

The Government pledged in January to send military aid to Ukraine, including weapons systems and items like body armour and ration packs.

'In response to further acts of aggression by Russia we have now increased that supply. I can update the House that as of today we have delivered 3,615 NLAWs and continue to deliver more.

'We will shortly be starting the delivery of small consignment anti-tank Javelin missiles as well.'

Mr Wallace also told MPs that it is the UK's assessment that Russia has failed to achieve the overwhelming majority of its invasion objectives.

'Of the initial Russian objectives, I can announce to the House that it is our assessment that they have been successful in achieving only one,' he said.

'While Russian forces are in control of Kherson, Melitopol and Berdyans'k in southern Ukraine, they currently encircle the cities of Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol but are not in control of them.

'In addition, their first day objectives of targeting Ukrainian air defence has failed, preventing total air dominance.'

Mr Wallace told the Commons that the estimated number of Ukrainian civilians killed or injured is now more than 1,000.

He said: 'The true figure is expected to be much higher and I'm afraid worse is likely to come.

'It's for that reason that the UK will increase its funding for Ukraine to £220 million, which includes £120 million of humanitarian aid.'

The Defence Secretary said that 'the Kremlin's threats cannot hurt us' as long as nations 'stand united' together.

'I know many of our constituents and our colleagues are fearful of what happens next,' he said.

'President Putin and the Kremlin continue to threaten countries who offer help to Ukraine. Their military campaign will, I'm afraid, get more brutal and more indiscriminate.

'But it is my firm belief that our strength to stand up to such bullying comes from our alliances.

'We should take strength from the peoples right across Europe who are standing shoulder to shoulder to protect our values, our freedom, our tolerance, our democracy and our free press. That is our shield.'

He said Ukraine is now facing its 'darkest hour' but Mr Putin 'should be and can be in no doubt that the international community is united against his actions'.

The shipments include anti-armor and anti-aircraft missiles which could be used against Russian tanks and helicopters .

The weapons are being used by Ukrainian fighters to push back Russian forces.

As fighting in Ukraine enters its third week, reports this week revealed heavily-laden military cargo jets are pouring into an airfield across the border, stacked with weapons and military equipment to help Ukraine's forces hold back the advance of Russian troops.

Throughout the buildup to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, NATO countries, including the US, insisted they would not send troops to the region amid concern that the presence of their personnel on the ground would lead to a dangerous escalation of the conflict.

That stance has continued since Moscow ordered its troops into Ukraine on the morning of February 24. Instead, NATO nations and other countries are supplying Ukraine's defence forces - vastly outgunned and outnumbered by Russia's military - with weapons and equipment that Kyiv hopes will be able to help staunch Russia's advance.

Around 17,000 anti-armor weapons have been sent to Ukraine in the last number of weeks and are being pressed into use against Russian tanks and other hardware. As of March 8, Ukrainian fighters had destroyed over 1,000 armored personnel carriers, 303 tanks, 120 artillery systems and 80 helicopters, The Kyiv Independent claimed.
