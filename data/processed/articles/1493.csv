0,f933fba6-1d01-4f46-affe-96ea8d79714d,[],,"BUCHA, Ukraine — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told the UN Security Council on Tuesday that the Russian military must be brought to justice immediately for war crimes, accusing the Kremlin’s troops of the worst atrocities since World War II.

Zelensky urged the council to “act immediately” on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of his country, calling for Russia to be expelled from the Security Council.

Zelensky called on the 15-member council, which aims to ensure international peace and security, to “remove Russia as an aggressor and a source of war, so it cannot block decisions about its own aggression, its own war.”

Russia is a permanent member of the council and has the right to veto any decision on it.

“The United Nations can be simply closed. Ladies and gentlemen, are you ready to close the UN? And the time of international law is gone? If your answer is no, then you need to act immediately,” he added.

The Ukrainian leader made his plea via video as grisly evidence continued to emerge of civilian massacres allegedly carried out by Russian forces on the outskirts of Kyiv before they pulled back from the capital.

The images, particularly from the town of Bucha, have stirred global revulsion and led to demands for tougher sanctions and war crime charges.

Making his first appearance before the UN’s highest body, Zelensky said Russian troops are no different from terrorists like the Islamic State group. He showed the council brief video footage of bloody corpses that ended with the words “Stop Russian Aggression.”

He stressed that Bucha was only one place and that there are more with similar horrors, and he called for a tribunal similar to the one that was set up at Nuremberg to try war criminals after World War II.

The grisly scenes of battered and burned bodies and evidence that some of the dead were bound and shot in the head have led Western nations to expel dozens more of Moscow’s diplomats and propose further sanctions, including a ban on coal imports from Russia.

The head of NATO, meanwhile, warned that Russia is regrouping its forces in order to deploy them to eastern and southern Ukraine for a “crucial phase of the war,” and said that more horrors may come to light as Russian troops continue to pull back in the north.

“When and if they withdraw their troops and Ukrainian troops take over, I’m afraid they will see more mass graves, more atrocities, and more examples of war crimes,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said.

Ukrainian officials said the bodies of at least 410 civilians have been found in towns around Kyiv that were recaptured from Russian forces and that a “torture chamber” was discovered in Bucha.

Zelensky told the Security Council there was “not a single crime” that Russian troops hadn’t committed in Bucha.

“The Russian military searched for and purposefully killed anyone who served our country. They shot and killed women outside their houses when they just tried to call someone who is alive. They killed entire families, adults, and children, and they tried to burn the bodies,” he said.

Police and other investigators walked the silent streets of Bucha on Tuesday, taking notes on bodies that residents showed them. Survivors who hid in their homes during the monthlong Russian occupation of the town, many of them above middle age, wandered past charred tanks and jagged window panes with plastic bags of food and other humanitarian aid. Red Cross workers checked in on intact homes.

Associated Press journalists in the town have counted dozens of corpses in civilian clothes. Many appeared to have been shot at close range, and some had their hands bound or their flesh burned. A mass grave in a churchyard held bodies wrapped in plastic.

The Kremlin has denounced the images as fake and suggested the scenes were staged by the Ukrainians. But high-resolution satellite imagery from Maxar Technologies showed that many of the bodies had been lying in the open for weeks, during the time that Russian forces were in the town.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the images from Bucha revealed “a deliberate campaign to kill, to torture, to rape, to commit atrocities.” He said the reports of atrocities were “more than credible,” and that the US and other countries will seek to hold the culprits accountable.

“Only non-humans are capable of this,” said Angelica Chernomor, a refugee from Kyiv who crossed into Poland with her two children, and who had seen the photos from Bucha. “Even if people live under a totalitarian regime, they must retain feelings, dignity, but they do not.”

Chernomor is among the more than 4 million Ukrainians who have fled the country in the wake of the February 24 invasion.

Russia has rejected similar accusations against its forces in the past by accusing its enemies of forging photos and videos and using so-called crisis actors.

As Western leaders condemned the killings in Bucha, Italy, Spain, and Denmark expelled dozens of Russian diplomats on Tuesday, following moves by Germany and France. Hundreds of Russian diplomats have been sent home since the start of the invasion, many accused of being spies.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the expulsions a “short-sighted” measure that would complicate communication and warned they would be met with “reciprocal steps.”

In another show of support for Ukraine, the European Union’s executive branch proposed a ban on coal imports from Russia, in what would be the first sanctions from the bloc targeting the country’s lucrative energy industry over the war. That coal imports amount to an estimated 4 billion euros ($4.4 billion) per year.

European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen denounced Moscow’s “heinous crimes” around Kyiv.

The 27-nation EU has been a steadfast backer of Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on February 24 and has already pushed through four rounds of sanctions — but Ukrainian officials have begged for more.

Just hours before the latest proposal was announced, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said that to prevent “new Buchas” the West must impose the “mother of all sanctions” — on Russian oil and gas.

“A few months of tightening your belts are worth thousands of saved lives,” he said.

But Western nations are divided over how far to go. Some are calling for a boycott of Russian oil and gas imports, while Germany and others fear that such a move could plunge the continent into a severe economic crisis.

Western weapons have enabled Ukraine to mount a stiffer than expected resistance to Russia’s overwhelming firepower. That resistance stopped Russian forces from overrunning the capital and other cities, and many troops have now withdrawn from areas around Kyiv.

But Western and Ukrainian officials say Russia is merely regrouping for another offensive.

“Moscow is not giving up its ambitions in Ukraine,” NATO’s Stoltenberg said. “We expect a further push in the eastern and southern Ukraine to try to take the entire Donbas and to create a land bridge” to the Crimea Peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014. Russia-backed separatists in the Donbas have been fighting Ukrainian troops for the last eight years.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/zelensky-tells-un-security-council-russia-has-committed-worst-atrocities-since-wwii/

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday offered macabre details of alleged Russian atrocities in his war-torn country and said the UN system was not fit for dealing with Moscow’s aggression.

Wearing khaki fatigues and sitting in front of a Ukrainian flag, Mr Zelenskyy recounted evidence of murder and torture of civilians by Russian forces in recently liberated parts of northern Ukraine and likely elsewhere in his war-torn country.

“They killed entire families, adults and children, and they try to burn the bodies,” Mr Zelenskyy said via a video-link, in his landmark first address to the UN Security Council.

“Civilians were crushed by tanks while sitting in their cars in the middle of the road. And just for their pleasure, they cut off limbs ... slashed their throats.""

He said women and been raped and murdered, sometimes in front of their children, and added gruesome details about victims' tongues being pulled out.

Mr Zelenskyy said the masterminds of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine should face a Nuremberg-style war crimes tribunal and called for a reboot to a global security system that has struggled to answer Moscow’s aggression.

The veto power enjoyed by Russia and the UN Security Council's other four permanent members — Britain, China, France and the US — left the body powerless when one of those five powers breaks international norms, said Mr Zelenskyy.

""Do you think that the time of international law is gone? If your answer is no, then you need to act immediately,"" he told the chamber.

""The UN system must be reformed immediately so that the veto is not the right to die.""

Mr Zelenskyy’s video address comes after discoveries of evidence that Russian forces killed unarmed civilians as they withdrew from around the capital, Kyiv, and from the nearby city of Bucha.

""The massacre in our city of Bucha is unfortunately only one of many examples of what the occupiers have been doing on our land for the past 41 days,” he told diplomats in New York.

""Russian troops are deliberately destroying Ukrainian cities to ashes with artillery and air strikes. They are deliberately blocking cities, creating mass starvation. They deliberately shoot columns of civilians on the road trying to escape from the hostilities.""

Moscow has denied attacking civilians in a military operation that it said is necessary to prevent the eastward expansion of the Nato military alliance.

Russia’s UN ambassador Vasily Nebenzya said the images from Bucha were a ""horrific provocation"", staged by Ukrainian forces. He also described armed Ukrainian nationalists committing abuses against civilians and accused western nations of using Ukraine as a ""pawn"" in a bid to isolate Moscow.

Mr Zelenskyy accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of genocide in Ukraine since the February 24 invasion and said that more of Moscow’s “atrocities” would come to light as it repositions its forces to the south-east.

Diplomats later watched a video of shocking images of what appeared to be executed civilians and half-torched corpses from various cities across Ukraine.

Mr Zelenskyy's first address to the UN chamber follows video appearances for the US Congress and parliaments around the world. Russian and Chinese diplomats were present in New York.

The president visited Bucha on Monday to see evidence of a mass grave and the bodies of people who were bound and shot. Flanked by soldiers, Mr Zelenskyy, wearing a flak jacket, appeared emotional.

Barbara Woodward, the UN ambassador for Britain, which holds the council’s rotating presidency for the month of April, said images from Bucha were “harrowing, appalling, probable evidence of war crimes and possibly a genocide”.

Still, no formal council action was expected on Tuesday, given Russia’s UN Security Council veto power.

UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres lamented the “horrifying images of civilians killed in Bucha” and the “personal testimony of rapes and sexual violence that are now emerging”.

He called for an independent investigation so those responsible face justice.

The UN’s top humanitarian Martin Griffiths met Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov and defence chiefs in Moscow on Monday and will soon head to Ukraine in a bid to broker “military freezes” to rescue civilians from bombed-out cities.

Russian officials promised to study his suggestions for humanitarian access, Mr Griffiths told diplomats, but added that he “came away from these meetings believing that we have a long road ahead of us”.

Washington's UN envoy Linda Thomas-Greenfield highlighted reports of Russian forces forcing tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilians from Mariupol and other besieged cities and relocating them to Russia.

She told the UN Security Council of “credible reports” that “children are being abducted – along with mayors, doctors, religious leaders, journalists, and all who dare defy Russia’s aggression” and taken to “so-called filtration camps” and packed off to Russia.

“Reports indicate that Russian Federal Security agents are confiscating passports and IDs, taking away cellphones, and separating families from one another,” she said.

“I do not need to spell out what these so-called filtration camps are reminiscent of,"" she said, in an apparent reference to Nazi concentration camps during World War Two.

""It is chilling. We cannot look away.”

Britain and the US are intensifying their pressure on Russia, pushing for its removal from the UN’s Geneva-based Human Rights Council. A vote on suspension of Russia in the 193-nation General Assembly could happen this week.

The General Assembly has twice voted to censure Russia for its aggression in Ukraine.

The roughly 140 votes against Russia in those two polls exceeded the two-thirds threshold needed for suspension, but it remains unclear whether UN members would back the more drastic step of ejecting Moscow from the human rights council.

Ms Thomas-Greenfield said Russia’s presence on the rights council “undermines the entire UN” and “is just plain wrong”. Governments should “come together to do what is right”, she added.",https://www.thenationalnews.com/world/us-news/2022/04/05/zelenskyy-to-detail-russian-atrocities-at-un-talks/

UK foreign secy, Ukraine FM demand action from UN over Russian 'war crimes'

This comes only hours after British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss called for the suspension of Russia from the United Nations Human Rights Council. The Foreign Secretary to the Boris Johnson administration mentioned the discovery of bodies and mass graves in Bucha, Ukraine and said that Russia must be penalised for the war crimes committed by their troops. Truss was speaking after a meeting with her Ukrainian and Polish counterparts in Warsaw on Monday when she along with Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba called for Russia’s ousting from the UN council.

Meanwhile, Kuleba also spoke with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres about events in Bucha in what appear to be deliberate killings in the town on the outskirts of the capital Kyiv. “No place for Russia on the UN Human Rights Council,” Kuleba said on Twitter. “Ukraine will use all available UN mechanisms to collect evidence and hold Russian war criminals to account.” Following reports, the UN along with the EU has informed that it was ready to send investigation teams to further look into the matter.

410 civilian bodies found in liberated regions: Ukraine

The Ukrainian Defence Ministry on Sunday, April 3, stated that they have found 410 bodies of slain Ukrainians in Bucha, Irpin and other significant towns and villages of the Kyiv region during the first two days. The Defence Ministry further added that the exact number of victims of Russian occupiers will be much higher. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on Sunday, April 3, revealed the tragedies caused by retreating Russian armed forces in Bucha city. In a tweet, the Ukrainian Foreign Minister said, ""Bucha massacre proves that Russian hatred towards Ukrainians is beyond anything Europe has seen since WWII."" However, Russia continues to refute what it calls the ""staged"" killings in Bucha and ""provocation"" to slander the Russian Armed Forces.

After Monday’s visit to the city of Bucha near Kiev, Zelenskiy told members gathered in New York that “there is not a single war crime that has not been committed there.” “The Russian military conscientiously searched for and killed everyone who served our state. Women were executed at the doors of their homes, entire families, adults and children, and they tried to burn their corpses, ”said the Ukrainian president.

“We remember the memory of civilians who were injured in the neck or in the eye after being tortured. That they were thrown into a well to die there in torment. (…) They were crushed by tanks on civilian vehicles in the middle of the road. To have fun,” he said. “Those who had their limbs cut off had their throats cut. Those who were raped and killed in front of their own children. Who had their tongues torn out just because they didn’t hear from them what they wanted to hear. How is this different from what the ISIS terrorists did? But we’re talking about a member of the Security Council.”

What happened in Bucha, he points out, is “just one of many examples” of what Russia has been doing in the country over the past 41 days. “The world is now seeing what the Russian army has done in Bucha, but has not yet seen what they have done in other cities. The geography may be different, but the cruelty is the same. Same crimes.

“Where is the security that the Security Council should guarantee? No. So where is the peace for which the United Nations was created? It is obvious that the key global institution, which should guarantee the enforcement of any aggressor to peace, simply cannot function effectively,” he said.

“The most heinous war crimes of all time since the end of World War II are being committed,” he said. “Russian troops are deliberately destroying Ukrainian cities with artillery and air strikes. They deliberately blockade the cities, creating mass starvation in them. They deliberately fire at the columns of civilians on the roads who are trying to escape from the combat zone.”

Russian leaders, Zelenskiy said, “feel like they were colonizers, just like in ancient times. (..) Russia wants to turn Ukrainians into silent slaves. The Russian military openly plunder the cities and towns they have captured. This is robbery to the highest degree. They steal everything from food to gold earrings, which they rip off with blood.”

The Ukrainian leader demanded that Russia be held accountable and brought before an international tribunal. “The Russian army and those who give orders must face a Nuremberg-like trial.”

Zelensky pointed to the impossibility for the UN to take any action against Russia, given its permanent seat on the Security Council and therefore its veto power and what he believes “allows them to go unpunished and allows them to destroy everything they can.” “Do you think that international law no longer makes sense? If your answer is no, then act immediately.”

The President of Ukraine called for a fair representation of all regions of the world and a transformation of the United Nations system “so that the right of veto does not become an imposition of the right to die.” “All participants must be equal before international law.”

“We need Security Council decisions. For peace in Ukraine,” Zelensky asked. “If they don’t know how to make that decision, they can do two things. Not to allow Russia, as an aggressor and source of war, to block decisions on its own aggression, its own war. And then do whatever the world can fix. Or show how you can actually reformat and work for the good of the world. Or, if your current format is unchanged and there is simply no way out, then the only way out is a complete dissolution.

Zelensky’s speech to the Security Council was made public by the United Kingdom’s (current Council President) representation at the UN in a tweet in which he said the meeting would serve to “ensure that the truth about Russian war crimes is heard.” The United States, for its part, has said it will seek Russia’s removal from the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC).

Zelenskiy, who has advocated continued peace talks, has said in recent days that Russian forces are likely to try to “cover up their crimes” and announced an investigation, saying he only had information on more than 300 people killed and tortured. in Bucha. Ukrainian authorities report that the bodies of at least 410 civilians have been found in towns around Kyiv and seized by Ukrainian forces.

International journalists visited the city of Bucha in recent days and counted dozens of lifeless bodies, dressed in civilian clothes and apparently unarmed, scattered through the streets, many of which were shot at point-blank range, and some with their hands tied, as well as bodies heaped into a mass grave . They also spoke to survivors and collected testimonies about the horrors experienced under Russian occupation.

The tough photos of Bucha are marked by discussions at the UN, where Russia unsuccessfully tried to call an emergency meeting of the Security Council on Monday to discuss what it called “the horrific provocations of Ukrainian radicals in Bucha”, which was opposed by Russian representative Vasyl Nebenzya. at the beginning of the meeting in New York on Tuesday. “I want to make it clear that we are not refusing to hold a meeting,” the British representative replied.

Without providing evidence to support their claims, the Russian authorities deny responsibility, assuring that “not a single local resident was harmed by violent actions” and claiming that the information is false and rigged to discredit Moscow, or that the death occurred after the attack on the withdrawal of Russian troops. The representative of Russia repeated these statements in the Security Council.

However, satellite imagery shows that many bodies lay in the open for several weeks while Russian troops were in Bucha, according to analysis by international media outlets such as the New York Times. The Kremlin also spread hoaxes that were exposed by international inspectors.

Following Bucha’s images, several European countries such as Spain announced the expulsion of Russian diplomats, and the European Commission submitted a proposal to 27 member states that includes energy sanctions against Russia for the first time.

UN Secretary-General António Guterres said the war resulted in “senseless” loss of life, massive destruction in urban centers and destruction of civilian infrastructure. “I will never forget the horrific pictures of civilians killed in Bucha,” said Guterres, who said he was “equally appalled by the personal testimony of rape and sexual violence” now emerging from the conflict.

5 Apr 2022 06.45 Germany has reported a rise in attacks against Russian and Ukrainian migrants since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the country’s interior minister, Nancy Faeser, said. Since the end of February, 308 anti-Russian offences have been recorded by police, including 15 acts of violence, Reuters cited her interview with the Neue Osnabrüecker Zeitung. Attacks against Ukrainians have also increased, Faeser said, with 109 offences recorded since the end of February, including 13 acts of violence like bodily harm. The majority of offences were property damage, insults and verbal threats. About 250,000 Russian-born migrants and 150,000 Ukrainian-born migrants lived in Germany before 24 February, when Russian troops invaded Ukraine. Since then, more than 300,000 Ukrainians have fled to Germany. Faeser told the newspaper: This conflict should not be allowed to creep into our society. We have to remind people that this is Putin’s criminal war. It is not the war of people with Russian roots who live here in Germany.

5 Apr 2022 05.25 The former British prime minister Gordon Brown has spoken out about the reports of atrocities in Ukraine as part of his support for the Justice for Ukraine campaign, saying: Now that crimes revealed at Bucha and Mariupol and elsewhere in Ukraine have shocked the world, we must set a clear path that brings Putin to justice. We are delighted to have received the support of 50 former Heads of State and Prime Ministers who have now signed up to support our petition. Nearly 1.5 million people have signed it, an extraordinary sign of resolution from people across the world. What started off as a European project has now won support from every continent. It reflects the widespread global revulsion at the war crimes committed against Ukraine by Russian forces. Brown went on to say: I welcome the fact that the British justice minister Dominic Raab has offered support for the international criminal court’s investigation into war crimes by Russia. At the request of Ukraine, our petition proposes that in addition to this the ICC also sets up a special tribunal to probe the crime of aggression by Putin and his associates. Doing so will show that the international community is prepared to do whatever it takes to hold him to account for his actions. The Justice for Ukraine campaign is calling for an international tribunal to try Putin and those accountable for the invasion of Ukraine for the crime of aggression.

5 Apr 2022 04.34 The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Tuesday said Ukraine’s efforts to push back Russian troops from Mariupol were facing difficulties.

In a televised interview with local media, Zelenskiy said the military situation in the southern port city was “very difficult.”

Reuters reports he also said Turkey had proposed a plan to help evacuate wounded people and dead bodies from the city, but cautioned that the initiative depended on the will of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Zelenskiy also said that the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, would have to choose between Moscow and the “other world”, and that the Hungarian leader feared Russian influence. At the weekend Orbán added Zelenskiy to his list of “overpowered” opponents in the wake of his fourth consecutive election victory in Hungary.

the Russians are quieter and more serene, the West is procrastinating to dominate the scene

The truth should be spoken.

Not going far enough. The entire #UN needs to be disbanded & reformed like the #LeagueOfNations was. The UN has lost the plot. Does not represent the average person, rather a multi-millionaire globalist elite hell-bent on driving everybody but their own group into poverty.

🩸 Ano.Nymouse:They must now wipe the ControlGroup

Good news: European countries keep buying Russian gas. Bad News: USA won't be able to sell its LNG.

Zelen is hero, their people keep fighting Russia and keep dying, the other countries keep supplying weapons to Ukraine people and Ukraine people keep dying.

I want to know if Putin is an emotional being? Let's here all the views......

Zelen lead their people to hell and now want lead the other countries to hell as well.

As we rally around Ukraine let’s not forget the people mostly affected by this war, the children, we have decide to pull resources into their safety, access to food and clean water with permanent relocation with mothers in mind Dm for more info ukrainereliefund.org

They are not a nato nation. Ukraine was a criminal empire. Zelensky was put into power as a puppet in coup of 2013. His job was to be a puppet for Biden crime family and WEF.

Humanitarian issues should not be politisized?? Fuck you China

UN have been so quiet about these things being done by criminals all over the World to us ordinary people then gave human rights to criminals while letting us all suffer as victims. That is why Brexit. God help USA & EU that cannot escape this sick radical feminist organization.

This is the video that was shown today at the @UN after @ZelenskyyUa ’s speech. CAUTION: Very graphic content. But we mustn’t look away. #StandUpForUkraine

Ukrainian soldiers were committing war crimes last week , wars a horrible thing. Look at the America who’s been dropping bombs on kids for years in Afghan and Iraq

Too many meetings and talks! Useless! Enough! Putin and world leaders need to meet NOW, ask what he wants and make him stop killing ppl! DIPLOMACY, not killings! World leaders all at fault, all kill ppl all over the world! Stop killing ppl, stop hunger!

That’s rich… @nytimes why keep pushing BS propaganda trying to paint a false image of “victim” of @ZelenskyyUa … too cowardly to report on👇🏽 pic.twitter.com/tChJQcd62f

who he said had〜 記事の内容は本当に酷い話だと思います。でもこの英語は…と考えるダメ親父です。

...& a weak Russian delegation toed the party line unable to look at the Ukraine member !! Just saying.

WTF? @POTUS @SenSchumer either use the $800B military budget when necessary or get rid of most of it and use it to help Americans! Otherwise sell planes to Ukraine! We sell to Saudi and other authoritarian regimes, why not to a democracy fighting 4 its life!!

As Zelensky addresses the UNSC, we must continue & increase military support for Ukraine, but must also have a bold strategy for getting truth to the Russian people to overcome Putin's gaslighting of them, a necessary step to properly dealing with Putin realcontextnews.com/how-best-to-pe…

If the world is serious about the prosecution of war crimes, perhaps all NATO member states, including US, should ratify the Rome Statute. icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/E…

I THINK WE SHOULD SUE 🇺🇳 UN FOR INCOMPETENCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ABSURD!!!!!!!

It's too late from Zelensky to address #UN security for peace and sustainable...To sustain in world against crul leaders #Rassia

If this horror does not move us to do what it takes to see Putin defeated,nothing will.

DO MORE FOR UKRAINE! We are standing on the sidelines watching an autocrat slaughter innocent people just because they want to be free and part of the EU. If Russia takes part of Ukraine, we're caught in a years long quagmire. Stop Putin now!

The UN omitted that Russia acused crimes against the people in the Dombas region since 2014, with +15,000 victims to date.

“Where is the security that the Security Council needs to guarantee?” Zelensky asked. “It’s not there.” “Show how we can reform and work for peace,” he implored the council. Otherwise, he said, “dissolve yourself altogether, if there is nothing you can do besides conversation.”
