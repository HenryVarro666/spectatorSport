For weeks, aviation spotters have been following the Air Force’s RQ-4 Global Hawk, RC-135 Rivet Joint, WC-135 Constant Phoenix and E-8C, an Army prototype called ARTEMIS, as well as other U.S. and NATO aircraft flying in Ukraine or in neighboring areas.

The aircraft flight paths are not classified and are readily viewable on commercial websites.

The specialized planes flying in or near Ukraine can provide real-time intelligence on land and sea movements and intercept Russian communications.

A remotely piloted Global Hawk with the call sign FORTE12 was the last aircraft tracked over Ukraine before the country shut down its airspace to civilian air traffic a few hours before dawn Thursday, according to the global flight tracking service Flightradar24.

It was spotted with another U.S. Global Hawk, call sign FORTE11, on Wednesday evening over eastern Ukraine. On Thursday morning, aviation watchers spotted FORTE12 flying southwest of Crimea over the Black Sea.

Based out of Naval Air Station Sigonella on the Italian island of Sicily, the two planes have been frequent visitors to Ukraine over the past month, according to Flightradar24 data.

The site observed that FORTE11 had arrived in Ukrainian airspace late Wednesday morning and noted that the last time it was in Ukraine, on Feb. 20, it stayed for 24 hours.

The Global Hawk can fly at high altitudes for more than 30 hours without refueling, according to the drone’s manufacturer, Northrop Grumman. Its cameras can gather nearly real-time, high-resolution imagery of large areas in all types of weather, day or night, the company says.

Air Force officials in Europe would not comment Wednesday on the specifics of surveillance aircraft flying in or near Ukraine, citing Defense Department policy.

The Air Force conducts “these types of flights with allies and partners routinely and only with prior approval from and full coordination with respective host nations,” said Tech. Sgt. Michael Battles, a spokesman for U.S. Air Forces in Europe–Air Forces Africa.

Surveillance and reconnaissance missions continued Thursday following Russia’s missile attacks on facilities in or near Ukraine’s major cities, including the capital of Kyiv.

The CivMilAir Twitter tracking site observed an American E-8C and RC-135 Rivet Joint plus ARTEMIS watching the western borders of Belarus and Ukraine late Thursday morning.

The E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System, or JSTARS, departed from Ramstein Air Base and was tracked over Poland and Romania.

The aircraft was conceived during the Cold War to locate and track moving ground targets in all weather conditions, manufacturer Northrop Grumman says.

Its 24-foot-long radar antenna can be tilted to either side of the aircraft, allowing it a 120-degree field of view covering about 19,000 square miles.

A British Rivet Joint plane was spotted with its U.S. Air Force counterpart Thursday morning over Eastern Europe. The aircraft’s sensors soak up electronic emissions from communications systems, radar and the like, according to Britain’s Royal Air Force.

ARTEMIS, which stands for Aerial Reconnaissance and Targeting Exploitation Multi-Mission Intelligence System, is the Army’s first manned intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance jet.

It is a Bombardier Challenger 650 “that’s been souped up with military-grade sensors for tracking ground troops” and is flown on the Army’s behalf by defense contractor Leidos, according to a Breaking Defense article published Tuesday.

Its electronics and ground-scanning radar can monitor tanks from hundreds of miles away, meaning it can see into Belarus, the heavily fortified Russian exclave of Kaliningrad and maybe even the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, Tom Spoehr, director of the Heritage Foundation’s center for national defense, said in the article.

Meanwhile, the Air Force’s WC-135 Constant Phoenix, nicknamed the “nuke sniffer,” spent time patrolling Eastern Europe this week. Its mission is to detect and collect radioactivity samples in the atmosphere. The radioactivity typically results from a nuclear explosion.

The aircraft, based at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska, made an emergency landing Tuesday at RAF Mildenhall, England, following a flight over the Baltic Sea.

Air Force officials said the crew followed all prescribed emergency and safety procedures and landed safely. No one on board was injured.",https://www.stripes.com/theaters/europe/2022-02-24/us-spy-planes-doing-double-duty-as-russia-raises-the-stakes-in-ukraine-5129043.html

According to an esteem by Flightradar24.com, around 60% of the civil airliners and only a small amount of business jets and military aircraft have an ADS-B transponder. This means that, although you will never spot a Stealth Helicopter nor Air Force One broadcasting its position, speed, altitude and route on the Web, you can still catch some extremely interesting planes. As the evasive US Air Force C-32Bs (a military version of the Boeing 757), operated by the Department of Homeland Security and US Foreign Emergency Support Team (FEST), used to deploy US teams and special forces in response to terrorist attacks.

I was wrong.

Although even the Flightradar24 FAQs confirmed that the Air Force One, the world’s most famous and important aircraft, should NOT be visible on their website, for a few seconds around 19.40UTC, the U.S. Air Force’s VC-25 (mil version of the B747), with registration 82-8000, transponder code 3614, advertised its position in the public domain while over Baltimore, descending through FL120 at 310 kts, heading towards Washington D.C. (for landing at Andrews AFB).

I don’t really know the reason for this quick appearance of the AF1 on FR24. A human error? A quick test? Hard to say. I’d expect the IFF Mode 5 with encrypted Mode-S and ADS-B to be paramount on the aircraft carrying the POTUS.

However, in the past I’ve witnessed some “doomsday planes” and other DoD flights shamelessly broadcasting on the Internet their position, altitude, track etc.

Let’s see what happens in the future. Maybe tracking Obama’s movements across the world will be possible. By means of a web browser….

Update Dec. 1, 2011: further investigation shows that the AF1 used genuine full ADS-B signal possibly triggered at the request of controllers for positioning purposes during descent to Andrews AFB.",https://theaviationist.com/2011/11/24/af1-adsb/

The RQ-4 Global Hawk is a high-altitude, long-endurance, remotely piloted aircraft with an integrated sensor suite that provides global all-weather, day or night intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capability. Global Hawk's mission is to provide a broad spectrum of ISR collection capability to support joint combatant forces in worldwide peacetime, contingency and wartime operations. The Global Hawk provides persistent near-real-time coverage using imagery intelligence (IMINT), signals intelligence (SIGINT) and moving target indicator (MTI) sensors.



Features

Global Hawk is currently fielded in three distinct blocks. Seven Block 10 aircraft were procured, but were retired from the Air Force inventory in 2011. Block 20s were initially fielded with IMINT-only capabilities, but three Block 20s have been converted to an EQ-4 communication relay configuration, carrying the Battlefield Airborne Communication Node (BACN) payload. Block 30 is a multi-intelligence platform that simultaneously carries electro-optical, infrared, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and high and low band SIGINT sensors. Block 30 Initial Operating Capability (IOC) was declared in August 2011. Eighteen Block 30s are currently fielded, supporting every geographic combatant command as well as combat missions in Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom/ New Dawn. Block 30s also supported Operation Odyssey Dawn in Libya and humanitarian relief efforts during Operation Tomodachi in Japan. Block 40 carries the Radar Technology Insertion Program (RTIP) active electronically scanned array radar which provides MTI and SAR data. Block 40 Early Operating Capability (EOC) was declared in Sep 2013 and eleven Block 40s are currently fielded, supporting operations in four combatant commands. IOC is projected in 2015.



Global Hawk is flown by a Launch and Recovery Element (LRE) and a Mission Control Element (MCE). The LRE is located at the aircraft base and functions to launch and recover the aircraft while en route to and from the target area. The MCE controls the Global Hawk for the bulk of the ISR mission. Like the LRE, the MCE is manned by one pilot, but adds a sensor operator to the crew. Command and control data links enable complete dynamic control of the aircraft. The pilot workstations in the MCE and LRE are the control and display interface (cockpit) providing aircraft health and status, sensors status and a means to alter the navigational track of the aircraft. From this station, the pilot also communicates with outside entities to coordinate the mission (air traffic control, airborne controllers, ground controllers, other ISR assets).



The sensor operator workstation provides capability to task the sensor, dynamically update the collection plan in real time, initiate sensor calibration and monitor sensor status. The sensor operator also assists the exploitation node with image quality control, target deck prioritization and scene tracking to ensure fluid operations.



The system offers a wide variety of employment options. The unmatched range and 30+ hour endurance allow tremendous flexibility in meeting mission requirements. In 2014, an RQ-4 Block 40 flew a 34.3 hour flight, setting the endurance record for longest unrefueled flight by a U.S. Air Force aircraft.

Background

Global Hawk began as an Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration in 1995. The system was determined to have military utility and provide warfighters with an evolutionary high-altitude, long-endurance ISR capability. The Global Hawk has been deployed operationally to support overseas contingency operations since November 2001.



In the RQ-4 name, the ""R"" is the Department of Defense designation for reconnaissance and ""Q"" means unmanned aircraft system. The ""4"" refers to the series of purpose-built remotely piloted aircraft systems. The ""E"" in EQ-4 delineates the communication configuration of the BACN equipped aircraft.



The Global Hawk is operated by the 12th Reconnaissance Squadron at Beale Air Force Base, California, and the 348th Reconnaissance Squadron at Grand Forks AFB, North Dakota, but aircraft are rotated to operational detachments worldwide. The 1st RS at Beale AFB provides formal training for all RQ-4 pilots and Block 30 sensor operators, while the 348 RS formal training unit (FTU) at Grand Forks AFB provides training for all Block 40 sensor operators.

FRANKFURT – While Ukraine’s airspace has been largely empty amid the crisis with Russia, a remotely piloted U.S. military vehicle called the RQ-4 Global Hawk has flown over the country in circles for hours at a time.

Over the past month, two of the spy planes have travelled on regular missions from the Mediterranean Sea to Ukraine, where they have navigated in repeated loops in the north and the east, according to Flightradar24.

The drones’ high-altitude, long-distance flights have coincided with a military build-up by Russia along the Ukrainian border and a flurry of diplomacy among leaders of the United States, Europe and Russia to avert war.

At times, the two planes – under the call signs Forte10, Forte11 and Forte12 – have been the only active aircraft publicly visible over eastern Ukraine. Aviation watchers have taken note, speculating that the United States is making its presence known in a show of force.

“With these types of flights, leaving the transponder on is a conscious decision,” said Ian Petchenik, communications director at Flightradar24.

The U.S. Air Force declined to comment on the details of the flights but said the United States routinely operates aircraft in support of intelligence objectives.

“These missions demonstrate our continued commitment to safety and security in the region,” a spokesperson said.

On Monday evening, Forte11 returned to the Mediterranean after a nearly 24-hour trip over Ukraine. Its transponder went off at a low altitude near the Sigonella Naval Air Station in Sicily. It was the 13th similar mission.

According to the Air Force’s website, the mission of such aircraft is to collect intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance “to support joint combatant forces in worldwide peacetime, contingency and wartime operations.”

Their manufacturer, Northrop Grumman, says the planes see “potential threats” and “gather near-real-time, high-resolution imagery of large areas of land in all types of weather – day or night.”

The flight path has stood out because international commercial aviation, out of an abundance of caution, has largely avoided Ukraine airspace, especially in the east along the Russian border.

On Feb. 15, Flightradar24 said Forte11 was its most tracked flight, and then later reported that it had been airborne for more than 21 hours.

The aircraft, with a wingspan of nearly 40 meters and length of 15 meters, can typically fly more than 30 hours.

In 2014, the craft travelled 34.3 hours without refuelling to set a record for the U.S. Air Force, according to its website.

Northrop Grumman has been providing the aircraft to the USAF for 20 years. In August, it won a five-year contract to maintain the craft for NATO.",https://www.euronews.com/2022/02/23/us-ukraine-crisis-drone

While Ukraine's airspace is closed to civilian flights, US remotely piloted military drones RQ-4 Global Hawk fly over the country for hours.

And in these operations, Sicily is at the forefront. As Il Messaggero said in recent days, the Global Hawk ""takes off every day from the Sigonella base, south of Catania, and after three hours it is ready to spy on the moves of the pro-Russian militias from the Ukrainian skies and, just beyond the borders with Russia and Belarus, some troops from Moscow ”.

The US Air Force aircraft has a wingspan of nearly 40 meters and a length of 14 meters. It is made by the American Northrop Grumman. It can also fly up to 20,000 meters above sea level for more than 30 hours. This autonomy allows him to cover a radius of up to 100,000 square km of territory in a single mission.

According to the Air Force website , the mission of these aircraft is intelligence gathering, surveillance and reconnaissance ""to support joint combat forces in peacetime, emergency and war operations around the world.""

All the details.

THE MISSIONS OF THE GLOBAL HAWKS IN UKRAINE

On Monday evening, the first RQ-4 Global Hawk named “Forte11” returned to the Mediterranean after a nearly 24-hour voyage over Ukraine. His transponder was triggered at low altitude near the Naval Air Station of Sigonella in Sicily. It was the thirteenth similar mission, Reuters reports .

Meanwhile, yesterday evening ""an RQ-4D Phoenix with an Italian registration number and managed by NATO took off from the Sigonella Air Base at about 22:00 UTC"", Giacomo Cavanna reports today on AresDifesa . “The RQ-4D is based on the Global Hawk Block 40 – explains Cavanna – in service with the US Air Force and has been suitably modified according to the needs of the Atlantic Alliance. It is one of the most advanced drones available capable of performing high altitude and long range (Hale) surveillance missions ”.

“Even going back in time, there has hardly ever been a triple deployment of RQ-4 drones in a specific aircraft on the planet, not even during the recent crises in the Middle East,” commented Cavanna.

THE INVOLVEMENT OF ITALY

""It is a very dramatic moment – General Marco Bertolini, former commander of the Operational Command of the Joint Forces Summit, told Adnkronos , commenting on the tensions between Russia and Ukraine on February 22 ( before the military operation in Moscow on February 24): ""Italy is involved from an energy point of view, because if they close the taps tonight we will cook with fire and not with gas"".

But ""we are also involved from an operational point of view – underlines the general – because the Global Hawks flying over Ukraine depart from Sigonella, Italy is a largely American military base "".

THE BASE OF SIGONELLA

In addition to the Global Hawks for high-altitude strategic surveillance, the Sigonella base – from where the US Navy Naval air station (Nas) operates – hosts P-3 Orion and P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft, unmanned aircraft type Hale (High Altitude Long Endurance), unmanned aircraft type ""Male"" (Medium Altitude Long Endurance) Armed Reaper, refueling aircraft and transport aircraft, plus a portion of Marines from the Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force-Crisis Response-Africa with MV-22 Osprey tiltrotors.

In 2019, NATO received the first of the 5 RQ-4D Global Hawk surveillance and strategic intelligence UAVs. The NATO AGS system, based in Singonella, includes a ground segment for control and analysis and an air segment consisting of 5 aircraft.

THE FEATURES OF SPY DRONES

The RQ-4 Global Hawk is a $ 222 million unarmed spy drone that weighs 10 tons at takeoff and uses a Rolls Royce turbojet engine. It can survey an area the size of South Korea or Iceland in one day, according to Task & Purpose.

According to manufacturer Northrop Grumman, the aircraft see ""potential threats"" and ""collect near real-time, high-resolution images of large swaths of the earth in all kinds of weather, day and night.""

""The power of the Global Hawk instruments is such that two of these penultimate generation drones are enough to keep the whole of Ukraine under control, over 600 thousand square kilometers, double the size of Italy"" underlines the Messenger .

MONITORABLE FROM INTERNET SITES

Finally, through the Flightradar24 and Italmilradar sites, it is possible to monitor the path of the drones that depart from Italy and arrive at the theaters of the crisis.

“At this point, the drone pilot from Sicily – explains Il Messaggero – turns on all the optical, infrared and radar instruments for reconnaissance. The joystick pulses travel up to the front bouncing off the satellites thanks to the over 40 large antennas of the Muos system of the radio base in Ulmo, in the municipality of Niscemi ”.

As La Stampa reminds us , Muos is the ""powerful system for the control of telecommunications of any kind that has four base stations scattered around the world and connected to each other, wanted, financed and managed by the Americans"".

Known as the Leidos Special Mission Aircraft (LSMA), the Challenger technology demonstrator is outfitted with the Aerial Reconnaissance and Targeting Exploitation Multi-Mission Intelligence System (ARTEMIS).

Since Russian President Vladimir Putin began deploying forces to regions surrounding Ukraine, NATO has stepped up its surveillance activities. The brunt of the effort has been borne by Boeing RC-135W Rivet Joint electronic intelligence-gatherers from both the U.S. Air Force and the UK’s Royal Air Force, flying from Mildenhall and Waddington in England, USAF Lockheed U-2s also flying from England, and by USAF Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk unmanned platforms operating from Sigonella, Sicily.

U.S. Army aerial surveillance assets involved include Beechcraft RC-12K Guardrail aircraft flying from Siauliai in Lithuania, and the ARTEMIS Challenger, which is operating from Constanta International Airport in Romania. The latter has been operating in Europe for some months, and has flown numerous missions during February.

The aircraft’s routing—as seen on civilian flight-tracking websites—has taken it north into Polish airspace, from where its sensors can peer into western Ukraine and Belarus. This route was flown on February 24, the first day of the major Russian attack on Ukraine. At the same time, an RQ-4 was flying an orbit over the Black Sea to the south of Odessa, having earlier set up a patrol pattern over eastern Ukraine close to the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, and an RC-135W was in an orbit over Poland. Also in the same area was a Northrop Grumman E-8 Joint STARS ground surveillance aircraft.

Leidos began the development of the LSMA in 2019 as a technology demonstrator for a potential candidate to replace the U.S. Army’s RC-12 Guardrail fleet, the move to a business jet platform offering significantly increased range, operating altitude, onboard power, and payload capacity. ARTEMIS is a plug-and-play mission suite that can be rapidly reconfigured to meet mission requirements. The aircraft is believed to be fitted with electronic intelligence (Elint) sensors and a side-looking radar that can track ground vehicles. The U.S. Army's description of the aircraft's role notes that it ""provides high-altitude sensing capabilities against near-peer adversaries and bridges gaps in the Multi-Domain Operations mission."" Demonstrations have been conducted in the U.S., Europe, and the Pacific since mid-2020, and in summer 2021 the aircraft was deployed again to Europe for an exercise and is believed to have remained in the theater since.

Recent years have seen a growing trend in transferring special mission suites and roles to business jets from larger jet platforms and smaller twin-prop aircraft, including the Saab GlobalEye airborne early warning aircraft and the E-11A Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN). In August last year, L3 Harris flew its Airborne Reconnaissance and Electronic Warfare System (ARES) demonstrator, based on the Bombardier Global 6500. ARES is intended to explore similar roles to the ARTEMIS, albeit in a larger airframe.",https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/defense/2022-02-24/artemis-challenger-joins-ukraine-surveillance-effort

Russian air and ground troops began their assault on dozens of strategic Ukrainian targets before dawn, along the way providing a window into the capability of Russia’s modern military forces, according to observers.

“Russian military has begun a brutal assault on the people of Ukraine, without provocation, without justification, without necessity,” Biden said Thursday afternoon. The invasion involved 175,000 Russian troops, the construction of a field hospital, and the prepositioning of blood supplies, he noted.

Russian forces advanced on Ukraine on three fronts, initially launching a barrage of about 100 intermediate-range, short-range, and cruise missiles from land, sea, and air platforms, according to a Department of Defense (DOD) report. The attacks included 75 fixed-wing, heavy and medium bombers, the DOD said.

In the beginning hours of the invasion, Russian airstrikes took aim at targets with strategic value, including Ukrainian airports and airfields, according to reports.

By mid-Thursday morning, Russia had targeted dozens of locations throughout the country, including Antonov International Airport (UKKM) northwest of capital city Kyiv, and Melitopol Air Base (UKDM) along the southern Ukrainian border with Crimea.

At Antonov International, a cargo airport owned by aircraft manufacturer Antonov, Ukrainian forces launched an artillery strike and shot down three of 34 Russian attack helicopters that were also accompanied by attack aircraft and fighter jets, according to a statement released by Ukraine’s Ministry of Internal Affairs. Following the attack, initial reports circulated that the Antonov AN-225 Mriya—the only operational copy of the world’s largest cargo airplane built during the Soviet era—was destroyed amid fighting. The claim, however, was reportedly refuted by an Antonov Airlines captain, who said on social media that while Russian Forces held the airport, the aircraft remained whole, Airlive Media reported.

“Peace in our continent has been shattered. We now have war in Europe, on a scale and of a type we thought belong to history,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Thursday following a North Atlantic Council meeting. “NATO’s core task is to protect and defend all allies. There must be no room for miscalculation or misunderstanding. An attack on one will be regarded as an attack on all. This is our collective security guarantee.”

Within hours of the invasion, NATO activated defense plans, putting more than 100 fighter jets at high alert in protection of NATO airspace, as well as 120 allied ships deployed from the High North Nordic territories to the Mediterranean, Stoltenberg said.

In recent weeks, U.S. military assets have been prepositioned in the region, and by Wednesday, Biden ordered the DOD to move U.S. forces in the European Command area of operations into the Baltic region and Poland.

All total, there are about 90,000 U.S. service members stationed in Europe, according to the DOD.

As part of the mobilization, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin III ordered the deployment of about 800 soldiers currently based in Italy into the Baltic region as well as the deployment of 20 AH-64 Apache attack helicopters from Germany. Another dozen Apaches are to be routed to Poland from Greece, the DOD said.

“These additional personnel are being repositioned to reassure our NATO allies, deter any potential aggression against NATO member states, and train with host-nation forces,” DOD officials said in a written statement.

The U.S. Air Force deployed six F-35 Lightning II fighter jets to the Baltic Sea and Black Sea region Thursday in support of NATO’s enhanced air policing mission, the service said Thursday. The aircraft are originally from Hill Air Force Base, Utah, and are assigned to the 34th Fighter Squadron operation out of Spangdahlem Air Base, Germany, the U.S. Air Force said.

“We are facing a dynamic environment, and the deployment of F-35s to NATO’s eastern flank enhances our defensive posture and amplifies the Alliance’s interoperability,” said General Jeff Harrigian, U.S. Air Force in Europe-Air Forces Africa commander.

In recent weeks, the Air Force has deployed the following in support of NATO’s policing mission:

Six F-35 Lightning II : 34th Fighter Squadron, 388th Fighter Wing, Hill Air Force Base, Utah, deployed to the Baltic Sea and Black Sea region

: 34th Fighter Squadron, 388th Fighter Wing, Hill Air Force Base, Utah, deployed to the Baltic Sea and Black Sea region Eight F-15E Strike Eagle : 336th Fighter Squadron, 4th Fighter Wing, Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, North Carolina, deployed to Poland

: 336th Fighter Squadron, 4th Fighter Wing, Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, North Carolina, deployed to Poland F-16 Fighting Falcons : 52nd Fighter Wing, Spangdahlem Air Base, Germany, deployed to Romania

: 52nd Fighter Wing, Spangdahlem Air Base, Germany, deployed to Romania Six KC-135 Stratotankers: 100th Aerial Refueling Wing, RAF Mildenhall, U.K., deployed to Ramstein Air Base, Germany

Not on the list, but as important, are NATO reconnaissance aviation assets, according to one military expert.

“For NATO, there’s been a major role for NATO reconnaissance aircraft,” said Mark Cancian, an international security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C.

Reconnaissance aircraft are flying missions along the border of Ukraine, and surveillance drones, such as Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk, are likely flying inside Ukraine, keeping an eye on the Russian build-up, he said.

“I’m sure now they’re watching Russian forces,” he said. “The intelligence on this build-up and the Russian attack has been excellent.”

The deployment of six F-35s, with two fighter jets sent to Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia, underscores that the strategic stance is symbolic, he said.

“That’s small,” Cancian said. “It’s not a warfighting capability.”

“The purpose from the beginning has been to reassure these countries that in a crisis, the United States and NATO would come to their aid really more with an eye towards the future conflicts than the current conflict.”

At the same time, Thursday’s invasion has provided NATO forces an insight into Russian military capability, specifically its use of heliborne forces, as well as missiles and aircraft used in strikes, Cancian said.

“I know people focus on NATO,” but those force roles are limited, he said. “But the Russians, they are in combat,” Cancian said. “We’ll learn something about their capabilities and modern air combat.”",https://www.flyingmag.com/u-s-forces-mobilize-as-russian-air-ground-assault-on-ukraine-rages-on/
