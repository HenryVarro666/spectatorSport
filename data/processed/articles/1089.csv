Choose your plan ArrowRight The big idea Blinken speaks as others deny there’s training going on now Secretary of State Antony Blinken has opened the door to giving Ukrainians fighting invading Russian soldiers “larger, more sophisticated” weapons than what America and its allies have provided to date, as well as training on how to use them, a potential deepening of the U.S. involvement in the war.

Blinken’s comments came Wednesday in response to a question from Deutsche Welle in a roundtable interview facilitated by the State Department’s Russian-language Telegram channel as he traveled in Belgium.

They also followed a series of seemingly contradictory or muddled statements from top U.S. officials over the past two weeks about whether America is currently training Ukrainians, even as it advertises giving them military hardware to kill Russian tanks and planes. U.S. forces trained Ukrainians in the years after Russia’s invasion in 2014, but officials have said those programs stopped in the run up to the Feb. 24 escalation.

“What we’re focused on is making sure that we get to Ukraine the systems that they can use now and use effectively,” Blinken said. “At the same time, we’re looking at other systems — some of them larger, more sophisticated — that may be useful and important going forward.”

But “Ukrainians need to be trained, because some of these systems you can’t just turn them over and have them be used immediately,” the secretary said. “Training is required; maintenance is required.”

The White House did not comment on the record when asked who would do the training, and where. The State Department referred The Daily 202 to the Defense Department, which declined to comment.

But earlier, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters at his daily briefing: “I know of no other American systems that are either being planned to go in or are already in that they require additional training on.” (He had not specifically been asked about Blinken’s remarks.)

Administration officials have told The Daily 202 that the West Wing worries about American troops training Ukrainians on NATO bases within range of Russian missiles, given the possibility (however remote) Moscow might decide the Ukrainians are legitimate targets.

Mixed Messages

Blinken’s comments punctuated a strange two-week stretch in which top U.S. officials, from President Biden on down, have left unclear whether there is an ongoing U.S. program to train Ukrainians.

On March 22, Biden national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters “we do not have U.S. troops currently training Ukrainians.”

On March 28, Biden explained a remark he made during a visit with troops from the 82nd Airborne in Poland by telling reporters “we were talking about helping train … the Ukrainian troops that are in Poland.”

(The same day, Politico reported: “A senior administration official said that U.S. troops help Ukrainian forces in Poland load weapons the West gives them to drive back to Ukraine. As they do so, they provide verbal instruction on how to use the weaponry, like anti-aircraft missiles, but don’t lead Ukrainian forces through physical drills.”)

On March 29, White House communications director Kate Bedingfield denied Biden had revealed a previously secret training program. But American forces in Poland have “regular interaction” with Ukrainian soldiers there, she said. She did not explain what that meant.

On March 30, Air Force General Tod Wolters, the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, was asked in a House Armed Services Committee hearing whether the United States was conducting any training of Ukrainians outside of Ukraine. “We are not,” he said.

On March 31, Gen. James McConville, the Army chief of staff, told reporters “the United States Army is not training Ukrainian soldiers or units right now.” “There are materials being provided to Ukrainians,” he said, “but that’s just a ship — it comes in and it moves out. We are not training Ukrainians right now.”

On Tuesday, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told the House Armed Services Committee that “to use some of the gear” NATO is providing Ukrainians “certainly they have to have training. And we’re doing that.”

On Wednesday, Kirby said the United States was providing “a little bit of training” on how to use explosives-packed “Switchblade” drones to “a very small number of Ukrainian soldiers who were already in the United States” before Russia’s invasion.

“It is not a very complex system. It doesn’t require a lot of training. An individual could be suitably trained on how to use the switchblade drone in about two days or so,” he said, adding that’s what Austin was referring to in the hearing.

Asked about the most recent training Americans had provided to Ukrainians, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters: “There’s not new training to report out to you.”

“Barring some extraordinary development — Schumer has attracted no serious left-wing challenger to his Senate re-election bid as Thursday’s primary filing deadline arrives, despite months of speculation about who might emerge,” the NYT's Katie Glueck, Blake Hounshell and Leah Askarinam report.

“[Schumer] is a highly visible presence from Brooklyn to Buffalo, building relationships with elected officials at every level of the ballot and across the Democratic ideological spectrum.

The project in question: “But Keystone was only the first Biden action that significantly undermined investments that would have increased both domestic supply and exports abroad. Right now, millions of gallons of natural gas could be streaming out of the central Pennsylvania town of Wyalusing, then shipped out of a new export facility in Gibbstown, NJ. Instead, environmental extremists emboldened by the administration’s heavy-handed regulation spent the last year and a half shutting down this critical project.”

The entire world has now witnessed the effectiveness of those weapons, as courageous Ukrainian forces have used them to repel the Russian attack on Kyiv, keep the skies of Ukraine contested, and deliver severe blows to the Russian military.

In addition to U.S.-produced weapons, we have also worked to facilitate the transfer of capabilities from our Allies and partners around the world. I want to thank the Slovakian government for providing an S-300 air defense system to Ukraine, something President Zelenskyy has personally raised with me in our conversations. To enable this transfer and ensure the continued security of Slovakia, the United States will reposition a U.S. Patriot missile system to Slovakia.

Now is no time for complacency. The Russian military may have failed in its objective of capturing Kyiv, but it continues to inflict horrific acts of brutality on the Ukrainian people.

3,1a15e99d-3a90-466a-a6a8-9ac70627cb50,['Bryant Harris'],2022-04-07 00:00:00,"WASHINGTON — The Senate on Wednesday unanimously passed a bill that alleviates bureaucratic hurdles associated with loaning U.S. military equipment to Ukraine.

The move came ahead of several other votes on Thursday levying additional penalties on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.

The Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act, introduced by Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, revives a World War II-era program that allowed the government to lend or lease military equipment to U.S. allies.

The bill would allow the Defense Department to lend or lease defense articles to Ukraine or any other eastern European country, such as Poland, impacted by the invasion.

“How we address a threat against one democracy’s sovereignty sends a message about how we’ll act on others, and adversaries like China are watching,” Cornyn said in a statement Thursday, following the Senate’s passage of the bill. “If we believe America supports freedom and democracy, we must provide Ukraine with the weapons necessary to protect its citizens.”

President Joe Biden can already use lend-lease authorities under the Arms Export Control Act, but the latest bill would waive several requirements mandated under that law.

Current law governing the lend-lease program also renders the recipient country financially liable for repaying the United States for costs incurred, such as if the items are damaged or destroyed.

Congress hopes waivers in the bill will allow Biden to more efficiently deliver military aid to Ukraine.

Cornyn’s bill would also waive a statutory time limit that caps the leases at five years, and require the president to establish expedited procedures for delivering loaned or leased military equipment to Ukraine within two months of it becoming law.

The Biden administration on Wednesday authorized another $100 million in Javelin anti-tank weapons for Ukraine from U.S. military stocks. This brings the total of U.S. military aid to Ukraine since the Russian invasion began Feb. 24 to $1.7 billion.

Congress appropriated $3.5 billion to backfill U.S. military equipment sent to Ukraine as part of the $1.5 trillion government funding bill that it passed last month.

Cornyn secured passage of the Ukraine lend-lease bill by holding up a vote on separate legislation to end normal U.S. trade relations with Russia.

The passage of Cornyn’s legislation on Wednesday paved the way for the upper chamber to subsequently pass that legislation, as well as a separate bill banning Russian oil imports into the United States, on Thursday.

Although the House passed the Russia trade relations and oil ban legislation shortly after the Senate, the lower chamber did not take action on the Ukraine lend-lease bill before adjourning for a two-week recess.

The list comes at a time when Ukrainian officials are pleading with the US to provide more military aid, according to The Wall Street Journal.

The memo, sent by the US Department of Defense and circulated by the White House on Thursday, claims the US has committed more than $1.7bn in security assistance and $2.4bn since Joe Biden took office.

""The administration is working around the clock to fulfill Ukraine’s priority security assistance requests, delivering weapons from U.S. stocks when they are available, and facilitating the delivery of weapons by allies and partners when their systems better suit Ukraine’s needs,"" the memo stated.

The memo provides specific counts of weapons that have already been sent to Ukraine. Those include at least 1,400 Stinger anti-aircraft systems, more than 5,000 Javelin anti-tank weapons, more than 7,000 small arms and more than 50 million rounds of ammunition.

The US has also reportedly sent 45,000 sets of body armour and helmets as well as laser guided rocket systems, night vision and thermal imaging devices, and numerous other items to aid in Ukraine's defence.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuelba plainly stated his country's need for arms during a meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation in Brussels on Thursday.

“My agenda is very simple, it only has three items on it,” he said. “It’s weapons, weapons and weapons.”

The call for more weapons comes at a time when evidence of war crimes committed by Russian troops continues to emerge. During the NATO meeting in Brussels, the Group of Seven condemned the ""atrocities committed by Russian armed forces"" in Bucha, a suburb of Kyiv.

They said the individuals responsible would be ""held accountable.""

Ukraine's western allies pledged to provide more arms in the wake of the attacks on civilians by Russian troops.

In addition to weapons, the US has also continued to ramp up sanctions against Russia and individual Russians, and has cut trade relations with the nation.

The Senate passed legislation on Thursdays suspending normal trade relations with Russia, and the US has placed sanctions on both of Russian President Vladimir Putin's daughters, claiming the leader is hiding his wealth with his family members.

A small number of Ukrainians who have been in the U.S. since the fall in professional military education programs have received rudimentary training on weapons systems that are new to the Ukrainian military, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said in a press briefing Wednesday.

The U.S. has taken advantage of having a small number of Ukrainians in the country and pulled them aside for a couple of days to receive training on how to operate switchblade drones. Kirby said training on the drones only takes a couple of days.

The small number of individuals are expected to go back to Ukraine relatively soon, as was initially planned and can train additional Ukrainian soldiers on the weapons.

The $800 million in assistance President Biden approved in March included 100 switchblade drones. Kirby on Wednesday said that all 100 of those drones have shipped to the region and are on their way to Ukraine, if they're not in Ukraine already.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley told the House Armed Services Committee on Tuesday that the new equipment heading over to Ukraine does require some additional training and some of that training is occurring in the U.S.

There are two versions of the switchblade, one goes after personnel and another after armored vehicles, like tanks. Austin told the House committee on Tuesday that Ukraine will receive both versions.

Overall, the U.S. has committed $1.7 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since the invasion started. The U.S. has two coordination cells that are assisting in making sure the weapons the Ukrainians need from the U.S. and other allies get into the hands of the Ukrainian military.

Since Mr. Biden has said no U.S. troops will be sent into Ukraine, the U.S. is coordinating the shipments to go into Ukraine mostly by land. Kirby said Wednesday that on average, it takes between four to six days after an announcement of assistance for the first shipment to arrive in Ukraine, which is unprecedented speed, according to Kirby.

President Biden said on Friday that the United States would place a Patriot missile defense system in Slovakia after that country provided a Russian-made S-300 air defense system to Ukraine.

Slovakian Prime Minister Eduard Heger said earlier in the day that his country had sent an S-300 mobile anti-aircraft system to Ukraine (which has an existing supply of such systems but lost a number of them in the course of the war). Slovakia previously said it would ship S-300 systems to Ukraine, provided its NATO allies would backfill them with other weapons.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement that the missile defense system will be manned by U.S. service members, with both battery and crew expected to arrive in Slovakia ""in coming days."" Their deployment length is not yet fixed, he added, as the U.S. continues to consult with the Slovakian government about more permanent air defense solutions.

""This deployment of Patriot capabilities to Slovakia aligns perfectly with our previous efforts to bolster NATO's defensive capabilities and to demonstrate our collective security requirements under Article 5 of the NATO treaty,"" he said. ""It complements the NATO multinational battlegroup in eastern Slovakia, which includes air defense elements from Germany and the Netherlands.""

And, he said, it's proof that Russian President Vladimir Putin's actions have actually brought about the very strengthening of the alliance that he sought to prevent.

Biden thanked the Slovakian government for its actions and said the U.S. will give it a U.S. Patriot missile system ""to enable this transfer and ensure the continued security of Slovakia.""

He added that while the Russian military may have failed to capture Kyiv, it continues to ""inflict horrific acts of brutality"" on the Ukrainian people.

President Joe Biden said on Friday that there's ""no time for complacency"" as the US announced that it is working with NATO-ally Slovakia to provide Ukraine with an advanced air defense system, answering one of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's personal requests.

""As the Russian military repositions for the next phase of this war, I have directed my Administration to continue to spare no effort to identify and provide to the Ukrainian military the advanced weapons capabilities it needs to defend its country,"" Biden said in a statement released by the White House.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin praised Slovakia's ""generosity"" in sending Ukraine an S-300 air defense system. He said it was a ""strong testament"" to the commitment Ukraine's neighbors are demonstrating as Russia continues its war. Biden said the US will provide Slovakia with an American-made Patriot missile system in return for the transfer.

""This deployment of Patriot capabilities to Slovakia aligns perfectly with our previous efforts to bolster NATO's defensive capabilities and to demonstrate our collective security requirements under Article 5 of the NATO treaty,"" Austin said in a statement.

Austin also said the Patriot system will be manned by American troops who will arrive ""in the coming days."" Austin said that their deployment did not have an end date as the US and Slovakia explore ""more permanent air defense solutions.""

Biden said that Zelenskyy had raised the S-300 system with him directly during their conversations. The S-300 is a Soviet-era system that can reach altitudes of up to 18 miles, The Washington Post previously reported.

""Now is no time for complacency,"" Biden said. ""The Russian military may have failed in its objective of capturing Kyiv, but it continues to inflict horrific acts of brutality on the Ukrainian people.""

In an emotional speech to Congress last month, Zelenskyy called for the US to support a no-fly zone in Ukraine. He added that if this was ""too much to ask for,"" then Ukraine needed better anti-aircraft systems like the S-300. ""Russia has turned the Ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people,"" Zelenskyy said at the time. The US and NATO have opposed a no-fly zone because it would require the alliance to shoot down Russian warplanes. This would effectively amount to a declaration of war, and spark a direct confrontation between a number of nuclear powers.

Since launching an unprovoked war against Ukraine in late February, Russia has struggled to make major gains on the ground. The Russian military, which has lost thousands of soldiers since the war began, failed to take Kyiv. Russia is now focusing its offensive on the eastern Donbas region.

After invading Ukraine and annexing Crimea in 2014, Russia began supporting rebels in a war against Ukrainian forces in the eastern Donbas region. The conflict in the Donbas raged on for eight years before Russia began its most recent invasion of Ukraine in February. The separatists control roughly one-third of the region, and NATO believes Moscow will move to conquer the rest of the Donbas in the days to come.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Tuesday said that Russia would launch a ""concentrated"" offensive in the Donbas.

""In the coming weeks we expect a further Russian push in the east and southern Ukraine, to try to take the entire Donbas and to create a land bridge to the occupied Crimea,"" the NATO chief said.

But Stoltenberg in an interview with NPR on Friday also warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin has not ""changed his overall aim, and that is to control Ukraine.""",https://www.businessinsider.com/us-assists-in-sending-ukraine-advanced-air-defense-s300-2022-4

Ukrainians have mounted a fiercer resistance to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invading forces than expected — and the West could sway the war decisively in Ukraine’s favor by supplying its fighters with heavy-duty weapons now, according to experts.

But to help Ukraine to prevail, the US must take the lead over its NATO allies, due to its global stature and massive military resources, said Dalibor Rohac, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, DC.

“In the short term, if you want Ukrainians to win this war there is nobody like the United States that could make that happen,” Rohac told The Post.

“My main message is just do more,” Rohac said. “Send Ukrainians everything that they ask for, don’t be afraid of Putin, and he can actually lose this war.”

NATO pledged to send more weapons to aid in the conflict Thursday, amid growing reports of Russian brutality and atrocities against civilians in Ukraine.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said images and accounts of the tactics of the invading force has the Biden administration “looking across the board right now not only at what we provided, and what we continue to provide, but whether there are additional systems that could make a difference.”

John Herbst, who served as the US Ambassador to Ukraine from 2003 to 2006, told The Post that the administration “spooked itself” by being overly concerned that it might take action that would be viewed as provoking Russia and lead to a nuclear standoff.

“I don’t think American troops should be shooting at Russians in Russia and actually I’m not arguing for American troops to be fighting the war in Ukraine,” Herbst said. “But I think all the weapons we can provide to Ukraine are not going to provoke Putin to nuke us.”

House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Gregory Meeks, a New York Democrat, supports providing additional weaponry including longer-range anti-aircraft missile systems, a committee spokesperson said in an email.

There remains a reluctance by some NATO countries, however, to supply weapons that will be viewed as offensive as opposed to defensive. Other concerns have been raised about arming Ukrainians with modern high-tech weapons they haven’t been properly trained to use.

Retired Gen. Wesley Clark wrote in an op/ed published in The Post Friday that there is little time to waste to give Ukrainian forces hundreds of thousands of artillery rounds, tanks and MiGs and Sukhoi aircraft.

“Why? Because there is a window of opportunity now – for a week or two perhaps – in which Ukraine can counterattack in the north, south and east to expel Russian forces. This will require mobile armored forces and air power,” Clark wrote. “And if this window is lost, the future is darker and more uncertain.”

A Ukrainian victory could push Russia out of the country for good, putting Putin on his heels and forcing him to think twice about further conflicts in Georgia, Moldova and elsewhere, Clark said.

Russia’s failure in Ukraine would also give pause to China if it decides to launch new military conflicts over its borders, he wrote in the piece.

There is a crucial window in the next several weeks, military and policy experts said.

Russia is refocusing its attacks in the east of Ukraine, in the Donbas region, after having difficulties in some northern cities — and there are fears that the intensity of the coming offensive may turn the tide back in Moscow’s favor.

But even if the offensive sputters, Putin may agree to a ceasefire by mid-May, with a concession such as annexing a piece of the Donbas region that would allow him to call the operation a success, Rohac told The Post.

The Biden administration built its initial policies about supplying weapons under the assumption that Ukraine would be largely overcome, and the resistance would be mostly guerilla-style fighters in occupied land, he added. But the US needs to adapt now the overview of the war has changed.

“Ukrainians have a decent chance of actually chasing Russians out of Ukraine altogether and that, to us, would be would a priority to get that outcome.”

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Biden “has been a little too cautious” about Ukraine.

“We need to give the Ukrainians everything they want,” he said in an interview on Fox News Friday. “They’ve demonstrated they have the will to fight, the ability to fight and our goal ought to be to win.”

McConnell said there was “no question” there were war crimes being committed by Putin’s forces — as he called for more than just talk from the US.

“Of course, Putin is not going to be deterred by being called a war criminal,” McConnell said. “He will be deterred on the battlefield … And so what we need to do is give (Ukrainians) every single useful weapon they ask for and need to beat the Russians.”
