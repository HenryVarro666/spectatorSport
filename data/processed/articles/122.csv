David Melero Pena, a photographer who has been covering the conflict in Ukraine since early March, posted the footage on March 15.

In the accompanying caption, Pena said, ‚ÄúCivilians and military sing the Ukrainian national anthem when bombing sirens sound as they work on the port of Odessa filling sandbags on the beach‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúIn Mykolaiv, less than 100 km from Odessa, the Russians are attacking,‚Äù he added.

Mykolaiv has been the target of repeated attacks for the past several weeks, as Russian forces move west along the Black Sea.

No bombings have taken place, but air raid sirens have already been heard throughout the region, including Ungv√°r (U≈æhorod), 20 kilometers from the Hungarian border.

Zolt√°n Babj√°k, mayor of Beregsz√°sz (Berehove), posted to Facebook addressing the recent warnings:

Do not forget, every air raid siren which does not end with a bombing testifies to the exceptional work of the [Ukrainian] armed forces. We should not be frustrated over the air raid notifications, we should be thankful for them.‚Äù

Over the past few days, multiple sirens have been heard throughout Transcarpathia, but the region has not been hit by bombs. Still, the large local Hungarian minority is preparing bomb shelters for the worst case scenario.

With these words, an elderly woman from Kyiv addressed Cardinal Czerny at the Catholic Caritas aid center for refugees.Continue reading

TV channels and local mayors have informed citizens about the protocol in the case that a siren is heard: electricity and gas must be turned off in houses, and residents must take their most important documents, along with food and water, to the nearest bomb shelter. If there are no bomb shelters in the area, residents must stay in the most protected part of their house or apartment, away from any windows.

There is also an air raid siren application which can be downloaded to smartphones.

Sirens Heard 20 Km from Hungarian Border

Situated directly on the Ukrainian-Slovakian border and 20 kilometers from the Hungarian border, an air raid alarm was called on March 15 in Ungv√°r (U≈æhorod), according to Ukraine NOW‚Äôs Telegram profile.

Not only does Ungv√°r have the largest Hungarian population in Ukraine, but it is also an important transportation hub, with an international airport and a railway linking Ny√≠regyh√°za, Csap, U≈æhorod, and Lviv. According to Slovakian Defense Minister Jaroslav Nad‚Äô, a Russian attack is expected on the city, 444.hu reports.

The mayors of Beregsz√°sz (Berehove) and Ungv√°r (U≈æhorod) have both asked their citizens to stay proactive, emptying and cleaning up shelters, and if possible filling them with food and water. It is paramount, they note, not to panic if they hear the sirens, but to take them seriously.

The Hungarian government has cited the potential targeting of Hungarians in Transcarpathia as one of its reasoning not to supply weapons [directly] to Ukraine. Indeed, the bombing of Ungv√°r would be highly alarming, considering that it is so far from the front-line and so close to the borders of the European Union.

LVIV, Ukraine, March 15 (Reuters) - When the air-raid siren went off mid-funeral on Tuesday there was no pause from the priest and scarcely a blink from mourners, who ignored the threat of Russian missiles to bury loved ones killed by them two days before.

Inside the baroque Saints Peter and Paul Garrison Church in Lviv, hundreds assembled to pay their respects to four soldiers, including one who had buried his brother only days before.

All were among the 35 killed by a Russian air strike on Yavoriv military base on Sunday, in which missiles penetrated farther into Ukraine than at any time during the three-week conflict, landing just 20km from the border with Poland.

Mothers hugged the coffins as weeping family members laid flowers ‚Äì some blue and yellow after the Ukrainian flag - atop the polished wood.

Pallbearers carried away the bodies of Oleh Yashchyshyn, Kyrylo Vyshyvanyi, Rostyslav Romanchuk and Serhiy Melnyk.

Three were laid to rest at the military memorial of the city's historic Lychakiv Cemetery, the most famous cemetery in Ukraine, while a fourth went to his family's plot in a small village near Lviv.

It was the second blow within a fortnight for Vyshyvanyi‚Äôs family, who buried his younger brother Vasyl on March 4. Also a soldier, he was killed near the southern city of Mykolayiv, hundreds of kilometers away.

The most senior of those killed was Oleh Yashchyshyn, whose daughter was also in Yavoriv but was not seriously wounded.

One child carried a teddy bear, the words 'Love, Love, Love' imprinted on a strap around her shoulder.

As the priest assured their families that the quartet's loss was not in vain, the choir chanted the encomium ""Memory Eternal"" in Ukrainian.

LVIV, Ukraine ‚Äî The massive movement of women and children fleeing Russian bombardments in Eastern Ukraine has led hundreds of thousands of them to Lviv, less than 50 miles from the Polish border.

In churches of every denomination, schools, orphanages, seminaries and the Ukrainian Catholic University, they find welcome, shelter and a warm meal.

Some stay only briefly as they prepare to wait hours in line to cross the border. Others hope that despite the air raid sirens and Russian bombing of military targets near Lviv, they can stay in their country.

Father Roman Prokopets, an Eastern-rite Catholic priest and chaplain at the House of Mercy Orphan Care Center, said that while the displaced people and the volunteers who help them are from different regions of the country, three things unite them: ‚ÄúLove for their homeland is one; sacrifice is two; willingness to help is three.‚Äù

Asked by a reporter what she would do when the war is over and Ukraine is victorious, Tetiana Payovska, who fled from the heavily bombed city of Kharkiv, said, ‚ÄúI would hang flags all over the house (and) kiss my native land.‚Äù

The preschool at the House of Mercy was converted into a shelter and now has about 20 guests, Prokopets told Catholic News Service. ‚ÄúWe had to make a kitchen from scratch in this house and equip a bomb shelter.‚Äù

Sofia Vasylechko, who had volunteered at the House of Mercy before the Russian invasion Feb. 24, said she knew displaced people would be seeking shelter there, so she went to help.

‚ÄúI asked myself: What do I live for?‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI realized that just living and achieving my own goals, doing everything I want is not enough for me.‚Äù

‚ÄúNow I feel needed, and, in my opinion, this is the meaning of my life,‚Äù she said.

Franciscan Father Mykola Orach, pastor of the Latin-rite Church of St. Anthony, has turned a parish house into a shelter for up to a dozen people.

Payovska is one of them. After two bombs landed near her home, she said, they grabbed a few clothes and their documents and ran to the train station.

Hundreds of other people did the same. Orach said the displaced people all report that ‚Äúit was a struggle to get on the train at the station. Then they spent a day or more in difficult conditions on the train, standing in carriages,‚Äù although ‚Äúthey tried to find a place for the children so that at least they could lie down.‚Äù

In Lviv, Payovska said, they were offered shelter and a warm meal, even though ‚Äúwe did not even want to eat after such events.‚Äù

Oleg Peniuk, pastor of Lviv Central Baptist Church, said his community initially made room for 30 people displaced by the war, but now they are hosting 75. Parishioners volunteer to help.

Tymofei Skorobagach, a youngster from Kyiv, noted, ‚Äúthere are also child volunteers.‚Äù

His mother, Natalia Skorobagach, said, ‚ÄúPillows, blankets ‚Äî everything was given to us. We have something to eat, plenty of food, the children can play in the playroom.‚Äù

Father Petro Terletskii, an Eastern Catholic priest who teaches at the Ukrainian Catholic University in Lviv, said volunteer work always has been part of the program for students and, after Russian annexed Crimea in 2014 and helped start the war in Eastern Ukraine, students began looking for ways to help, for example, by ‚Äúproviding medical care, protective equipment for the military, helping with technical and material needs.‚Äù

Some of the students, he said, come from the areas under constant Russian fire.

‚ÄúThis means that students and their relatives are direct victims,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe administration decided right away to provide dormitory accommodation for relatives from those areas of this military horror.‚Äù

Orach said that what is at stake in the war is Ukraine‚Äôs desire ‚Äúto be part of the European community, part of European civilization.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnfortunately, the price of that struggle is extremely high,‚Äù he said. While Europeans may ‚Äúunderestimate‚Äù the value of their civilization and democratic values, ‚Äúour people here in Ukraine, our military, are paying for it. They pay for it with their lives.‚Äù
