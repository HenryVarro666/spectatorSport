EU Defence Ministers meet in Brussels this afternoon to talk about the military situation on the ground in Ukraine, and “coordinate … what we can do with these half a billion euros that yesterday we decided to grant to the Ukrainian armed forces”, EU High Representative Josep Borrell told journalists on arrival at the meeting.

“These half a billion euros will be devoted to provide defensive arms, high calibre arms, anti-tanks and all kind of equipment in order to repel the aggression. Member States have to provide these arms and we have to coordinate what they are doing and what we can do, additionally, with these resources.”

He added: “We have to provide ammunition, we have to provide the high calibre guns and anti-tank equipment. Also fuel, they need fuel for the tanks, for the planes. All that has to be coordinated.”

Commenting on the referendum in Belarus on Sunday amending the Constitution and granting Belarus the status of a nuclear country, he said: “This is very dangerous. If we start changing the status of countries becoming nuclear. We know what it means for Belarus to be nuclear; it means that Russia will put nuclear weapons in Belarus.”

Asked about Ukraine’s request for EU membership, Borrell said this was not on the agenda of today’s meeting, but added: “Ukraine has clearly an European perspective, but now we have to fight against an aggression. The world cannot afford that a powerful country smashes the neighbour using its military capacities. If we allow it, it is the law of the jungle… And this, for us, Europeans, is an existential threat. We will do everything we can in order to stop it.”

On Sunday, Brussels announced that it would release 450 million euros to buy arms for the benefit of Ukraine, putting “an end to the taboo that the European Union does not supply arms to belligerents”, declared Josep Borrell, High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, on Sunday. Transport, deadlines, European coordination… How are grenades, tanks or combat aircraft sent in time of war? 20 Minutes takes stock.

Europe responds present

It only took a few days for the majority of European countries to provide military support to Ukraine by announcing the shipment of arms. And it was Germany that opened the ball on Saturday, announcing the delivery of 1,400 anti-tank rocket launchers, 500 Stinger surface-to-air missiles, nine howitzers and 14 armored vehicles.

Rifles, machine guns, anti-tank weapons, shells, helmets, ammunition… The Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Romania, Sweden, Italy, Denmark and Croatia have also promised deliveries forthcoming military equipment.

On the French side, the government confirmed this weekend the additional delivery of defense equipment to the Ukrainian authorities as well as fuel support, the presidency said on Sunday, without giving details on the type of these weapons. For its part, the French general staff announced the imminent arrival of 4 Mirage 2000-5 fighter planes intended to “reinforce the air defense of the Baltic countries”.

Poland, logistics hub

If the weapons come from national stocks, the deliveries are coordinated by the European Union. The 450 million euros announced by Brussels will be released via the “European Peace Facility”, a fund which is not part of the common EU budget but which is endowed with 5 billion euros, making it possible to “reimburse Member States which have taken from their national arms stocks and give a “European hat” to these arms deliveries”, explained a European official interviewed by AFP.

“Since there is a full-fledged war in Ukraine, and we want to do everything to support Ukraine, we decided to use our capabilities to supply weapons, lethal weapons […] to the Ukrainian army for a value of 450 million euros”, said Josep Borrellalso vice-president of the European Commission, on Sunday.

The latter also confirmed that these weapons were going to be delivered to Poland, which “has offered to serve as a logistical hub for the transfer of this material assistance to Ukraine”. But easier said than done, according to General Vincent Desportes, professor of strategy at Sciences Po and HEC and former director of the School of War, with 20 Minutes: “There is a gap between the decision and the arms delivery. The question of logistics is a major problem. A problem that European defense ministers will have to resolve on Tuesday during a meeting on the financing of arms deliveries, as well as on the delivery of the latter.

The land route, the only option

Because if deliveries can be organized by sea, land or air, Vincent Desportes believes that we can already eliminate the last option. “Currently, delivering weapons by air is totally impossible because Russia has control of Ukrainian airspace. Any plane entering Ukraine can be destroyed immediately,” explains the general, who adds: “It is really not certain that Westerners would take the risk, it would be an act of war, with all that that entails. The maritime option is not necessarily better. “Russia controls the Sea of ​​Azov, south of Ukraine, and obviously we cannot go through Russia or Crimea,” continues the general, who adds that it is also impossible to go through the Black Sea, in the southwest of Ukraine, due to the presence of the Soviet fleet.

The land route remains. If it appears to be the one and only solution, it poses many problems. “The weapons have to arrive in trucks, probably those of NATO, as far as Poland, to be unloaded and then loaded into Ukrainian trucks. The Russians are following this closely and could attack these trucks on Ukrainian soil”, explains the specialist, who also points out that the Polish and Ukrainian roads are, for the time being, totally congested by Ukrainian refugees who are fleeing to other places. countries, especially in Poland.

How long ?

After weapons, logistics and funding, there remains the question of deadlines. How soon can Ukraine expect to receive this material? The first deliveries have already taken place this weekend, several European officials said on Sunday. But for Vincent Desportes, it will take several days, even weeks, to deliver everything. “Shipping boxes of grenades by land is doable quickly. But delivering planes seems much more complicated to me, ”analyzes the specialist.",https://www.paudal.com/2022/02/28/how-will-the-delivery-of-arms-to-ukraine-be-organised/

For this, the European Union will use €500 million. As Brussels clarified earlier, we are talking about the supply of large-caliber and anti-tank weapons. NATO also said that they are sending thousands of small arms and anti-tank weapons, hundreds of air defense missiles to Ukraine. According to the Kremlin, such a move by the West would be an extremely dangerous and destabilizing factor that would in no way contribute to ""stability in Ukraine."" According to experts, such actions by the EU and NATO are aimed at “escalating the situation” and may lead to an increase in the number of civilian deaths from the criminal actions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and nationalists.

“We will use €500 million from the European Peace Fund to provide military support to Ukraine,” the European Commission said in a statement posted on its Twitter page after the meeting of EU defense ministers on February 28.

Earlier, Western states, including the EU and NATO, condemned the special operation of the Russian Federation to demilitarize and denazify Ukraine, announced on February 24 by Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Moscow emphasizes that this was a forced measure designed to assist the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics in repelling aggression from the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

As the head of EU diplomacy, Josep Borrell, explained during a press conference, the member countries of the association intend to ""increase the volume of bilateral military support to Ukraine and supplement these efforts with EU funding.""

“In this situation, our support for the armed forces of Ukraine is extremely important.

They need ammunition, new medical aid, any defensive weapon.

And together with the countries (EU.

- RT

) - in addition to the efforts of some of them - we intend to provide resources from EU funding, which it was decided to use yesterday.

And everyone - I emphasize - everyone agreed with this, ”said Borrell.

He also noted that military assistance to Ukraine will be ""delivered to those countries that have a border with Ukraine.""

“I believe that it is no secret to anyone what class of weapons we are talking about.

I will repeat what I said yesterday that we are talking about defense weapons and ammunition.

Armament and ammunition of all calibers that will allow Ukraine to defend itself against aggression,” the head of EU diplomacy said.

However, Hungary has already stated that no lethal weapons will be delivered to Ukraine through its territory, since they can ""become the object of violent military operations.""

This was announced by the head of the Hungarian Foreign Ministry, Peter Szijjarto, in his video message posted on Facebook.

According to him, Budapest will not ""get involved in the war.""

As the head of EU diplomacy, Josep Borrell, clarified earlier, we are talking about the supply of large-caliber and anti-tank weapons to Ukraine, as well as ""the most diverse equipment"" designed to ""repel aggression.""

“Countries (EU.

- RT

) must provide these weapons, and we need to coordinate their actions, as well as possible additional ways to dispose of these resources,” he said.

At the same time, Borrell welcomed the Russian-Ukrainian talks.

Germany also supported them, which, however, had previously approved the transfer to Kiev of 400 German anti-tank guns from the Netherlands, nine D-30 howitzers and ammunition from Estonia.

Russia's response

Moscow reacted to these measures of the EU countries.

According to the press secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov, the supply of weapons and ammunition to Ukraine will destabilize the situation.

“The supply of arms, weapons, ammunition to the territory of Ukraine, from our point of view, will become an extremely dangerous and destabilizing factor, which in any case will in no way contribute to either stability in Ukraine or the restoration of order,” Peskov told reporters on February 28.

In the long run, such a move could have ""much more dangerous consequences,"" he said.

“This once again confirms the correctness of Russia in the measures that are being taken,” Peskov added.

In turn, the official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, called outrageous Germany's decision to start deliveries of lethal weapons to Ukraine.

“Too many sad associations are caused by the prospect of further “military” pumping of Kyiv from Berlin,” Zakharova said.

In addition, the Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement condemning the EU decision to supply lethal weapons to Ukraine, stressing that the individuals and structures of the association involved in this will be held accountable ""for any consequences of such actions.""

“They cannot fail to understand the degree of danger of the consequences,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

The Russian Foreign Ministry also noted that the EU decision ""is self-revealing.""

""Marks the end of European integration as a 'pacifist' project to reconcile European peoples after World War II,"" the statement said.

“Another myth that was propagated by the EU in the past was also finally dispelled – that their unilateral restrictions, illegitimate in international legal terms, are not directed against the Russian people.”

Through NATO

Recall that the supply of weapons to Ukraine, in addition to the EU, was reported by the North Atlantic Alliance.

So, on February 27, a press release was published on the bloc's website, which stated that NATO countries were strengthening their ""practical support"" for Kyiv.

“Thousands of anti-tank weapons, hundreds of air defense missiles, as well as thousands of small arms and ammunition are sent to Ukraine,” the report says.

Belgium, Germany, Greece, Canada, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, the Czech Republic and Estonia have already made or claim large deliveries of military equipment to Ukrainian territory.

In turn, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson said in a conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that he would do everything possible to ensure the delivery of military assistance from the UK and its allies to Ukraine.

Later, on February 28, Croatia announced that it would send infantry weapons and protective equipment worth 124 million kuna (about €16.5 million) to Kiev.

Earlier it was reported that the Netherlands will transfer 200 Stinger complexes to Kiev.

In addition, Canada announced on February 28 that it would send about $20 million worth of military assistance to Ukraine, primarily body armor, helmets and night vision goggles.

Later, Ottawa informed that it would also supply anti-tank weapons to Kiev.

At the same time, as the press service of NATO notes, Ukraine has already received ""critical weapons"" from the countries of the alliance, including anti-aircraft missiles and Javelins.

“I welcome the fact that the allies are stepping up support for Ukraine by providing additional military equipment,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg was quoted as saying by the press service of the alliance.

It is also noted that ""in the context of the current crisis,"" the bloc is helping to coordinate Ukraine's requests for assistance.

As Stoltenberg said on February 28 during a conversation with Volodymyr Zelensky, NATO allies are “increasing support” by providing Ukraine with air defense missiles, anti-tank weapons, and humanitarian and financial assistance.

I just spoke with President @ZelenskyyUa & commended him for the bravery of the people & armed forces of #Ukraine.

#NATO Allies are stepping up support with air-defence missiles, anti-tank weapons, as well as humanitarian & financial aid.

— Jens Stoltenberg (@jensstoltenberg) February 28, 2022

At the same time, in an interview with NBC News, the NATO Secretary General ruled out the possibility of the alliance introducing a no-fly zone over Ukraine.

According to him, the bloc has no intentions ""to enter Ukraine either by land or by air.""

In turn, the press service of the Ukrainian Navy said that Bulgaria, Poland and Slovakia will send 70 MiG-29 and Su-25 combat aircraft to Kiev.

It is noted that, if necessary, they will be able to be based on Polish airfields, from where Ukrainian pilots will perform combat missions.

""Hostile actions against Russia""

As Vladimir Olenchenko, senior researcher at the Center for European Studies at IMEMO RAS, noted in an interview with RT, the decision of the EU and NATO countries to send more weapons to Ukraine is “thoughtless and extremely dangerous.”

“But such a measure fits into their general outline of anti-Russian actions and further undermines the situation in Ukraine,” the analyst said.

At the same time, Olenchenko drew attention to the fact that the statements of the European Commission, Borrell and Stoltenberg on the supply of weapons to Ukraine were made at a time when negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow were underway.

“The parties were then looking for a way out of the current situation.

Against this background, the actions of the EU look inflammatory and provocative.

Once again, the European authorities, in this case the EU, show that they are not interested in either Ukraine or Russia, they are interested in a clash between them, ”the expert emphasized.

Deliveries of weapons to Ukraine from Western countries

Olenchenko also noted that the EU and NATO arms supplies ""give Kyiv unnecessary hopes"" for Western military assistance.

“The West has repeatedly admitted that it will not fight on the territory of Ukraine, but now it speaks allegorically, but the meaning is this: continue to oppose the Russian Federation, and we will support you with the supply of weapons and other measures,” he said.

Olenchenko also believes that military assistance from the EU and NATO as a whole “could play a cruel joke on them,” since such activity could lead not only to an aggravation of the situation in Ukraine, but also to a clash between Russia and the North Atlantic alliance.

“Moscow takes into account and understands such risks.

At the same time, Western countries pretend or really do not understand where the desire to militarize Ukraine can lead them, ”the analyst believes.

In turn, Vladimir Shapovalov, deputy director of the Institute of History and Politics of the Moscow State Pedagogical University, stressed that the supply of Western weapons to Kiev justified the fears of the Russian Federation, which were indicated in the security guarantees offered by Moscow to the United States and NATO.

“In fact, we are talking about the fact that Ukraine is not a NATO country, but nevertheless, the alliance states began massive supplies of weapons to Ukraine.

And what would happen if the Ukrainian side was part of the bloc, it’s even scary to imagine.

Now we are seeing hostile actions from NATO against Russia and we understand why the Russian Federation is sounding the alarm because of this situation, ”he said.

Shapovalov also noted that the supply of weapons by the West to Ukraine is aimed at ""escalating the conflict.""

“Each supply of this kind is the death of new civilians, both in the LPR and DPR, and in Ukrainian cities, given that Kiev distributes weapons to the population uncontrollably, besides, nationalists who have experience of military operations in Ukraine are released from prisons in Ukraine. Donbass,” the expert noted.

Shapovalov also believes that Western military assistance gives the Kiev authorities the illusion of support from the EU and NATO.

“But the Western military and diplomats left Ukraine, they recommended the same to their citizens.

Moreover, the Secretary General of the alliance said that the bloc does not intend to take Ukraine into NATO, and even more so to fight on its territory, ”concluded the analyst.

The images released by Maxar Technologies, a space technology company, showed a large deployment of Russian ground troops moving in the direction of the Ukrainian capital from approximately 40 miles (64 km) away.

The deployment consisted of hundreds of military vehicles and extended more than 3.25 miles (5 km), Maxar said.

The convoy was situated northeast of the Ukrainian city of Ivankiv and contained fuel, logistics and armored vehicles including tanks, infantry fighting vehicles and self-propelled artillery.

Maxar has been tracking the buildup of Russian forces for weeks.

This development comes as the European Union took the unprecedented step of supplying weapons to Ukraine, which is the first time the bloc has financed the purchase and delivery of weapons for a country that is under attack.

Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, called the step a ""watershed moment"" and also announced that the bloc will also close its airspace to Russian airlines.

“Putin’s war is not only against Ukraine. We need to understand the gravity of the situation for Europeans and global security: this afternoon, Putin has announced that he is putting Russia’s nuclear deterrent forces on “high alert”.

“I just had a VTC with the G7 Foreign Ministers, and we were joined by Minister [of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Dmytro] Kuleba, who informed us of the latest developments on the ground and Ukraine’s urgent needs. I told him very clearly. You came last week and you asked for SWIFT and for arms. Now we are delivering on both. We are doing everything we can to support Ukraine, we stand by the Ukrainian people in practical terms.

“In one hour, I am convening for the fourth time this week the EU Foreign Affairs Council for an extraordinary meeting via VTC.

Following up to the request by Foreign Affairs Minister of Ukraine, [Dmytro] Kuleba on Friday, I will today propose to use the European Peace Facility for two emergency assistance measures: to finance the supply of lethal material to the Ukrainian army, as well as urgently needed fuel, protective equipment and emergency medical supplies.

“Another taboo has fallen. The taboo that the European Union was not providing arms in a war. Yes, we are doing it. Because this war requires our engagement to support the Ukrainian army.

“We live unprecedented times, like we did when the pandemic arrived. We are facing the pest of the war, like in the Biblical times. This will be the first time in history that the EU will be providing lethal equipment to a third country.

“I have also instructed my team in the EU Military Staff to set up a mechanism to coordinate the requests of the Ukrainian army, so that we respond in the most effective way with Member States to their needs that Minister Kuleba has explained to us today.

“Today we will provide the political endorsement of the European Union 27 Member States on the overall package of measures outlined by President [of the European Commission, Ursula] von der Leyen and pave the way for the swift adoption of all necessary legal acts.

“As just explained by Madame President, we will discuss with the Foreign Ministers the announcement of tough economic sanctions: SWIFT, the Central Bank and I will also put forward additional listings against Oligarchs. We will target the elite of Putin’s regime, who benefit financially from the system. We will also reinforce our measures against Belarus, who have been facilitating Russia’s assault against Ukraine.

“With these measures, more than half of the Russian Central Bank reserves will be blocked.

“Also, more and more Member States are announcing to close their airspace to Russian airlines and aircrafts. We will set out a common approach with the Ministers.

“Finally, disinformation. Because Putin does not want only to conquer the land, he also wants to conquer the spirits of the people with toxic messages through lies.

We have been fighting it since 2015 with the East StratCom Taskforce and the EU vs Disinformation platform(link is external) – which I invite you to visit.

“Today, we are taking a crucial step to turn off the tab for Russia’s information manipulation in Europe by banning Russia Today and Sputnik from broadcasting in the Union. We are killing the snake from its neck. We will also continue working actively in Ukraine and our neighbourhood to fight their attempts to distort reality and seed confusion and uncertainty.

Ukraine’s ambassador has told a rare emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly that if his country is crushed, international peace and democracy are in peril.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said “the guns are talking now, but the path of dialogue must always remain open.”

The meeting was the assembly’s first emergency session in decades. It came ahead of a vote this week to isolate Russia by deploring the “aggression against Ukraine” and demanding its troops stop fighting and withdraw.

Rocket attacks kill 11 in Kharkiv, regional official says

The head of the regional administration in Kharkiv, Oleg Synegubov, has said that at least 11 people were killed and dozens of others wounded during Russian rocket attacks on the eastern Ukrainian city.

The city, Ukraine’s second-largest, has become one of the major battlegrounds since Moscow launched its invasion.

Synegubov said Russian forces were firing artillery at residential areas of Kharkiv where there are no Ukrainian army positions or strategic infrastructure.

“This is happening in the daytime, when people have gone out to the pharmacy, for groceries, or for drinking water. It’s a crime,” he said.

It was not immediately possible to independently verify the casualty figures. Earlier Interior Ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko said Russian rocket bombardments on Kharkiv on Monday had killed dozens of people.

Ukraine’s president says Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has agreed to provide Kyiv with $100m of aid, on top of existing financial support.

“A truly global anti-war coalition works,” Zelenskyy tweeted after the pair spoke by phone.

Kishida said separately that Tokyo will join the international sanctions effort on Russia’s central bank and impose sanctions on Belarusian individuals and organisations including President Alexander Lukashenko given the country’s “evident involvement in the invasion” of Ukraine.

The developments came after former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Sunday that Tokyo should weigh whether to seek a nuclear sharing arrangement similar to NATO’s nuclear deterrence policy following Russia’s assault on its neighbour.

“But, for that reason, it is paramount that everyone is treated with dignity and without favour. All who flee a conflict situation have the same right to safe passage under UN Convention and the colour of their passport or their skin should make no difference.”

‘Hard to see quite where these talks have to go’

Al Jazeera’s Jonah Hull, reporting from Lviv, says Moscow “has not given any hint or indication” that it intends to step back from its key demands ahead of the Russia-Ukraine talks.

“These demands include the neutrality of Ukraine, guarantees that it will never join NATO and that Kyiv recognise the declared independence of breakaway regions in the east of the country,” Hull said, citing the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) and Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR).

“And you can probably include in that recognition that Crimea is officially part of Russia after it was annexed [by Moscow] back in 2014; most of the world and certainly Ukraine does not recognise that,” he added.

“This Ukrainian delegation is certainly not going to accede to those demands and it seems highly unlikely that the Russians are suddenly going to withdraw their forces and therefore it is hard to see quite where these talks have to go.”

UN says Ukraine radioactive waste site struck

The UN nuclear watchdog says missiles have hit a radioactive waste disposal site in Kyiv, but there are no reports of damage to the buildings or indications of a release of radioactive material.

In a statement, International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Grossi said Ukrainian authorities informed his office of the overnight attack and the agency expects to receive the results of on-site radioactive monitoring soon. A day earlier, an electrical transformer at a similar disposal facility in the eastern city of Kharkiv was damaged.

Such facilities typically hold low-level radioactive materials such as waste from hospitals and industry, but Grossi said the two incidents highlight a “very real risk.” He added that if the sites are damaged there could be “potentially severe consequences for human health and the environment”.

Russia’s nuclear forces high alert is a ‘psychological ploy’: Analyst

Robert Hunter, a former US ambassador to NATO, said Putin’s decision to put Russia’s nuclear forces on high alert is meant as a warning to the West not to get involved.

“This is a psychological ploy to try to increase his leverage, as he decides how far he wants to go in Ukraine,” Hunter told Al Jazeera.

“I don’t believe it’s a threat at all, because the Russians would have just as much to lose, if not more, if they went in this direction.”

NATO, US, must take Putin announcement ‘seriously’: Analyst

Jim Walsh, an expert in international security and a research associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Security Studies Program, said NATO and the US have to take Putin’s announcement on placing Russia’s nuclear forces on high alert “seriously”.

“If an adversary goes on nuclear alert, and you are a target of that, then you’re going to begin to make preparations in case your adversary moves higher along the alert chain,” Walsh told Al Jazeera. “But I think politically, it’s hard to believe that anyone takes it seriously,” he said.

“My guess is … that, in particular, people in the Pentagon, military officials, are reaching out to their counterparts in Russia in quiet closed conversations. I think back channel communication, reassurance – that’ll be the main emphasis, at least in the US and in NATO, because there’s obviously no reason for this to escalate into a nuclear war,” he added.

Holocaust remembrance groups in Israel denounce Babyn Yar damage

Organizations in Israel dedicated to remembrance of the Holocaust condemned a Russian airstrike that damaged the Babyn Yar Holocaust memorial.

The missile strike on the nearby TV tower killed five people according to Ukrainian authorities. A spokesman for the memorial said a more thorough assessment of damage would be carried out with daybreak.

In a statement, Israeli foreign minister Yair Lapid denounced the incident and said Israel would repair any damage.

In a tweet, Lapid wrote, ""We are calling for the preservation and respect for this sacred site.""

Babyn Yar commemorates the lives of more than 33,000 Jewish people who were slaughtered by Nazi Germany in 1941.

Natan Sharansky, the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial's chairman, said. Russian President Vladimir Putin ""seeks to distort and manipulate the Holocaust to justify an illegal invasion of a sovereign democratic country is utterly abhorrent.""

Sharansky added, ""It is symbolic that he starts attacking Kyiv by bombing the site of the Babyn Yar, the biggest of Nazi massacres.''

What's behind Russia's 'denazification' claims?

Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly asserted that Ukraine needs to be ""denazified"" — a term, which in its original context refers to the Allies' policy for Nazi Germany after World War II. DW's fact-checking team has debunked the claim, but why is Putin using it to justify the invasion?

To understand why, you have to look to Russia's past, said Emily Sherwin, DW's former Moscow correspondent, who is now in Berlin after Russia revoked media accreditation for DW employees in January.

""This 'denazification' idea is based on a very emotional past,"" Sherwin explained.

""The Soviet Union fought against Germany in World War II — which is known in Russia as the 'Great Patriotic War' — and that has almost become a founding myth for Russian identity … especially under Putin.""

""Everyone can relate to this horrible story, of all these Soviet soldiers being killed. Almost every family has someone who was killed,"" Sherwin said.

""So in a way, Nazis are the perfect enemy — even in this context,"" she said, adding that framing the conflict in Ukraine within his emotional, historical frame ""is kind of convenient now for the Russian government.""

Orthodox clerics sign open letter against the war

The letter called ""the conflicting parties to dialogue,"" saying: ""Only the capability to hear the other can give hope to leave the abyss in which our countries have been plunged in just a few days.""

The letter also said that ""the final judgment awaits every person"" and seemed to intimate that those involved in ""murderous orders"" were liable to face ""eternal torment.""

""Let yourself and all of us enter the Great Lent in the spirit of faith, hope, and love. Stop the war,"" the letter concluded, using a popular phrase among Russians calling for a halt to the invasion.

Petukhov added that the people in Kyiv are ""ready for whatever comes next.""

He also urged for the EU to consider Ukraine's appeal for membership, as a sign of solidarity for the people in Ukraine who have taken to the streets to stop Russian troop advances.

""You could see the video footage from around the country of ordinary people going in front of stopping them. So these people need a reassurance and this clear message from Europe,"" Petukhov added.

5 killed after Kyiv television tower hit: Interior Ministry

A Russian airstrike hit the main television tower in the heart of Kyiv, killing five and injuring five, Ukraine's State Service for Emergency Situations said.

Ukraine's Interior Ministry said equipment had been damaged and ""channels won't work for a while"" after a blast sounded in the Babi Yar district.

Andriy Yermak, the head of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office, said on Facebook that a ""powerful missile attack"" had hit ""where th Babyn Yar memorial complex is located.""

BMW and Volkswagen announce production shutdowns

Production of BMW and Volkswagen (VW) vehicles is shutting down due to a shortage of wiring systems from sites in Ukraine. The announcement from Volkswagen came in a letter company board members sent workers on Tuesday.

""As of today, we will not be able to manufacture in Wolfsburg,"" at the company's headquarters, the letter said.

Automotive parts supplier Leoni was forced to shutter two plants in Stryji and Kolomyja in Ukraine as a precautionary measure when Russia's invasion started. Up until only one week ago, 7,000 employees were at work manufacturing and delivering wiring systems.

BMW has created a crisis management team to address the problem to secure ""alternative production sites and to restart production as quickly as possible,"" a company spokesman said.

Scholz 'condemns' Russian attacks in call with Zelenskyy

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz ""strongly condemned"" Russia's aggressive actions in Ukraine in a phone call with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday.

Scholz informed Zelenskyy ""about the status of Germany's support and the numerous demonstrations of solidarity in Germany,"" according to a chancellery statement.

The statement from the German government on the call came after Zelenskyy tweeted that he'd spoken with Scholz.

Zelenskyy said the two discussed the ""shelling of residential neighborhoods"" as well as Ukraine's appeal for a no-fly-zone over the country.

Western leaders, including NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg and British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, have already spoken out against a no-fly-zone, saying such a step would risk widening the war by putting NATO aircraft in direct conflict with Russian forces.

The Ukrainian leader also appealed for the EU to accelerate talks on the possibility of Ukraine joining the European Union.

The German government statement did not mention Ukraine's request to close airspace over Ukraine, nor Kyiv's push to urgently join the EU.

MEP David McAllister: 'We are at a watershed moment'

DW spoke to David McAllister, a Member of the European Parliament, after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed a special session of the body.

In an emotional speech delivered from Kyiv, Zelenskyy described recent attacks on Ukrainian cities and accused Russia of targeting children. Zelensky also repeated his appeal for his country's immediate membership into the EU, arguing the bloc would be stronger with Ukraine in it.

""MEPs made clear that we stand in full solidarity with Ukraine in these very dark hours of our European history,"" McAllister told DW, noting: ""Today our message was Ukraine is a European nation.""

However, he saw little hope for the immediate accession Kyiv is seeking, describing joining the EU as a ""medium and long term"" process.

""Article 49 of the Treaty of the European Union is very clear. Any country in Europe, which adheres to our values can apply to join our European Union. Of course, this is a medium and long term process because in the end, a country has to go through the accession negotiations and in the end has to fulfill all the very ambitious judicial, financial, economic and political criteria.""

Watch video 05:10 'We support Ukraine in a European perspective': MEP David McAllister speaks to DW

He added, ""Ukraine wants to join the European Union, and we are standing in solidarity with Ukraine because Ukrainians are not only fighting for democracy, the rule of law and their own liberty, but also fighting for European values which are under attack now in Kyiv.""

""We are at a watershed moment,"" McAllister said, adding that this was why ""the European Union has taken this decision to support Ukraine in its heroic fight against Russian aggression.""

One step he noted was that ""just two weeks ago, we adopted a new micro financial assistance package of €1.2 billion. In total, we have now supported Ukraine with €17 billion.""

McAllister is a longstanding senior MEP for Germany's conservative CDU/CSU, and was state premier of Lower Saxony before heading to Brussels. He was born in West Berlin to a Scottish father and German mother.

EU readies for millions of refugees

The EU Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson said on Tuesday says the bloc must prepare for ""millions"" more refugees fleeing Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

It is designed to deal with mass arrivals of displaced persons in the EU, and provides for the same level of protection, for 1 to 3 years, in all EU states.

The includes a residence permit and access to employment and social welfare.

Johansson also said the EU's external border and coastguard agency Frontex would be deployed to secure parts of the border that are overwhelmed from Ukranian refugees fleeing Russia's invasion.

At present, some 400,000 have passed into the bloc.

Hundreds of thousands of people have already fled Ukraine, with millions expected to flee in the coming months

Italy to move embassy from Kyiv to Lviv

Italy's Foreign Ministry has announced that it will be moving its embassy in Kyiv to the western city of Lviv as the situation in the capital becomes increasingly uncertain.

""Owing to the deterioration of the security situation in Kyiv, and the consequent impossibility of guaranteeing full functionality, the Italian embassy in Kyiv is being transferred to Lviv,"" a Foreign Ministry statement said.

Rome's decision follows several other countries, such as Israel, Australia, and Canada, completely moving their diplomatic corps to Lviv.

Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said that all embassy staff, as well as other Italian nationals living in Kyiv, had moved to the ambassador’s residence temporarily. Most of them were expected to leave the city today.

In a speech to the Senate in Rome, Draghi said that Russian President Vladimir Putin had underestimated Europe.

""Perhaps Putin had thought us impotent, divided or intoxicated by our wealth. He was wrong. We were and are ready to respond and fight back,"" he said.

The prime minister praised Europe's ""prompt, consistent, quick"" and ""united"" response to the invasion of Ukraine, saying that the bloc was not trying to expand its influence but rather ""defend our values.""

Russia says sanctions will not 'change our position'

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Western sanctions will not change the course of the war. ""They probably think that they can force us to change our position with sanctions,"" the Interfax news agency quoted Peskov as saying.

""It is obvious that there is no question of that, no one will change their position,"" said Peskov, who has also personally been hit with sanctions. ""We have no assets in the West, we have no accounts in the West, punish us,"" Peskov said.

Russia's top security official, Dmitry Medvedev, shot back at French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire promising to wage an economic and financial war against Russia.

""Watch your tongue, gentlemen! And don't forget that in human history, economic wars quite often turned into real ones,"" Medvedev, a former Russian president, wrote in French on his Twitter account.
