April 2 (UPI) -- Russian forces broadly retreated from the Kyiv region Saturday, Ukrainian military officials said. The Russian military left behind dead soldiers and burned vehicles in its retreat, according to to witnesses, Ukrainian officials, satellite images and military analysts, signaling a potential major turn in the war which is in its sixth week, The New York Times reported.

""The initial Russian operation was a failure and one of its central goals -- the capture of Kyiv -- proved unobtainable for Russian forces,"" Michael Kofman, the director of Russian studies at C.N.A., a research institute in Arlington, Va., told the Times in a telephone interview Saturday.

Ukraine's military also announced that Russian forces have retreated from other areas.

Still, attacks on other cities have continued, and the Pentagon has cautioned that Russian forces near Kyiv could be repositioning for renewed assaults.

Meanwhile, Russian forces attacked a major oil refinery Saturday in Kremenchuk, Ukraine, Russian officials announced.

The Russian military targeted the major oil refinery in the central Ukrainian city in a series of strikes, including ""high-precision long-range and sea-based weapons,"" Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov told CNN. The strikes destroyed storage facilities holding gasoline and diesel fuels for Ukrainian troops in the country's eastern and central regions.

Russian forces also used high precision air-based missiles to hit military airfields in cities to the east of Kremenchuk, including Poltava and Dnipro, Konashenkov added.

Since Russian forces seized the central Ukrainian town of Enerhodar, close to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, last month, there have been sporadic protests, according to CNN.

On Saturday, Russian forces dispersed these protesters with gunfire and explosions, National Nuclear Energy Generating Company of Ukraine Energoatom posted on Telegram on Saturday.

""The occupiers dispersed the protesters with explosions and shootings,"" a Telegram post read, according to CNN's English translation of the social media post.

""A series of loud explosions has taken place in Enerhodar,"" another Energoatom post read, Ukrinform reported. ""This morning, the town residents gathered for a peaceful rally in support of Ukraine. They sang the anthem and talked to each other. Russcist occupiers were watching them. When Enerhodar residents started to go away, paddy wagons approached, in which the invaders began to pack locals.""

The explosions injured about four people, according to Energoatom's posts on Telegram.

In Mykolaiv state, the death toll from an explosion that destroyed the regional state administration building on Tuesday has risen to 31, Ukraine's States Emergency Service said Saturday, adding that 34 were injured in the blast.

On Friday, a fire broke out at a fuel terminal in Belgorod, a Russian city near the Ukrainian border, which Russian officials blamed on a strike by two Ukrainian helicopters.

Firefighters have since put out the blaze engulfing half of the fuel tanks at the terminal, according to the Russian News Agency TASS, and no casualties resulted from the incident.

""Ukrainian forces continue to advance against withdrawing forces in the vicinity of Kyiv,"" according to the British Ministry of Defense update earlier Saturday. ""Along the northwestern axis, Ukrainian forces' attempts to advance from Irpin towards Bucha and Hostomel are ongoing. Russian forces are reported to have withdrawn from Hostomel airport, which has been subject to fighting since the first day of the conflict. Along the eastern axis, Ukraine has re-taken several villages.""

""In the east of Ukraine, Ukrainian forces have secured a key route in eastern Kharkhiv after heavy fighting,"" the update added. ""This follows the liberation of Trostyanets, in the vicinity of Sumy, earlier this week.""

Since the Russian Federation's invasion of Ukraine began on Feb. 24, 1,325 civilians have been killed and 2,017 have been injured, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights' latest update.

The OHCHR warned actual casualties could be even higher as receipt of information from some locations of intense fighting has been ""delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration.""

ODESA, Ukraine (Reuters) -Russian attacks have destroyed an oil refinery in the central Poltava region and struck ""critical infrastructure"", most likely oil facilities, near the port city of Odesa, local officials said on Sunday.

Russian forces have attacked Odesa, the main base for Ukraine's navy, alongside other Ukrainian Black Sea ports such as Mariupol and Mykolaiv. If taken, it would give Russia a land corridor from Crimea to Transniestria, a Russian-speaking breakaway province of Moldova that hosts Russian troops.

Oil facilities have been a focus of attacks.

Kremenchuk, 250 km (150 miles) southeast of Kyiv along the Dnipro river, had Ukraine's only fully functioning oil refinery.

Dmytro Lunin, governor of the Poltava region, said on television that the refinery had been destroyed in a rocket attack on Saturday.

""The fire at the refinery has been extinguished but the facility has been completely destroyed and can no longer function,"" he said.

Reuters could not independently confirm the refinery's destruction. The plant processed 3.2 million tonnes of oil last year and its loss could prove a blow to Ukraine's defence effort.

Several rockets also hit Mykolaiv, an interior ministry aide said.

Earlier, Russia's defence ministry said its missiles had destroyed an oil refinery and three fuel storage facilities near Odesa. It said they had been used by Ukraine to supply its troops near Mykolaiv.

Vladyslav Nazarov, an officer of Ukraine's Southern Operational Command, said on Telegram that there had been a missile attack on ""critical infrastructure"". Two columns of thick, black smoke could be seen rising into a grey sky before spreading out over the city.

""All relevant systems and structures are working ... No casualties reported,"" Nazarov added. Reuters could not confirm details of the attack.

Odesa Mayor Gennadiy Trukhanov said on television the situation was ""under control"", adding: ""Homes, civilian infrastructure, roofs have suffered damage.""

Vika, a local resident who declined to give her surname, said her family had woken up to powerful explosions near their home.

""There was smoke, the children were in a panic, the windows were blown in ... it was terrifying,"" she said.

Russia denies attacking civilians.

Russian forces invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what the Kremlin calls a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" its neighbour.

Ukraine and the Western countries supporting it reject that as a baseless pretext for a war of aggression.

Missiles struck near Ukraine's southern port of Odesa on Sunday with Russia saying it had destroyed an oil refinery used by the Ukrainian military, while attempts to evacuate people from the devastated city of Mariupol were due to continue.

There was little sign of a breakthrough in efforts to negotiate an end to the five-week war, although Russia's chief negotiator said talks were due to resume on Monday.

In Odesa, the city council said ""critical infrastructure facilities"" were hit by missiles. No casualties were reported.

Russia's defence ministry said strikes by its military destroyed an oil refinery and three fuel storage facilities near Odesa. It said the facilities were used to supply Ukrainian troops near the city of Mykolaiv.

Odesa, on the Black Sea, is the main base for Ukraine's navy. It has been targeted by Russian forces seeking a land corridor to Transdniestria, a Russian-speaking breakaway province of Moldova which hosts Russian troops.

""Smoke is visible in some areas of the city. All relevant systems and structures are working ... No casualties reported,"" Vladyslav Nazarov, an officer of Ukraine's South Operational Command, said on Telegram.

Dmytro Lunin, governor of the central Poltava region, said the Kremenchug oil refinery, 350 kilometres (220 miles) northeast of Odesa, had been destroyed in a separate rocket attack on Saturday.

Evacuation efforts in Mariupol and nearby Berdyansk, both also on Ukraine's southern shores, were due to continue with a convoy of buses being prepared for the operation with help from the Red Cross.

""Seven buses will try to get closer to Mariupol, accompanied by the International Committee of the Red Cross,"" Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said in an online video posting.

The ICRC abandoned earlier attempts due to security concerns. Russia blamed the ICRC for the delays.

Mariupol is Russia's main target in Ukraine's southeastern region of Donbas, and tens of thousands of civilians there are trapped with scant access to food and water.

PEACE TALKS

Russia's chief negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, said a draft deal was not ready for any meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

On Saturday, Ukrainian negotiator David Arakhamia raised hope for negotiations with Russia, saying enough progress had been made for direct talks between the two.

Medinsky said that while Ukraine was showing more realism by agreeing to be neutral, renouncing nuclear weapons, not joining a military bloc and refusing to host military bases, there had been no progress on other key Russia demands.

""I repeat again and again: Russia's position on Crimea and Donbas remains UNCHANGED,"" he said on Telegram, adding talks via videoconference would continue on Monday.

Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and has recognised declarations of independence by the self-proclaimed republics of Luhansk and Donetsk in the Donbas area of eastern Ukraine which rose up against Kyiv's rule.

BUCHA DESTRUCTION

Ukraine said on Saturday its forces had retaken all areas around Kyiv, claiming complete control of the capital region for the first time since Russia launched its invasion on Feb 24.

Russia has pulled back forces that had threatened Kyiv from the north to regroup for battles in eastern Ukraine.

There was no Russian comment on the claim that the Kyiv region was entirely in Ukrainian hands, which Reuters could not immediately verify.

The mayor of Bucha, a liberated town 37 km (23 miles) northwest of the capital, said 300 residents had been killed during a month-long occupation by the Russian army, and victims were seen in a mass grave and still lying on the streets.

""The bastards!"" Vasily, a 66-year-old man said, weeping with rage as he looked at more than a dozen bodies in the road outside his house. ""I'm sorry. The tank behind me was shooting. Dogs!""

The Kremlin and the Russian defence ministry in Moscow did not immediately reply to requests for comment when asked on Saturday about the bodies found in Bucha.

Moscow denies targeting civilians and rejects war crimes allegations.

Among those killed near Kyiv was Maksim Levin, a Ukrainian photographer and videographer who was working for a news website and was a long-time contributor to Reuters.

British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said she was appalled by atrocities in Bucha and voiced support for the International Criminal Court's inquiry into potential war crimes.

Ukraine's emergencies service said more than 1,500 explosives had been found in one day during a search of the village of Dmytrivka, west of the capital.

Zelenskiy warned in a video address: ""They are mining all this territory. Houses are mined, equipment is mined, even the bodies of dead people."" He did not cite evidence.

Russia's defence ministry did not reply to a request for comment on the allegations about mines. Reuters could not independently verify them.

Since the launch of what Putin called a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine, Russia has failed to capture a single major city and has instead laid siege to urban areas, uprooting a quarter of the country's population.

British military intelligence said Russian naval forces were maintaining a blockade along the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, but the option of amphibious landings were becoming increasingly high-risk for Russia.

It said reported mines, the origin of which remained unclear and disputed, posed a serious risk to shipping in the Black Sea.",https://www.thedailystar.net/news/world/2022-russian-invasion-ukraine/news/ukraine-oil-refinery-destroyed-russian-missile-attack-2997036
