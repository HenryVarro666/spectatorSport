History of Russian & Ukraine 1

Why Ukraine once the third-largest nuclear power gave up its nuclear weapons. 1

History lesson (from a Romanian analyst) 1

The role of paratroopers in Russian military doctrine 1

Since WWII there were only three cases when Russian paratroopers were actually dropped on the enemy from the air: Hungary 1956, Czechoslovakia 1968, Ukraine 2022. Ergo, paratroopers act as paratroopers only when they don't expect resistance from another regular army

Paratroopers were supposed to take control of the main cities and logistical clusters, so the occupation of the country by the army would go smoothly. But Ukrainian army opened fire and they failed. And after that initial failure the entire plan was broken

Putin's Blitzkrieg failed because it wasn't a Blitzkrieg. Blitzkrieg is a war operation against an enemy who fights. But Russia launched a special operation expecting Ukrainians to surrender. That's why they sent forward their glorified riot police. Of course, they were beaten TLDR: They're used more as ""riot police"" for intimidation/psyop than spec ops

Civilian Resistor Advice

Urban warfare tips from a former Marine 1

Stay out of the street. Stay out of street. For the love of God, stay out of the street. The worst place to be in an urban warfare environment is to be outside. Doors are called ‚Äúthe fatal funnel.‚Äù It is human nature to try and enter through a door. Aim all your weapons at the door to maximize the number of kills. Block the door from the inside with anything you can, furniture, chairs, booby-traps (explosives. The idea is to make the invaders think the door isn‚Äôt blocked. That way when they try to enter they remain exposed for the longest amount of time possible. Stairways are another good killing zone. Block stairways with any obstacles you can to slow down invaders. if you throw grenades downstairs, have your magazine fully topped off and ready. The invaders will most likely run up the stairs to run past the grenade blast. You‚Äôll need all the ammo you have to gun as many down as possible. When possible, cut small holes in the floor into the rooms below to fire into. People breaching rooms will look for threats directly in front of them and usually don‚Äôt look above or below until last. Don‚Äôt sling your weapon around your body. If things go hand-to-hand it will hinder you. Have a knife, spade, or club close by and readily available. If you have to fight hand-to-hand it‚Äôs much more handy than a rifle. Never fire from the same window twice. Never stick the muzzle of your rifle outside of a window. Don‚Äôt expose it. Shoot from deep inside the room out of the window. It will help hide the muzzle flash and reduce the noise making it hard to tell where it came from. If you wound an enemy, don‚Äôt kill him. Let his friends come to help him. Moving a wounding a soldier means it will take 4 men out of the fight to carry him away. That‚Äôs four less rifles firing at you. Shoot the men trying to evacuate the wounded soldier. It will demoralize them and take even more men out of the fight to evacuate him. Keep as many carbohydrates on you and remember to eat and hydrate. Urban warfare is incredibly intensive. Keep moving. Never stay in one spot very long. One very accurately placed shot can hold up a lot of people for a very long time. You don‚Äôt have to be a sniper. You just have to convince them there is one in the area. Utilize the sewers in subways to move whenever possible. Whenever possible, try to let other friendlies know where you are at to avoid friendly fire. It‚Äôs very easy to start shooting at each other in an urban environment. It may be consuming, but take the tracers out of your ammunition supply and refrain from using them. have one magazine of all tracer rounds. Use this magazine only when you need to let everyone else (friends know where an enemy is located at. (Across the street, in a park, which window. After using it run like hell and get away from where you just were. Ammunition goes fast. Conserve what you have. 10 men firing from several different buildings can appear to be a small army and stop a lot of people. Rip down street signs, deface building names, and do anything to strip the identity of where you are at. This will add confusion to an invading force. Evacuate your wounded in a timely manner possible. if the enemy suddenly pulls back, GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE AREA. It doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre winning. It means they are going to call and heavy artillery or an air strike on your position. if you are going to lose an area, poison common water supplies. Most likely an enemy will try to refill their supplies at the closest source. Cluster your booby traps in close proximity to create paranoia. Always keep on the move. Never stay in the same place for long.

CaddyWiper does not share any significant code similarity with #HermeticWiper, #IsaacWiper or any other malware known to us. The sample we analyzed was not digitally signed.

Similarly to HermeticWiper deployments, we observed CaddyWiper being deployed via GPO, indicating the attackers had prior control of the target's network beforehand.

Putin considers the retreat in #UkraineRussiaWar as his death sentence. 1

Just off the phone with an officer from Ukraine's military intelligence service (GUR). Someone I've known now for four years who's often rolled his eyes at official Ukrainian government pronouncements. A few observations/comments: 1

He also confirmed the majority of Ukraine's Air Force is still in tact, on Day 12, including fixed wing and rotary aircraft. I asked how many operational Bayraktar TB2 drones Ukraine has in its arsenal. He laughed. ""OK, Michael, can I just say: 'It's enough.'""

Zelensky: ""While Russians are to blame for the killings, responsibility is shared by those who for 13 days in their Western offices haven‚Äôt been able to approve an obviously necessary decision, who didn‚Äôt save our cities from these bombs and missiles ‚Äì although they can."" 1

1/14 Whether Russians actually support the hideous war that Putin has waged against Ukraine is a matter of utmost political importance. The answer to this question will largely define Russia‚Äôs place in the history of the 21st century. 1

Throughout the history of ACF‚Äôs polling department, we have never observed such dynamics of public opinion shifts. It took a few days of war to bring about radical mood changes among Russians.

It's a different, safer kind of reactor. However, a meltdown would still not be good at all.

Nuclear physicist here: there's a lot to be worried about, but one thing you SHOULDN'T worry about, is Russia bombing Ukrainian nuclear power plants. It's literally, physically impossible to make those explode. 1 Some clarification: when I say ""can't explode"", I mean that it can't explode like a nuke (because no reactor can do that), and can't explode like Chernobyl (because it's a different technology, inherently safer - and the safety is in the physics itself, can't be switched off).

More than 5,000 U.S. troops deployed to Poland are still more than 5 miles from the Ukrainian border in assembly areas: senior U.S. defense official. U.S. troops have so far helped sporadically with American evacuees, but most leaving Ukraine are ""doing it on their own"" 1

No update on the length of the deployment, per official. 1

We're seeing a lot of images of cluster munitions being used in Ukraine, so there's a few things I want to highlight to assist with reporting of the incidents. There's two types of rockets, fired by BM-27 and BM-30 multiple rocket launchers. 1 2

In a particularly egregious incident, a kindergarten in Okhtyrka appears to have been impacted by a cluster munition, with the cargo warhead landing about 200 metres away. 1

Ukraine went into talks demanding an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of all Russian forces from Ukraine. 1

Russia calls in Canadian envoy, complains over protests outside its embassy 1

Drive-by-molotov 1

There's a lot going on in this video. First, an APC being pulled by a tractor is hilarious. But that tractor has a ""Z"" on it indicating it's Russian. So, the Russian's ran out of gas, stole a farmer's tractors, are trying to tow their vehicle back to base or somewhere and they got hit 1 2

‚ÄòThis war was not provoked. It was chosen by someone right now that is sitting in the bunker. We know what happened to the person who sat in the bunker in Berlin, in May, 1945,‚Äô said Ukraine‚Äôs U.N. envoy Sirgiy Kyslytsya 1

""if he wants to kill himself, he doesn't need to use nuclear arsenal.""

According to @TheTimes, 400+ Russian mercenaries from the Wagner Group flew in from Africa to #Kyiv with orders from the #Kremlin to assassinate #Ukraine President #Zelensky and his government, laying groundwork for Moscow to take control. 1

Russia's foreign ministry said those supplying lethal weapons to #Ukraine would bear responsibility if they are used during Moscow's ongoing invasion. 1

EU accepts to integrate Ukraine into its electricity network. Ukraine was supposed to join the EU electric grid in 2023, synchronizing with it instead of the Russian and Belarusian ones. The Ukrainian electric grid will synchronize with the European one in a few weeks. 1

Foreigners willing to join üá∫üá¶Ukraine‚Äôs International Legion now require no visa or something. Zelensky has signed a decree. 1

One brave Canadian combat medic travelled to Poland and is currently at the border. He is looking to get permission to travel back and forth between the two countries so that he can assist the injured and provide critical care. Pride of Canada 1

The Panzerfaust 3 is a man-portable rocket-propelled grenade that can penetrate 900 mm. (35 inches) of steel armor or 700 mm. of explosive reactive armor and destroy tanks such as the Soviet T-72 and T-80.

Okay, this is getting ridiculous. The Russian forces have abandoned another two T-72 tanks. 1

""The US has solid intelligence that Putin is frustrated and expressing unusual bursts of anger at people in his inner circle over the state of the military campaign so far and the worldwide condemnation of his actions,"" according to 2 current US officials. 1 2

Cyber

The details of the cyber attack I mentioned at the border is now public. Russia took out #Ukranie border control data processing with a wiper virus. It's downright cruel causing massive delays in evacuating & human suffering at the border, it's #CyberWarfare 1

LockBit Ransomware Group confirms they are apolitical (not making the same mistake as Conti) 1

Russia is intentionally re-routing and sniffing massive amounts of internet traffic from Ukraine. Calls, sms, possible geolocations: probably used for military targeting. It‚Äôs called: BGP Hijacking 1

As rapporteur on Europe‚Äôs new cyber security legislation NIS2, I‚Äôve put forward an amendment to demand every EU member state to introduce safe routing protocols (RPKI for example) so that these BGP Hijacks are no longer possible. Now everyone understands why

""Open-source intelligence is bringing in a new era of transparency and accountability to these world events, and that's not lost on global leaders,"" said @Will4Planet. Watch for more: 1

The Kremlin‚Äôs propaganda machine is running at full throttle 1

Russia is not conducting a war, Mr Putin‚Äôs flacks insist, but a nearly bloodless military operation to free its Ukrainian brothers from the vile West and its Nazi proxies in Ukraine.

Unprepared for the scale of the war or its consequences, many Russians, especially middle-class and educated ones, are horrified. Despite the risk of being arrested or beaten with truncheons, anti-war protesters have massed and marched in several Russian cities. In the past five days, about 4,000 people have been detained, though most are swiftly released. Anonymous, an international hacking group, has joined the fray. It has launched denial-of-service attacks on Russian state media and posted a message on many of them: ‚ÄúDear citizens. We call on you to stop this madness. Don‚Äôt send your sons and husbands to die. It is time to act‚Äìcome out on the streets!‚Äù

Ukrainian civilians got an abandoned Russian BTR-82A working and took it for a drive. 1
