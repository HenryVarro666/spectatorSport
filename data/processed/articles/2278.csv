0,60285e67-7cad-4f54-bd90-99c55ea500aa,[],,"Mr. President,

I am grateful for your leadership in this main policymaking and representative organ of the United Nations.

You have chosen the word “Hope” as a motto for your Presidency. The same feeling currently dominates the mindsets of Ukrainians and people around the globe. Hope for peace. Hope for common sense to prevail. Hope for diplomacy to ease tensions.

However, today we need much more than hope. We need swift, concrete and resolute actions. A new type of action by the UN and international community which is relevant to the level of threat we all, not just Ukraine, face today because of Russia’s aggressive course.

The people of Ukraine need these actions by Ukraine’s strategic partners and international community. We are at a critical juncture in world history and our actions today define it for decades to come. We all read history books. We all watched movies about the mistakes of politicians in the runup to 1914 and 1939. About the feats of our grandparents and a catastrophic price at which a revanchist evil in Europe was defeated.

There is no more important task today than to not repeat the mistakes of the past. I do believe in the power of the free world and our joint ability to avert a new devastating catastrophe in Europe that no nation will be able to sit out. This is why today I address you on behalf of over 40 millions of Ukrainians who only wish to live in peace and prosperity. Not in fear, intimidation, not under Russian fire, bombs and shelling.

We are currently at the middle of the largest security crisis in Europe since the Second World War. This crisis was created and is being escalated by one side unilaterally, by the Russian Federation. Russia’s accusations of Ukraine are absurd. Ukraine has never threatened or attacked anyone. Ukraine has never planned and does not plan any such action. Ukraine has never planned and does not plan any military offensive in the Donbas. Neither any provocations or acts of sabotage. It is ultimately absurd to suggest that Ukraine could have prepared for anything like this and waited for months until Russia amassed an enormous military force along our borders to proceed with such alleged plans. This absurdity defies basic logic.

Not less absurd are accusations of Ukraine escalating by acquiring defensive weapons from its partners. The only, I want to stress it, the only reason for Ukraine to boost its defenses is Russia’s ongoing and planned military and political actions. Russia’s actions and statements are outrageous, horrific and go far beyond threatening Ukraine.

In fact, in his address this week Russian president Vladmir Putin overtly denied Ukraine’s right to exist. Anyone who might think I exaggerate as the Ukrainian Foreign Minister should just watch this horrifying speech. It is with a heavy heart that we all need to admit the grim reality of a new aggressive and revanchist rule rising over Europe.

This is the fourth time that the General Assembly debates the situation in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine. However, this is the first time we debate the situation in the new reality created by the illegal recognition of two territories of Ukraine by Russia. And the backdrop of our discussion today is much more dangerous as Russia attacked the very fundamental principles of international peace and security, the pillars of the United Nations and, as I mentioned, the very existence of the Ukrainian state, the founding member of the United Nations.

A Ukrainian state that signed the UN Charter in San Francisco in 1945 as a founding member and made the principle enshrined in Article 2 of the Charter a cornerstone of its foreign policy. A state that voluntarily gave up its nuclear arsenal under the security assurances of nuclear powers. A state that has endured years of assault by one of these powers, a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.

Two days ago, on February 21st, the Russian President recognized “independence” of the temporarily occupied parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine and ordered the deployment of the Russian Armed Forces in these areas. This is an affront attack on the United Nations and core principles of international law, an ultimate blow to years of peace process and Russia’s unilateral withdrawal from the Minsk agreements.

What is happening right now in Eastern Ukraine, where Russian tanks are rolling in, and along the Ukrainian borders, where Russian forces are amassed in enormous quantities, must be a concern for everyone, for all of you.

I warn every nation in this distinguished chamber: no one will be able to sit out this crisis if Putin decides that he can move forward with his aggression against Ukraine. Your governments and your people will face painful consequences together with our government and our people. This is why we need to use this last chance for action and stop Russia where it is. It is clear that President Putin will not stop by himself.

Distinguished representatives,

The beginning of a large-scale war in Ukraine will be the end of the world order as we know it. If Russia does not get a severe, swift and decisive response now, this will mean a total bankruptcy of the international security system and international institutions which are tasked with maintaining the global security order. This is a grim scenario which will throw us back to the darkest times of the 20th century. Russia will not stop at Ukraine. If a permanent member of the UN Security Council succeeds in breaking literally all rules, other actors will be inspired by him and follow his pattern. What he tries to do now is to prove that the United Nations are weak, indecisive and unable to defend their core principles, that rules do not apply to him, to Russia, to Putin.

What role for the UN does Russia see? A new League of Nations. We must deny Russia what it wants. I graduated from the university with a degree in international law and a strong belief in multilateralism. After many years of practicing diplomacy, I still do believe in both: rules containing aggression and the power of our collective and firm action. If the United Nations makes a pivot right now to become a strong and proactive player, which is not afraid of resolute actions and using all of its might and powers, I am confident that Russia will stop.

In this context, I welcome yesterday’s statement by the United Nations Secretary General which is truly different in tone. We need decisive actions of the same kind to follow these right words.

Russia shows signs of readiness to further escalate its aggression against Ukraine and we have limited time to stop, deter and contain it. Every hour of inaction now is a threat to the lives of Ukrainians, not only military but also civilians, including women and children. This is an escalating threat to our collective global security and to our freedom.

Ukraine expects decisive, immediate and proportional actions by the international community. The United Nations is the organization that has to demonstrate leadership. Not just condemnations. Concrete actions to stop the Russian machine of war without stepping into a bloody conflict with many thousands of casualties, devastation and suffering. I do not want this. Ukraine does not want this. The world does not want this. We need your help right now to stop Russia from proceeding with aggressive plans.

Ukraine believes in diplomacy. We see no alternative to peaceful solutions by political and diplomatic means. There is still an opportunity for diplomacy to say its word. Even as Russia continues its escalation and provocations. For months Russia pretended to pursue diplomacy while bringing more and more troops to our borders and in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine. Now this number stands at least at 150 thousand.

Under the OSCE Vienna Document on Confidence and Security-Building Measures such actions fall under the qualification of “unusual military activities” that would require explanation. However, Russia has persistently refused to provide it. Instead, it proceeded with threats.

Russia has literally stuffed the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov with at least 46 military vessels. It routinely closes large parts of the seas under the pretext of holding naval exercises. In practice, it amounts almost to a blockade of Ukrainian seaports. This is already an attack on the global freedom of navigation, one of the sacred principles of international law.

Russia’s propaganda machine is in full swing. It desperately tries to create a pretext for further aggression against Ukraine.

We resolutely reject all Russian insinuations about any alleged Ukrainian offensive military operations in the Donbas. We do not hold or plan any such actions.

We remain committed to political and diplomatic settlement and together with our partners we maximize efforts to reduce tensions and keep the situation in line with diplomatic dialogue.

For now, we see that Russian occupation forces have already significantly increased shelling of Ukrainian territory and civilian infrastructure. Artillery fire at the contact line in the Donbas from the occupied territory hit a kindergarten in a town called Stanytsia Luhanska and a school in Vrubivka, among the latest terrible examples.

Recognition of the so-called “republics” has no legal implications. It merely confirms Russia’s own involvement as a party to the armed conflict in Donbas, which Russia vehemently denied all these years.

The situation in the occupied Donbas has already been terrible for years, with residents living in the atmosphere of fear, lawlessness and insecurity.

The infamous secret prison called “Izolyatsia” in the occupied Donetsk remains inaccessible for human rights and humanitarian missions. It continues to function as a literal concentration camp. In Europe, in the 21st century. Hundreds of people have passed through this camp and were subjected to heavy forced labour, humiliation, tortures. Cases of extrajudicial killings have been reported too.

Russia continues to block the release of the illegally detained persons. In September 2021 the President of Ukraine handed over to the Secretary General the list of more than a hundred of Ukrainians from Donbas and Crimea who had been unlawfully detained, sentenced or even transferred from the occupied territories to the Russian Federation. We reiterate our call on the Secretary-General to provide good offices and facilitate their immediate release. And I appreciate the readiness of the Secretary General to do so.

Mr. President,

Today, Ukraine defends not only global security, but also freedom, democracy and fundamental principles of international law. Peaceful life and the future of millions of people in Europe and around the globe rely on the rules that Russia tries to destroy. Diplomacy and international fora must prevail and stop Russian aggression.

Since 2014, the General Assembly has already adopted eleven resolutions reaffirming its commitment to Ukraine’s territorial integrity and condemning the temporary occupation of Ukraine’s territories by Russia.

The General Assembly has not and will not accept the Russian mantra that “the case of Crimea is closed”. The occupying power persists in destroying the identity of Ukrainians and the indigenous people of the peninsula — the Crimean Tatars. Since 2014 more than 64,000 Ukrainian citizens have had to leave Crimea and move to mainland Ukraine due to fear, persecution for political and human rights activism, discrimination on ethnic and religious grounds. Political persecutions continue unabated.

Among many others, Mr. Nariman Dzhelyalov, Deputy Head of the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar people, participant of the International Crimea Platform Summit, remains behind bars. He is one of more than 100 political prisoners of the Kremlin.

On February 16th, a court in Simferopol sentenced journalist Vladyslav Yesypenko on trumped-up charges to six years in prison. He is one of fourteen Ukrainian journalists kept by Russians in prison. Russia may continue to pretend it doesn’t violate any international norms and principles. Yet, reports by the UN Secretary-General, OHCHR, OSCE, their missions, as well as the report of the ICC Prosecutor, all testify to the contrary.

If Russia doesn’t agree with all the mentioned resolutions and reports it should simply provide access to Crimea to the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine and the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission. The access of international organizations to the occupied territories is critical. Ukraine guarantees such access throughout the government-controlled territory and continues to demand from the Russian side to do the same in the occupied territories.

Esteemed members of the General Assembly,

The whole world witnesses today that Russia turns to threatening and blackmailing the global community to “close the Crimea case”. It is in fact one of the points in the long-list of its recent so-called “security demands”.

Ukraine continues efforts to achieve de-occupation of Crimea by peaceful means.

The Crimea Platform is a tool designed exactly for that end. We are truly thankful to all the countries supporting the International Crimea Platform. Your active involvement in the Platform is a sound foundation for our future success. We are open to new members and I call on you to join the Crimea Platform. Be it states or international organizations, you are welcome. We expect the UN will find proper modalities to engage with this initiative, established on the principles of the UN Charter.

Mr.President, dear colleagues,

Ukraine made a historic contribution to global security. In 1994 we denuclearized, giving up the world's third largest nuclear arsenal. We have no plans to regain nuclear weapons. Today, we expect the world to reciprocally ensure our security with relevant scale and resoluteness of actions in the face of a historic level of threat. This is the reason why Ukraine requested urgent consultations under article 6 of the Budapest memorandum.

The world owes Ukraine its security.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy initiated a new format of negotiations to settle the security crisis created by Russia. Five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Ukraine, Germany and Turkey. This is the format that we are trying to convene.

I reaffirm that Ukraine proposed some years ago to deploy a UN peacekeeping mission to Ukraine. Until now, the UNSC has failed to take necessary decisions.

Ukraine proposes to combine stark sanctions policy and strengthening of Ukraine together with keeping diplomatic channels open to persuade Russia to de-escalate and prioritize diplomacy.

We urge member states to use all available means to protect Ukraine and deter Russia. Whatever action you can take is appreciated. We are grateful for the actions already taken by many of you.

We expect the international community to do its best to put out the fire in the center of Europe, which is about to flare up.

The Russian security crisis must end with Russia returning to the path of diplomacy.

We call on all States and international organizations not to recognize any alteration of the status of the certain areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine and to refrain from any action or dealing that might be interpreted as recognizing any such altered status.

The absence of proper reaction or a neutral stance will only contribute to further escalation and sufferings. And it will not be limited to Ukraine’s border and territory.

On the contrary, active diplomacy, strong political messaging, tough economic sanctions and strengthening Ukraine can still force Moscow to abandon aggressive plans. Swift and resolute actions by the United Nations can reclaim the organization’s leading role at this historic and dark moment.

Russia must withdraw its forces from the sovereign territory of Ukraine. Russia must stop destabilizing the international security situation. We, Ukrainians, want peace. And we want to resolve all issues through diplomacy. We stand ready for all possible scenarios and ready to protect our land and our people if Russia further attacks. Ukraine will not hesitate to exercise its inherent right of self-defense as outlined in article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations in response to the armed attacks of the Russian Federation.

These days we have probably the last window of opportunity to do what Russia does not expect the United Nations and its member states to do. Demonstrate unprecedented ability and readiness to act in order to stop aggression. No matter what relations you develop among each other, it is your ultimate duty to defend the UN Charter.

I thank you!",https://www.kmu.gov.ua/en/news/vistup-ministra-zakordonnih-sprav-ukrayini-dmitra-kuleba-na-debatah-generalnoyi-asambleyi-oon-situaciya-na-timchasovo-okupovanih-teritoriyah-ukrayini-23022022

WASHINGTON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told senior European officials on Friday that China respects countries' sovereignty, including Ukraine's, but that Russia's concerns about NATO's eastward expansion should be properly addressed.

After weeks of warnings from Western leaders, Russian President Vladimir Putin unleashed an invasion of Ukraine from the north, east and south on Thursday that was the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two.

Weeks before the invasion, China and Russia announced a strategic partnership, and so far Beijing has stayed clear of condemning Moscow's actions. read more

Wang said the current situation in Ukraine was not something Beijing wished to see and that it would welcome direct dialogue between Russia and Ukraine as soon as possible.

""China firmly advocates respecting and safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries,"" Wang said, according to a statement from China's Foreign Ministry. ""This equally applies to the Ukraine issue.""

Wang held separate calls with British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, European Union foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell and a French presidential adviser.

""Given five consecutive rounds of NATO's eastward expansion, Russia's legitimate security demands should be taken seriously and properly addressed,"" Wang said, according to the statement.

The U.N. Security Council was expected to vote on Friday on a resolution condemning Moscow's invasion.

Russia is expected to veto the measure, and Wang said China historically had opposed Council resolutions that applied sanctions or the use of force. He said the Council should seek to ease tensions, ""not fuel them.""

U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday said any country that backed Russia's onslaught in Ukraine would be ""stained by association,"" and Washington has said Chinese firms will face consequences if they seek to help Moscow evade export controls imposed by Western countries. read more

Listing out five points in the to-do list, Kuleba said that Russia should be fully isolated by all means and devastating sanctions should be imposed. The foreign minister demanded weapons, financial and humanitarian assistance for Ukraine.

""To do list:

1. Devastating sanctions on Russia NOW, including SWIFT

With the commencement of a military operation, Russia is going all guns out to launch attacks on Ukraine with the West severely condemning it. Around 200,000 Russian troops have been massed along the borders of Ukraine.

""I have made the decision of a military operation,"" Russian President Vladimir Putin said in a televised address in Moscow on Thursday.

“Russia cannot feel safe, develop, and exist with a constant threat emanating from the territory of modern Ukraine. All responsibility for bloodshed will be on the conscience of the ruling regime in Ukraine,” he added but pointed out that his plans did not include occupying Ukrainian territories.

Shortly after Putin's announcement, Russian forces fired missiles at several Ukrainian cities and landed troops on its South Coast.

Ukraine's foreign minister Kuleba also said on Thursday that his country will defend itself and emerge victoriously. ""The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now,"" he said in a tweet put out earlier in the day.

Meanwhile, European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen denounced Russia's military operations and expressed solidarity with the people of Ukraine.

""In these dark hours, our thoughts are with Ukraine and the innocent women, men and children as they face this unprovoked attack and fear for their lives,"" Leyen told AFP and vowed that Moscow will be held accountable.

Ukraine's foreign minister told the United Nations on Wednesday that a full-blown war with Russia would spell the ""end of the world order.""

""The beginning of a large-scale war in Ukraine will be the end of the world order as we know it,"" Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told the UN General Assembly in New York and later shared on Ukraine's government website.

He added: ""If Russia does not get a severe, swift and decisive response now, this will mean a total bankruptcy of the international security system and international institutions which are tasked with maintaining the global security order.""

Kuleba urged both the UN and the international community at-large to impose ""swift, concrete, and resolute actions"" as a response to the latest Russian aggression.

Russia on Monday recognized two regions in eastern Ukraine governed by Kremlin-backed separatists as independent states, shortly before President Vladimir Putin ordered troops across his borders and into Ukraine.

The move has triggered expansive sanctions from the US, UK, European Union, and other nations, targeting banks, Russian lawmakers and elites, and the country's finances.

Kuleba said the world is at a ""critical juncture"" in its history, and called the ongoing situation Europe's ""largest security crisis"" since World War II.

He said the UN needs to take ""concrete actions to stop the Russian machine of war"" before a ""bloody"" conflict ensues.

President Joe Biden has previously said that US troops won't send to Ukraine — which is not a NATO ally — but that the US and its allies will ""defend every inch of NATO territory.""

Earlier on Wednesday, Kuleba wrote on Twitter that countries should impose more sanctions on Russia and Putin.

4,60285e67-7cad-4f54-bd90-99c55ea500aa,[],,"AFP: China has consistently refrained from condemning Russia’s aggression toward Ukraine. Now that President Putin has begun an invasion. Will China finally condemn Russia’s actions?

Hua Chunying: China is closely monitoring the latest developments. We call on all sides to exercise restraint and prevent the situation from getting out of control.

Global Times: According to reports, Beijing-based Qi An Pangu lab released a report on February 23. It found that Equation, the hacking group under the US National Security Agency (NSA), has been creating a top-of-the-line backdoor and conducting a decade-long cyber attack operation called “Telescreen” (Bvp47) against 45 countries and regions, including China, Russia, Japan, the ROK, India, the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Australia, Thailand, Egypt and Brazil. The operation covers such industries as communications, universities, research institutions, economic and military sectors. Some of the attacks even use Japan as a springboard to attack other countries. As we understand, this is the first time that a Chinese cybersecurity lab has publicly exposed the complete chain of technical evidence about the cyber attack launched by the NSA. Do you have any comment?

Hua Chunying: We noted relevant news reports and the technical report. We express grave concern over the irresponsible, malicious cyber activities exposed by the report and strongly urge the US to offer an explanation and immediately stop such activities. China will take necessary measures to uphold China’s cybersecurity and interests.

According to the report, Equation, a hacking group affiliated with the NSA, has conducted cyber attacks against Chinese communications, scientific research departments and economic sectors for more than a decade. Previously, Chinese cybersecurity company 360 also released a report to expose that APT-C-39, a cyber attack organization of the US government, has launched large-scale attacks on China, which could cause serious leak of massive personal information and data, business secrets and intellectual property and undermine the security of China’s critical infrastructure. It is worth noticing that relevant attacks date back to as early as 2005, and last until 2015 and beyond. We cannot help but ask whether the US is sincere about implementing the consensus on cybersecurity reached with China in 2015.

The US intelligence law allows the US government to carry out massive and indiscriminate information and data theft including on its allies. Edward Snowden and Wikileaks have exposed how the US government engaged in large-scale surveillance and theft of secrets all around the world. The revelations from this report show that besides China and other major developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America, the US doesn’t even spare its allies and partners, and its cyber attacks even cover its European allies, its fellow members of the Quad and the Five Eyes. At present, the US is actively seeking bilateral and multilateral cybersecurity cooperation globally in the name of helping other countries to improve capability. One cannot help but wonder what is its real intention.

Cyberspace is a shared homeland for humanity and cybersecurity is a common challenge faced by all countries. We hope the US will take a responsible attitude and uphold peace and security in cyberspace through dialogue and cooperation with all parties.

Bloomberg: Can you say then China considers Russia’s action an invasion? Is it an invasion? Is it a violation of the UN Charter?

Hua Chunying: We have stated China’s principled position on the Ukraine issue. There is a complex historical background and context on this issue. The current situation is the result of the interplay of various factors.

We noted that today Russia announced its launch of a special military operation in eastern Ukraine. Russia’s defense ministry said that its armed forces will not conduct missile, air or artillery strikes on cities. China is closely monitoring the latest developments and calls on all sides to exercise restraint and prevent the situation from getting out of control.

I would like to stress once again China’s consistent position. We should pursue common, cooperative and sustainable security for all countries. The legitimate security concerns of all sides should be respected and resolved. We hope all sides will keep the door to peace open and continue to work for deescalation through dialogue, consultation and negotiation and prevent further escalation.

CCTV: Speaking on the Ukraine issue, US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said that China should respect the principle of state sovereignty and territorial integrity and that China has an obligation to urge Russia to “back down”. He also said the growing relationship between China and Russia is concerning. The two sides’ joint statement shows that China is trying to use its influence on Russia to create a world order both want. Do you have any comment?

Hua Chunying: I noted the remarks by the US State Department spokesperson.

First, when it comes to respect for state sovereignty and territorial integrity, I’m afraid the US is in no position to tell China off. The Chinese people have deep understanding and strong feelings about state sovereignty and territorial integrity through first-hand experience. Recent history saw China invaded by the Eight-Power Allied Forces and other colonialist powers, which left behind indelible poignant memories of national humiliation. Just a little more than 20 years ago, the Chinese embassy in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was hit by NATO bombing, which killed three Chinese journalists and injured many more. NATO still owes the Chinese people a debt of blood. Even today, China still faces a realistic threat from the US flanked by its several allies as they wantonly and grossly meddle in China’s domestic affairs and undermine China’s sovereignty and security on issues including Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Taiwan. China remains the only permanent member of the Security Council that has yet to realize complete national reunification. It is because of all these that China consistently and firmly uphold the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and basic norms governing international relations, firmly safeguard its sovereignty, security and territorial integrity, and firmly defend international equity and justice.

If we look at the US, during its nearly 250 years of history, there were only 20 years when it was not conducting military operations overseas. The pretexts it used can be democracy or human rights or simply a test tube of laundry powder or even fake news. Such a country’s understanding of respect for state sovereignty and territorial integrity is definitely different from ours. The international community can see this very clearly.

The US side suggests that Russia acted with complicit support from China. I don’t believe Russia would be too pleased to hear that. Russia is a permanent member of the UN Security Council and an independent major power. It is fully capable of formulating and implementing its diplomatic strategy independently based on its judgement and national interests.

I must also stress that China-Russia relations are based on the foundation of non-alliance, non-confrontation and non-targeting of any third party. This differs fundamentally and essentially from the practice of the US, which is, ganging up to form small cliques and pursuing bloc politics to create confrontation and division based on ideology. China has no interest in the friend-or-foe dichotomous Cold War thinking and the patchwork of so-called allies and small cliques and has no intention to follow such a path.

As to the China-Russia joint statement, I suggest the US side give it some further study. China and Russia aim to strengthen strategic communication and coordination, firmly uphold the international system with the UN’s central coordinating role in international affairs, and firmly safeguard the international order based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and international law. This shows exactly that China and Russia are acting responsibly and positively maintaining international strategic security and stability.

ITV News: Despite the scenes that we have seen from Ukraine this morning, you seem to suggest that peace is still possible. Does President Xi plan to phone his close friend President Putin and appeal for some calm and potential diplomatic solution?

Hua Chunying: The door to peace should never be shut casually. Even with the latest developments in Ukraine, we still call on all sides concerned to exercise restraint and take constructive steps to ease the situation as soon as possible and prevent the situation from getting out of control.

China consistently holds that all sides should respect and take seriously each other’s legitimate security concerns and strive to resolve regional hotspot issues peacefully through negotiation and consultation. Yesterday I shared the efforts made by China to promote a peaceful settlement of the Ukraine issue. President Xi Jinping, during a phone call with French President Macron, called on all sides to adhere to the direction of political resolution, assume their responsibility and work for peace. State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi also stressed the importance of this.

CCTV: ROK Foreign Minister Chung Eui-yong reportedly expressed deep concerns over Japan’s move to have a group of gold mines on Sado Island listed as a world heritage site in a meeting with UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay in Paris on February 22, stressing that the island is linked to the forced labor of Koreans. Director-General Azoulay said UNESCO fully understood Seoul’s concerns and will continue to follow how Japan honors its pledge made in a previous bid. Does China have any comment?

Hua Chunying: China’s position on Japan’s forced recruitment of laborers is consistent and clear. We fully understand and support the ROK’s attitude. Forced recruitment and enslavement of laborers is a grave crime committed by the Japanese militarism during its overseas aggression and colonial rule. It shall not be denied or whitewashed in any way. In a similar bid previously, Japan admitted that there was forced labor at some of the sites involving workers from China, the Korean Peninsula and other Asian countries, and promised to set up an information center to display historical records and honor the victims, but it never fulfilled the promise. Now again ignoring the painful memories of its neighbors, Japan is trying to make a similar new bid. Naturally other sides will question its true intention.

Japan should face up to and reflect upon history, adopt an honest and responsible attitude and take concrete actions to properly handle issues left over from history, lest it should further lose the trust of its Asian neighbors and the international community.

AFP: During yesterday’s press conference, the Foreign Ministry criticized the United States for raising tensions and creating panic. Do the events of the last 24 hours show that Americans’ warnings are justified? And should China have heeded such warnings and asked its citizens to leave Ukraine?

Hua Chunying: The US has been increasing tensions and hyping up war for some time. Do you know how many arms and ammunition the US has sent to Ukraine?

If all parties had done more to promote peace, showed more respect and accommodation for each other’s security concerns, and reasonably and properly resolved the issue to enable a soft landing, what the situation would have been today? The US signaled that Russia would launch large-scale invasion on February 16, and Russia dismissed that as disinformation. Would you like to see the false alarm of the US become a reality, or to see the problems nipped in the bud and not develop to the current point with true care for the Ukrainian people and regional peace and security?

From the very beginning, China has taken a responsible attitude and persuaded all parties not to escalate tensions or incite war. I think what China is doing is very responsible. Those who follow the US’ lead in fanning up flames and then shifting the blame onto others are truly irresponsible. As the culprit, the person who started the fire should think about how to put it out as soon as possible.

CGTN: According to reports, Chinese students in the US have reported being subjected to harassment and interrogation for extended periods of time, and even deportation in some cases. They said that the US side rudely questioned whether they are CPC members, restricted their personal freedom for long periods of time, and refused their requests to contact families and local Chinese embassy and consulates. Do you have any comment on that?

Hua Chunying: China deplores and rejects the US’ vile act of continuous interrogation, harassment and repatriation of Chinese students and discrimination against CPC members. The Chinese side lodged stern representations with the US side every time it learned of such incidents.

The discriminatory and malignant practice of the US gravely violates the basic human rights, fundamental freedoms and lawful rights and interests of Chinese citizens pursuing studies in the US and severely undermines the normal people-to-people, cultural and educational cooperation between the two countries. And yet the US styles itself as a “human rights defender” and a “beacon of freedom”. Nothing could be more ironic. Such actions run counter to its statements that “the US welcomes Chinese students” and “we should encourage the younger generation to interact more and be more exposed to each other’s culture”. They also run counter to the shared aspiration of the Chinese and American people for friendly exchanges. The frequent acts by the US aimed at suppressing Chinese students reflect its sinister psyche and are symptoms of its loss of confidence. They will not make the US safer or stronger, but will only hurt its interests, image and reputation.

We urge the US to immediately rectify its mistakes, stop creating ideological confrontation, or even attempt to use it as a pretext to suppress and harass Chinese students and harm the legitimate and lawful rights and interests of the Chinese personnel concerned.

Bloomberg: A question on oil prices. Given the oil prices are rising amid the Ukraine crisis, will China be on board with releasing strategic oil reserves in sync with the United States to quell the gains?

Hua Chunying: We believe that under the current circumstances, all parties should exercise restraint and ease tensions through dialogue and negotiation. Only when the situation stabilizes can spillover effects of various types be prevented. And I also want to say that the world today is not peaceful and there have been enough problems. Truly responsible countries should take responsible actions to jointly safeguard global energy security, maintain security and stability of the global supply and industry chain, and avoid regional tensions that impact the security and stability of the international energy market.

Beijing Youth Daily: China said earlier this month that this year marks the 50th anniversary of Richard Nixon’s visit to China and the signing of the China-US Shanghai Communiqué. China and the US will hold a series of commemorative activities in the near future. We have noticed that the US government has not made any comment on the 50th anniversary of Richard Nixon’s visit to China. US State Department Spokesperson Ned Price said on February 23 that the US has no plans at the moment for a statement on the 50th anniversary of Nixon’s visit to China. Do you have any comment? Could you give us more details on what commemorative activities China plans to hold?

Hua Chunying: As to whether the US would issue a statement or why they wouldn’t, you should ask the US side.

Yesterday, I reviewed with you at this podium the main content of the Shanghai Communiqué issued by China and the United States during President Nixon’s visit to China 50 years ago. The one-China principle affirmed in the Shanghai Communiqué, as well as the principles of respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-aggression, non-interference in other countries’ internal affairs, equality, mutual benefit and peaceful coexistence, constitute the political foundation for the normalization of China-US relations and the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.

Certain details you are interested in are somehow interesting. It is understandable that the attitude of the US has caused some speculation and associations by correspondents. However, I believe it is all the more necessary and relevant for the US to revisit the spirit and inspiration of the Shanghai Communiqué today when China-US relations are facing difficulties and challenges.

As far as I know, the two sides will hold some commemorative activities together in the near future, and some representatives and guests from both sides will attend. Relevant activities are still being scheduled. If there is any information on the specifics, we will release it in a timely manner.

Hubei Media Group: According to reports, Member of the European Parliament Herve Juvin said that on the crisis between Russia and Ukraine, the US is a fomenter of the conflict and hopes to take advantage of it to control Europe and obstruct European independence on security affairs. He believes that the US wants to sabotage the relations between Russia and the EU and rope the latter in onto the track of confrontation against Russia. Do you have any comment?

Hua Chunying: With regard to the role of the US in the current situation in Ukraine, I noticed that apart from this MEP, some European media have also made their reflections and observations.

Recently the EU, France and Germany have made a lot of efforts through diplomatic mediation in order to ease the tension. The current situation is certainly contrary to Europe’s interests. The European side should indeed think seriously about what is truly conducive to maintaining peace and stability in Europe, and what is the best way to uphold long-term peace and stability in Europe.

AFP: The Russians said they would not attack cities and they announced they were clearly targeting military targets. So is it okay for you to invade another country as long as they are hitting on military targets and not cities? And then you also said that the US has been supplying ammunition to Ukraine. But is it not the right of any sovereign country to buy arms and ammunition wherever it wants in order to protect itself?

Hua Chunying: I’m sure you have noticed that Russia stated that in its special military operation in Ukraine, its armed forces will not conduct any missile of artillery strikes on any Ukrainian city.

As to the definition of “invasion”, it brings us back to how we view the current situation in Ukraine. As we have stated repeatedly, the Ukraine issue has a very complicated historical background and context. The current state of affairs is not what we would hope to see. It’s hoped that all sides will work in concert to give peace a chance and strive to ease the situation as soon as possible through dialogue, consultation and negotiation.

As to the right of sovereign countries to buy arms, I have a question for you. If two people near you are arguing and a fist fight seems to be coming next, what will you do? Hand one of them a gun, a knife or some other sorts of weapon? Or break up the fight with persuasion first and then get to know the whole story leading to the argument and helping them resolve the issue peacefully? It’s as simple as that. Weapons can never solve all problems. This is not the time to pour oil on the flame, but to put our heads together to come up with a way to put out the fire and safeguard peace.

Here is another question. Western media used the word “invasion” for Russia’s operation. When the US took illegal unilateral military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan without the mandate of the UN and caused massive civilian casualties, did you use the word “invasion” or some other word?

Anadolu Agency: But according to Russian Defense Ministry’s statement, Russian army targeted air defenses of Ukraine this morning. So it’s usually considered as the start of an invasion. If this happens, will China see this as an aggression and an attack on a sovereign state?

Hua Chunying: China is closely following the development of the situation. The current situation in Ukraine is not what we wish to see. So we continue to call on all parties to exercise restraint and resolve the issue through dialogue and consultation as soon as possible so as to ease the tension.

Beijing Daily: It is reported that Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen said that the China Initiative is “not the right approach”. The Initiative lowers the threshold of the Department of Justice to investigate and prosecute China-related criminal acts, and applies different standards based on race, ethnicity or family relations. The DOJ is ending the China Initiative, but will continue to prioritize handling and proactively fight back any actions that harm US citizens and institutions, which requires a new set of comprehensive counter measures. Do you have any comment?

Hua Chunying: The so-called China Initiative is the poisonous legacy of the previous administration, and should have been abolished long ago.

Facts have proven that the Initiative is in essence a tool for a handful of anti-China forces in the US to abuse the concept of national security and go all out to contain and suppress China. It exacerbates racial discrimination in the US, severely harms Asian-American groups, and also poisons the atmosphere of China-US mutual trust and cooperation. The Foreign Ministry of China and the Chinese Embassy in the US lodged multiple solemn representations on different levels from the very beginning to urge the US side to stop implementing the Initiative.

The US media have revealed repeatedly that the so-called China Initiative set targets first and carried out investigation accordingly. Such acts, in total disregard of judicial justice, will only result in wrongful convictions. It is reported that over the past two years, most of the so-called China-Related Cases Examples under this initiative did not involve intellectual property or commercial theft. Most of the charges range from fraud to misrepresentation to tax evasion. Nearly 2,000 university scholars across the US signed an open letter to the US Department of Justice in protest of this initiative. More than 20 Asian-American groups in the US sent a joint letter to the US President demanding the end of this Initiative. Not long ago, the United Chinese Americans protested outside the US DOJ demanding the end of China Initiative. A total of 192 Yale professors wrote and signed a letter to the Attorney General pointing out that the strategy has “fundamental flaws”. With all these voices against this initiative, it is clear that the initiative finds no support and will hurt the interests of all.

We urge the US side to stop hyping up the so-called China threat, stop seeing China as an imaginary enemy, stop smearing and suppressing China with fabricated pretexts, and stop disrupting and undermining normal China-US exchange and cooperation in all sectors, to root out the poisonous legacy of the former administration and do more to promote the steady development of China-US relations, and mutual trust and cooperation.

CNBC: China is a trading partner of Ukraine and Russia. On Tuesday, I saw an announcement that due to the overseas market conditions, China may be buying more edible oils. And also we just saw the Customs bureau said China can import wheat from Russia. Given the current situation, does China have any plans to increase or decrease trade with each of these countries?

Hua Chunying: China will continue to carry out normal trade cooperation with Russia and Ukraine in the spirit of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit.

AFP: Has China spoken to the Ukrainian side in the last 24 hours or so since military operations began? Specifically, has China spoken to Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, or does it plan to do so?

Hua Chunying: All parties are very busy now. We are closely following the development of the situation and continue to call on all parties to exercise restraint and commit to easing the tension through dialogue and negotiation as soon as possible to prevent the situation from getting out of control.

Reuters: Has China provided Russia with any military equipment, or does it plan on providing any military or otherwise support for Russia during this conflict?

Hua Chunying: On this issue, there is a fundamental difference between China and the US. When we see the risk of conflict, we won’t do the same as the US, who has offered Ukraine a large amount of military equipment. I believe that as a strong country, Russia doesn’t need China or other countries to provide weapons to it.

AFP: Just earlier, you mentioned the mediation efforts by France and Germany in this dispute. Now these two countries have very clearly condemned Russia’s action. Don’t you think this is proof that negotiating efforts are useless, and the only thing to make Russia move back is the very strong condemnation from the whole international community, including China?

Hua Chunying: For some time, some European countries including France and Germany have conducted mediation. The Ukraine issue is very complex. Dr. Kissinger made some public observations on Ukraine more than seven years ago. He said, if Ukraine is to survive and thrive, it must not be either side’s outpost against the other — it should function as a bridge between the East and the West.

An outsider is clear-minded. All parties of the international community should calmly learn about the historical merits of the evolving Ukraine issue. On this basis, they should work to ease the situation as soon as possible through dialogue and negotiation, prevent the situation from getting out of control and peacefully resolve the issue. Europe should think over what kind of security landscape best meets its interests.

You mentioned condemning Russia. I’m not sure whether the friends of a certain country have done their best to prevent it from going down the wrong path before there was no turning back when it set the fire and fanned the flames. No one wishes to see or stands to benefit from the current situation. We hope all parties can work together, and call on relevant parties to exercise restraint to prevent the situation from further spiraling out of control.

Reuters: You just said we hope for all sides to calm down and prevent escalation. We know China has said this many times. Will China call on Russia to withdraw?

Hua Chunying: We call on all relevant parties concerned to exercise restraint.

AFP: You mentioned the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. I’m quite sure my agency at that time spoke about invasion. So yesterday you mentioned what has happened in Iraq was the US violating the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq. Now how come you are not able to say the same thing about Ukraine? Can you explain to us what’s the difference between the situation in Ukraine and the situation in Iraq? Is there a case of double standard? Is it okay for Russia to invade Ukraine and not okay for the US to invade Iraq?

Hua Chunying: “Double standard” can never be pinned on China because our position is aboveboard. China always believes that all countries’ sovereignty and territorial integrity should be respected, and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter should be jointly upheld. These are our longstanding principles and basic norms governing international relations that should be followed by all countries.

At the same time, China believes that one country’s security cannot be at the expense of others’ security; still less should one country flagrantly undermine others’ sovereign security for his absolute security advantage. All countries’ legitimate security concerns should be respected.

You should know the whole story of Iraq. The then US Secretary of State launched military attacks on Iraq with a vial of detergent and a trumped-up charge and plunged the Iraqi people into grave disasters. This constitutes out-and-out invasion, which is a consensus of the international community.

You must have read President Putin’s remarks. I’m not the Spokesperson for Russian Foreign Ministry, and will not speak for their position. But I suppose, outsiders should uphold objectivity and fairness, and see the complex historical merits as well as their interplay and evolution on the Ukraine issue.

An unbiased mediator should not only see what is happening at the moment but also the whole story. He should not only treat the symptom but also the root cause. That is why China has been calling on all parties concerned to exercise restraint and stay committed to resolving the issue through dialogue and negotiation.

Reuters: Does China believe Ukraine is a sovereign country?

Hua Chunying: Ukraine is for sure a sovereign country. China and Ukraine conduct friendly cooperation on the basis of mutual respect.

Reuters: How many Chinese citizens are currently in Ukraine? And what is the latest instruction that China is planning on giving them?

Hua Chunying: I don’t have the specific number of Chinese citizens in Ukraine at the moment. China’s Embassy in Ukraine has issued a security alert. Given the current situation, we remind Chinese citizens and companies to protect their own safety and prevent accidents and injuries. The Chinese Embassy in Ukraine is also in touch with our students and the Chinese business council in Ukraine, reminds them to keep following information from the embassy, and alerts Chinese citizens in Ukraine not to travel to unstable regions. Besides, the embassy also calls on Chinese citizens in Ukraine to demonstrate Chinese people’s fine tradition of working in solidarity and offering each other help. If anyone is in trouble, we hope others can lend a helping hand and give each other warmth during trying times. The embassy also reminds Chinese citizens not to panic. Anyone in trouble will receive all-out assistance from the Chinese embassy.

Reuters: Did Vladimir Putin tell China that he will invade Ukraine when he visited China a few weeks ago?

Hua Chunying: On February 4, President Putin visited China for the opening ceremony of the Beijing Winter Olympics and held a meeting with President Xi Jinping. The readout has been released, which you may refer to carefully.

As I said just now, Russia is an independent major country. It independently decides and implements its diplomacy and strategy based on its strategic judgement and interests. Russia does not need to get others’ consent before making diplomatic decisions and taking actions.

AFP: Are there any other circumstances whatsoever under which China would condemn Russia’s actions in Ukraine? Specifically, what will Russia do to see condemnation from China?

Hua Chunying: Why are you obsessed with China’s condemnation?

We have said that the historical merits of the Ukraine issue are very complex. The current situation after evolution is the result of multiple factors at play. The correct way is to learn the whole story and the evolving process objectively before resolving the issue through dialogue and consultation. The security of all countries should be common, comprehensive and sustainable. And only security like this is lasting.

You keep asking when will China join the US and some European countries to condemn Russia. This reminds me that it is the handful of countries you raised, including the US, that have been interfering in China’s internal affairs and attacking China based on disinformation.

In international relations, the last thing one should do is to impose his will on others. One should instead allow all countries to make independent judgement based on the merits of the matter itself.

AFP: China has been accused of committing genocide in Xinjiang, an accusation that has been called “lie of the century”. Now Russia is saying that the genocide of Russians happening in Ukraine is one of the justifications for its invasion in Ukraine. Has Russia showed you any evidence that genocide is happening in Ukraine? And if it’s not the case, are you prepared to say that this is also a lie of the century?

Hua Chunying: I can tell you, I cannot make any comparison between what happens in China’s Xinjiang and eastern Ukraine because I don’t know what happened in the latter. So we’re not going to rush to any conclusions. But I can tell you very clearly, please stop using the word “genocide” when it comes to Xinjiang the next time you write your reports because it is an out-and-out lie of the century. And I have a better right and I am in a better position to brief you on the situation of my own country.

The Chinese government has for numerous times proved to you with facts that the so-called genocide in Xinjiang is the biggest lie of the century. I hope you can listen to what we said. In recent years, more than 2,000 government officials, religious personnel and journalists, including resident foreign correspondents in China, from over 100 countries and organizations have visited Xinjiang. What they see is a peaceful and harmonious Xinjiang with steady development, where people of all ethnic groups enjoy freedom of religious belief in Xinjiang. This are the facts and truth about Xinjiang. I also need to tell you that some preventive deradicalization measures in Xinjiang are similar to the counterterrorism and deradicalization measures like “community correction” in France.

Therefore, I hope that you will not have any prejudice against China on this issue or make groundless accusations against China based on disinformation. It is because some of you have always condemned China on this issue that I am very unhappy to hear you use the word “condemn”. Accusations must be based on facts, and should be used with caution before the full picture is known.

I also hope that after the epidemic, I can find a right opportunity to take you to Xinjiang to enjoy the beautiful scenery of Xinjiang and see what kind of life people there are leading with your own eyes. I think when the truth of Xinjiang and people’s life there spread around the world through your reports, ethnic minorities in many other countries will be very envious of the ethnic minorities in Xinjiang.

AFP: Is there a coincidence between the fact that President Putin was here for the opening of the Olympics and then it seemed that he’s waited until the Olympics to be over to launch offensive acts against Ukraine? Do you think Russia should wait until the end of the Paralympic Games on March 13 before targeting its neighbor?

Hua Chunying: AFP’s imagination is as rich as ever. I can tell you that more than 30 international dignitaries attended the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics in China, including President Putin. The two heads of state exchanged views on China-Russia relations and issues of common concern. We have released relevant information in a timely and detailed manner.

Russia is an independent major country, and it decides its policy and actions independently according to its own strategic judgment and interests. As to the question concerning the timing of Russia’s move, you might have to ask Russia.

The Beijing Winter Olympics was splendid, safe and successful. We believe the Beijing Winter Paralympics will be equally splendid, safe and successful.

Dragon TV: The Washington Post reported on February 23 that the Beijing Winter Olympics was a disaster for broadcaster NBC and the sponsors. Prime-time viewership plummeted more than 40 percent from four years ago, hitting record lows. Do you have any comment?

Hua Chunying: That was according to the Washington Post. I’m not sure NBC would agree. What I have noted is that the CEO of Olympic Broadcasting Services (OBS) said that the Beijing Winter Olympics is the most watched Winter Olympics with new records in terms of broadcast hours, technology and content. It is also the most viewed Winter Olympics on NBC’s digital platforms. The IOC said that the Games set many records with the widest digital interaction, the longest broadcast hours and the highest viewership at the opening ceremony. The Games saw billions of interactions on digital platforms. During the Games, a record 64 million people followed the events through the Olympic website and APP. The Olympic channel on YouTube was watched by 58 percent more views than the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. On TikTok, hashtag OlympicSpirit videos tallied more than 2.1 billion views.

Against the backdrop of the lingering global pandemic, especially with the rampant Omicron variant, China has honored its commitment as scheduled and presented a streamlined, safe and splendid Olympics to the world. This is a success for the Chinese people and the people of the whole world. We noted that the international community has spoken positively of the Games. IOC President Bach awarded the Olympic Cup to the Chinese people. His deeply moving address at the closing ceremony was received with rounds of applause from the audience. He described Beijing 2022 as a truly exceptional Olympic Winter Games.

If a handful of media outlets or individuals choose deliberately to ignore the excellent events for political reasons and to ignore the uplifting spirit and message for solidarity, peace and cooperation conveyed by the Games, then it’s their loss.

Reuters: Does China think Russia’s action is an invasion of Ukraine? If not, why not?

Hua Chunying: A suggestion for you. You may go ask the US: they started the fire and fanned the flames, how are they going to put out the fire now?

Reuters: Is China satisfied that it’s proactively enough in the effort to achieve peace in Ukraine?

Hua Chunying: We want peace in Ukraine and do not want to see the situation in Ukraine evolve to what it is today. We call on all parties to ease tension through dialogue and exercise restraint. In the meantime, we have to bear in mind that everything happens for a reason. Not only the symptom but also the root cause should be addressed, which calls for the joint efforts of all parties concerned.

You have been latching on to China today. Is China a party directly concerned? Who is the one that started the fire, fanned the flames and added fuel to it? There is a Chinese saying that whoever started the trouble should end it. The Ukraine issue needs to be resolved by the parties directly concerned through negotiations. Some of the words you used could easily remind us of those groundless accusations against China based on a lot of disinformation and rumors, which made us feel uncomfortable and offended.

So I want you to be calm, sensible and restrained. I hope you will join China in calling on all parties to exercise restraint, do more to help put out the fire, and not to let the situation get further out of control.

Reuters: Did the Chinese leader give his blessing for President Putin to attack Ukraine?

Hua Chunying: I find such a way of questioning quite offensive frankly speaking. It exposes a certain stereotype of looking at China with preconceived notions, bias, arrogance and malicious characterization. China is not a direct party to this issue. All we have been doing is promoting peace talks.

Yesterday I shared our observations about all the ins and outs on this matter. President Putin also delivered a detail-rich speech. Why don’t you take some time to read them? Why not cool down, cast aside your entrenched notions, and look at matters from a rational and objective perspective? Who started the fire? Who fanned the flames? Who keeps pouring oil on the flame? It takes the person who started the trouble to end it. The parties directly concerned should be the ones to resolve the issue through negotiation.

Russia is an independent major power and a permanent member of the UN Security Council. It makes foreign policy decisions independently. China’s position is very clear. On regional hotspot issues, we consistently call for peaceful resolution through dialogue, consultation and negotiation.

When countries like Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan were hit by illegal military operations, and when the seven billion US dollars of assets of the Afghan people were illegally plundered by the US recently, did you condemn any of it? Did you speak up for fairness and justice? Did you question the US government? That’s why I don’t think your question has the objectivity that a professional journalist’s question should possess. You are not neutral. You subscribe to preconceived notions. As a journalist, you shouldn’t impose your presuppositions on others.

AFP: I understand you feel we are all very emotional about the issue. But I believe when there is war, there is bound to be casualties. What I meant to say is that Albania and the US are preparing a resolution at the UN Security Council, that will be put out tomorrow I guess New York Time, and put to a vote on Friday. Would you mind telling us what China’s vote will be on this resolution?

Hua Chunying: We will handle relevant issues based on China’s consistent position and in keeping with the principles of the UN Charter.",https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/202202/t20220224_10645282.html
5,60285e67-7cad-4f54-bd90-99c55ea500aa,[],2022-02-23 17:30:43+00:00,"New York [US], February 23 (ANI): Amid the growing tensions between Moscow and Kiev, Dmytro Kuleba, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine on Tuesday (local time) said that the globe is in the middle of the largest security crisis in Europe since World War 2.

Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) meeting on “the situation in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine”, he said, “We are currently in the middle of the largest security crisis in Europe since World War II. This crisis was created and is being escalated by one side unilaterally by Russian Federation. Russia’s accusations of Ukraine are absurd.”

Kuleba warned the world to not repeat mistakes of the past. “I believe in the power of the free world and our joint ability to avert a new devastating catastrophe in Europe. 40 million Ukrainians only want to live in peace and solidarity,” he said.

The Ukrainian Minister also reiterated that Ukraine has never threatened or attacked anyone. He said, “Ukraine has never planned and does not plan any military offensive in the Donbas. Neither any provocations nor acts of sabotage.”

“It is ultimately absurd to suggest that Ukraine could have prepared for anything like this and waited for months until Russia amassed an enormous military force along our borders to proceed with such plans,” added Kuleba.

He urged UNGA to stop Russia, adding, “We need to use this last chance to stop Russia, where it is. It is clear that President Putin will not stop by himself. The beginning of a large-scale war in Ukraine will be the end of the world order as we know.”

Meanwhile, Ukraine’s top security official said that Ukraine introduced a state of emergency in all Ukrainian territory apart from Donetsk and Luhansk regions. The official added that the state of emergency would last 30 days and can be extended for another 30 days.

Earlier in the day, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky had urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to sit down at the negotiations table.

“I believe that Russia should be among those countries that provide clear security guarantees. I have many times suggested that the President of Russia sit down at the negotiating table and speak,” said Zelensky.

US President Joe Biden on Wednesday said that the US has no intention of fighting with Russia.

“We have no intention of fighting with Russia. We want to send an unmistakable message though, that the United States, together with our allies will defend every inch of NATO territory and abide by the commitments we made to NATO. We still believe that Russia is poised to go much further in launching a massive military attack against Ukraine. I hope I am wrong about that, I hope we are wrong about that, but Russia has only escalated his threat against the rest of Ukrainian territory including major cities and the capital city of Kyiv,” said Biden.

Russia said Wednesday that new US sanctions will meet a “strong response” after US President Joe Biden announced fresh penalties against Moscow for “beginning” an invasion of Ukraine.

Responding to the US sanctions, the Russian Foreign Ministry said that it will be met with strong response.

“There should be no doubt — sanctions will meet a strong response, not necessarily symmetrical, but well-calibrated and sensitive for the American side,” the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement.

The ministry said that Washington had slapped a new round of sanctions in order to “change Russia’s course.”

“Russia has proved that, with all the sanctions costs, it is capable of minimizing the damage. And even more so, sanctions pressure cannot affect our determination to firmly defend our interests,” the statement said.

On Tuesday, Biden announced what he called the “first tranche” of sanctions, including steps to starve Russia of financing and target financial institutions and the country’s “elites.”

Earlier this week Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized Ukraine’s separatist regions of Donetsk and Lugansk as independent statelets and put his forces on standby to move into the Western-backed country. (ANI)
