Slovak government passed a ""state of crisis"" declaration that is valid as of 12:00 on Saturday (26 February). The decision is related to the mass influx of war refugees to the territory of Slovakia due to the war in Ukraine. It is a governmental move, which should create conditions for easier adoption of necessary measures to prevent and mitigate the consequences of the critical influx of war refugees.

NATO troops to strengthen the Eastern border



Slovakia's defence should be strengthened by approximately 1,200 NATO troops. Together with 300 members of the Slovak Armed Forces, they will form the so-called NATO Forward Presence Unit. After Saturday's cabinet meeting, Slovak Defence Minister Jaroslav Naď announced that he would submit a proposal for the approval of such presence to the government and subsequently to the parliament in the coming weeks. The minister also stated that Germany will deliver to Slovakia the Patriot system, to strengthen its air defence. The Patriot anti-missile defence system can detect, track and destroy aircraft, including drones, cruise missiles and tactical ballistic missiles.



Ukrainian President asks via phone call Slovakia for help



President Zuzana Caputova had a telephone conversation on Thursday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who asked Slovakia for help in the form of tougher sanctions against Russia and material help in a crisis situation. Caputova assured Zelenskyy that Ukraine and its people can count on Slovakia as a reliable neighbour in times of need.

On Friday, President Caputova represented Slovakia at an extraordinary summit of North Atlantic Alliance (NATO) leaders with other leaders of the so-called Bucharest Nine countries, including Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Romania.

Government approves €1 million for Ukraine



Slovakia will provide €1 million in humanitarian aid to Ukraine, the Government decided on Friday. The sum will be distributed among international and Slovak organisations that are capable of delivering humanitarian aid in Ukraine immediately.

""We can expect that the Russian aggression will drive many people from Ukraine,"" stated Prime Minister Eduard Heger after the session of the Security Council on Thursday. He called on people in Slovakia to have compassion and understanding for those fleeing Ukraine because they deserve our help.

Slovakia will also provide Ukraine with military material amounting to almost €11 million. Specifically, 10 million litres of diesel fuel, 2.4 million litres of aviation gasoline and 12, 000 pieces of 120 mm ammunition. ""Slovakia is sending Ukraine exactly what it has asked for"", Slovak Defence Minister Jaroslav Naď stressed.



Situtation on the Slovak - Ukrainian border



More than 7,500 Ukrainian citizens crossed the Slovak-Ukrainian border in the first two days of the war conflict in Ukraine. According to the Interior Ministry's press department, before the conflict, the average number of Ukrainians crossing the border to Slovakia was 1,400 per day.

The Interior Ministry plans to set up so-called hotspots for the case of increased influx of people from Ukraine. They will be set up during the weekend in Ulic, Ubla, Vysne Nemecke, Velke Siemence and Cierna nad Tisou. People arriving without documents will be registered in the hotspots. Soldiers will assist police officers with the registration.

""We enable persons fleeing the war a short-term stay of up to 90 days. However, these persons have a possibility to apply for international protection after they enter Slovakia or even later. As soon as an amendment to the Asylum law and the respective government decision are approved, they will also be able to request a temporary refuge status,"" explained the Interior ministry. If they are granted international protection, meaning asylum or a temporary refuge status, the limitation of 90 days will no longer apply to them.

Interior Ministry also informed that entry to Slovakia will be granted to all persons fleeing the military conflict. After individual assessment, also to persons who do not have a valid travel document (biometric passport).

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

How you can help: Here are ways those in the U.S. can help support the Ukrainian people as well as what people around the world have been donating.

'You pray': Ukrainian American church sees influx of parishioners, welcomes new arrivals The Rev. Volodymyr Steliac held Sunday service at St. Andrews Cathedral in Silver Spring, Maryland, like he has every Sunday before for 26 years. Only this Sunday, everything was different. “When this started, I opened the church 24/7. Because what do you do when bombs are falling on your mother or brother or sister, your friend, what do you do?” Steliac said in an interview. “You pray.” The Ukrainian American cathedral was overwhelmed with parishioners seeking community after a brutal week in Ukraine. Maryna Kapovska and her sister, Polina Olson, pray for their parents, who stayed in Kyiv even after the conflict had begun. “It's definitely really hard to be so far away from them and know that you're helpless,” Kapovska said.

Durbin wants Temporary Protected Status for 29,500 Ukrainians in the U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said Monday he is requesting that the Biden administration allow Ukrainians in the United States on visas to obtain Temporary Protected Status. ""There are 29,500 Ukrainians in the United States now on visas. We have a letter going out to the president this evening asking for Temporary Protected Status for all of them. They include tourists and students and people working here on visas and that sort of thing. So that is something we could and should do immediately,"" Durbin, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, told reporters. ""Some of them — the visas have expired and they're supposed to return to Ukraine. That's that is unacceptable under the current circumstances,"" he said. The TPS designation can be made by the Secretary of Homeland Security. It does not confer a permanent benefit for recipients but allows them to temporarily stay in the U.S. without fear of deportation. Durbin said he believes Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, will sign his letter and that additional Republican senators ""are being asked right now."" Share this -

International Criminal Court to open investigation into Russia over allegations of war crimes The International Criminal Court will open an investigation into potential war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine, prosecutor Karim Khan announced Monday. The court, located in The Hague, Netherlands, is an independent international body responsible for investigating and trying large-scale international crimes, such as war crimes and genocide. Based on a preliminary examination of the Russian invasion, Khan said, there is a ""reasonable basis"" to believe Russia has committed both war crimes and crimes against humanity. ""Given the expansion of the conflict in recent days, it is my intention that this investigation will also encompass any new alleged crimes falling within the jurisdiction of my Office that are committed by any party to the conflict on any part of the territory of Ukraine,"" he said in a statement.

Biden says Americans don't need to worry about nuclear war President Joe Biden said on Monday that Americans do not need to be worried about a nuclear war, after Russian President Vladimir Putin declared Sunday that he was putting his nuclear forces on high alert. Asked by reporters as he was leaving a Black History Month event at the White House if Americans should be concerned, Biden responded: ""No."" Over the weekend, Biden administration officials said that Putin's choice to put deterrence forces on alert was unnecessary and escalatory, and said that the Russian leader was not under any threat from the U.S., NATO or Ukraine. White House press secretary Jen Psaki told ABC News on Sunday that Putin was ""manufacturing threats that don't exist in order to justify further aggression."" Share this -







Key Democrat backs Biden's opposition to no-fly zone over Ukraine Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, told NBC News he supports the Biden administration's decision not to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine. ""It would invariably require our aircraft to come into contact with Russian aircraft. The possibility of miscalculation or deliberate confrontation would be very serious,"" Reed said on Monday. ""The other steps the administration is taking — and the incredible fighting skills of the Ukrainians — have made it something where [Russians] don't have as dominant air superiority as one would thing,"" he said. ""And just yesterday, the Germans announced that they were sending several hundred Stinger missiles. And Ukrainians do have an air defense system."" Earlier on Monday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki defended Biden's opposition to a no-fly zone. ""What that'd require is implementation by the U.S. military. It would essentially mean the U.S. military would be shooting down planes, Russian planes. That is definitely escalatory. That would potentially put us into a place where we're in a military conflict with Russia,"" Psaki said in an interview on MSNBC. ""That is not something the president wants to do.""

Hungary won't allow weapons for Ukraine to cross its territory Hungary will not send troops or weapons to Ukraine and will not allow lethal weapons to transit its territory in order to keep the country safe, Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on Monday during a visit to Kosovo. ""The reason for making this decision is that such deliveries might become targets of hostile military action and ... we have to ensure the security of Hungary ... that we are not getting involved in that war,"" Szijjarto said after meeting Kosovo Foreign Minister Donika Gervalla. While Hungary is a member of both NATO and the European Union, its prime minister, Viktor Orban, is a close ally of Putin's who met with him in Moscow at the beginning of February. At the time, he said ""Russia’s demands for security guarantees"" from Ukraine are ""normal and should be the basis for negotiations. And I agree with that."" He condemned Russia's “military action” after it began, but said his country would not send military aid to Ukraine, which shares a border with Hungary.

Most Russian troops at the border now inside Ukraine, U.S. official says About 75 percent of the combat power that Russia had amassed at the Ukraine border is now inside the country, a senior U.S. Department of Defense official said Monday. Russia's main objectives appear to be the capital, Kyiv, as well as the city of Kharkiv, the official said, adding the Kremlin's advance on Kyiv remains slowed. Russian troops have advanced about 3 miles (5 kilometers) in the last 24 hours, and are still about 15 miles outside the city, the official said. The official said the U.S. expects Russia will try to encircle Kyiv in the coming days, and is trying to do the same with Kharkiv, which has already seen heavy fighting in and around the city. The official said the U.S. believes all the troops in Ukraine are Russian, and no soldiers from Belarus, which has allied with Russia, are involved. The official said there has been no significant new naval activity in the area, and the airspace over Ukraine remains contested, with air dominance shifting back and forth between the two countries. Russia has launched more than 380 missiles at Ukraine since the attack began, the official said, and there's been no evidence of any change in Russia's nuclear posture, despite Russian President Vladimir Putin's announcement Sunday that he was putting his country's nuclear deterrent forces on high alert. The U.S. has seen no “appreciable or noticeable muscle movements” of Russian nuclear forces, and “we remain comfortable and confident in our own strategic deterrence posture.” Share this -

Facing widespread condemnation, Russia continues to blame Ukraine Facing widespread criticism at the U.N.

The representative said Russia does not support the draft resolution to condemn Russia’s actions being handled by the General Assembly as opposed to the U.N. Security Council, which voted in favor on Sunday. ""We're guided by the fact that that this measure proposes that we register that the Security Council failed to comply to uphold its main responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security and at the same time, there was not even a hint at an attempt to find a constructive solution at the Security Council, attempt to circumvent the position of the Russian Federation, to disregard the position of the Russian Federation runs counter to the very bedrock of the United Nations,"" said the representative. ""There's a need to find common ground, regardless of our Western partners attempts to avoid this, including when they disregarded our legitimate concerns in connection with NATO policy and Western countries' breach of the core principles of the OSCE [Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe] on indivisibility of security,"" he continued.

Bulgarian prime minister fires top official who would not describe Ukraine invasion as war Bulgarian Prime Minister Kiril Petkov on Monday fired Defense Minister Stefan Yanev for his reluctance to describe the Russian invasion of Ukraine as a war, reiterating that Sofia would speak in one voice with the European Union.

""My defense minister cannot use the word operation instead of the word war. You cannot call it an operation when thousands of soldiers from the one and the other side are already killed,"" Petkov said in a televised statement. ""The Bulgarian interest is not in bending our heads down ... When we see something we do not agree with, something so obvious, we cannot keep quiet,"" Petkov said.

No big cyberattacks, but digital skirmishes abound Direct, crippling cyberattacks have so far been largely absent since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine, but both sides have adopted other digital tactics to get an edge. Russia and its ally Belarus have continued to deploy disinformation operations, including creating social media influence campaigns to convince Ukrainians to distrust their government. On Monday, Ukraine's Cyber Police said that an unidentified individual or group has been sending emails falsely claiming to be evacuation announcements from the country's national law enforcement agency.

Western firms head for the exit in Russia as sanctions tighten Energy giant BP, global bank HSBC and the world's biggest aircraft leasing firm AerCap joined a growing list of companies looking to exit Russia on Monday, as Western sanctions tightened the screws on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. The West has sought to punish Russia with a raft of measures, including closing airspace to Russian aircraft, shutting out some Russian banks from the SWIFT global financial network and restricting Moscow's ability to deploy its $630 billion foreign reserves. Russia's economy was already reeling on Monday. The ruble plunged as much as 30 percent to an all-time low, while the central bank doubled its key interest rate to 20 percent, kept stock markets and derivative markets closed and temporarily banned brokers from selling securities held by foreigners. BP, Russia's biggest foreign investor, abruptly announced at the weekend that it was abandoning its 20 percent stake in state-controlled Rosneft at a cost of up to $25 billion, cutting the British firm's oil and gas reserves in half and reducing BP's production by a third. BP's decision, following talks with the British government, shone a spotlight on other Western firms with stakes in Russian oil and gas projects, such as U.S. firm ExxonMobil, France's TotalEnergies and Britain's Shell. Equinor, the energy firm majority owned by the Norwegian state, said it would start divesting its joint ventures in Russia, although a spokesperson added: ""It will take some time to untangle a business developed over decades."" Norway's sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, will also divest its Russian assets, worth about $2.8 billion, while Australia's sovereign wealth fund said it planned to wind down its exposure to Russian-listed companies.

Kremlin spokesman: Russia has 'potential to compensate for the damage' from sanctions Russia can overcome the damage from heavy sanctions imposed in response to the country's continued attack on Ukraine, Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov said Monday. As negotiations between Ukraine and Russia took place on the Belarusian border Monday, Peskov said he would not comment on the ""aim of the negotiations."" ""Let's wait and see what they bring,"" he said, adding: ""We regret that the negotiations didn't start a day ago, or last night."" Speaking before the U.S. announced new sanctions on the Russian central bank this morning, Peskov acknowledged that Russia's ""economic reality"" has changed, with the value of the ruble plummeting Monday and Moscow's central bank raising interest rates from 9.5 percent to 20 percent in a bid to protect people's savings. However, he said, ""there is no reason to doubt the effectiveness and reliability of the central bank."" ""The Russian Federation was preparing for the possible sanctions in advance. Even to the harshest sanctions,"" he said. His comments came as Japan announced it would join international sanctions on the Russian central bank by limiting transactions, along with other measures. Peskov said Russia would be ""dealing with the issues as they come."" ""The sanctions are heavy, problematic, but Russia has the potential to compensate for the damage,"" he said. Asked about Vladimir Putin's own attitude toward personal sanctions, Peskov said the Russian president was ""rather indifferent."" He also repeated warnings about international interference in the conflict, characterizing the European Union's response to Russia's invasion as ""measures of an unfriendly, hostile nature against us."" ""From our point of view, the supply of weapons, armaments and ammunition to the territory of Ukraine can and will become extremely dangerous as a stabilizing factor,"" he said, warning that such efforts could have ""much more dangerous consequences.""

U.S. expands sanctions on Russia's central bank, prohibiting American deals and freezing assets The United States is expanding sanctions on Russia’s central bank in a move that will block Americans from doing any business with it and freezing any assets it holds in the U.S. In a statement Monday, the Treasury said the decision would apply to the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, the National Wealth Fund of the Russian Federation and the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation. It said U.S. was also adding Russian Direct Investment Fund Chief Executive Officer Kirill Dmitriev — who it referred to as a ""known Putin ally"" — to the sanctions list. “The unprecedented action we are taking today will significantly limit Russia’s ability to use assets to finance its destabilizing activities, and target the funds Putin and his inner circle depend on to enable his invasion of Ukraine,” Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen said in a statement. “Today, in coordination with partners and allies, we are following through on key commitments to restrict Russia’s access to these valuable resources.” It comes after the U.S., Canada and the E.U. announced they would each be restricting Russia's ability to use its central bank reserves.

NATO secretary general: Alliance won't move into Ukraine amid conflict NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Monday that the alliance will not move into Ukraine, either on the ground or in the air, as Russia's invasion continues. Speaking with NBC News in an interview in Brussels Monday morning, Stoltenberg reiterated his support for Ukraine and said NATO allies continued to provide more anti-tank missiles, military aid and financial assistance. He also said Ukraine appeared to be providing a much tougher resistance than Russia likely expected. ""I think that they underestimated the resistance they were going to meet and that's why they're making less progress, why they are advancing much slower and why they have higher rates of attrition or casualties than expected,"" he said. Stoltenberg said he would not discuss specific numbers around casualties, but said ""there is no doubt that Russia has suffered much more casualties than they expected under the whole operation is moving much slower than planned."" At the same time, he said: ""We see now a new wave coming in from Russia and from Belarus, with heavy armor, with long range artillery."" ""It's very unpredictable and fluid situation,"" he said. Still, he maintained: ""We have no intentions of moving into Ukraine neither on the ground or in the airspace."" ""I think we have to understand that this is a brutal conflict that is taking place in Ukraine now,"" he said. ""At the same time, we have a responsibility to make sure that this doesn't spiral out of control that escalates even further into concern for full-fledged war in Europe involving NATO allies."" He also said that NATO ""has not changed the readiness level of our nuclear forces"" after Russian President Vladimir Putin took the extraordinary action on Sunday of ordering his nuclear deterrent forces to be on alert.

Facebook, Twitter remove disinformation accounts targeting Ukrainians Facebook and Twitter removed two anti-Ukrainian “covert influence operations” over the weekend, one tied to Russia and another with connections to Belarus, the companies said. One of the operations, a propaganda campaign featuring a website pushing anti-Ukraine talking points, was an offshoot of a known Russian disinformation operation. A Facebook spokesperson said it used computer-generated faces to bolster the credibility of fake columnists across several platforms, including Instagram. The other campaign used hacked accounts to push similar anti-Ukraine propaganda and was tied to a known Belarusian hacking group. Disinformation experts warned that Russia is expected to continue to try to manipulate narratives about Ukraine — most notably around the claims made by Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Ruble falls to historic lows as Russia's central bank hikes interest rates to 20 percent The Russian ruble tumbled to a record low against the dollar Monday after Western countries announcer harsher sanctions against Russia over the weekend amid its invasion of Ukraine. The ruble fell to 119.50 per dollar in Asian trading, marking a record low for the currency. It later recovered to around 110 per dollar. Meanwhile, Russia's central bank set the country's key interest rate at 20 percent from Monday, nearly double its previous rate of 9.5 percent. ""External conditions for the Russian economy have drastically changed,"" the bank said in a statement. ""The increase of the key rate will ensure a rise in deposit rates to levels needed to compensate for the increased depreciation and inflation risks. This is needed to support financial and price stability and protect the savings of citizens from depreciation."" The bank said further key rate decisions would be made ""taking into account risks posed by external and domestic conditions and the reaction of financial markets, as well as actual and expected inflation movements relative to the target and economic developments over forecast period.""

Kids with cancer shelter in Kyiv hospital basements with limited access to meds, food and water Kids with cancer and the staff members treating them are huddled in the basements of two children's hospitals in Kyiv with waning access to medication, food and water, an official with Ukraine's largest children's cancer charity said. Pharmacies and warehouses with medication that the children need have closed down, Yuliya Nogovitsyna, the director of programming for the charity Tabletochki, said in an interview. The kids have access to only basic forms of chemotherapy, she said. Other treatments have been interrupted, raising concerns that the children could relapse, not achieve remission and grow sicker. ""When we speak about casualties in war, we just count those who are killed in the fighting,"" Nogovitsyna said. ""These children, they have been also killed by it, but slowly, because their treatments are interrupted."" A further challenge is finding drivers to deliver food and water, she said. The hospitals have made deals for food and water, but not many people are willing to drive through the conflict-ravaged city of Kyiv. A truck taking water to the children Saturday was shot at and the driver has had to shelter at the hospital, she said. Thirteen children with cancer at the older of the two hospitals are being treated by four doctors, two nurses and two assistant nurses, who have decided to stay there. The basement is humid and moldy, Nogovitsyna said. The organization hopes to move some of the children by bus to a hospital in Lviv in western Ukraine as soon it is safe. After that, the kids have been offered beds and treatment if they can reach Poland. The logistics remain challenging, however. ""It's not possible to leave Kyiv for the moment — there is a curfew,"" Nogovitsyna said. ""Nobody is allowed to move outside of the buildings because every person will be regarded as an enemy and will be shot."" Share this -







Ukraine's U.N. ambassador condemns Putin's 'nuclear blackmail' and claims of genocide Russian President Vladimir Putin has resorted to ""nuclear blackmail"" and perverted the basis of the international Genocide Convention for his own agenda, Sergiy Kyslytsya, Ukraine's ambassador to the United Nations, said at a public Security Council meeting Sunday. Kyslytsya detailed attacks in Ukraine on residential areas and the country's infrastructure from ""bloody and mad Russian leadership"" in his speech to fellow U.N. ambassadors Sunday. He said the world must take Putin's threat of nuclear armament very seriously. Ukraine has filed a case with the International Court of Justice on the basis of the Genocide Convention and asked the world court to issue provisional measures against Russia, Kyslytsya announced. ""Russia, however, has twisted the concept of genocide and perverted the solemn treaty obligation to prevent and punish genocide,"" Kyslytsya said. ""It has made an absurd and unfounded claim of alleged genocide as a justification and pretext for its own aggression against Ukraine and violation of the sovereignty and human rights of the Ukrainian people."" Vasily Nebenzya, the Russian diplomat assigned to the U.N., denied accusations that Russian armed forces were targeting Ukrainian civilians. He continued to push the narrative that crimes by Ukrainian nationalists were the catalyst for Putin's invasion. The Russian Federation blocked a previous resolution denouncing Russia's invasion, which Nebenzya said was ""imbalanced."" He asserted that any attempt to ""circumvent"" the Russian Federation's position on the Security Council would undermine the U.N. Charter. ""This is precisely why the council has the vested right for permanent members to block a decision,"" Nebenzya said. ""This is not a privilege. This is a mechanism for ensuring the balance of interests, which is of such paramount importance for the entire world, and through this balance of interest for the achievement of global stability.""

Americans also should monitor local and international media, keep in contact with family and friends, stay alert of their surroundings when in public, review security plans and always carry their passports with current Russian visas, the embassy said. Since January, the State Department has said Americans should not travel to Russia because of ""ongoing tension along the border with Ukraine, the potential for harassment against U.S. citizens, the embassy's limited ability to assist U.S. citizens in Russia, COVID-19 and related entry restrictions, terrorism, harassment by Russian government security officials, and the arbitrary enforcement of local law.""
