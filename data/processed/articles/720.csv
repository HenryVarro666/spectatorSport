Demonstrators have been seen waving Ukrainian flags at what appear to be peaceful rallies in Kherson, Energodar, and Berdyansk.

Hundreds of protesters have been seen standing in a square in the port city of Kherson in the south of Ukraine, which is home to more than 280,000 people, and one of the first locations to fall under Russian control.

One video, which has not been verified by i , shows crowds waving Ukrainian flags in Kherson, chanting “Kherson is Ukraine!”.

In Berdyansk, a small Ukrainian port city in the south east of the country, 200 to 250 people gathered for a rally, according to Belarusian outlet Nexta.

There have also been unconfirmed reports of people being detained and beaten at the Berdyansk protest.

One video of the protest in Berdyansk, which has not been verified, shows men in military uniforms beating protesters as they lay on the ground.

Hromadske International reported at least 1,500 residents went to a peaceful rally in south eastern city of Energodar and demanded the release of its deputy mayor Ivan Samoilyuk, who Ukrainian officials claim has been kidnapped by Russian forces.

In another unverified clip recorded in Energodar, a crowd of people are seen crowding around a jeep as a Russian soldier holding an assault rifle stands outside the driver’s door.

He then fires his weapon into the air in a apparent attempt to disperse the crowd – but they continue to swarm the vehicle. The soldier then gets in his vehicle before speeding away.

In recent weeks, there has been similar acts of defiance against Russian occupation in the cities and others in Ukrainian which have been taken over by Russian troops.

Video footage recorded in Berdyansk at the end of last month showed crowds chanting “go home” at Russian troops as they waved Ukrainian flags and raised their fists in the air.

Pictures have emerged of protesters carrying the Ukrainian flag filing past Russian vehicles emblazoned with the letter Z and Russian soldiers aiming their weapons at civilians.

As Ukrinform reports with reference to social media, Russian soldiers detained pro-Ukrainian protesters and used physical force. Shots were fired in the street.

It also became known that Russian invaders kidnapped activist Tetiana Typakova, an active participant in anti-occupation rallies. She was abducted from her own home. Now she, as well as other public figures – Vitaliy Shevchenko and Volodymyr Sushko – are held captive.

As reported, the invaders kidnapped first deputy mayor of Enerhodar Ivan Samoydiuk. A rally in support of him was held in the town today. People say they will gather every day until the enemy releases Samoydiuk.

“Despite the fact that the invaders impose a strict administrative and police regime in the temporarily occupied territories, Ukrainians are not afraid of holding mass protests. It is impossible to stop Ukrainians. They are really citizens of their country,"" the statement reads.

In particular, residents of Kherson once again took to the streets with blue and yellow symbols on March 20. The occupiers, who had been waiting for a warm welcome here, did not expect such resistance.

A mass march took place in Kakhovka under the slogans ""One, united, free Ukraine!""

The occupiers came to a traditional peaceful rally in Berdyansk. They fired several shots into the air and detained about 10 people.

The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine stated on March 19 that even Russian intelligence had come to the conclusion that it would be impossible to establish pro-Russian authorities in the territories temporarily controlled by the occupiers due to strong opposition from Ukrainians.

On February 24, Russian president Putin announced the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine. Russian troops shell and destroy key infrastructure, massively fire on residential areas of Ukrainian cities, towns, and villages using artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, and ballistic missiles.

Martial law was imposed in Ukraine and general mobilization was announced.

5,8c5d2b40-e329-4faf-89da-12de4b9eab36,['Jamie Dettmer'],,"Anhelina sat and prayed in the basement of her home in Bucha after Russian forces overran her small town north of Kyiv this month after fierce fighting. “There was no light, water, or gas. It was impossible to go out because they shoot. People were being shot around the house, which is a terrible sound, even scarier than the bombs,” said the mother of a three-year-old daughter.

That day Russian soldiers had broken into her home and inspecting the mobile phones of her father and husband found text messages to the local Ukrainian territorial defense forces. “They were taken away for interrogation. And I just sat and prayed in the dark for their return,” she told VOA in a text message.



Anhelina was lucky. The men were returned and a Russian commander who “loves children” told his men not to scare the toddler. “They brought food, water and candy for the little one,” she says. That was the only glimmer of hope in the terrifying days she spent under Russian occupation.



Chechen fighters “miraculously passed our house” one day. The friendly commander told her if they had entered, they probably would have killed her in revenge for the deaths of many of their men in a Ukrainian ambush.

Her story isn’t dissimilar to the testimony of others trapped in occupied towns and villages. Ukrainians disparagingly refer to their invaders as “orcs,” a reference to the malevolent goblin-like beasts' author JRR Tolkien portrayed in his trilogy Lord of the Rings.

Abductions, shots, threats

It wasn’t how Russian soldiers expected to be greeted. Russian POWs have told their Ukrainian captors their commanders told them they’d be welcomed as liberators. But they’re being met with civilian protests and surliness, even in predominantly Russian-speaking regions, to the surprise of the shunned intruders.



And the occupying forces are responding harshly — with threats, intimidation, shootings. At checkpoints men are brusquely examined to see if their chests or backs display signs of chaffing caused by wearing flak jackets. There have been allegations of torture, and so far, unverified reports of rapes. Last week Ukrainian lawmaker Lesia Vasylenko said women in some occupied towns near Kyiv had been subjected to barbaric sexual assaults.



Russian soldiers, many dispirited and demoralized, are looting, say locals.



“Orcs are hungry,” a woman in the southern town of Kherson told VOA. “At first they would go house to house and ask for food, now they just take it, and they steal food from passers-by and stores,” she said. “They also take cars, trucks, and daub Z on them,” she added, in reference to the Russian army invasion marking that’s become a pro-war Russian symbol.



Locals are split on the reasons for the looting. Some say it is a tactic of terror aimed at breaking their will to resist; others suspect it is plain hooliganism by ill-disciplined and hungry troops.



In Bucha, Veronika, who managed to flee the town after living under Russian occupation for three days, told VOA: “They use people’s houses like their own. Eat and charge up their walkie-talkies and clean their guns. And when they leave, they steal a lot of things also, they steal everything, even food blenders, do you understand? Even blenders, carpets, everything. They're taking everything from our houses and sometimes they burn houses for no reason.”

She added: “Sometimes they kill people. I don't know why. At the house of a friend, when the husband went to the outhouse they killed him with three shots, one to the back, another one to the stomach. I don't remember where the third one was. They never gave a reason.”



Veronika said it got worse with the second wave of soldiers who entered Bucha. The first wave seemed to be more professional, more disciplined, but the soldiers who came later, many of whom were from Chechnya, “really were beasts.”



“The Russians disperse peaceful protests with their guns. When people stand up to them, they often shoot,” the woman in Kherson said. “One time they fired at the ground, causing ricochet injuries. About five people were wounded,” she added. “A blogger, a girl, was broadcasting live near them. She was stuffed into a car. Until now, nothing is known about this girl,” she added.

Kherson was encircled on February 27 and endured a brief siege before Russia captured it on March 3, the first major Ukrainian town to fall to Russian forces. The mayor, Igor Kolykhaiev, urged troops who stormed a town hall meeting not to shoot civilians; he counseled residents to heed the rules he managed to negotiate with the Russians. He managed to persuade the invaders to allow the Ukrainian flag to remain flying above the town hall.



The Russians may have seized Kherson, but the town has not kowtowed. There is still episodic peaceful civil resistance in the form of protests, which the Russians respond to stony-faced or with shots, threats and abductions.



And that is how it is playing out in other Ukrainian towns as the Russians install new political knyaz, or masters, and puppet administrations, according to locals in occupied towns in southern and eastern Ukraine. On Sunday thousands of protesters rallied in Kherson and in occupied Enerhodar, where they demanded the release of the town’s deputy mayor, who has been abducted. Video posted on social-media sites show Russian soldiers in Berdyansk, a port town on the Sea of Azov, beating protesters as they lay on the ground.



The mayor of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov, was abducted on March 11 by Russian troops. Local residents protested. He was released last week in exchange for nine Russian POWs. Fedorov told Current Time TV, a Russian-language television channel overseen by Radio Free Europe and VOA: “It is a rather difficult ordeal when they take you for seven hours with a bag on your head, not knowing where, and you don't trust the people who took you.”



His interrogators didn’t manhandle him — they didn’t need to as there was a constant air of menace. “Or there was someone being tortured in the next cell over — and you could hear the screams, which absolutely pressured you, psychologically, so that it could definitely be compared with intimidation, with torture, and so on. So all of these six days were quite difficult,” he said. The mayor of the small southern Ukrainian town of Dniprorudne, was also abducted last week, according to Ukrainian authorities. His fate is unknown.

Protests

Kherson’s mayor hasn’t been dragged off. But on Thursday the Russians announced a new governing authority for the town, using the same name as used for other puppet administrations, the Rescue Committee for Peace and Order. In Kherson the new knyaz are pro-Russian politicians with links to the party of former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, who was ousted in 2014 by the Maidan uprising. Most of the town’s residents remain uncooperative. “Kherson's attitude to the Russian world had been neutral before the war,” said a local woman, who asked not to be named.



“But after the events of February 24, it changed. Numerous demonstrations show this. People show remarkable courage and bravery during these protests,” she said. “The city is full of [pro-Russian] separatists. These separatists are despised. Most are corrupt officials from previous city administrations. They try to cajole people. They promise benefits; they blackmail; they intimidate,” she added. Another said: “You can’t complain, or they’ll put you on an enemies list.”



Homes of suspected political activists are raided. There are checkpoints across Kherson and frequent Russian patrols stop, search and interrogate residents, checking mobile phones. “We are seeing it a lot,” a Kherson resident said. “A lot of people have deleted their social-media accounts or they clean up their messages in Viber or Telegram before leaving home,” they added.



Igor Kolykhaiev, Kherson’s legal mayor, has been trying to oversee emergency repairs and get some rudimentary basic services functioning. The new knyaz are at a loss and issue half-baked orders, locals say. That is reminiscent of what happened eight years ago in Donetsk, one of the two eastern Ukrainian oblasts seized in 2014 by pro-Moscow separatists, as this correspondent witnessed when reporting from the city.



The Moscow-backed insurrectionists who seized control of Donetsk were ignorant of the basic mechanics of practical politics. When they stormed the local city treasury to seize money, the treasurer had to explain that tax proceeds were not stored in actual cash in the building.



According to locals, pharmacies are almost empty, and so. too, food stores. Despite shortages, most people won’t accept Russian humanitarian aid that’s trucked in. “The Russians just wanted a pretty propaganda picture,” said a local. Ukrainian humanitarian aid conveys have been rebuffed by the Russians.



Trying to escape from occupation isn’t easy. On March 10 Anhelina and her family heard a humanitarian corridor was being opened up for Bucha. On the journey out, she spent a night with her relatives and others in another basement, where a sewer broke. “and so in the stench, cold, sitting, we waited for the morning.”



“Wheelchair, white flag, a minimum of things and we set off. We walked past the corpses of civilians [how many of them there were]. I didn’t explain anything to the child, because I didn’t know what to say,” she says.



“Every few meters Russians ordered us to stop and put our hands up. Later we noticed my three-year-old was also raising her hands,” she says. At a checkpoint a civilian car sped by and hit a mine. “There was almost nothing left,” she says.



Anhelina then explained what happened next: “You can't go back, only forward, men in front, I’m with the wheelchair behind. Passed mines, corpses, shattered military equipment, we made our way to freedom.”



“We are safe now, but nothing will be the same. We try to talk normally, even joke a little, but when I close my eyes, I see a road of dead people, and how we stood with our hands up, waiting for the Russians to decide about us.”",https://www.voanews.com/a/life-under-russian-occupation-hunger-fear-and-abductions-/6494205.html

20 Mar 2022 00.13 China’s foreign minister says the country time will tell that they stand on the right side of history over the Ukraine crisis. Reuters reports the minister Wang Yi told reporters on Saturday China had “always stood for maintaining peace and opposing war, and that its position was “objective and fair, and is in line with the wishes of most countries”. “Time will prove that China’s claims are on the right side of history,” he said according to a statement published by the ministry. China’s government holds conflicting positions on the war. It has projected itself as a neutral power, saying it respects Ukraine’s sovereignty as well as Russia’s “security concerns”, and says it could mediate. It has refused to condemn Russia’s actions or call it an “invasion”, has voted alongside it at international bodies, and the US has significant concerns it is considering supplying weapons to Russia (which Beijing denies). It has repeatedly objected to the use of economic sanctions against Russia.

“China will never accept any external coercion or pressure, and opposes any unfounded accusations and suspicious against China,” Wang told reporters on Saturday evening. Wang’s comments followed a Friday video call between Joe Biden and Xi Jinping, during which Biden warned Xi of “consequences” if Beijing gave material support to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Xi told Biden the war in Ukraine must end as soon as possible and called on NATO nations to hold a dialogue with Moscow. He did not, however, assign blame to Russia, according to Beijing’s statements about the call, Reuters reported.



20 Mar 2022 23.17 Russian troops have reportedly stopped a convoy of busses traveling to Mariupol to evacuate residents, according to the Kyiv Independent. Citing the Berdyansk City council, the outlet said the convoy was stopped a few kilometres outside Berdyansk and refused entry into the city limits, and the drivers were not permitted to spend the night. According to the Berdyansk city council, the convoy was heading to Berdyansk from Zaporizhzhia to pick up fleeing Mariupol residents but was stopped by Russian occupying forces near the village Azovske, three kilometers from Berdyansk. — The Kyiv Independent (@KyivIndependent) March 20, 2022 The Guardian has not independently verified the report. Berdyansk is about 85km by road from Mariupol, which is under heavy siege by Russian forces. Local authorities have accused Russia of forcibly taking thousands of Mariupol residents to Russia against their will.



20 Mar 2022 22.32 The New York Times has some more detail on the claims by Mariupol City Council that residents are being taken to Russia against their will. Pyotr Andryuschenko, an assistant to the city’s mayor, accused Russian forces of taking “between 4,000 and 4,500 Mariupol residents forcibly across the border to Taganrog” without their passports. Andryuschenko said thousands of people had been sheltering at a sporting complex in the city centre, and he believed many of those inside were being taken to Russia. Other Mariupol residents said they had heard from friends and neighbors who relayed having been taken across the border without their consent. Eduard Zarubin, a doctor who left the city on Wednesday, said he had been in touch with three families who had been forcibly taken to Taganrog by Russian soldiers. “Now the Russians are walking through the basements, and if there are people left there, they forcibly take them to Taganrog,” Mr. Zarubin, 50, said. In one case, he said, the whole family of one of his friends was taken away, as was the family of his friend’s brother.



20 Mar 2022 21.55 A senior Chinese government official said on Saturday that sanctions imposed by Western nations on Russia over Ukraine are increasingly “outrageous”, according to a recent Reuters report. China’s vice foreign minister Le Yucheng also acknowledged Moscow’s point of view on NATO, saying the alliance should not further expand eastwards, forcing a nuclear power like Russia “into a corner”. “The sanctions against Russia are getting more and more outrageous,” Le said at security forum in Beijing, adding that Russian citizens were being deprived of overseas assets “for no reason”. “History has proven time and again that sanctions cannot solve problems. Sanctions will only harm ordinary people, impact the economic and financial system... and worsen the global economy.” Beijing decries the use of sanctions in general, as unauthorised and unilateral, but has often used trade as an unofficial diplomatic weapon against countries with which it is in diplomatic dispute, including Lithuania and Australia. China’s government has refused to label Russia’s assault on Ukraine as an “invasion”. It has sought to present itself as a neutral potential mediator, and denied US claims that it is considering a Russian request to supply weapons. However in recent weeks it has repeatedly abstained from voting in multilateral resolutions aimed at Russia, or voting alongside it, including against the International Court of Justice’s recent demand that Russia withdraw its troops.

20 Mar 2022 21.20 'Ukrainians have proved they know how to fight' - Zelenskiy Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy published a video address just a short time ago. Here is an excerpt being reported by Ukrainian media. The 24th day of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine is over. After eight years of aggression, Ukrainians have proved that they know how to fight more professionally than an army that has been fighting for decades in different regions and under different conditions. We respond with wisdom and courage to the huge number of their equipment and soldiers sent to Ukraine. That is why, for example, the Ukrainian Chornobayivka will go down in war history. This is a place where the Russian military and their commanders have shown themselves completely as they are: incompetent, able to simply drive their people to slaughter. Zelenskiy said more than 6,600 people were evacuated through eight humanitarian corridors on Saturday, including from Bervytsia and Bucha. “Due to the shelling of the occupiers, we were unable to remove people from Borodyanka, Kyiv region,” he said. “More than 4,000 Mariupol residents managed to leave for Zaporizhia.”

The government overnight announced it was ceasing all exports of alumina and aluminum ores, including bauxite, to limit Russia’s ability to produce aluminium, a major Russian export and a critical component in arms and munitions.

20 Mar 2022 20.43 Hello, this is Helen Davidson here to take you through the news developments for the next few hours. Russian cosmonauts on the International Space Station have rejected claims their yellow and blue flight suits are a nod to Ukraine, and have expressed support for their president. Cosmonauts Oleg Artemyev, Denis Matveyev and Sergey Korsakov, of Russian space corporation Roscosmos, docked at the ISS late on Friday. Their uniforms - bright yellow with blue accents, sparked immediate questions about whether it was tacit message of support. Shortly after arriving Artemyev was asked and said the crew had just “accumulated a lot of yellow material so we needed to use it”. In a follow up statement published on the Russian space agency’s Telegram channel, he again urged people to not “look for any hidden signs or symbols” in the suits. “A colour is simply a colour. It is not in any way connected to Ukraine. Otherwise, we would have to recognise its rights to the yellow sun in the blue sky.

“These days, even though we are in space, we are together with our president and our people!” He gave a different reason for the choice this time - saying the crew chose the colours of the prestigious Bauman Moscow State Technical University, of which all three are graduates.

19 Mar 2022 19.36 The Guardian’s Moscow correspondents Andrew Roth and Pjotr Sauer wrote about why public support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is still high, despite hopes from the West that it is waning: There have been efforts from abroad to encourage the Russian people to protest against the war. Former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger last week released a nine-minute video in which he recalled his admiration for the Soviet weightlifter Yuri Vlasov and his father’s shame at fighting for the Nazi army at Leningrad. “This is not the Russian people’s war,” he said in an appeal to ordinary Russians. But others in Russia say it is. Many supporters cite the eight-year-old war between Ukraine and Russian proxy forces in Donbas, using words such as genocide and comparisons to the second world war to justify the invasion. As one former diplomat wrote in a WhatsApp message, he looks forward to Russia holding a “Nuremberg 2.0” in Ukraine after the war. “Aren’t you sad for the children killed in Donbas?” Elizaveta from Moscow shot back when asked about her views on the invasion. “Why don’t you write about them instead?” Russian society is deeply polarised between supporters and opponents of the Kremlin. Those camps have carried this division over into support for and opposition to the war, experts said. Even simple choices such as whether to call the conflict a “war” or the state-sanctioned “military operation” carry political meaning. “We are seeing that society is divided by a majority that broadly supports the war and a minority that is against it,” said Sergei Belanovsky, a sociologist. “These two groups live in different worlds, and cannot convince each other that their viewpoint is the right one.” According to the state-run Russian Public Opinion Research Center, 71% of Russians “support Russia’s decision to hold a special military operation in Ukraine”. Valery Fyodorov, head of the polling centre, said that new data to be published by the centre this week would show an increase in support for the “military operation”.

The demonstrations appear to have been peaceful, but images on social media show Russian forces arresting people and dispersing crowds in places like Enerhodar.

Crowds of protesters gathered in the city after Mayor Dmytro Orlov alleged that Russian troops had abducted his first deputy, Ivan Samoydyuk.

""We do not know what condition he is in,"" Mr Orlov said on Telegram. ""He has not been in touch since yesterday.""

One video allegedly taken in another city, Berdyansk, shows people being detained and beaten by Russian forces. The BBC has not been able to independently verify these images.",https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-60802572/page/7
