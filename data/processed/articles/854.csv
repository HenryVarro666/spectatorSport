Ambassador of the Russian Federation to Estonia Vladimir Lipaev was summoned to the ministry and handed a diplomatic note on the closure of the Consulate General of the Russian Federation in Narva and the Consular Office of the Russian Embassy in Tartu.

Estonia decided to expel and declare as persona non grata 14 of their staff, including seven employees with diplomatic status.

Undersecretary Märt Volmer, who presented the note, said they must leave Estonia by April 30.

Volmer said in light of the constant news of atrocities committed by the Russian forces, including in Bucha and elsewhere, there can be no talk of business as usual, especially in view of Russia's grave violation of international law, including the international commitments it has taken upon itself.

The undersecretary added the perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity must be held accountable, a statement from the ministry said.

Volmer reiterated that Russia's actions in Ukraine were unacceptable. Russia must also withdraw its forces from Ukraine and take responsibility for the war damages it has caused.

On Tuesday, Latvia sent out 13 consular staff and diplomats and closed two consulates.

On Monday, Lithuania went further, telling the Russian ambassador to leave, recalling its ambassador from Moscow and closing a consulate in the port city of Klaipeda.

Alexander Mamayev, consul of the Russian Federation in Narva, stepped out. He was there to wave off three colleagues whom the Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs had declared persona non grata and given 72 hours to leave the country. It was part of Estonia’s response to show solidarity with Ukraine.

Their names have not been publicly revealed, but New Lines, in cooperation with investigative partner Delfi Estonia, can reveal that one of the three diplomats was Sergey Nalobin. As Russia did not have an accredited ambassador in Tallinn at that time, Nalobin — who holds the diplomatic rank of a minister-counselor — was the chargé d’affaires at the time of the expulsion.

The deportation of Nalobin was confirmed off the record by two different sources. And according to open-source data, attachés Anton Kovalenko and Nikita Petrov also lost their diplomatic credentials.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs emphasized — without identifying any of the three diplomats — that all three were “directly and actively engaged in undermining Estonia’s security and disseminating propaganda justifying Russia’s military action [against Ukraine].”

Nalobin’s personal background and previous activities as a diplomat were, to put it mildly, colorful, raising questions about why he received diplomatic credentials from Tallinn in the first place.

A 2012 joint investigation by The Guardian and The Insider, an independent Russian news outlet that was recently forced to close as part of the Russian government’s ongoing crackdown on the media, found that Nalobin has family ties to the FSB, Russia’s Federal Security Service, and that while serving as a diplomat in London, he was instructed by Moscow to cultivate ties with the British Conservative Party.

The Conservative Friends of Russia, a now-defunct pro-Kremlin parliamentary group launched in 2012 at the Russian Embassy at the invitation of Nalobin, was the vehicle through which these links were forged. The objective, according to Luke Harding, a co-author of the investigation, was to “to see off motions [Russia] regards as hostile.”

Among the guests at the launch party were Matthew Elliott, former head of the pro-Brexit movement Vote Leave; John Whittingdale, a member of Parliament and honorary vice president of the group; and Carrie Symonds, who at the time worked in Whittingdale’s office and is now married to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. In fact, even Johnson socialized with Nalobin. In a Twitter post, since deleted, that included a photo of Johnson and Nalobin posing together, Nalobin described Johnson, then mayor of London, as “our good friend.”

All of these figures went on to play prominent roles in Brexit, which culminated in Britain’s voting to leave the EU in 2016.

Political blogger Paul Staines, who later wrote about his exposure to Nalobin in The Spectator, said that he immediately suspected Nalobin was a Russian spy and that he was very surprised to see him at a private Tory party in 2014 where outsiders were not invited.

Nalobin’s ties to the FSB caused controversy for the Conservative Friends of Russia. (The group later rebranded as the Westminster Russia Forum, and on March 9, the forum disbanded following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.) His father, Nikolai, was a KGB general, while his brother Viktor also worked for the FSB until at least 2013. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Nikolai worked at the FSB as the deputy head of the economic counterintelligence service. Among other responsibilities, he was the supervisor to Alexander Litvinenko, the former FSB agent who fled to the U.K. in 2000 and worked for the British intelligence services before he was poisoned with the highly radioactive substance polonium-210 in London in 2006.

The U.K. government published the findings of its inquiry into the murder of Litvinenko in 2016 and concluded that the FSB operation was “probably approved” by Putin.

There is no direct proof that Nalobin is a spy, but his proximity to Russian security services raises red flags.

The diplomat, characterized by many as very communicative and active on social media, did not reply to requests for comment.

According to the Dossier Center, Nalobin, born in 1979, received his education in international law from the elite MGIMO University (Moscow State Institute of International Relations). He worked for a security company and law firm before joining the Russian Foreign Ministry in 2000. In his diplomatic career, there are no “gaps” in his timeline that would be characteristic of intelligence officers.

In the end, the British forced Nalobin to leave London. He was not officially declared a persona non grata or blacklisted. Rather his permission to stay was suddenly revoked by the Home Office in 2015. Nalobin’s service continued in the headquarters of Russia’s Foreign Ministry in Moscow, where, for example, he headed the Department of Digital Diplomacy Development. According to one source, Nalobin fell out with Maria Zakharova, the notorious spokesperson for the Russian Foreign Ministry. This quarrel was said to be the reason Nalobin landed in Tallinn in September 2019.

An individual in Estonia who is familiar with how Nalobin operates called him extremely active. “He was not like the average Russian diplomat who does not come out of the embassy and who speaks only the official talking points of the Russian Foreign Ministry.”

According to this person, Nalobin interacted with many people in Tallinn and tried to dig his way into high society — just as he did in London.

Marko Mihkelson, chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Estonian Parliament, said that he did not often come into personal contact with Nalobin, but he noticed Nalobin’s activity, primarily on social media. “He loved to tag me to all kinds of Russian propaganda articles that he posted,” Mihkelson said.

Nalobin did not respond on social media to questions posed by Estonian news site Delfi. However, the Russian Embassy in Tallinn emailed one of the authors and stated that the Estonian Foreign Ministry’s accusations that the expelled diplomats had been undermining Estonia’s security were “absurd and ridiculous.”

Mihkel Tamm, director general of public relations for the Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that Nalobin’s background was familiar to the ministry before he was granted diplomatic accreditation. “The non-issuance of visas to foreign diplomats is rather a very exceptional measure, which is always carefully considered by the host country,” he said, adding that the host country expects incoming diplomats to adhere to diplomatic procedures and practices.

“It must always be borne in mind that in the event of a visa being refused, it can be assumed that there may be a countermeasure.”

On April 4, the ministry announced that it was shutting down Russia’s consulate-general in the border town Narva and a consular office in the town of Tartu. As a result, 14 employees, including seven diplomats, will be sent across the Narva River to Russia. This includes Alexander Mamayev, who only two weeks ago waved off Nalobin.",https://newlinesmag.com/reportage/estonia-expels-a-colorful-russian-diplomat/

More countries continue to expel Russian diplomats as part of the fallout from Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.

Here's a list of countries and the actions they have taken:

Italy has expelled 30 Russian diplomats for ""national security"" reasons, Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said in Berlin on Tuesday.

The decision ""taken in agreement with other European and Atlantic partners"" was needed for ""reasons related to our national security, in the context of the current crisis resulting from the unjustified aggression against Ukraine by the Russian Federation,"" Di Maio said.

""Italy is available to act as a guarantor of security and peace in Ukraine and we will do whatever it takes to carry out this work.""

Spain is expelling “about 25 Russian diplomats and embassy staff who represent a threat to the security interests of our country,” Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said Tuesday at news conference in Madrid.

The expulsions also “come after the terrible actions in recent days in Ukraine, especially in Bucha,” Albares said, in reference to images of Ukrainian civilians killed in that town at close range.

Spain’s Foreign Ministry press office said those expelled will have a few days to prepare for their departure. The list does not include the Russian ambassador to Spain, the press office added.

Sweden has expelled three Russian diplomats for carrying out intelligence operations in the country in breach of diplomatic relations, Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde said in a news conference in Stockholm on Tuesday, condemning ""war crimes committed by Russia"" in reference to scenes from Bucha.

She added that Sweden wants ""to see a fifth sanction package as soon as possible that goes further when it comes to Russian exports of fossil fuels.""

Latvia announced Tuesday that it was closing two Russian consulates and expelling staff over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Tuesday. The Russian ambassador to Latvia was told that the consulates in the Latvian cities of Daugavpils and Liepāja must close and their staff leave the country by the end of the month, the foreign ministry added.

“The decision was taken in solidarity with Ukraine in its fight against the unprovoked and unjustified military aggression and war started by Russia,” a ministry statement read.

Estonia has said it will shut down both Russian consulates in the country and expel 14 staff in light of the atrocities revealed to have been committed by Russian forces against Ukrainian civilians.

Seven of the employees have diplomatic status, according to a statement from Estonia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The former Soviet state is the latest European country to participate in Tuesday’s mass expulsion of Russian diplomats.

Consulates in Narva and Tartu will close and staff have until April 30 to leave, the Russian ambassador was told, according to the Estonian Foreign Ministry. Russia still has an embassy operating in Estonia’s capital city of Tallinn.

Several European countries – including France, Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands – also decided to expel Russian diplomats. Denmark said Tuesday it has expelled 15 alleged Russian intelligence officers it claims were working undercover as diplomats.

Russia's response: Russia on Tuesday warned the European Union of “adequate reciprocal measures” after the bloc designated 19 Russian diplomats to the European Union as “persona non grata” over its invasion of Ukraine, the Permanent Mission of the Russian Federation to the EU said in a statement.

""This openly unfriendly — moreover, hostile and, most importantly, completely groundless step continues the European Union's policy of dismantling the partnership between Russia and the EU, which until recently both sides proudly called strategic,” the statement said.

The expulsion of Russian diplomats is a “short-sighted step” that will “inevitably lead to retaliatory steps,” the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters on a regular conference call on Tuesday.
