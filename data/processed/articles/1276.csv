The European Union is heavily reliant on energy imports from Russia, a big producer of oil, diesel, coal and, perhaps most important, natural gas. That dependence has become a growing problem as the European Union seeks to punish Mr. Putin. Russia provides about 40 percent of Europe’s natural gas, and a sizable chunk of it is shipped by pipeline through Ukraine.

Germany has long been one of Russia’s biggest customers. Having decided to shut down its nuclear plants, Germany has increasingly relied on natural gas. Because it got relatively affordable gas by pipeline from Russia — and some from the Netherlands, Norway and other suppliers — it declined to build any terminals where liquefied natural gas could be imported.

Germany also imports nearly a third of its crude oil from Russia. It has been trying to slash its consumption with generous subsidies for electric cars and greater investment in public transportation.

The Ukraine war has accelerated such German efforts under Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who leads a coalition government made up of conservatives, liberals and environmentalists. Germany this year has revived plans to build gas importing terminals and has suspended final approvals of Nord Stream 2, an almost-complete pipeline that would have fed it a steady supply of Russian gas.

“Every supply contract that is terminated hurts Putin,” Mr. Habeck said on Friday.

Later in the day, E.U. countries agreed to jointly purchase and store natural gas. They set a target of filling 80 percent of their underground gas storage facilities by November as a buffer against supply disruptions during winter, when gas use increases for heating.

In the United States, gas exporters were already shifting sales to Europe from Asia in recent months, largely because prices in Europe have been higher than almost anywhere else in the world because of rising tensions with Russia and, more recently, the war in Ukraine. Nearly 75 percent of U.S. L.N.G. exports have gone to Europe so far this year, up from 34 percent in 2021. The Biden administration has encouraged that shift by relaxing export restrictions to certain European countries.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/25/business/energy-environment/biden-eu-liquefied-natural-gas-deal-russia.html

The main question now isn’t whether Putin will win his war, but how many more Ukrainians will have to die to give him a face-saving way to stop this senseless slaughter.

No matter how the fighting ends, the Ukrainian people have shown that they will never willingly submit to rule by Moscow. Putin’s ham-fisted attempt to bend a former Russian colony to his will has turned into Ukraine’s war of independence, with President Volodymyr Zelensky, a former comedian, cast improbably in the role of George Washington.

Of course, Russia has by far the stronger military and evidently no moral compunctions about using it to massacre Ukrainian civilians. Can Putin inflict enough pain on Ukrainian society to wring big concessions from its government? Possibly, but so far Ukraine’s defenders are more than holding their own.

{mosads}The Russian dictator is caught in his own web of historical delusions and disinformation. Few outside Russia believe his ludicrous claims that Ukraine’s democratically elected leaders are “fascists” scheming with America to prevent Ukrainians from voluntarily reuniting with Mother Russia. Yet in launching his second invasion in eight years, Putin seems to have expected that his forces would easily topple Zelensky’s government, allowing him to install a more compliant regime in Kyiv.

Instead, Ukrainians are fighting for their freedom. This has forced Putin to set aside his dream of absorbing Ukraine into Russia. Now he demands that Ukraine commit itself to “neutrality,” which would rule out future membership in NATO and possibly the European Union as well. For good measure, Putin wants Kyiv to accept Russia’s seizure of Crimea in 2014 and recognize two breakaway eastern provinces as independent states.

But even if Putin gets all of what he wants, it won’t be enough to compensate for what he has already lost by attacking Ukraine. From a strategic, military and economic standpoint, a weaker and more isolated Russia is bound to emerge from this needless war.

Putin insists the war is necessary to bolster Russian security, but it’s having the opposite effect. For starters, it has jolted NATO, Putin’s nemesis, back to life. And how many Russians who know their country’s history welcome the news that Germany is rearming and, in a break from its pacifistic post-war diplomacy, supplying weapons to Kyiv?

RELATED OP-EDS FROM THE HILL

—

Before the invasion, Putin faced a divided and often feckless Europe. Now the continent seems more unified than ever as leaders condemn Russian throwback militarism and cheer on Ukraine’s valiant defense of Europe’s liberal and democratic values. Europeans are working with Washington to impose punishing economic sanctions and say they will start reducing their heavy dependence on Russian oil and gas.

President Biden is in Europe this week to rally support for NATO and additional sanctions. He’s also determined to show both Putin and our transatlantic partners that his country’s backsliding into “America First” insularity is over. Putin has even managed to bring Washington’s warring political tribes closer together, at least for the moment.

The second major casualty of Putin’s war is Russia’s reputation for military prowess. U.S. military observers have been stunned by how ill-prepared Russia forces were to meet determined and effective Ukrainian resistance. Despite huge increases in defense spending over the past decade, Russia’s vaunted military has been hobbled by stagnant tactics, poor coordination and logistics and low morale.

This is devastating to Putin, because military power is really the only kind Russia has left. He figures the way to make Russia great again is to make it feared again. That’s why he keeps invoking the specter of nuclear war and why he has deployed showy “hypersonic” missiles with little tactical utility in Ukraine.

It would be a mistake to view Russia’s military as yet another Potemkin Village — an imposing façade with little behind it. But if Russia is struggling to subdue Ukraine, it’s hard to believe it poses a dire military threat to the richer and collectively far more populous countries of Europe, even if they weren’t backed by the United States.

U.S. intelligence sources estimate that more than 7,000 Russian soldiers have died in the past month of fighting – more than the United States lost in Iraq and Afghanistan. Putin is a ruthless ruler who brooks no dissent, but even he has to be sensitive to ordinary Russians’ reactions as their sons die in his “special military operation.”

Finally, Putin’s latest misadventure in Ukraine is an economic calamity for Russia. This time around, the West is escalating from narrowly targeted sanctions whose impact is mostly symbolic to all-out financial warfare.

{mossecondads}The United States and its allies have locked Russian banks and financial institutions out the world’s SWIFT messaging system. They have frozen a large chunk of the central bank’s reserves of foreign currency. This especially is a blow to Russia’s ability to pay for imports and service its debts. It likely will send the ruble and bond credit ratings into free fall, precipitating a default that would effectively prevent Russia from borrowing abroad.

Meanwhile, Western companies are pulling out of Russia, governments are revoking trade treaties, Russian goods are the subject of boycotts and its airlines are banned from Western airspace. As Nicholas Mulder writes in Foreign Affairs, “the world’s eleventh-largest economy has now been decoupled from twenty-first-century globalization.”

The Biden administration has also announced a ban on Russian energy imports. If European countries follow suit, the Russian petrostate would take another huge hit. Europe relies on Russian gas to meet about 40 percent of its energy needs. Russia could find new buyers elsewhere, say in China and India, although that could be complicated by its demand that its customers pay in rubles rather than dollars.

Will ratcheting up the economic pressure on Putin be enough to convince him to wind down the military pressure on Ukraine? No one knows. We are witnessing an unprecedented application of Western financial power, with incalculable effects on Russia’s economy, which is expected to shrink this year, as well as global markets.

But this is already clear: The longer Putin’s war in Ukraine grinds on, the deeper the damage it will do to Russia’s great power status, military credibility and economic strength.

PRESIDENT BIDEN: Good morning. Today I’m proud to once again be standing together with President von der Leyen as we announce a new groundbreaking initiative between the European Union and the United States.



First, we’re coming together to reduce Europe’s dependence on Russian energy. Putin has issued Russia’s energy resources to coerce and manipulate its neighbors. That’s how he’s used it. He’s used the profits to drive his war machine.



And that’s why, earlier this month, I announced the United States would ban all imports of Russian energy to make it clear that the American people would not be part of subsidizing Putin’s brutal, unjustified war against the people of Ukraine.



At the time, I noted that we were able to take those steps when others could not because the United States is a net energy exporter of energy, with a strong domestic industry.



And the United States welcomed the European Union’s powerful statement earlier this month committing to rapidly reduce its dependence on Russian gas.

Today we’ve agreed on a joint game plan toward that goal while accelerating our progress toward a secure clean energy future.



This initiative focuses on two core issues: One, helping Europe reduce its dependency on Russian gas as quickly as possible. And, secondly, reducing Europe’s demand for gas overall.



To address the first point, the United States, together with our international partners, they’re going to — we’re going to work to ensure an additional 15 — one-five — 15 billion cubic meters of liquified natural gas — LNG — for Europe this year.



And as the EU works to discontinue buying Russian gas well before 2030, it will also work to ensure additional EU market demand for 50 billion cubic meters of LNG from the United States annually by 2030.



To accomplish this, the European Commission is going to work with the member states to store gas across the continent, to build more infrastructure to receive LNG, and to take steps to increase the efficiency of gas.



This build-out — this build-out will occur in a way that consists — is consistent with, not in conflict with, the zero — net-zero climate goal we — that we’re shooting for. It’s going to take some time to adjust gas supply chains and infrastructure as is built the last decade — for the last decade.



So we’re going to have to make sure the families in Europe can get through this winter and the next while we’re building an infrastructure for a diversified, resilient, and clean energy future.



At the same time, this crisis also presents an opportunity. It’s a catalyst — a catalyst that will drive the investments we need to double-down on our clean energy goals and accelerate progress toward our net-zero emissions future.



That’s what the second part of this initiative is all about.



The United States and the European Union are going to work together to take concrete measures to reduce dependence on natural gas — period — and to maximize the available — the avail- — the availability and use of renewable energy.



We’re going to accelerate widespread adoption of energy-efficient technologies and equipment, like smart thermostats, the work — that work to — and work to electrify heating systems all across Europe.



We’re going to invest in innovative solutions and technologies to make the switch from fossil fuels.



And together, we’ll advance the use of clean and renewable hydrogen to reduce our carbon emissions.



This — these steps will increase energy security, economic security, and national security.



And we’re going to stand up a joint task force to implement these changes and drive progress that will be co-chaired by representatives from the White House and the President of the European Union’s team — Commission’s team.



Madam President, I know — I know that eliminating Russian gas will have costs for Europe. But it’s not only the right thing to do from a moral standpoint, it’s going to put us on a much stronger strategic footing.



And I’m proud to announce that we’ve also reached another major breakthrough in transatlantic data flows. Privacy and security are key elements of my digital agenda.



And today, we’ve agreed to unprecedented protections for data privacy and security for our citizens.



This new agreement will enhance the Privacy Shield Framework; promote growth and innovation in Europe and the United States; and help companies, both small and large, compete in the digital economy.



Just as we did when we resolved the Boeing-Airbus dispute and lifted the steel and aluminum tariffs, the United States and the EU are finding creative, new approaches to knit our economies and our people closer together, grounded on shared values.



This framework underscores our shared commitment to privacy, to data protection, and to the rule of law. And it’s going to allow the European Commission to once again authorize

transatlantic data flows that help facilitate $7.1 trillion in economic relationships with the EU.



So thank you again, Madam President, for your personal friendship, for your partnership, and above all, your leadership.



All of this is bringing the European Union and the United States even closer together, and that’s a win for all of us.



So I thank you all, and I’m now going to yield the podium to the President.



Let me pull this out. (Pulls out the step stool.) Got to earn my salary here. (Laughter.) Is it out enough? There you go. Thank you. (Laughs.)



PRESIDENT VON DER LEYEN: Thank you. Mr. President, Dear Joe, your presence here in Brussels this week — at the NATO summit, at the G7, and at our European Council — sends a very powerful message to the world.



The transatlantic partnership stands stronger and more united than ever. And we are determined to stand up against Russia’s brutal war. This war will be a strategic failure for Putin.



Our cooperation on the four successive waves of sanctions against Russia has been extraordinary and exceptional. The sanctions are now working their way deep into the Russian system, draining Putin’s resources to finance this atrocious war.



Our work on sanctions also shows that when we act together, we’re stronger and we really can make a difference.



And we are continuing to reinforce our cooperation in many strategic ways: on humanitarian and security assistance to Ukraine; on energy; on fighting the threats against our democracies; on solving outstanding issues in the EU-U.S. cooperation, including in data protec- — protection and privacy.



In a world faced with disorder, our transatlantic unity upholds fundamental values and rules that our citizens believe in. Let me focus first on refugees.



Until now, around three and a half million people have left Ukraine, half of them children. Every second refugee is a child. And the numbers will keep rising. So, together, we are mobilizing massive resources to support those displaced by the conflict, be it in Ukraine or in the neighboring countries.



Just this week, for example, I announced that the European Union will allocate an extra 3.4 billion euros for this purpose, and more will come. This demonstrates our deep support for Ukraine and its citizens.



And I want to tell the American people how grateful Europe is for their unwavering support. This support also extends to strengthening Europe’s energy security and independence from Russian fossil fuels. As you know, we aim to reduce this dependency on Russian fossil fuels and to get rid of it. And this can only be achieved through, of course, first of all, investment in renewables, but also through additional gas supplies, including LNG deliveries.



So we want, as Europeans, to diversify away from Russia, towards suppliers that we trust, that are friends, and that are reliable.



And therefore, the U.S. commitment to provide the European Union with additional at least 15 billion cubic meters of LNG this year is a big step in this direction because this will replace the LNG supply we currently receive from Russia.



And looking ahead, the United States and Europe will ensure stable demand and supply for additional at least 50 billion cubic meter of U.S. LNG until 2030. And if we look at that, this amount, 50 bcm per year, is replacing one third already of the Russian gas going to Europe today. So, we are right in — on track now to diversify away from Russian gas and towards our friends’ and partners’ reliable and trustworthy suppliers.



We need to secure our supplies not just for next winter but also for the years ahead. And this is a — an important, a big starting point to do that.



Our partnership aims to sustain us through this war, to work on our independence from Russian fossil fuels, but it also focuses on building a greener future with climate neutrality. We will work together also with our energy-intensive industry. And the good news is that the infrastructure that we use for gas today can be used for clean hydrogen in the future. So, this investment we are doing right now is also an investment in the decarbonizing of our economy.



The cooperation shows the power of our democracies. I particularly welcome that we will step up our respective action on strengthening democracies, the rule of law, the freedom of media in the world.



And we also need to continue adapting our own democracies to a changing world. This is particularly true when it comes to digitalization, in which the protection of personal data and privacy has become so crucial.



And therefore, I’m very pleased that we have found an agreement in principle on a new framework for transatlantic data flows. This will enable predictable and trustworthy data flows between the EU and U.S., safeguarding privacy and civil liberties.



And I really want to thank Commissioner Reynders and Secretary Raimondo for their tireless efforts over the past month to finish a balanced and effective solution. This is another step in our — strengthening our partnership. We managed to balance security and the right to privacy and data protection.



Mr. President, Dear Joe: Putin is trying to turn back the clock to another era — an era of brutal use of force, of power politics, of spheres of influence, and internal repression. I am confident he will fail.



We are working together to forge a peaceful, prosperous, and sustainable future. And I know we will succeed.



Thank you very much.



PRESIDENT BIDEN: Thank you.



PRESIDENT VON DER LEYEN: Thank you very much.



PRESIDENT BIDEN: Thank you, everyone.

3,68f11632-4370-4172-8f4f-6da12d9ade96,[],2022-03-25 00:00:00,"US, EU announce new partnership to undercut Russian energy

The United States and European Union on Friday announced a new partnership to reduce the continent’s reliance on Russian energy, a step top officials characterized as the start of a years-long initiative to further isolate Moscow after its invasion of Ukraine.

U.S. President Joe Biden asserted that Russian President Vladimir Putin uses energy to “coerce and manipulate his neighbors” and uses the profits from its sale to “drive his war machine.”

Biden said the partnership he announced jointly with a top European Union official will turn that dynamic on its head by reducing Europe’s dependence on Russian energy sources, as well reducing the continent’s demand for gas overall.

The president said such a step is not “only the right thing to do from a moral standpoint” but “it’s going to put us on a stronger strategic footing.”

Under the plan, the U.S. and other nations will increase liquified natural gas exports to Europe by 15 billion cubic meters this year, though U.S. officials were unable to say exactly which countries will provide the extra energy this year. Even larger shipments would be delivered in the future.

At the same time, they will try to keep their climate goals on track by powering gas infrastructure with clean energy and reducing methane leaks that can worsen global warming.

Although the initiative will likely require new facilities for importing liquified natural gas, the partnership is also geared toward reducing reliance on fossil fuels in the long run through energy efficiency and alternative sources of energy, according to the White House.

Ursula von der Leyen, head of the EU’s executive arm, said it is important for Europe to shift away from Russia and toward energy suppliers that are trustworthy, friendly and reliable.

“We aim to reduce this dependence on Russian fossil fuels and get rid of it,” she said.

Russian energy is a key source of income and political leverage for Moscow. Almost 40% of the European Union’s natural gas comes from Russia to heat homes, generate electricity and power industry.

Biden was leaving Brussels after the announcement and heading to Rzeszów in Poland, where U.S. troops are based roughly an hour’s drive from the Ukrainian border.

He will be briefed on the humanitarian response to the refugees streaming out of Ukraine and those still suffering inside the country. He also will meet with U.S. service members from the 82nd Airborne Division, who serve alongside Polish troops.

Biden is then expected to fly to Warsaw for talks Saturday with Polish President Andrzej Duda and an address to the Polish people before he departs for Washington.

While in Brussels, Biden participated in a trio of summits hosted by NATO, the Group of Seven industrialized nations and the European Union, all on Thursday. The extraordinary series of meetings reflects heightened concerns about the war in Ukraine, which has entered its second month.

Although Ukraine has resisted the Russian invasion much more successfully than initially expected, the conflict has become a grueling and bloody affair, with thousands of casualties on each side and millions of refugees fleeing the country.

Western leaders are also concerned that Russian President Vladimir Putin could use chemical or even nuclear weapons to regain momentum in the war.

Getting more liquefied natural gas to Europe could be difficult, even though the U.S. has been dramatically increasing its exports in recent years. Many export facilities are already operating at capacity, and most new terminals are still only in the planning stages.

Most U.S. shipments already go to Europe, according to the Center for Liquefied Natural Gas, an industry lobbying group. Although much of the supply is already contracted out to buyers, there are still opportunities to shift its destination.

“The U.S. is in a unique position because it has flexible LNG that can be rerouted to Europe or to Asia, depending on who’s willing to pay that price,” said Emily McClain, gas markets analyst at Rystad.

Even if the U.S. can ship more gas to Europe, the continent may struggle to receive it. Import terminals are located in coastal areas, where there are fewer pipeline connections for distributing it.

And if all Europe’s facilities were operating at capacity, the amount of gas would likely be only about two-thirds of what Russia delivers through pipelines.

9:10 pm: Ukrainians fighting to retake Kherson, now 'contested' city

Ukrainian forces have launched a counter-offensive in Kherson, the country's only major city seized by Russian troops, and it is once again ""contested"", a senior US defense official said Friday.

""The Ukrainians are trying to take Kherson back, and we would argue that Kherson is actually contested territory again,"" the Pentagon official told reporters.

""We can't corroborate exactly who is in control of Kherson but the point is, it doesn't appear to be as solidly in Russian control as it was before,"" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

If the Ukrainian forces manage to regain control of the strategic city located at the mouth of the Dnieper, Russian troops around Mikolaiv would be ""sandwiched"" between Ukrainian forces defending Mikolaiv and those in Kherson, the official said.

Georgia mourned Friday two retired military officers who died fighting in Ukraine, in a war that has reminded Georgians of their own conflict with Russia in 2008.

The full-scale offensive on Ukraine unleashed by the Kremlin a month ago sparked an outpouring of solidarity in fellow ex-Soviet country Georgia, with hundreds of Georgians joining the ranks of the Ukrainian army.

Among them were retired military officers Giorgi Beriashvili and David Ratiani, both 53, who were killed on March 17 near the flashpoint town of Irpin on the outskirts of Kyiv.

5:10 pm: EU leaders struggle for deal on energy crunch fix

European Union leaders struggled to agree on steps to ease the energy market crunch exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, seeking difficult compromises on how to limit the impact for hard-hit consumers of soaring gas and oil prices.

Discussions on the second day of a summit in Brussels were ""intense,"" an EU official said, while adding that the leaders of the 27 nations did appear to be moving towards an agreement on some of the points - in particular on joint gas purchases.

Proposals to cap power prices for businesses and households were much trickier, and there was no deal in sight on banning energy imports from Russia, Europe's top gas supplier.

4:48 pm: 'Majority of Americans believe Biden is not tough enough'

“There has been a sort of shift as this war has gone on. Initially there was bipartisan unity to face Russia and unity behind the president– there was unity on what sanctions to take, unity on the fact that the US needed to help the Europeans and help Ukrainians,” FRANCE 24’s Kethevane Gorjestani reports from Washington DC in the video below.

“But now there have been a couple of polls in the past 24 hours showing a majority of Americans believe Biden is not doing enough to support Ukraine and not being tough enough on Russia,” Gorjestani continued.

4:15 pm: HSBC steps up scrutiny of Russian clients worldwide

HSBC is shunning prospective Russian clients and declining credit to some existing ones, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, as the bank seeks to shield itself from Western sanctions against Moscow.

The measures affect HSBC's individual and business customers globally and go further than the bank's previously stated intentions to wind down its relations with lenders such as VTB, which were placed under Western restrictions after Russia invaded Ukraine.

The moves by Europe's second biggest bank show how sanctions aimed at Russia's financial system and its political and business elite are also ensnaring Russian nationals outside the country as lenders seek to avoid falling foul of the restrictions and potentially hefty fines.

3:50 pm: Hungary's Orban rejects Zelensky appeal for weapons, tougher sanctions

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban dismissed Friday an EU summit appeal by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for weapons and tougher sanctions against Russia as it would be ""against Hungary's interests"".

Orban ""rejected (Zelensky's) demands at the European Council because they are contrary to the interests of Hungary"", said Hungarian government spokesperson Zoltan Kovacs. ""Hungary wants to stay out of this war, so it will not allow the transfer of arms and weapons to Ukraine,"" Kovacs added in a statement.

3:48 pm: Russia warns Europe of gas bills in roubles within days

Russia warned that billing in roubles for billions of dollars of natural gas exports to Europe could be just days away, Moscow's toughest response yet to crippling sanctions imposed by the West for the invasion of Ukraine.

With the Russian economy facing its gravest crisis since the years that followed the break-up of the Soviet Union, President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday hit back at the West, ordering that Russian gas exports should be paid for in roubles.

The Kremlin on Friday said Putin had ordered Gazprom, the world's biggest natural gas company, which supplies 40 percent of Europe's gas, to accept export payments in roubles, and that it had just four days left to work out how.

3:45 pm: Neutral Swiss adopt more EU sanctions on Russia

The Swiss government had adopted more European Union sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, the cabinet said on Friday.

""This means that all measures contained in the EU's fourth package of sanctions have been implemented,"" it said in a statement, adding it had decided not to implement the EU measure of March 1 suspending the broadcasting of Russian media outlets Sputnik and Russia Today.

3:34 pm: NATO says cannot allow Arctic 'security vacuum' amid Ukraine war

NATO cannot allow a security vacuum to develop in the Arctic, where the alliance sees ""growing strategic competition"" from Russia and China, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said.

""We cannot afford a security vacuum in the High North. It could fuel Russian ambitions, expose NATO and risk miscalculation and misunderstandings,"" Stoltenberg said. ""We also see an increased Chinese interest in the region. China has defined itself as a near Arctic state and aims to build a presence here,"" he added.

3:31 pm: Poland’s Rzeszow an ‘important destination’ for Biden

“There are several reasons why Rzeszow is an important destination for the US president,” FRANCE 24’s Ellen Gainsford reports on the ground in the video below. “There’s a military base on the outskirts of the city that plays host to a large number of NATO troops, including US troops, and we’ve heard that is on his itinerary during his visit. And secondly it’s really on the frontline of the humanitarian crisis on the Polish border.”

3:25 pm: Germany would see Russian oil, gas ban as 'devastating'

It was “pretty clear” even before today that Europe was not going to follow the US in banning Russian fossil fuel imports, noted FRANCE 24’s Chief International Affairs Editor Robert Parsons in the video below.

“We’ve heard the Germans expressing reservations about what it would mean for them if they were suddenly to put a boycott on Russian oil and gas – ‘devastating’ for the German economy, according to Chancellor Olaf Scholz,” Parsons continued.

3:15 pm: Dozens of Ukrainian officials, journalists detained or disappeared, UN says

Dozens of Ukrainian officials, journalists and activists have been detained or forcibly disappeared by invading Russian forces, the UN said Friday, warning that some cases resembled ""hostage-taking"".

Since Russia invaded Ukraine just over a month ago, the United Nations rights office said it had documented the arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance of 22 local Ukrainian officials, 13 of whom had subsequently been released.

The most famous case was perhaps the mayor of Ukraine's southern city of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov, who Ukrainian authorities said was abducted by occupying Russian forces and held for several days before being released.

3:14 pm: US sanctions on China 'not necessary', Yellen says

US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Friday that sanctions against China are ""not necessary or appropriate"" since its support for Russia following the invasion of Ukraine was still unclear.

""I don't think that that's necessary or appropriate at this point,"" Yellen said in an interview with CNBC, adding that ""senior administration officials are talking privately quietly with China to make sure that they understand our position"". She noted Washington ""would be very concerned if they were to supply weapons to Russia. Or to try to evade the sanctions that we've put in place on the Russian financial system and the central bank. We don't see that happening at this point"".

Yellen also warned that petrol prices could rise further in the United States, where inflation is already at a rate not seen since the 1980s, helping sap Biden's popularity.

2:57 pm: US calls India's position on Ukraine 'unsatisfying'

A senior White House official said on Friday India's position over the crisis in Ukraine has been ""unsatisfactory"" but was also unsurprising given its historical relationship with Russia.

Mira Rapp-Hooper, director for the Indo-Pacific at the National Security Council, told a panel discussion it was necessary to provide India with alternatives to continued close ties with Russia.

2:55 pm: Russian negotiator says Moscow, Kyiv making limited progress on key issues

Russia and Ukraine are coming closer to an understanding on secondary issues at peace talks but there has been limited progress on the key questions, Moscow negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said on Friday, the Interfax news agency reported.

""Negotiations have been going on all week, from Monday to Friday, in video conference format, and will continue tomorrow,"" Interfax quoted Medinsky as saying. ""On secondary issues, positions are converging. However, on the main political issues, we are, in fact, treading water.""

2:49 pm: Russian army says 1,351 soldiers killed

The Russian army on Friday updated its losses in Ukraine to 1,351 soldiers killed and 3,825 wounded, while saying that it had evacuated more than 400,000 civilians and condemning Western supplies of weapons to Kyiv.

2:45 pm: Putin compares attacks on Russian culture to Nazi book burnings

President Vladimir Putin on Friday slammed the West for discriminating against Russian culture, which he likened to Nazi supporters burning books in the 1930s.

""Today they are trying to cancel a thousand-year-old country,"" Putin said during a televised meeting with Russian winners of culture-related prizes.

""I am talking about the progressive discrimination against everything connected with Russia, about this trend that is unfolding in a number of Western states, with the full connivance and sometimes with the encouragement of Western elites,"" Putin added.

2:33 pm: Russian ambassador sues Italian paper over Putin article

The Russian ambassador to Italy, Sergey Razov, said on Friday he was suing Italian newspaper La Stampa over an article that had raised the possibility of killing President Vladimir Putin.

""Needless to say that this goes against the rules of journalism and morality,"" Razov told reporters in front of the prosecutor's office in Rome after he had deposited the suit.

On March 22 La Stampa published an analysis headlined ""If killing the tyrant is the only option"". The piece said if all other options failed to halt the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the only solution might be for someone to kill the president.

2:30 pm: Russia will focus war effort on Donbas

Russia's defence ministry said on Friday that the first phase of its military operation in Ukraine was mostly complete and that it would focus oncompletely ""liberating"" eastern Ukraine's Donbas region.

5,68f11632-4370-4172-8f4f-6da12d9ade96,[],,"Biden says in Poland that the stakes of Ukraine war go well beyond its borders

President Joe Biden announced a new initiative meant to deprive Russian President Vladimir Putin of European energy profits that Biden says are used to fuel Russia's war in Ukraine.

By Kevin Liptak and Maegan Vazquez, CNN

(CNN) -- President Joe Biden told American troops on a deterrence mission near the border with Ukraine that the consequences of the raging conflict 50 miles away could extend around the world.

""What's at stake (is) not just what we're doing here in Ukraine to help the Ukrainian people and keep the massacre from continuing, but beyond that what's at stake is what are your kids and grandkids going to look like in terms of their freedom?"" Biden told US service members from the 82nd Airborne Division, who have been deployed along NATO's eastern edge as a visible deterrent to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

""What you're engaged in is much more than whether or not we can alleviate the suffering of Ukraine,"" he went on. ""We're in a new phase, your generation. We're at an inflection point.""

It was a sweeping view of the war underway in Ukraine, which has jolted the west into unprecedented cooperation while sending millions fleeing their homes, mostly into Poland. Biden was able to witness both of those factors at close range during his visit to Rzeszow, which has acted as a staging area for Western military assistance to Ukraine while also serving as a waypoint for people fleeing the violence.

As Biden was arriving, anti-aircraft missiles could be seen on the grounds of the airport. Later, he met with aid workers to hear their accounts of helping alleviate the humanitarian crisis, which he said was put in motion by a leader, Putin, whom he again described as a war criminal.

Speaking during a roundtable focused on the refugee issue, Biden said he would have preferred to see the crisis from an even closer perspective but was prevented by security concerns.

""They will not let me, understandably, I guess, cross the border and take a look at what's going on in Ukraine,"" he said. The White House has said it did not explore a visit to Ukraine.

Biden told the US troops, assembled inside a stadium, that their mission was more than simply sending a message to Russia. Instead, he said they were acting as a signal to all the world's autocrats.

""The question is, who is going to prevail? Is democracy going to prevail and the values we share? Or are autocracies going to prevail? That's really what's at stake,"" Biden said. ""What you're doing is consequential, really consequential.""

Echoing the expansive foreign policy frame he's used previously, but with a Russian twist, he said the assembled US service members were ""in the midst of a fight between democracies and oligarchs.""

Biden is in Europe this week on a hastily arranged bid to reinforce Western cooperation and reassure countries the United States will help protect their security. Before he arrived in Poland, he announced a new initiative with the European Union meant to deprive Putin of energy profits that Biden said are used being to fuel Russia's war in Ukraine.

Speaking in Brussels alongside European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Biden said Russia was using its supply of oil and gas to ""coerce and manipulate its neighbors."" He said the United States would help Europe reduce its dependence on Russian oil and gas and would ensure the continent had enough supplies for the next two winters.

Meeting troops who are in Poland on a reassurance and deterrence mission

Biden arrived midday Friday in Poland, where the regional security issues and the humanitarian catastrophe that he'd discussed during a series of summits a day earlier were put into sharper focus.

""I just wanted to come by and say thanks. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you,"" Biden said as he walked into a cafeteria where US troops had gathered, adding: ""it's not hyperbole to suggest, you are the finest fighting force in the world ... in the history of the world.""

Noting the pizza the soldiers were eating for lunch looked appetizing, Biden took a slice for himself and sat down to chat.

The President has made clear that US troops won't travel into Ukraine to directly fight Russian forces, suggesting such a step would lead to World War III. But he has ordered new rotational deployments along NATO's eastern edge to demonstrate American commitment to protecting the alliance.

He was greeted in Poland by President Andrzej Duda, who has called for a more permanent NATO defense posture in the country along with an international peacekeeping force in Ukraine. US officials have not warmed to the peacekeeping proposition, suggesting it could violate Biden's red line of keeping US troops out of the conflict.

Speaking to US service members, Biden hailed the Ukrainian people, whom he said were demonstrating admirable resolve.

""The Ukrainian people have a lot of backbone, a lot of guts. I'm sure you're observing it. And I don't mean just a military,"" he said.

He went on to make an apparent slip by suggesting the gathered US troops would see the Ukrainians in action themselves.

""The average citizen, look at how they're stepping up. And you're going to see when you're there, I don't know if you've been there, you're going to see women, young people, standing in the middle of the damn tank, saying, 'I'm not leaving. I'm holding my ground,'"" he said.

Biden and his administration have been adamant that US service members will not be deployed to Ukraine and all US armed forces who had been in the country had been removed ahead of the Russian invasion. A White House spokesperson later said, ""The President has been clear we are not sending US troops to Ukraine and there is no change in that position.""

Later, while receiving a briefing on the humanitarian response to the crisis in Ukraine, Biden said the images coming from the country are ""something out of a science fiction movie.""

""Those little babies. Little children. You're looking at mothers -- you don't have to understand the language they speak -- you see in their eyes pain and I mean literally pain watching their children. I don't think there's anything worse for a parent than see their children suffering,"" Biden said.

More than 3.5 million refugees have now fled Ukraine, according to data from the United Nations refugee agency released on Tuesday. A vast majority of those refugees have fled to Ukraine's western neighbors across Europe.

Poland, which borders Ukraine to the west, has registered more than 2 million Ukrainian refugees crossing into the country. However, the number of refugees staying in Poland is lower, with many continuing on in their journey to other countries.

Earlier this month during Vice President Kamala Harris' trip to Poland, Duda personally asked the vice president to speed up and simplify the procedures allowing Ukrainians with family in the US to come to the country. He also warned Harris that his country's resources were being badly strained by the influx of refugees, even as Poland welcomes them with open arms.

The White House says that since February 24, the US has provided more than $123 million to assist countries neighboring Ukraine and the European Union to address the refugee influx, including $48 million in Poland.

And Biden announced this week the US would admit up to 100,000 people fleeing violence in Ukraine through a variety of migration channels.

New steps to wean Europe from dependence on natural gas

As Biden was departing Brussels earlier, he sought to smooth over one of the biggest cracks in Western unity in punishing Russia: Europe's dependence on Russian energy imports, which have continued to provide billions of dollars to Putin, even as Biden seeks to shut him off from the global economy.

Biden and von der Leyen announced a joint task force meant to help wean Europe from its dependence on Russian oil and gas. The panel, chaired by representatives from the White House and the European Commission, will be aimed toward finding alternative supplies of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and reducing overall demand for natural gas moving forward.

""It's going to take some time to adjust gas supply chains and infrastructure that (were) built for the last decade so we're going to have to make sure the families in Europe can get through this winter and the next while we're building an infrastructure for a diversified, resilient and clean energy future,"" Biden said.

Europe's dependence on Russian gas and oil has proved a major sticking point in western efforts to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. While the US banned Russian energy imports, Europe found it far more difficult to cut off its supplies.

""I know that eliminating Russian gas will have costs for Europe, but it's not only the right thing to do from a moral standpoint, it's going to put us on a much stronger strategic footing,"" he said.

The US will work toward supplying Europe with at least 15 billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas in 2022, in partnership with other nations, the White House said. The group will also work toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions through reducing methane emissions and using clean energy to power operations.

Senior administration officials said the 15 billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas come from multiple sources, including the United States and nations in Asia. But officials did not have an exact breakdown on where the gas was coming from. The announcement Friday was the culmination of a US effort over the past months to identify alternate sources of energy for Europe, particularly in Asia. Officials said those efforts would continue through this year to hit the target.

One official said weaning Europe from Russian energy amounted to ""replacing an unreliable supplier of LNG with a much more reliable supplier in the US.""

""This crisis also presents an opportunity. It's a catalyst,"" Biden said. ""A catalyst that will drive the investments we need to double down on our clean energy goals and accelerate progress towards our net zeroes emissions future.""

A focus on chemical weapons

The White House on Friday also sought to clarify another comment Biden made during Thursday's news conference -- when he said he would respond ""in kind"" if Russia used chemical weapons in Ukraine.

En route to Poland aboard Air Force One, US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the US response to a potential chemical weapons attack by Russia would be done in coordination with allies. Sullivan would not say what the response would entail, but said that Russia would pay a ""severe price"" and emphasized that ""the United States has no intention of using chemical weapons, period -- under any circumstances.""

The Poland trip also comes two weeks after the US rejected Poland's proposals to facilitate the transfer its MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine.

The US rejected Poland's proposals over fears that the US and NATO could be perceived as taking an escalatory step, further fomenting conflict between the alliance and Russia -- which adamantly opposes Ukraine's ambitions to join the NATO alliance.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly requested more aircraft for the invasion, making another appeal to NATO leaders on Thursday.

During a virtual address Thursday, Zelensky asked NATO members for ""1% of all your planes,"" later adding, ""You have thousands of fighter jets, but we have not been given one yet.""

Despite Zelensky's plea, a senior US official told CNN later on Thursday that the US position on the fighter jet issue has not changed.

This story has been updated with additional developments on Friday.

6,68f11632-4370-4172-8f4f-6da12d9ade96,[],,"The U.S. and European Union announced a new task force on Friday aimed entirely at reducing Europe's reliance on Russian gas in the face of Moscow's war on Ukraine. The initiative unveiled in Brussels by President Joe Biden and EU chief Ursula von der Leyen will see the U.S. work with partners to strive to supply Europe with an extra 15 billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, this year alone, they said.

The European Commission is to work with EU member nations to ensure they have infrastructure capable of receiving about 50 billion cubic meters, or bcm, of additional LNG until at least 2030, according to a factsheet provided by the White House. It was unclear whether that referred to amounts additional to last year's 22 bcm of U.S. exports to the EU.

""This initiative focuses on two core issues, one helping Europe to reduce its dependency on Russian gas as quickly as possible and secondly, reducing Europe's demand for gas overall,"" Mr. Biden said at a joint news conference with von der Leyen.

""Today we've agreed on a joint game plan toward that goal while accelerating our progress toward a secure clean energy future,"" he said.

The agreement raises environmental concerns over the construction of new LNG terminals in the U.S. and Europe which, once built, will likely be in operation for years to come, the New York Times reported. Made from natural gas that is cooled and kept in liquid form for easier transportation, LNG is a form of fossil fuel.

""If the LNG export industry expands as projected, it is likely to make it nearly impossible to keep global temperatures from increasing above the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold for catastrophic climate impacts,"" the Natural Resources Defense Council said in a 2020 report on LNG and climate.

The task force initiative comes as EU member states wrangle over calls for the bloc to ban Russia's key energy exports to punish President Vladimir Putin for his invasion of Ukraine. The Baltic countries and Poland are urging counterparts to do so. The EU has already announced ambitious plans to slash its imports of Russian gas by two-thirds this year and eliminate imports entirely before the end of the decade.

Germany, one of Russia's biggest energy customers, is taking steps to speed up the building of terminals to receive liquefied natural gas. The economic powerhouse said Friday it was drastically slashing its energy purchases from Russia over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, with oil imports to be halved by June and coal deliveries to end by the autumn.

Mr. Biden stressed that while the significant increase in U.S. liquified natural gas deliveries to Europe were essential in the short to mid-term, as ""we have to make sure families in Europe can get through this winter and next winter,"" he did not see it derailing efforts to wean both the U.S. and Europe off fossil fuels in the longer term.

The crisis in Ukraine, Mr. Biden said, ""presents an opportunity. It's a catalyst to accelerate"" the shift away from gas and coal power and toward a shared American and European carbon ""net-zero future,"" he said.

""I know eliminating Russian gas will have costs for Europe,"" Mr. Biden said, ""but it's the right thing to do, and it will put us on a stronger strategic footing.""

As part of the task force the EU's executive said the organization will work with member states ""toward the goal of ensuring, until at least 2030, demand for approximately 50 bcm/year of additional US LNG"".

""This Task Force for Energy Security will be chaired by a representative from the White House and a representative of the President of the European Commission,"" the leaders said Friday. ""It will work to ensure energy security for Ukraine and the EU in preparation for next winter and the following one while supporting the EU's goal to end its dependence on Russian fossil fuels.""

Europe faces a major task in substituting supplies of Russian gas, with Moscow supplying around 150 bcm of gas each year.

U.S. gas supplies to the EU accounted for just 6.3% in the first half of 2021, the bloc's statistics agency says.

However, U.S. exports of LNG to Europe nearly doubled in January from November 2021 — making it the largest supplier of LNG imports to Europe for that month, ahead of Russia and Qatar, according to the U.S. Energy Information Association.

As U.S. LNG plants are already working to capacity, the Reuters news agency said analysts expect that most of the additional gas for Europe will have to come either from U.S. exports that are diverted from other parts of the world, or from other suppliers working in partnership with the U.S. to help meet Europe's needs.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-europe-us-ukraine-russia-liquified-natural-gas-lng-taskforce/

United Co. Rusal International PJSC, the huge aluminum producer fighting blow-back from Russia’s war in Ukraine, is getting some help from traders in China to keep its smelters running.

Some 30,000 tons of alumina -- used to make aluminum metal -- have been loaded onto two vessels headed for Siberia after leaving China in recent weeks, according to traders familiar with the matter. The relatively small amount is to test whether the cargoes face any logistics issues or problems with sanctions, with more ready to ship if all goes well, said the traders, who asked not to be named because the matter is private.

The trade comes at a time of intense global scrutiny of China’s role in responding to Russia’s growing economic isolation.

Traders in China Strike Rare Deal With Russia’s Rusal on Alumina

Stocks Steady Amid Oil Dip (3:17 a.m.)

Stocks in Asia were steady Friday as investors weighed the resilience of the global economic recovery to risks from tightening Federal Reserve monetary policy and Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine.

Japanese, Chinese and Hong Kong equities fluctuated in relatively narrow ranges. U.S. futures slipped between red and green after technology shares helped the S&P 500 index to close at the highest in more than six weeks.

Treasuries held losses, leaving the U.S. 10-year yield in the vicinity of levels last seen in 2019. Oil retreated as European Union leaders refrained from fresh steps to cut imports of Russian crude.

Sanctioned Mogul’s Yacht Heads Home to Russia (3:13 a.m.)

One of the world’s biggest super yachts, reportedly owned by sanctioned billionaire Alexey Mordashov, is headed home to Vladivostok, a Russian port city near Japan.

The 465-foot Nord -- a $500 million vessel with two helipads, a cinema and 20 luxury cabins -- is currently in the South China Sea. Other Russian-linked yachts are turning off their transponders, leaving Europe and sailing toward the Middle East, where they might get less scrutiny.

China May Send Tech Hardware to Putin, Says EU (2:47 a.m.)

European Union officials suspect that China may be ready to supply semiconductors and other tech hardware to Russia as part of an effort to soften the impact of sanctions imposed over the invasion of Ukraine.

The EU is concerned that China is ready to help President Vladimir Putin’s government weather the economic penalties it has put in place along with the U.S., the U.K. and Japan with particular focus on the availability of high-tech components, according to two people with knowledge of the bloc’s internal assessments.

Mariupol Evacuation Continues, Ukraine Says (10:57 p.m.)

All proposed humanitarian corridors operated successfully on Thursday and more than 3,300 people were able to leave combat areas, according to Ukrainian authorities. That includes more than 2,700 who left the besieged southern port of Mariupol by car.

The government continues efforts to arrange delivery of humanitarian aid to Mariupol, and evacuation from the city by buses.

Oil Declines as Traders Await New Energy Measures (9:45 p.m.)

Oil declined as traders weighed the impact of rising trading costs on the major exchanges and sought details about new Russia sanctions -- which weren’t expected to include an oil ban by the European Union -- and a plan to reduce Europe’s energy dependence.

“Crude trading is choppy as we await further details from the Nato meeting today and see where Europe’s red line will be,” said Rebecca Babin, senior energy trader at CIBC Private Wealth Management. “The headline risk remains exceptionally high with liquidity remaining low.”

Johnson Says Allies Can Strengthen Ukraine Outside NATO (9:38 p.m.)

U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that even if Ukraine is unable to join NATO, allies can help it create a deterrent by sending equipment, training and intelligence, giving Ukraininans the “tools to protect themselves.”

Johnson also said he’s not optimistic that Putin wants peace, and warned that Russia may bomb Ukraine’s cities the way it did in Chechnya during wars fought two decades ago.

Baltic Leaders Meet with Zelenskiy in Kyiv (7:57 p.m.)

The speakers of the Lithuanian, Estonian and Latvian parliaments visited Kyiv Thursday to meet with Zelenskiy.

“The Ukrainian nation trusts your countries and Poland the most,” Zelenskiy told them in his office in the capital city. He said Russian troops deliberately attack civilians and ruin civilian infrastructure as they try to besiege cities, creating humanitarian catastrophes. Ukraine needs air defense systems, jets, armored vehicles and protection for civilians, and it wants tighter sanctions on Russia, the president said.

Biden Warns Against Putin Attempts to Break Up NATO (7:39 p.m.)

Biden urged NATO and the European Union to maintain total unanimity in the face of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

“The single most important thing that we have to do in the west is be united,” Biden said Thursday in Brussels at the Europa building, where he was due to meet with European Council President Charles Michel. Putin wants to break up NATO, Biden told reporters.

EU Leaders to Agree on Modest Tightening of Sanctions (7:02 p.m.)

Leaders of the European Union are expected to back a modest tightening of earlier sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, but refrain from imposing major new measures, as countries remain divided on whether to tackle energy supplies.

Under pressure from the U.S. and with Biden in Brussels as their guest, the leaders are likely to approve sanctioning more Russian tycoons and the closing of some loopholes as early as Thursday night, according to EU diplomats. They are expected to avoid a major cut-off of oil and gas purchases despite a push from several countries. Austria said it won’t agree to an energy embargo.

Biden Says to Expect ‘Real’ Food Shortages (6:57 p.m.)

Biden said that the world will experience food shortages as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and urged countries to drop trade restrictions that could limit food exports.

“It’s going to be real,” Biden said of food shortages at a news conference in Brussels. Ukraine and Russia are both major producers of wheat, in particular, and Kyiv’s government has already warned that the country’s planting and harvest has been severely disrupted by the war.

Biden Says He Backs Removing Russia From G-20 (6:40 p.m.)

Russia should be removed from the Group of 20 major economies, Biden said in a news conference after meetings with allies in Brussels. Putin plans to attend the G-20 summit in Indonesia later this year, Russia’s envoy to the Southeast Asian country said.

Biden also said he told China’s President Xi Jinping of “significant jeopardy” to his nation’s economy if he backed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Scholz, Draghi Reject Rubles for Russian Gas (5:30 p.m.)

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian Premier Mario Draghi and their counterparts in other EU nations told Russia to honor payments for energy exports in the currency stated in the contract, usually U.S. dollars or euros.

Gas prices surged more than 30% after Putin on Wednesday ordered the Russian central bank to develop a mechanism to force some countries to make ruble payments for natural gas within a week. EU leaders say that would be a contract violation.

UN General Assembly Condemns Russia Invasion (5:10 p.m.)

The United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities in Ukraine while blaming Russia for the humanitarian crisis there. The resolution received 140 votes in favor, 5 votes against, and 38 abstentions.

The vote followed a failed Russian effort at the UN Security Council on Wednesday to pass a resolution on Ukraine that urged humanitarian aid to the country without mentioning Russia’s invasion. Only China joined Russia in voting for that resolution, as 13 countries abstained.

Latvian President Calls for Cutting Off Russian Energy Imports (4:45 p.m.)

In principle there is a clear decision we should “cut off” Russian oil and gas deliveries, Latvian President Egils Levits said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. “We should pay for our freedom and our independence.”

Paying in dollars or euros is better than “paying in blood,” Levits said. Latvia, which gets most of its natural gas from Russia, has gas reserves and can buy LNG to replace Russian gas, he said.

Pentagon Says Other Nations Free to Send Aircraft (3:25 p.m.)

The Biden administration has no objection to other nations sending aircraft to Ukraine even as it continues to believe that Russia would see a U.S. transfer of planes as an escalatory move, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said.

“The United States has not put a veto on other nations who may want to provide aircraft to the Ukrainian armed forces,” Kirby said on Bloomberg Television from the NATO summit in Brussels. “President Zelenskiy says he wants them and individual nations can make those sovereign decisions.”

U.S. Sanctions Russian Lawmakers, Defense Sector (2:26 p.m.)

The full blocking sanctions affect more than 400 individuals and entities, including the Duma, Russia’s lower house of parliament, and 328 of its members, more than a dozen Russian elites and 48 Russian defense companies.

The sanctions will hit Herman Gref, the head of Russia’s Sberbank and adviser to President Vladimir Putin; Russian billionaire Gennady Timchenko, his companies and members; as well as 17 board members of the Russian financial institution Sovcombank.

U.S. to Welcome Up To 100,000 Ukrainians Fleeing Invasion (2:25 p.m.)

The U.S. will welcome up to 100,000 people fleeing Russian violence in Ukraine, using a variety of legal pathways to allow them to enter the country, a senior Biden administration official said.

Some of those allowed into the country will come as refugees, but the U.S. will permit others to seek parole status or immigrant or non-immigrant visas, the official said, without defining a timeline for the arrivals. The official suggested people fleeing the conflict could come to the U.S. over the course of several years.

NATO Extends Jens Stoltenberg’s Term for One Year (2:13 p.m.)

A senior U.S. official said Washington is working with allies on preparation and deterrence postures over Russian weapons of mass destruction, as well as on potential medical and other countermeasures to help Ukraine.

The U.S. warnings show growing concern that Putin will lash out with his military suffering heavy losses. Biden, speaking at the White House Wednesday, said there’s “a real threat” that Russia will use chemical weapons.

Russian Defense Minister Reports on Operation at Putin Meeting (1:00 p.m.)

Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu reported to Putin and other top officials on the Ukraine “operation” in a video conference, the Kremlin said.

Shoigu was shown on a video screen in front of Putin in his first public appearance in nearly two weeks, though there was no way to confirm when it took place. Earlier Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Shoigu was too busy to do media events. State television also showed what it said was video from the meeting, but didn’t include any sound.

Separately, the Defense Ministry said a top commander from the Eastern Military District had visited troops near the front lines about 30 km from Kyiv. Ukraine has reported killing a number of senior Russian commanders in the month-long war but Moscow hasn’t confirmed that.

German Energy Group Says Gas Supply About to Deteriorate (11:58 a.m.)

Germany’s BDEW energy industry group said it sees “concrete and serious indications” that the country’s natural gas-supply situation is about to deteriorate and urged the government to issue the first level of warning in its emergency plan.

The BDEW, which represents Germany’s main gas and electricity suppliers, said it can’t rule out disruptions after Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded payment in rubles.

Seventh Journalist Killed in Ukraine (10:05 a.m.)

A journalist filming damage in Kyiv’s Podil district was killed on Wednesday along with a civilian during a rocket strike on a shopping center, according to the Insider, the investigative website she worked for.

Oksana Baulina left Russia after the previous organization she worked for, the Anti-Corruption Foundation, was listed as an extremist group by Moscow. Her death brings the number of journalists reported to have been killed since Russia’s invasion began to seven, according to the Press Emblem Campaign group. Dozens of others have been injured.

NATO Chief Warns Russia Against Chemical Attack (9:55 a.m.)

The head of NATO warned Russia that any attack with chemical weapons would have far-reaching consequences.

“Any use of chemical weapons would fundamentally change the nature of the conflict, it would be a blatant violation of international law and it will have widespread and severe consequences,” Jens Stoltenberg told reporters as he arrived for the NATO summit in Brussels.

The risk of contamination would mean “a catastrophe for the people of Ukraine but of course the risk is also that we can see the spread of the chemical agents in NATO territory.” Slovenian Premier Janez Jansa said member states would “consider some acts” as a direct attack on NATO countries. He didn’t elaborate.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.
