The Russian military has pummeled wide areas in Ukraine with airstrikes and has conducted major rocket and artillery bombardments, resulting in large numbers of casualties. But Russian forces have yet to capture strategic cities such as Kyiv or Kharkiv, leading President Biden and others to warn that Moscow could turn to deadlier weapons such as hypersonic missiles or even to chemical and biological attacks to subdue Ukraine.

Here’s a look at some of the weapons being used in the conflict.

Warplanes and missiles

The Russian military has used warplanes and different types of missiles to strike facilities throughout the country. Civilian targets are also increasingly being hit.

On Saturday, the Russian military said it had deployed its Kinzhal, or Dagger, aviation missile system with hypersonic aero-ballistic missiles for what was believed to be the first time since its invasion of Ukraine began Feb. 24. Hypersonic missiles can fly at up to 10 to 15 times the speed of sound.

The U.S., China and North Korea are all working on developing hypersonic missiles, whose speed makes them more effective at evading missile-defense systems.

“It’s almost impossible to stop it. There’s a reason they’re using it,” Biden said of Russian troops in Ukraine.

The Kalibr cruise missile is a precision weapon, but Ukrainian military facilities and government buildings apparently targeted by those missiles in Kyiv and Kharkiv are close to residential areas, resulting in civilian casualties.

The same applies to missiles carried by Russian warplanes, which targeted military infrastructure in strikes that also involved so-called collateral damage.

To hit key targets, the Russian military also has used Iskander missiles that have a range of up to around 300 miles and carry a much more powerful warhead that can destroy big buildings and some fortified facilities. Some Iskander missiles were reportedly fired from the territory of Russian ally Belarus, which has served as a staging ground for the Russian invasion.

Rocket and artillery

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and other officials have accused the Russian military of indiscriminately shelling residential buildings, schools and hospitals around the country.

Independently verified images from Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, showed what appeared to be a barrage of Russian rockets hitting residential buildings in an attack that killed and wounded scores of civilians.

The Soviet-designed Grad (Hail), Smerch (Tornado) and Uragan (Hurricane) multiple-rocket launchers are designed to fire a salvo of powerful rockets to destroy concentrations of troops or military equipment. Their use against populated areas inevitably causes heavy casualties and major damage to civilian infrastructure.

The Russian military also has a wide range of powerful Soviet-designed artillery units, which were bizarrely named after flowers, such as the self-propelled 203-mm Peony and 152-mm Hyacinth and Acacia self-propelled howitzers.

Moscow has claimed that its forces are targeting only military bases and infrastructure, but the Associated Press has documented massive damage to civilian infrastructure and residential areas in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Mariupol and numerous other cities and towns across Ukraine. Russian officials have alleged that Ukrainian forces have widely deployed heavy weapons in residential areas to use civilians as shields, a claim that couldn’t be independently verified.

Cluster munitions and thermobaric weapons

Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of using cluster munitions, accusations that the Kremlin has denied.

Such weapons are designed to target enemy troops and weapons over a broad area, and their use in populated areas inevitably would lead to mass casualties among civilians.

Cluster bombs, rockets and artillery shells open in the air, releasing submunitions, or “bomblets,” that are dispersed over a large area and simultaneously hit multiple targets.

Beyond the initial impact, bomblets have a high rate of failure of exploding immediately, and therefore pose a threat of killing and maiming people long after they are fired.

Thermobaric weapons consist of a fuel container and two separate explosive charges, with the first detonating to disperse the fuel particles and the second igniting the dispersed fuel and oxygen in the air, creating a blast wave of extreme pressure and heat that creates a partial vacuum in an enclosed space. That makes the weapon particularly deadly for people in an enclosed space.

The Pentagon has said that Russian mobile launchers for thermobaric weapons were spotted inside Ukraine, but couldn’t confirm their use.

Ukraine’s arsenal

The Ukrainian military has relied on the same assortment of Soviet-built multiple-rocket launchers and howitzers that the Russian military has.

It doesn’t possess sophisticated long-range precision weapons like Russia’s Iskander ballistic missiles or Kalibr cruise missiles.

The Ukrainian military has Soviet-era Tochka-U short-range ballistic missiles, which have a powerful warhead but poor precision compared with the latest Russian weapons.

In addition to its aging Soviet-made arsenals, Ukraine has received large shipments of Western weapons, such as U.S.-made Javelin anti-tank missiles and shoulder-launched Stinger anti-aircraft missiles. Ukrainian officials said the country’s military has used them to inflict heavy casualties on the invading Russian forces.

The Ukrainian military also has used Bayraktar drones supplied by Turkey before the conflict. It has released a video showing an attack by a Bayraktar drone against a Russian military convoy.

Putin and other Russian leaders know well the high cost of fighting for cities, both from Soviet and recent Russian history. While there is talk of a peace deal — and Putin could be looking for a face-saving exit strategy — the fighting still continues and Russian attacks on civilians are intensifying.

As the battle to capture Berlin during the Second World War and more recent fighting for the Chechen capital of Grozny in both 1994-1995 and 1999-2000 show, fighting for urban areas generally leads to high casualties among combatants and civilians alike.

Fighting over cities is also slow. In light of Russia’s experience with this type of warfare and the ferocity of Ukrainian resistance, neither Putin nor his generals were probably expecting quick results in Ukraine.

To take cities like Kyiv or Kharkiv without suffering unsustainable casualties, Russian forces will have to continue to make widespread use of artillery — something Soviet leader Joseph Stalin once described as “the God of War.”

During the Second World War, artillery typically involved unguided munitions fired from either guns, howitzers or rocket launchers. Today, artillery also includes firing munitions that are guided, but the cheapest form of artillery remains the unguided shell or rocket.

Soviet experience

Russian forces have a long history of capturing cities after heavy fighting. Perhaps the most famous example is the capture of Berlin by the Red Army in May 1945 after two weeks of fighting.

The widespread use of artillery was crucial to keeping Red Army losses down against German defenders who were at times fanatical. Whole blocks of the German capital were levelled by both artillery and bombing by Soviet aircraft. Nonetheless, the Red Army still took horrendous casualties capturing the heart of the Third Reich — nearly 80,000 were killed.

Soviet tanks had a role to play in the capture of Berlin, but by the end of the Second World War, tanks were extremely vulnerable to recently developed infantry anti-tank weapons such as the German Panzerfaust.

During the final phases of fighting for Berlin, one Soviet commander had to bang on the side of Soviet tanks to rouse tank crews inside and encourage them to move forward when they were unwilling to advance towards the Reichstag building in the city centre. In front of those young tank crews stood three burnt-out tanks, a testament to the dangers posed to tanks operating in urban environments.

Casualties among senior Russian commanders in Ukraine suggest that they, too, have had to lead from the front in order to motivate their troops.

Second Chechen war

After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Chechen separatists wanted to leave the Russian Federation. But Russian leader Boris Yeltsin had just overseen the collapse of the U.S.S.R. and wasn’t about to allow what was technically part of Russia to leave.

The fighting for the Chechen capital Grozny in late 1994 and early 1995 was a stark reminder for Russian forces of how difficult it is to fight for urban areas.

Russian troops suffered heavy casualties against a stubborn defence. After an initial attempt to seize the city, the Russian army subsequently had to regroup and engage in a much more systematic destruction of enemy resistance, making widespread use of artillery and air power.

Civilian casualties were high — as many as 27,000 people were killed. The Russian army would officially acknowledge the deaths of 1,376 Russian soldiers in fighting for the city, with another 408 missing.

During the second Chechen war in 1999-2000 — with Vladimir Putin in charge — Russian troops had learned their lesson from the first. Rather than trying to rush the city’s defenders, Russian forces took a more systematic approach.

Russian artillery and air power systematically pounded the city before Russian ground forces fought well-prepared defenders block-by-block. A corridor for civilians to flee the besieged city was established, but it was dangerous and many chose to stay.

It still took Russian forces more than a month to capture the city of Grozny during the second Chechen war — and even then, they faced guerrilla warfare after they had done so.

The war in Ukraine

Logistically, the Russian army wasn’t prepared for a long war when it invaded Ukraine. The Russian army also didn’t expect to have to use the artillery assets that are now being employed against cities like Kharkiv.

Russia started to use its artillery when it became clear the war wasn’t going well, but doing so nonetheless plays to the Russian army’s strength in artillery.

Stubborn Ukraine defenders — well-equipped with anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons from the West — are proving to be difficult to root out from urban areas. To send Russian infantry and tanks into cities without first “suppressing” or “neutralizing” defences, as attacking defenders is known in military jargon, would no doubt lead to unacceptable losses for Russian tanks and infantry.

With Russian aircraft vulnerable to western-supplied anti-aircraft weapons, this leaves Russian artillery. Stalin’s God of War is now, in many ways, the principal Russian weapon in Ukraine.

In practice, conventional artillery is indiscriminate. Russian forces are therefore resorting to the indiscriminate artillery-oriented strategy that was used to subdue Grozny and will be difficult for Ukrainian forces to counter.

Russian commanders are no doubt aware that it takes time to conquer a well-defended city. They do, however, have the advantage of a recent historical precedent in Grozny for eventually “winning” against an entrenched defender in an urban environment. Still, the key coastal city of Mariupol has been under siege for weeks and has still not been captured.

Whether Russian society is willing to accept the sort of Russian losses that will likely result from capturing Kyiv, and other major Ukrainian cities, remains to be seen. The cracks are already appearing in Russia, but there is probably still a long way to go before Putin feels he has to make peace on less than desirable terms and lose face.

Sadly, the bloodshed could continue for some time. If it does, many more soldiers and civilians alike will be killed and maimed amid the hell of what is essentially old-school urban warfare.",https://theconversation.com/russia-is-now-reliant-on-heavy-artillery-stalins-god-of-war-in-ukraine-179356
2,0a53a21d-d85b-4aa3-be09-4fd79b6cfec2,['Dan Sabbagh'],2022-03-23 00:00:00,"It has been a month since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, and such has been the intensity of the first phase of the fighting that both sides in the conflict have increasingly depleted their stocks of ammunition and other military supplies.

But while Ukraine is willing to claim that the Russian invaders have only three days of supplies left, while warning that its own troops are running out of anti-tank and anti-aircraft systems, the reality is hard to measure.

“Resupply issues are hard to gauge, as both sides are keeping that information close to their chest due to operational security concerns,” said Nick Reynolds, a land warfare specialist with the Rusi thinktank.

For Ukraine there is a particular concern that it is running short on the western-supplied weapons that have helped it knock out Russian tanks and planes.

Kyiv’s military has been requesting a huge number more weapons in the run-up to the Nato summit on Thursday, and has secured a commitment from Britain to send 5,000 more missiles.

It is also clear that Russia is suffering from serious logistical constraints that have forced it to abandon its clearly over-optimistic plan to simultaneously encircle Kyiv and Kharkiv and attack from the south and east.

Western officials believe it has lost the ability to fight an offensive on multiple axes, partly because of resupply issues but also because of the casualties it has sustained – somewhere between 7,000 and 10,000 – and it is now simply focusing on trying to capture Mariupol with a brutal and long-running bombardment.

An important sign of the scale of Russia’s difficulties will be if Ukraine can muster an effective counterattack in the Irpin area north-west of the capital, which has seen some of the most deadly fighting from almost the beginning of the war.

“If the early reports of a Ukrainian counter-offensive in the Irpin area prove accurate, this will be a key indicator that Russian supply problems along the Kyiv axis of advance have not been rectified, though casualties, low morale and poor operational coordination will also have played a role,” Reynolds said.

The prevailing view, however, remains that the advantage sits with the aggressor. “Russia retains, in overall terms, significant materiel and personnel reserves that it can draw upon,” said one western source, speaking on condition of anonymity. But the supply lines are complicated for some of the invading forces, particularly those from Russia’s far-off easternmost districts.

Ukraine’s problem is more serious. The country’s arms industry was already far smaller than Russia’s and many of its industrial areas in the east have been heavily damaged by the war. It is long-term damage, which, judging by the scant regard Moscow has shown for civilian casualties, was probably partly deliberate.

Kyiv, in terms of most of the key military hardware, is now entirely reliant on a regular, continuing flow of supply from the west to counteract Russia’s ability to mass tanks and air power against Ukrainian defenders and people. But such high-end weapons can easily be used in warfare far faster than they can be manufactured.

When it comes to arms and ammunition, that could mean a longer fight is to Russia’s advantage, if the Kremlin is willing to continue to tolerate large numbers of casualties. Unfortunately, Vladimir Putin appears willing to do just that.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/military-supplies-depleted-on-both-sides-but-russia-retains-advantage

The claims of major shortages were described as “plausible” by western officials although they said they were unable to corroborate the analysis.

The report from the Ukrainian armed forces general command was said to be consistent with evidence that the Russian advance had stalled, and that they had reverted to using “indiscriminate and attritional” artillery attacks on civilians.

“We do think that the Russian forces have used a lot of material including particular categories of weapons and we have seen isolated reports of particular units that have lacked supplies of one sort or another,” the official said.

“It is consistent with an advance which has ground to a halt. Failures in the logistic chain has been one of the reasons they have not been as effective as they hoped.”

A Pentagon official added there were continuing morale issues among Russian troops, with food and fuel shortages, as well as frostbite due to a lack of adequate clothing.

“They’re struggling on many fronts,” the US official said.

The Ukrainian military said that a major problem for the Russian advance was a failure to lay down a fuel pipe to the front, although the claim could not be independently verified.

On Monday, Komsomolskaya Pravda, the pro-Kremlin tabloid, reported that according to Russian defence ministry numbers, 9,861 Russian soldiers had been killed in Ukraine and 16,153 were injured. The death toll was swiftly removed from the newspaper’s website.

Western officials said they believed the numbers cited by the newspaper are a “reasonable estimate”. The official said: “It is a level of casualties that has not been experienced [by Russia] really since the second world war. It is still continuing … it is a conflict on a different scale.”

While Vladimir Putin’s forces have struggled around Kyiv, a senior US official said the fighting had been taken to the streets in Mariupol, where many civilians remain trapped among rotting corpses and flattened buildings.

Two “super powerful bombs” hit the city on Tuesday even as rescue efforts were ongoing, local authorities said. The port city is said to be under naval shelling from ships in the Sea of Azov.

Russians are said to want to be able to declare Mariupol as a first strategic victory. The city is seen as key to securing a Russian corridor between the separatist Donbas region and illegally annexed Crimea.

It is also home to the largest trading port in the Azov Sea from which Ukraine exports grain, iron and steel, and heavy machinery.

Further, at least 21 people were killed in Merefa, near Kharkiv, when Russian artillery demolished a school and a community centre, according to a local official. On Friday, Putin's soldiers continued their assault on Ukrainian cities, firing missiles at a structure near a western city's airport.

On Thursday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned that US officials were reviewing suspected war crimes and that if Russia's purposeful targeting of civilians is verified, ""huge consequences"" will follow. Rosemary DiCarlo, the UN's political chief, also asked for an investigation into civilian casualties, reminding the UN Security Council on Thursday that direct assaults on civilians are prohibited under international humanitarian law.

Russia-Ukraine War

According to the United Nations, the number of refugees fleeing Ukraine's conflict has now topped 3.2 million. As a result of the Russian aggression, this number will continue to climb. Russia's aggression against Ukraine is now in its fourth week, despite increasing harsh rhetoric from Western nations directed at Russian President Vladimir Putin for neglect in halting attacks in a number of cities. It's difficult to say how many civilians have died so far.

According to the UN, more than 600 people have died; however, the true toll is likely to be much higher. According to reports, thousands of soldiers on both sides have died. Meanwhile, talks between Russia and Ukraine to find a diplomatic solution continue, despite concerns that Russia's military is becoming bogged down. Despite Russia's claims of air superiority, Ukraine's air defences appear to be operational, even as Western nations pour portable anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles into the country.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) on Thursday that Russia has used phosphorous bombs, which killed “adults and children”. As the war in Ukraine is intensifying, Russia has been using more and more dangerous and deadly weapons to achieve success in the assault launched about a month ago. The Ukrainian army is also giving Russians stiff resistance using the weapons provided by the West. Some of these weapons have inflicted serious damage to Russian artillery and tanks.

Here is a look at the weapons used in the Russia-Ukraine War:

Phosphorus bombs

Phosphorus is a substance used by militaries across the world to cause smoke, illumination and incendiary munitions. It burns brightly when exposed to air and produces a large amount of smoke. Phosphorus is used to mark enemy targets and produce a smokescreen to hide troop movements. Zelensky said today that phosphorous used by the Russian military, while igniting, gave serious burns to the targets.

Kinzhal missiles

These are the hypersonic missiles used by Russia I the Ukraine war. Kinzhal, Russian for “dagger”, was launched from the air, most likely by a MiG-31 warplane, according to the BBC. Hypersonic missiles can travel at more than five times the speed of sound, or Mach 5. According to Russia, Kinzhal has a range of 2,000 kilometres. The length of the missile is 8 metres.

9K720 Iskander ballistic missile

These short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs) are leading the Russian attacks in Ukraine. The Iskander has the precision to hit targets 500 kilometres away. These missiles have destroyed homes, hospitals and schools in many Ukraininan cities. The Iskander is a multipurpose tool which comes in various versions - bunker buster, smart submunition, thermobaric and even EMP.

""Vacuum"" bombs

Thermobaric bombs are one of the most brutal war weapons.

Also called thermobaric weapons, these are one of the most brutal war weapons that exist. The bombs are filled with explosive and chemical mix, which causes supersonic blast waves on explosion. These waves can obliterate everything in their path. They are also called vacuum bombs because these explosives suck in the oxygen from the surrounding the air to generate a powerful explosion. Several videos have been posted by Ukrainians, which show Russian thermobaric bombs destroying key structures in cities.

Cluster bombs

Russia was accused of using cluster bombs in an attack on Ukrainian pre-school in which a child was killed. These bombs scatter small bomblets over a wide area, which can result into a significant number of casualties. They can pose a huge risk to civilians present in the area. Human Rights Watch (HRW) and other rights group have claimed that these bombs were used by Russia in the civil war in Syria. Though an international treaty bans the use of these cluster bombs, Russia is not a signatory to it.

War planes

The Russian military has used 75 fixed-wing bomber planes to target Ukrainian airbase and other targets, according to Ukraine's Defence Ministry. These planes are capable of firing air-to-ground missiles or cluster bombs to inflict quick and significant damage to the Ukrainians. Apart from these, there are also reports of the use of Mi-8 choppers.

Javelin missiles

The US-made anti-tank missiles are in high demand in Ukraine. These weapons are giving the numerically inferior Ukrainian army a chance to wreak havoc on their attackers. Javelin has been developed by Lockheed Martin, which said on its website that the missile guides itself to the target after launch (“fire and forget” system), allowing the gunner to take cover and avoid counterfire, or load a new missile.

Bayraktar TB2 drone

Turkish-made Bayaraktar drones have been used extensively by the Ukrainians.

Another weapons used by the Ukrainian military against the Russians. This is a Turkish-made drone that can remain airborne for 27 hours.

Next Generation Light Anti-Tank Weapon (NLAW)

NLAW is very effective in destroying enemy targets at a short distance.

Weighing just 12.5 kilograms, NLAW is a portable, shoulder-launched system that can be used by a single operator. Its armour-piercing warhead can destroy a heavily protected modern battle tank with one shot, and the system is effective at ranges between 20 and 800 metres.

But Vladimir Putin has demonstrated that he was prepared to escalate his use of deadly force, with reports of cluster bombs in the city of Kharkiv.

Russia is widely believed to have the largest nuclear arsenal in the world but the country has many other devastating weapons it can deploy, some of which it appears to have used already.

Below we look at the weapons at Putin’s disposal, as the war in Ukraine continues.

Hypersonic missiles

Russia said on Saturday it had used hypersonic Kinzhal (Dagger) missiles to destroy a large weapons depot in Ukraine’s western Ivano-Frankivsk region.

Russia’s Interfax news agency said it was the first time Russia had deployed the Kinzhal system since it sent its troops into Ukraine.

Moscow prides itself on its advanced weaponry, and Mr Putin said in December that Russia was the global leader in hypersonic missiles, whose speed, manoeuvrability and altitude make them difficult to track and intercept.

The Russian military has said it will keep using state-of-the-art Kinzhal missiles.

President Joe Biden said Russia used the hypersonic missile to destroy a weapons depot on Saturday “because it is the only thing they can get through with absolute certainty”.

Phosphorus bombs

Russia has been accused of using phosphorus bombs in its invasion of Ukraine.

White phosphorus munitions were deployed in the eastern city of Kramatorsk on Monday, according to the deputy head of Kyiv’s police.

Oleksiy Biloshytskiy shared a video of material burning fiercely on the ground as it was touched with a spade. The footage has not been independently verified.

White phosphorus, which ignites on contact with air, is often used to mark enemy targets and produce a smokescreen to hide troop movements.

It can also be used to start fires, and can burn through bone when it comes into contact with flesh. It can kill, maim and poison victims.

Thermobaric launchers or ‘vacuum bombs’

Among the weapons which have been seen moving towards the capital are TOS-1 thermobaric launchers; BM-21 122mm Grad; BM-21 220mm Uragan and 300mm Smerch systems.

Thermobaric weapons are considered to be one of the most brutal war weapons that exist.

The missiles are filled with a highly explosive fuel and chemical mix, which on exploding can cause supersonic blast waves that can obliterate everything in their path, including buildings and humans.

They are also known as aerosol bombs or vacuum bombs because they suck in the oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a powerful explosion.

The Ukrainian ambassador to the US said thermobaric launchers had been used during the invasion. Russia has also confirmed that it has used thermobaric weapons in Ukraine, according to the UK’s ministry of defence.

“The Russian MoD has confirmed the use of the TOS-1A weapon system in Ukraine,” the MoD wrote on Twitter. “The TOS-1A uses thermobaric rockets, creating incendiary and blast effects.”

Intelligence officials told The Independent the Russians are also using 27M Malka 203mm heavy self- propelled howitzer and 2S4 Tyulpan 240mm heavy self-propelled mortars, which can be used to large buildings.

Peter Lee, of the University of Portsmouth, explained how these bombs work in gruesome detail in 2016, after Russia allegedly used them in Syria.

“Imagine taking a deep breath then submerging yourself in water,” he wrote. “Then imagine having all of the oxygen forced instantaneously from your body.

“Try to inhale again. But instead of cold water filling your lungs, toxic, flammable particles start killing you from the inside out.”

In 2000, Human Rights Watch condemned Russia’s reported used of the weapons a year earlier in Chechnya as “a dangerous escalation” with “important humanitarian implications”.

Cluster bombs

The Russian military has also been accused of using cluster bombs in an attack that killed a child and two adults hiding in a pre-school in northeastern Ukraine.

Cluster bombs, or cluster munitions release hundreds of smaller munitions or bomblets over a wide area, wreaking catastrophic damage and casualties.

Human Rights Watch said it has also identified examples of cluster munition use.

People walk past burned cars a day after a shelling on a residential area in Kyiv (EPA)

On Friday, it said a cluster bomb had been used the day before by the Russian military in the town of Vuhledar.

Four civilians were killed in the attack, the organisation said.

Human Rights Watch describes the weapon as posing “an immediate threat to civilians during conflict by randomly scattering submunitions or bomblets over a wide area”.

Bellingcat, a website specialising in investigations and verification, said on Sunday that it had located multiple sites in Ukraine where cluster munitions had been used.

It outlined two, at a pre-school in the city of Okhtyrka, and in Kharkiv, where it had verified social media reports of cluster munition attacks.

More than 100 countries have committed never to use the weapons under the Convention on Cluster Munitions, including the UK, but neither Russia nor Ukraine have signed the agreement.

Amnesty International has condemned Russia’s reported use of cluster munitions in Ukraine, saying an attack on a pre-school “may constitute a war crime”.

Nuclear Weapons

Although Vladimir Putin put Russia’s strategic nuclear deterrent forces on high alert, such extreme measures have not been used so far.

Instead Russia has deployed some “dual-capable” vehicles that could theoretically launch nuclear weapons near Ukraine but there are no signs on the ground the country has actually deployed nuclear weapons or nuclear custodial units, according to the group. And Russia itself has not announced any plans to use nuclear weapons.
