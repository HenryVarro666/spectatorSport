The latest: The weeks-long resistance in besieged Mariupol appeared to be cracking as Russian forces moved closer to capturing the seaside port city in southeastern Ukraine, with a Russian-imposed deadline for Ukrainian forces in the city to surrender passing early Sunday local time. Meanwhile, officials in the capital Kyiv and the western city of Lviv reported explosions Saturday. Moscow has withdrawn its forces from those regions to focus on eastern Ukraine, but airstrikes have continued.

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

President Vladimir V. Putin ordered troops into two Russia-backed separatist territories in Ukraine and hinted at the possibility of a wider military campaign and laid claim to all of Ukraine as a country “created by Russia” in an emotional and aggrieved address to the Russian people.

Russian state television then showed Mr. Putin signing decrees late Monday recognizing the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics and directing the Russian Defense Ministry to deploy troops in those regions to carry out “peacekeeping functions.”

The order was condemned as a violation of international law and Ukraine’s sovereignty by several nations at an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council on Monday night.

“He calls them peacekeepers,” said Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. “This is nonsense. We know what they really are.”

It was not immediately certain whether the Russian troops would remain only on the territory controlled by the separatist republics, or whether they would seek to capture the rest of the two Ukrainian enclaves whose territory they claim.

And so it was unclear if a long-feared Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine had begun. The separatists might have invited Russian forces in, but neither Ukraine nor the rest of the world views the so-called republics as anything but Ukrainian territory.

The threat was clear to the government of President Volodymyr Zelensky, which denies that it is responsible for the escalating shelling on the front line between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists in recent days. Russian state television has broadcast extensive reports claiming, without evidence, that Ukraine is preparing an offensive against the separatist territories.

Mr. Zelensky, in a televised statement, urged Ukraine’s allies to take action immediately and called for the Ukrainian people to remain calm.

“We are on our own land,” he said. “We are not afraid of anything or anyone.”

Mr. Zelensky spoke to President Biden and called a meeting of his Security and Defense Council.

White House officials said Mr. Biden would impose sanctions against people doing business in the separatist regions and that the White House would soon announce more.

Condemnations of Russia’s actions rang out around the continent, with British and European Union leaders vowing to impose sanctions on those involved.

“Putin just put Kafka and Orwell to shame: no limits to dictator’s imagination, no lows too low, no lies too blatant, no red lines too red to cross,” Prime Minister Ingrida Šimonytė of Lithuania said. “What we witnessed tonight might seem surreal for the democratic world. But the way we respond will define us for the generations to come.”

Mr. Putin went so far as to describe Ukraine’s elected pro-Western leaders as stooges and cast them as the aggressors — even though Russia has an estimated 150,000 to 190,000 soldiers surrounding Ukraine.

While Mr. Putin’s ultimate plans remain a mystery, a full invasion would constitute the largest military action in Europe since World War II.

Now edging toward the twilight of his political career, Mr. Putin, 69, is determined to burnish his legacy and to correct what he has long viewed as one of the greatest catastrophes of the 20th century: the disintegration of the Soviet Union.

Asserting Moscow’s power over Ukraine, a country of 44 million people that was previously part of the bloc and shares a 1,200-mile border with Russia, is part of his aim of restoring what he views as Russia’s rightful place among the world’s great powers, the United States and China.

WASHINGTON — President Biden said Tuesday that American officials had not verified Russia’s claim that it is pulling some troops back from Ukraine’s border, saying that Russian forces remain “very much in a threatening position” and that “an invasion remains distinctly possible.”

Speaking from the East Room of the White House, Mr. Biden vowed to “give the diplomacy every chance” to prevent a Russian invasion. But he also promised not to “sacrifice basic principles” according countries the right to determine the shape of their own borders.

The president said he had no intention of sending American troops to fight in Ukraine, which is not a member of the NATO alliance, but he noted that the United States has provided military equipment, intelligence and training to Ukraine’s government as its prepares for any invasion.

He also vowed to stand by NATO countries in the event that Russia — or any other nation — attacks the alliance.

“The United States will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of American power,” he said. “An attack against one NATO country is an attack against all of us. ”

Mr. Biden’s remarks came hours after Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, said his country had decided to “partially pull back troops,” and Russian military officials signaled that some of the forces on the border with Ukraine had been sent back to their garrisons.

American officials and their counterparts in other European countries have expressed skepticism about the Russian troop movements, saying the majority of Mr. Putin’s troop deployment remains poised to invade Ukraine quickly.

Jens Stoltenberg, NATO’s secretary general, said members of the alliance “have not seen any sign of de-escalation.” Russia has moved forces around before while leaving heavy weapons in place, Mr. Stoltenberg noted.

On Tuesday, Mr. Biden did not repeat the recent assessments from some administration officials that a Russian invasion was imminent. But his comments did not reflect a change in his administration’s overall judgment about the possibility that Russia will attack, White House officials stressed.

Mr. Biden has argued that agreement among European allies on a set of harsh sanctions is the best way to force Mr. Putin to accept diplomacy instead of an invasion.

“The United States and NATO are not a threat to Russia,” Mr. Biden said. “Ukraine is not a threat to Russia. Neither the U.S. or NATO have missiles in Ukraine. We do not, do not have plans to put them there as well. We’re not targeting people of Russia. We do not seek to destabilize Russia. To the citizens of Russia. You are not our enemy.”

Mr. Biden had a warning for Americans, too.

He said a Russian invasion that triggered severe economic sanctions could cause oil prices to rise, making it more difficult for the administration to fight the already damaging inflation in the United States.

“I will not pretend this will be painless,” he said.

Still, the president warned Mr. Putin that Russia’s economy will suffer even more if he decides to invade. The president specifically vowed to stop a proposed Russian natural gas pipeline that would serve Europe.

“When it comes to Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would bring natural gas from Russia to Germany, if Russia further invades Ukraine, it will not happen,” Mr. Biden said.

Earlier in the day, Mr. Putin said after a face-to-face meeting with Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany that Russia would continue pushing for its central demands: a rollback of NATO presence in Eastern Europe and a guarantee that Ukraine would not join the alliance.

Mr. Scholz suggested after the meeting that NATO might formally say that Ukraine’s membership in NATO “is not on the agenda” as a way of defusing the tensions.",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/02/15/world/russia-ukraine-news

The negotiation process was expected to begin on Monday, but Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said that was unlikely as the negotiators of both sides would only be arriving in Turkey during the day.

Regarding possibilities of a face-to-face meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy for bringing an end to the war, Lavrov said it could only happen after key issues of a potential peace deal were settled.

Here are some of the top updates on the Russia-Ukraine war that has killed hundreds and injured thousands, while triggering one of the worst refugee crisis in Europe since the Second World War.

1. Mayor of Ukraine’s besieged city Mariupol Vadym Boychenko said as many as 5,000 people, including 200 children, had been killed in the region since Russia’s siege. The port city has borne the brunt of Russia’s heavy shelling, which began on March 1. Boychenko added that 90 per cent of the city’s residential houses and hospitals, including maternity wards, have been completely destroyed by Russian shelling or missile attacks.

2. Ukraine said it has paused evacuations from the besieged city due to fear of Russian attacks on humanitarian corridors. Turkey, Greece and France are now trying to organise a mass evacuation of civilians from Mariupol.

3. Leading Ukrainian newspaper, The Kyiv Post, said a second attempt to assassinate Zelenskyy has been foiled. It alleged that a group of 25 people led by the Russian special services was captured near the Slovakia-Hungary border.

4. Ukraine said it has taken full control of Irpin, located near Kyiv. “We have good news today – Irpin has been liberated,” mayor Oleksandr Markushyn said in a video post on Telegram.

5. Russia’s leading independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta, whose chief editor was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year, suspended publication earlier in the day until the end of the Ukraine war. The paper said the decision was made “to save us for each other”. According to AFP, the paper had fallen foul of Russian censors for its coverage of the war.

6. The European Union, according to a Bloomberg report, has sent aside $1.9billion to help Ukrainian refugees find work, get access to schools and healthcare and also pay those who lost their homes due to the war.

7. Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began last month, which Putin has termed a “special military operation”, there has been a massive refugee influx in the neighbouring countries of Slovakia, Hungary, and Poland, among others. The highest influx has been reported in Poland with the country welcoming nearly 2.3 million Ukrainian refugees.

8. According to Bloomberg, the population of Polish capital Warsaw has soared by 300,000 (or about 20 per cent) alone in four weeks, with accommodations falling short. The United Nations’ refugee agency, UNHCR, said that 3,862,797 Ukrainians have so far fled the country, with around 90 per cent of them being women and children.",https://robetnews.com/2022/03/28/ukraine-mariupol-mayor-says-5000-killed-in-war-assassination-bid-on-zelenskyy-foiled-top-points-world-news/

When the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. announced his strong opposition to the war in Vietnam, the media attacked him for straying outside of his civil rights mandate. In so many words, powerful interests told him: “Mind your own business.” In fact, African American leaders have long been concerned with broad issues of peace and justice—and have especially opposed nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, this activism is left out of mainstream corporate-produced history textbooks.

On June 6, 1964, three Japanese writers and a group of hibakusha (atomic bomb survivors) arrived in Harlem as part of the Hiroshima/Nagasaki World Peace Study Mission. Their mission: to speak out against nuclear proliferation.

Yuri Kochiyama, a Japanese American activist, organized a reception for the hibakusha at her home in the Harlem Manhattanville Housing Projects, with her friend Malcolm X. Malcolm said, “You have been scarred by the atom bomb. You just saw that we have also been scarred. The bomb that hit us was racism.” He went on to discuss his years in prison, education, and Asian history. Turning to Vietnam, Malcolm said, “If America sends troops to Vietnam, you progressives should protest.” He argued that “the struggle of Vietnam is the struggle of the whole Third World: the struggle against colonialism, neocolonialism, and imperialism.” Malcolm X, like so many before him, consistently connected colonialism, peace, and the Black freedom struggle. Yet, students have rarely heard this story.

Focusing on African American history, too often textbooks reduce the Black freedom movement to the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the March on Washington. Rosa Parks and Dr. King are put in their neat categorical boxes and students are never taught the Black freedom struggle’s international dimensions, viewing slavery, Jim Crow, and the Civil Rights Movement as purely domestic phenomena unrelated to foreign affairs. However, Malcolm X joined a long list of African Americans who, from 1945 onward, actively supported nuclear disarmament. W. E. B. Du Bois, Bayard Rustin, Coretta Scott King, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and the Black Panther Party were just a few of the many African Americans who combined civil rights with peace, and thus broadened the Black freedom movement and helped define it in terms of global human rights.

Writing in the Chicago Defender, poet Langston Hughes was among the first to publicly criticize using the atomic bomb in Hiroshima and the role race played in the decision. Years later, Hughes again used the Black press to raise awareness about the nuclear issue. He implored the U.S. not to use nuclear weapons in Korea, making clear that things would be different if Americans viewed people of color as human beings rather than an “Other.” In his view, racism, nuclear weapons, and colonialism were indeed inextricably linked.

If students learn about Du Bois at all, it is usually that he helped found the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) or that he received a PhD from Harvard. However, a few weeks after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Du Bois likened President Truman to Adolph Hitler, calling him “one of the greatest killers of our day.” He had traveled to Japan and consistently criticized the use of nuclear weapons. In the 1950s, fearing another Hiroshima in Korea, Du Bois led the effort in the Black community to eliminate nuclear weapons with the “Ban the Bomb” petition. Many students go through their entire academic careers and learn nothing of Du Bois’ work in the international arena.

If students ever hear the name Bayard Rustin, it is usually related to his work with the March on Washington. He has been tragically marginalized in U.S. history textbooks, in large part because of his homosexuality. However, Rustin’s body of work in civil rights and peace activism dates back to the 1930s. In 1959, during the Civil Rights Movement, Rustin not only fought institutional racism in the United States, but also traveled to Ghana to try to prevent France from testing its first nuclear weapon in Africa.

These days, some textbooks acknowledge Dr. King’s critique of the Vietnam War. However, King’s actions against nuclear weapons began a full decade earlier in the late 1950s. From 1957 until his death, through speeches, sermons, interviews, and marches, King consistently protested the use of nuclear weapons and war. King called for an end to nuclear testing asking, “What will be the ultimate value of having established social justice in a context where all people, Negro and White, are merely free to face destruction by Strontium-90 or atomic war?” Following the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, King called on the government to take some of the billions of dollars spent on nuclear weapons and use those funds to increase teachers’ salaries and build much needed schools in impoverished communities. Two years later, receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, King argued the spiritual and moral lag in our society was due to three problems: racial injustice, poverty, and war. He warned that in the nuclear age, society must eliminate racism or risk annihilation.

Dr. King’s wife largely inspired his antinuclear stance. Coretta Scott King began her activism as a student at Antioch College. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, King worked with various peace organizations, and along with a group of female activists, began pressuring President Kennedy for a nuclear test ban. In 1962, Coretta King served as a delegate for Women Strike for Peace at a disarmament conference in Geneva that was part of a worldwide effort to push for a nuclear test ban treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union. Upon her return, King spoke at AME church in Chicago, saying: “We are on the brink of destroying ourselves through nuclear warfare . . . . The Civil Rights Movement and the Peace Movement must work together ultimately because peace and civil rights are part of the same problem.” Of course, Coretta was not alone. Zora Neale Hurston, Marian Anderson, Lorraine Hansberry were just a few of the black women who spoke out against the use of nuclear weapons.

Each new school year students will hopefully open their textbooks to study the nuclear arms race and the Black Freedom Movement. However, most will not learn how these issues are connected. They will not learn of all those in the Civil Rights Movement who simultaneously fought for peace. But this must change, and soon. The scarring of war and poverty and racism that Malcolm X spoke of continues. It is time that students learn about the long history of activism that has challenged these deadly triplets.",https://www.peaceactionwi.org/nukes
