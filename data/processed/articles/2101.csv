As you have just heard from the Secretary-General and USG DiCarlo, Ukrainian civilians are paying far too high a price for war.

Let me speak briefly about humanitarian needs and what we are doing to meet them, before I refer to my recent travels.

In the last six weeks, as we have heard, at least 1,430 people have been killed, among them over 121 children. We know this is very likely a serious underestimate.

Homes and civilian infrastructure – bridges, hospitals and schools – have been damaged and destroyed.

Current figures on displacement tell us more than 11.3 million people have been forced to flee their homes, of whom more than 4.2 million are now refugees in generous neighbouring countries that Rosemary has just been referring to.

In total, more than a quarter of Ukraine’s population has fled in this extraordinarily short time.

And, unfortunately, these figures will continue to rise until we can find a pause, and some peace.

Madam President,

The ground and air offensives and counteroffensives are making life nearly impossible for many civilians in Ukraine. Families, the elderly, women and children have been trapped by fighting already for too long.

For more than five weeks, the people of Mariupol have been caught up in the fighting. It is well documented that Mariupol is a centre of hell. Other cities like Chernihiv, Sumy, and Kharkiv remain cut-off from essential goods and services.

The perilous conditions are hampering our efforts to access civilians - or for them to access us.

We restate here that civilians must be allowed to move to safer areas without the fear of attacks and to locations of their own choice and selection.

It is vital that all parties to the conflict respect their obligations under international humanitarian law to protect civilians and to allow impartial humanitarian organizations safe, rapid, unimpeded access to all civilians in need, wherever they are in Ukraine.

Madam President,

As the world watches humanitarian needs soar in Ukraine, the United Nations and its partner organizations are making every effort to dramatically increase our support to affected civilians.

The work of the 6,000 volunteers from the Ukraine Red Cross, as we have noted before in this chamber, together with the local Non-Governmental Organizations in eastern Ukraine, continue to work tirelessly at the front line of assistance to communities.

The World Food Programme has reached more than 1.3 million people with cash and food assistance and plans to reach around 2.5 million people in this month.

Health partners report that more than 180 tons of medical supplies were delivered in Ukraine, with another 470 tons on the way. This will address the health needs of around six million people in the months ahead.

And I am pleased to say that, after much effort, in the past day another convoy was dispatched from our humanitarian coordination hub in Dnipro to Severodonetsk - in the far east.

Today, food, winter clothing, non-food items, medicine and hygiene kits were offloaded to the Ukraine Red Cross and will reach the hands of those in most need .

Indeed, following notification to both parties, as part of the notification system that we and the International Red Cross are involved in, four convoys in total have provided critical support to people in some of the cities encircled by war and experiencing ongoing fighting.

While these are initial steps, it gives us a basis to now expand to scale, to provide much more than one convoy a day.

Madam President,

Let me also emphasize to this Council how concerned I am over the growing number of reports we receive of human trafficking, sexual violence, exploitation and abuse in Ukraine and in the region. As ever, such horrific incidents as we are seeing there overwhelmingly impact displaced women and children more than others.

We are bolstering protection and gender-based violence services through agencies and through the wealth of civil society organizations in Ukraine, to provide specialized care for survivors. These services are being designed and carried out in collaboration with Ukrainian civil society, including very particularly, local women organizations.

Madam President,

Today, I address you from Geneva, having just returned from Moscow overnight.

As you know, the Secretary-General as he said, charged me to bring both sides together, on humanitarian grounds, to explore specific and sustained ways to reduce humanitarian suffering, including in particular the pursuit of pursuing a humanitarian ceasefire.

Yesterday, in Moscow, I had long and frank exchanges with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov and his Deputy, Sergei Vershinin, and then separately with the Deputy Minister of Defence, Alexandre Fomin.

In my meetings with these senior officials I also discussed humanitarian convoys of safe passage, including the four which have already been able to move. I outlined possibilities for building further on that cooperation, sharing specific suggestions for mutually agreed upon military freezes to allow for evacuations of civilians and for the safe passage of life-saving aid. In effect, for humanitarian pauses in different parts of Ukraine to save lives and bring back a modicum of safety for people living in those places.

My counterparts received these suggestions and assured me of their intent to carefully study these ideas which I left with them. We agreed to remain in close contact.

I came away from these meetings believing that we have a very long road ahead of us, but it must be travelled, and we will travel it.

Tomorrow, I plan to travel to Ukraine to have discussions with senior authorities from the Ukrainian Government in Kyiv on Thursday on these same issues, and others that they will present to me and also to see first-hand with our Crisis Coordinator, Amin Awad, on the humanitarian response.

Madam President,

Thanks to generous donor contributions, many from governments in this chamber, the humanitarian response since February has been scaled up allowing us to meet the needs of one and half million people. We will need sustained financial support for needs in Ukraine.

And like the Secretary-General, I also want to stress as he has done consistently, that funding must not be diverted from other crises.

Madam President,

As you heard from David Beasley last week, conflict, climate shocks, COVID, compounded by the soaring food and fuel costs could push another 47 million people globally into severe food insecurity.

The total number of people around the world who will not know where their next meal comes, could be driven to the astonishing figure of 325 million people around the world. That is by a long distance the highest in our recent history, well over double what it was less than three years ago.

Madam President,

I close by reminding the Council of what it already knows well: the world cannot afford this war. And neither can the people of Ukraine.

Like others, I call on all Council Members, and all Member States with influence, to support all efforts from whatever part they come from, in the pursuit of peace and the alleviation of humanitarian suffering.

For the sake of the people of Ukraine, and the sake of those around the world who cannot afford to bear the additional burden this war imposes on them. And all of us we must as the Secretary-General says, silence the guns.

Thank you Madam President.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/under-secretary-general-humanitarian-affairs-and-emergency-relief-coordinator-2
1,d55af864-543d-4c4e-8cbf-c3cc10aec954,['United Nations'],,"In an impassioned address to the Security Council today detailing the death and destruction caused by Russian forces in Moscow’s war against Ukraine, the President of that country challenged members to uphold international law or disband the United Nations, calling for the convening of a global conference in Kyiv to determine how to reform the world security system.

The Council also heard briefings from the Secretary-General and two other senior United Nations officials on the political and humanitarian situations in Ukraine.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, detailing actions of the Russian Federation, said that the most terrible war crimes since the Second World War are being committed in his country. Likening their actions to those of Da’esh, he said Russian troops are deliberately destroying Ukrainian cities, creating mass starvation, shooting columns of civilians trying to escape hostilities, blowing up shelters and creating conditions in their temporarily occupied territories to ensure that most civilians are killed. The massacre in Bucha is only one of many examples of what the occupiers have perpetrated for 41 days, in Mariupol, Kharviv and dozens of other communities. Hatred by the aggressor is supported at the State level and exported through a system of propaganda, seeking to provoke a global food crisis that could lead to famine in Africa, Asia and elsewhere, he added, stressing that the security which the Council must guarantee simply “is not there”.

Emphasizing that the purposes of the Charter of the United Nations, especially Article I — to maintain international peace and security — are being violated, he asked: “What is the point of all other Articles?”, adding: “Are you ready to close the United Nations? Do you think that the time for international law is gone?” If not, “you need to act immediately”. To support peace in Ukraine, the Council must either remove the Russian Federation from the organ as an aggressor and source of war, so it cannot block decisions made about its own war, or the Council can “dissolve yourselves altogether” if there is nothing it can do other than engage in conversation. “Ukraine needs peace. Europe needs peace. The world needs peace,” he insisted.

The Charter must be immediately restored and the system reformed so that the veto power does not represent the right to die, and so there is fair representation in the Council of all world regions, he said. If tyranny in places from Syria to Somalia had received a response, it would have ceased to exist, and an “honest peace” would have prevailed. A war against Ukrainian citizens would not have been launched. Instead, the world watched, and turned its eyes away from the occupation of Crimea, the war against Georgia, the taking of Transnistria from the Republic of Moldova and the preparations of Russian troops for another war near the border. The Russian military and those who gave them orders must be brought to justice and charged with war crimes in Ukraine, before a tribunal similar to the one created in Nuremburg.

He then proposed the convening of a global conference in Kyiv to determine how to reform the world security system, establish guarantees for the recognition of borders and the integrity of countries, and to assert the rule of international law. Stressing that the laws set in 1945 in San Francisco for the creation of a global security organization will remain elusive without reforms, he said “we must do everything within our power to pass on to the next generation an effective United Nations”, with the ability to respond preventively to security challenges and force aggressors to peace. For its part, Ukraine stands ready to provide a platform for an office of a newly updated security system, he said, proposing the creation of a “U24 office” specializing in preventive measures to maintain peace.

United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres described the war in Ukraine as one of the greatest challenges ever to the international order and the global peace architecture, because of its nature, intensity and consequences. “We are dealing with the full-fledged invasion, on several fronts, of one Member State of the United Nations, Ukraine, by another, the Russian Federation — a permanent member of the Security Council — in violation of the United Nations Charter, and with several aims, including redrawing the internationally recognized borders between the two countries,” he said.

The Russian offensive has also led to massive displacement and increases in the prices of food, energy and fertilizers; disrupted supply chains; and put more pressure on many developing countries that were already on the verge of debt collapse. “For all these reasons, it is more urgent by the day to silence the guns,” he emphasized, noting that he had asked the United Nations Emergency Relief Coordinator, Martin Griffiths, to travel to the Russian Federation and Ukraine to press for an urgent humanitarian ceasefire.

Mr. Griffiths, also Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, addressing the Council via videoconference from Geneva, recounted his recent trip to Moscow, noting that the Secretary-General had charged him with bringing both sides together to explore specific and sustained ways to reduce suffering. On 4 April, during “long and frank” exchanges with Minister for Foreign Affairs Sergey V. Lavrov and his Deputy, Sergey V. Vershinin, and separately with the Deputy Minister for Defence, he discussed humanitarian convoys, including the four which have already been able to move. He outlined possibilities for building on this cooperation, sharing suggestions for mutually agreed upon military freezes to allow for evacuations of civilians and for the safe passage of life-saving aid.

While his counterparts assured him of their intent to carefully study these ideas, he said he came away from these meetings believing that “we have a long road ahead of us — but it must be travelled, and we will travel it”. He expressed hope of traveling to Ukraine on 7 April to lead discussions with senior Government officials on these same issues, and to see first-hand the humanitarian response. Updating the Council on the situation on the ground, he said that, over the last six weeks, at least 1,430 people have been killed, among them over 121 children — figures which are likely a “serious underestimate”. Homes, bridges, hospitals and schools have been damaged and destroyed, while almost 11 million people have been forced to flee — more than 4.2 million of whom are now refugees in neighbouring countries and beyond. In total, over a quarter of Ukraine’s population has fled.

Rosemary Dicarlo, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, noting that the number of civilians killed has more than doubled since her 17 March briefing, said: “The devastation wrought on Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities is one of the shameful hallmarks of this senseless war.” The war is also threatening Ukraine’s future, with early assessment projections by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) suggesting that, if the war continues through 2022, 18 years of hard-won socioeconomic gains in Ukraine could be rolled back. While there has been a reported reduction of Russian troops and attacks around Kyiv and Chernihiv, such moves should not be merely tactical, repositioning forces for renewed attacks, she said, pointing out that the General Assembly has twice called for Russian forces to fully withdraw from Ukrainian territory and cease all military operations.

Diplomatic efforts to end the war, including direct talks between Ukrainian and Russian representatives, have continued, she said, commending Turkey for hosting these discussions, as well as the efforts of many others engaging with the Russian Federation and Ukraine. Welcoming the willingness for continued engagement to reach a mutual understanding, she said this requires good faith and earnest efforts, stressing: “Any progress in the negotiations should be translated quickly into action on the ground.”

In the ensuing discussion, most Council members expressed shock at the images of corpses coming out of Bucha while the Russian Federation’s representative argued that those images are fake and were staged.

The representative of the United States said that the heart-wrenching stories that will never get to be heard are the ones of those in the images from Bucha. Based on available data, her delegation determined that the Russian forces committed war crimes in Ukraine. Describing how the Russian Federation is sending Ukrainians to its “filtration camps”, she condemned Moscow’s literal disrespect for human rights. The United States seeks suspension of the Russian Federation from the Human Rights Council as that country uses its membership as a platform for its propaganda.

Albania’s representative, also backing the call for the Russian Federation’s suspension from the Human Rights Council and noting this is the fourteenth meeting on Ukraine since 31 January, said the Russian Federation’s imperial dreams have gone nowhere. Kyiv has proved “too hard to swallow”. Describing Bucha as “an open-air graveyard”, he said it is impossible to convince anyone that the destroyed tanks cluttering the roads or the civilians killed in arbitrary executions are staged scenes. “You may muzzle media back home, but you cannot fool satellite images,” he said. “These are facts, hard and sickening proof of the atrocities committed.” The Russian Federation has cancelled itself from international law, “but the law will pursue it”, he assured, deploring that the Russian Federation has become the world’s most sanctioned country in history and an international pariah to the point it is forced to seek support from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Syria.

Likewise, the Head of the European Union delegation, in its capacity as observer, welcomed the International Court of Justice’s provisional steps ordering Moscow to immediately suspend military operations, as well as the International Criminal Court Prosecutor’s investigation into war crimes and crimes against humanity, and the work of the independent Commission of Inquiry. He described the European Union’s assistance to Ukraine’s Prosecutor General in the collection and preservation of evidence of war crimes, assuring: “It is clear, there will be accountability.” The bloc has adopted sanctions against Moscow, its financial and defence sectors and those individuals enabling and financing the aggression.

The Russian Federation’s representative retorted that Ukraine’s President is laying blame at the feet of the Russian military, criminally staging events when, in fact, Ukrainian civilians were killed by their own radicals. As it turns out, Russian forces should not have withdrawn from Bucha. Describing flagrant inconsistencies being promoted by Ukraine and the Western media, he cited recordings of Ukrainian radicals shooting civilians. To the video presented by the Ukraine delegation to the Council, he responded that the corpses “in no way” resemble those who reportedly had been on the ground for four days.

The only dilatants who could fall for this fake are Western countries, who, in fact, do not care about Ukraine, he said, imploring Ukraine’s President to recognize that his country is only a pawn in the geopolitical game against the Russian Federation. President Zelenskyy should find a solution, because “we came to Ukraine to bring long-awaited peace to the blood-soaked land of Donbas”. He called for cutting out the malignant Nazi tumour that is consuming Ukraine and would, in time, consume the Russian Federation, urging Mr. Zelenskyy not to allow the West to achieve its goals.

China’s delegate said that the disturbing images from Bucha must be verified before jumping to conclusions and accusations. Citing the negative impact of sanctions against the Russian Federation on developing countries, he said such measures are not effective and only expedite the spillover effects. Indiscriminate sanctions are tantamount to weaponizing the world economy, he pointed out, adding that smaller countries should not be caught between the great Powers and must not be forced to take sides. He urged the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) members to engage with the Russian Federation head-on to establish a balanced, effective and sustainable security framework in the region. Beijing will play a constructive and responsible role in that regard.

Kenya’s representative recounted that, in April 1994, even as genocide engulfed Rwanda, there were members of the Council contesting the horrifying truth that a million people were being murdered. “We should stand warned that the inability of the Council to establish the facts and attribute responsibility may enable the risk of escalation into far worse crimes,” he stressed.

In a similar vein, Brazil’s delegate warned against the Council becoming “a bystander of the shocking consequences of the conflict”. So far, the organ is failing in its role to foster a constructive dialogue between the parties, with the aim of brokering an effective peace settlement to this conflict. “We deeply regret that the Security Council has not been able to speak with one voice throughout this crisis,” he said.

The United Arab Emirates’ delegate urged the Council not to forget the impact of war on a nation’s cultural heritage and identity, expressing concern over the dozens of cultural sites that have been damaged and calling on all sides to refrain from such wilful destruction. She also expressed alarm over how the war is affecting the 1.2 billion people in 47 developing countries who are at risk due to rising food prices and looked forward to efforts by the Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance.

Also speaking today were the representatives of Gabon, Ireland, Mexico, India, France, Norway, Ghana and the United Kingdom.

BRUSSELS — Western nations on Thursday escalated their pressure on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, with the European Union approving a ban on Russian coal and the United States moving to strip Russia’s trading privileges and prohibit its energy sales in the American market.

The new punishments came as the United Nations General Assembly took a symbolically important vote to penalize Russia by suspending it from the Human Rights Council, the 47-member U.N. body that can investigate rights abuses. Western diplomats called the suspension a barometer of global outrage over the war and the growing evidence of atrocities committed by Russian forces.

That evidence includes newly revealed radio transmissions intercepted by German intelligence in which Russian forces discussed carrying out indiscriminate killings north of Kyiv, the capital, according to two officials briefed on an intelligence report. Russia has denied any responsibility for atrocities.

Together, the steps announced Thursday represented a significant increase in efforts led by Western nations to isolate and inflict greater economic pain on Russia as its troops regroup for a wave of attacks in eastern Ukraine, prompting urgent calls by Ukrainian officials for civilians there to flee.

“These next few days may be your last chance to leave!” the regional governor of Luhansk, Serhiy Haidai, declared in a video on Facebook. “The enemy is trying to cut off all possible ways to leave. Do not delay — evacuate.”

But the Western penalties were unlikely to persuade Russia to stop the war, and they revealed how the allies were trying to minimize their own economic pain and prevent themselves from becoming entangled in a direct armed conflict with Moscow.

In some ways, the efforts underscored internal tensions among Russia’s critics over how best to manage the next stage of the conflict, which has created the biggest refugee crisis in Europe since World War II. The war is also indirectly worsening humanitarian and economic problems far from Ukraine, including rising food and energy prices that are exacerbating hunger and inflation, particularly in developing nations.

It took two days of protracted talks in Brussels for the European Union to approve a fifth round of sanctions against Russia that included its first ban on a Russian energy source, coal. But the measures were softened by several caveats, highlighting Europe’s diminishing appetite to absorb further economic fallout from the war.

The ban would be phased in over four months, instead of three as originally proposed, according to E.U. diplomats. Germany had been pushing for a longer transition period to wind down existing contracts, even though Russian coal is easier to replace with purchases from other suppliers, compared with oil and gas.

European diplomats also agreed to ban Russian-flagged vessels from E.U. ports, block trucks from Russia and its ally, Belarus, from E.U. roads, and stop the import of Russian seafood, cement, wood and liquor and the export to Russia of quantum computers and advanced semiconductors.

Ukrainian officials had urged Western nations to go further and completely cut off purchases of Russian oil and gas, contending that existing sanctions would not cripple Russia’s economy quickly or severely enough to affect President Vladimir V. Putin’s campaign to subjugate Ukraine by force.

“As long as the West continues buying Russian gas and oil, it is supporting Ukraine with one hand while supporting the Russian war machine with the other hand,” Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said Thursday at NATO headquarters in Brussels, where he urged members of the alliance to accelerate promised help to Ukraine’s outgunned military.

The NATO secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said the alliance would “further strengthen and sustain our support to Ukraine, so that Ukraine prevails in the face of Russia’s invasion.” But he did not offer details.

At the United Nations, the General Assembly’s resolution suspending Russia from the Human Rights Council, a step advocated by the United States and its allies, was the strongest measure the organization has taken to castigate the Kremlin.

Although the decision carries little practical impact, Russia’s suspension, approved on a 93 to 24 vote, with 58 countries abstaining, was still a diplomatic slap that Russia, one of the United Nations’ founding members, had hoped to avoid.

“The country that’s perpetrating gross and systematic violations of human rights should not sit on a body whose job it is to protect those rights,” Antony J. Blinken, the secretary of state, said at NATO headquarters.

Russia, which resigned its seat on the Human Rights Council in protest, denounced the vote as “an attempt by the U.S. to maintain its domination and total control” and to “use human rights colonialism in international relations.”

China, Cuba, North Korea, Iran, Syria and Vietnam were among the countries that joined Russia in opposing the measure, while India, Brazil, South Africa and Mexico were among those that abstained. Some of those countries argued the move could worsen the war, and called for further investigation of reports of Russian atrocities.

The last country to lose its seat on the panel was Libya in 2011, after President Moammar al-Qaddafi launched a ferocious crackdown on antigovernment protesters.

Russia remains one of five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council with a veto power that it has already used to block a resolution calling on it to stop the war and withdraw its forces.

As U.N. members were deliberating, the United States Senate voted unanimously to strip Moscow of its preferential trade status and to ban the import of Russian energy into the United States. The legislation would allow the United States to impose higher tariffs on Russian goods. Russian energy, however, represents only a small fraction of American imports, and Moscow is already having trouble exporting its oil.

The House approved the bills later on Thursday, sending them to President Biden, who was expected to sign them.

The latest efforts to punish Russia over the Feb. 24 invasion were energized partly by international outrage over the discovery of many dead civilians by Ukrainian soldiers who reclaimed areas north of Kyiv that had been vacated by retreating Russian forces.

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, has said hundreds of bodies including children were found, many of them in the suburb of Bucha, and that many victims had been bound, tortured and shot in the head.

Mr. Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, was asked at NATO headquarters about reports of atrocities that may have been committed by Ukrainian troops.

He said he had heard about, but not seen, a video showing a group of Ukrainian soldiers killing captured Russian troops outside a village west of Kyiv. The video has been verified by The New York Times.

Mr. Kuleba said his country’s military observes the rules of warfare and would investigate any “isolated incidents” of atrocities.

“You don’t understand how it feels that Russian soldiers rape children,” he said. “This is not an excuse to those who violate the rules of warfare on either side of the front line. But there are some things which you simply can’t understand. I’m sorry.”

Mr. Blinken spoke with disgust about the atrocities attributed to Russian soldiers, saying “the sickening images and accounts coming out of Bucha and other parts of Ukraine have only strengthened our collective resolve.”

“The revulsion against what the Russian government is doing is palpable,” he said.

Russia has described evidence of the Bucha killings by Russian forces — including satellite images verified by The New York Times that show bodies on streets while still under Russian occupation — as fabricated.

Mr. Kuleba said the expected Russian assaults on the eastern regions of Luhansk and Donetsk made it more urgent that NATO members expedite delivery of weapons to help Ukraine defend itself.

“The discussion is not about the list of weapons,” Mr. Kuleba said. “The discussion is about the timeline. When do we get them?”

Mr. Blinken did not offer any new details on military assistance.

He noted that the United States had supplied Ukraine with arms for months, totaling more than $1.7 billion since Russia’s invasion began. That aid includes an additional $100 million worth of Javelin anti-tank missiles that the Biden administration approved for shipment this week.

Mr. Blinken expressed skepticism about the peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, saying he had “heard nothing from the Russians suggesting that they’re serious” about a negotiated settlement.

The mayor of the eastern city of Sloviansk, Vadim Lyakh, said it was “preparing for the worst” and stocking bomb shelters and hospitals with medical supplies and food.

“We have been watching closely how the Russians have encircled and seized nearby cities like Mariupol and Izium,” he said referring to two Ukrainian cities devastated by Russian attacks. “It’s clear that these cities were not evacuated in time, but in Sloviansk we have some notice, and that’s why we are actively pushing people to leave.”

Ukraine’s Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova has said 26 bodies had been found under two ruined buildings in the Kyiv region town of Borodianka, which is been being searched by the authorities after Russian troops occupying it withdrew.

In a televised briefing, Venediktova did not say if the authorities had established the cause of death, but she accused Russian troops of carrying out air raids on the town before they seized control of it.

“Borodianka is the worst in terms of destruction and in terms of the uncertainty about [the number of] victims,” she said.

Montenegro expels four Russian diplomats: report

Montenegro’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ordered four Russian diplomats to leave the country over violations of diplomatic norms, the Podgorica-based Pobjeda newspaper reported, citing sources from the ministry.

A diplomatic note has been handed over to Russia’s ambassador to Montenegro and the diplomats have a week to leave the country, the report said.

The government of Montenegro, a small ex-Yugoslav republic of just 628,000, has joined international sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.

His claims came after Ukraine’s prosecutor general said on Monday that the number of civilian casualties in Borodyanka may outweigh those in Bucha, where dozens of non-combatants have been found dead.

‘Very small’ number of Ukrainian troops get drone training in US

Ukrainian soldiers are being trained in the US to operate the Switchblade drones that Washington is supplying to Kyiv, a Pentagon official has said.

Pentagon Spokesperson John Kirby said a “very small” number of Ukrainian troops – less than a dozen – who were already present in the US before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began, are being trained.

“We took the opportunity, having them still in the country, to give them a couple of days’ worth of training on the Switchblades, so they can go back … to train others in the Ukrainian military,” Kirby said, adding that 100 drones have been sent to Ukraine.

Delay on Russia oil embargo decision is costing lives: Zelenskyy

The Ukrainian president has blasted Western leaders for being too slow to agree to impose an embargo on Russian oil – at the cost of Ukrainian lives.

“Some politicians are still unable to decide how to limit the flow of petrodollars and oil euros to Russia so as not to put their own economies at risk,” Zelenskyy said in a video.

“The only question is how many more Ukrainian men, how many more Ukrainian women, the Russian military will have time to kill in order for you, certain politicians – and we know who you are – to find some determination.”

Zelenskyy added that Moscow was making so much money from oil exports that it did not need to take peace talks seriously and called on the “democratic world” to shun Russian crude.

Russia has completed withdrawal from around Kyiv: US official

The US has assessed that Russia has completed its withdrawal from around Kyiv and is refitting and resupplying its troops for an expected redeployment into Ukraine, a senior US defence official said.

“We are assessing that all the Russians have left,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity, adding that the US assessment was completed in the past 24 hours.

But the official said Kyiv remained under threat, even if Russian ground troops had left the area. “The threat of [a] ground invasion [of Kyiv] is clearly gone for the moment … but it’s not clear what their longer-range goals are,” the official said.

Ukrainian refugees continue to stream to US-Mexico border

Ukrainian refugees have continued to make their way to Tijuana, Mexico, as they wait to cross the border into the US, and temporary shelters have sprung up in Mexico.

“This is very nice, really very nice. We have food. We have sleep,” Anastasiia Derezenko, a Ukrainian refugee, told the Associated Press news agency from a shelter run by a charity called Agape Ministries.

“For us, it’s difficult – a little cold at night … But you know it’s not dangerous. We stay without worry. Because we think about our people who stay now in Brovary, in Kyiv, in Bucha, in Irpin,” she said.

Coordinator Alex Fedorchuk said that 2,000 refugees have already made their way through the shelter to date.

IMF cuts Japan’s growth forecast amid Ukraine war fallout

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has cut Japan’s economic growth forecast and urged policymakers to consider preparing a contingency plan in case the Ukraine crisis derails a fragile recovery.

“Escalation of the Ukraine conflict poses significant downside risks to the Japanese economy,” the IMF said in a staff report.

The IMF said it now expects Japan’s economy to grow 2.4 percent this year, lower than a projection for 3.3 percent expansion made in January.

Ukraine war is descending towards ‘brutalisation’: expert

Jonathan Leader Maynard, an expert on genocide and war crimes at King’s College in London, has said that there is now evidence that the war in Ukraine is seeing an increasing “brutalisation”.

“To some extent, all wars involve significant civilian suffering, but this kind of severe violations of the laws of war is not universal, it is specific to certain conflicts,” Maynard told Al Jazeera.

“The evidence so far would suggest that this has been much more widespread in areas of Russian occupation particularly against civilians but there have been a few isolated crimes that appears to show Ukrainian forces engaging in violations of the law of war as well,” Maynard said in reference to a recent video that emerged that appeared to show Ukrainian soldiers shooting a captured Russian soldier.

Putin’s daughters hiding president’s wealth: US officials

US officials have said that Putin’s two adult daughters, Katerina and Maria, are hiding his wealth.

“We have reason to believe that Putin, and many of his cronies, and the oligarchs, hide their wealth, hide their assets, with family members that place their assets and their wealth in the US financial system, and also many other parts of the world,” a senior US administration official said.

“We believe that many of Putin’s assets are hidden with family members, and that’s why we’re targeting them,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

More than 1,000 people evacuated to Zaporizhzhia: Red Cross

An International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) team says it has led a convoy of buses and private cars carrying more than 1,000 people to Zaporizhzhia after the civilians fled Mariupol on their own.

“This convoy’s arrival to Zaporizhzhia is a huge relief for hundreds of people who have suffered immensely and are now in a safer location,” Pascal Hundt, the ICRC’s head of delegation in Ukraine, said in a statement.

“It’s clear, though, that thousands more civilians trapped inside Mariupol need safe passage out and aid to come in.”

US treasury secretary says Biden wants Russia out of G20

US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned that Russia’s aggression will have “enormous economic repercussions in Ukraine and beyond” and that President Joe Biden wants Moscow expelled from the Group of 20.

“President Biden’s made it clear, and I certainly agree with him, that it cannot be business as usual for Russia in any of the financial institutions,” Yellen said. “He’s asked that Russia be removed from the G20, and I’ve made clear to my colleagues in Indonesia that we will not be participating in a number of meetings if the Russians are there.”

Her comments at a US House Financial Services Committee hearing raised questions about the future of the G20, which has been the premier global economic and policy forum since the 2008-2009 financial crisis.

US sanctioning relatives of Russian officials in push to seize assets: White House

The US is imposing sanctions on the relatives of Russian officials to prevent them from concealing their assets, the White House has said.

Washington has imposed sanctions on Putin’s two adult daughters as well as Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov’s wife and daughter.

“We’ve seen a pattern over time [that] President Putin and Russian oligarchs stash assets and resources in the bank accounts of their family members. And so, this was an effort to get at those assets, and that’s why these individuals were sanctioned,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters.

FBI says it disrupted Russian hackers

US officials have said that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) disrupted thousands of routers and firewall appliances away from Russian military hackers.

“Fortunately, we were able to disrupt this botnet before it could be used,” US Attorney General Merrick Garland said.

An unsealed and redacted affidavit described the unusual operation as a preemptive move to stop Russian hackers from mobilising the compromised devices into a “botnet” – a network of hacked computers that can bombard other servers with rogue traffic.

Boston Marathon restricts Russian and Belarusian runners

The Boston Athletic Association (BAA) has said that Russian and Belarusian athletes who were accepted through open registration to the Boston Marathon and reside in their home countries will not be allowed to compete in this month’s event.

“We are horrified and outraged by what we have seen and learned from the reporting in Ukraine,” BAA President and CEO Tom Grilk said in a statement. “We believe that running is a global sport and, as such, we must do what we can to show our support to the people of Ukraine.”

Runners who are Russian and Belarusian citizens but reside outside either country will be permitted to compete but not under the Russian or Belarusian flag.

Russia faces ‘genocide’ charge, but experts urge caution

Images of corpses lining the streets and bodies stuffed into plastic bags in Bucha, near Ukraine’s capital Kyiv, have shaken the world, raising calls for credible investigations and accountability.

But the explosive “genocide” charge levied by Ukrainian and foreign government officials against Russia over the killings has proven contentious.

Legal experts say it is too early to determine whether genocide has occurred in Ukraine, stressing that while the term is politically damning, other human rights violations are also serious and should not be ignored.
