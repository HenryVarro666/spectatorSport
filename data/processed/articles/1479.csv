A huge blast shook the city at the time of the attack and fires could be seen blazing in the wreckage of the Retroville mall, AFP journalists say.

“One killed so far,” Mayor Vitali Klitschko says on Telegram.

“Enemy shelling” caused a fire on several floors of the mall in the city’s northwestern Podilsky district and set several cars ablaze, emergency services say on Facebook.

They release security camera footage showing a huge explosion and a mushroom cloud, followed by a series of smaller blasts.

Firefighters pulled at least one man covered in dust from the twisted debris, according to more video released by the emergency services.

Soldiers cordoned off the site and told journalists to move back, warning of danger from unexploded munitions without elaborating further.

Neighbors in a housing block whose windows were shattered by the blast say that they had seen a mobile rocket launcher near the mall for several days previously.

Kyiv has been hit by a series of strikes over the past week, with one on an apartment block earlier today wounding five people.

Russia’s advance on Kyiv has however largely stalled. Moscow’s forces engage in sporadic fighting to the northwest and east but have barely moved for two weeks.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-march-20-2022/

Russia now pursuing 'strategy of attrition,' U.K. defense ministry says The British defense ministry believes the Kremlin has ""been surprised"" by the resistance of Ukrainian forces to its attack and invasion of the country, and is now pursuing a strategy likely to increase harm to civilians. The United Kingdom in an intelligence update Saturday said that Russia ""is now pursuing a strategy of attrition."" ""This is likely to involve the indiscriminate use of firepower resulting in increased civilian casualties, destruction of Ukrainian infrastructure, and intensify the humanitarian crisis,"" the U.K. defense ministry said. Cities in Ukraine have been bombarded since Russia invaded the country in what Western countries have condemned as an unprovoked and unjustified attack. The United Nations has recorded 2,149 civilian casualties in Ukraine since Russia attacked Feb. 24, including 816 killed — 59 of which were children.The U.N. human rights office says the actual number of civilian casualties is ""much higher."" Russia has denied targeting civilians. More than 3 million refugees have fled the country, according to the U.N. Share this -







Celebrated Ukrainian actor Oksana Shvets is killed in Kyiv Celebrated Ukrainian actor Oksana Shvets was killed in Kyiv when a residential building was hit by Russian shelling, her theater company announced Thursday. She was 67. The Molodyi Theater, where Shvets had been a troupe member for decades, said in a Facebook post that there was “unrepairable grief in the family of Molodyi Theater,"" according to an NBC News translation. “There is no forgiveness for the enemy that has come to our land,” the post said. Shvets, who studied at the Ivan Franko Drama Theater and the Institute of Theater Arts, appeared in dozens of roles at the Young Theater, including a recent production of the play “Enchanted.” She was awarded the Merited Artist of Ukraine, an honorary title for outstanding achievement in performing arts. Shvets was killed as Russian forces advanced on Ukraine’s capital and appeared to target civilians. Kyiv's city council said Friday that since the invasion began, Russian attacks have damaged 36 residential buildings, five homes and 11 schools, including four kindergartens, according to an NBC News translation. The officials said that 222 people, including four children, have been killed. NBC News has not been able to independently verify those claims. Russia has denied targeting civilians.

Russian cosmonauts arrive at International Space Station in flight suits in colors of Ukraine flag Three Russian cosmonauts have arrived at the International Space Station wearing flight suits in yellow and blue colors that match the Ukrainian flag. The men were the first new arrivals on the space station since the start of the Russian war in Ukraine last month. Video of one of the cosmonauts taken as the capsule prepared to dock with the space station showed him wearing a blue flight suit. It was unclear what, if any, message the yellow uniforms they changed into were intended to send. Oleg Artemyev was asked about the yellow flight suits when the newly arrived cosmonauts were able to talk to family back on Earth. He said every crew chooses its own flight suits, so that they are not all the same. “It became our turn to pick a color. But in fact, we had accumulated a lot of yellow material so we needed to use it. So that’s why we had to wear yellow,” he said. Artemyev, Denis Matveyev and Sergey Korsakov blasted off successfully from the Russia-leased Baikonur launch facility in Kazakhstan in their Soyuz MS-21 spacecraft at 8:55 p.m. Friday. They smoothly docked at the station just over three hours later, joining two Russians, four Americans and a German on the orbiting outpost. Share this -







Ukraine says it’ll take years to defuse mines KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine’s interior minister said Friday that it will take years to defuse unexploded ordnances after the Russian invasion. Denys Monastyrsky said that the country will need Western assistance to cope with the massive task once the war is over. “A huge number of shells and mines have been fired at Ukraine and a large part haven’t exploded, they remain under the rubble and pose a real threat,” Monastyrsky said. “It will take years, not months, to defuse them.” In addition to the unexploded Russian ordnances, the Ukrainian troops also have planted land mines at bridges, airports and other key infrastructure to prevent Russians from using them. “We won’t be able to remove the mines from all that territory, so I asked our international partners and colleagues from the European Union and the United States to prepare groups of experts to demine the areas of combat and facilities that came under shelling,” Monastyrsky said. He noted that another top challenge is dealing with fires caused by the relentless Russian barrages. He said there’s a desperate shortage of personnel and equipment to deal with the fires amid the constant shelling. Share this -







Macron, Scholz press for cease-fire in calls with Putin PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday asked Russian President Vladimir Putin to lift the siege of Mariupol, allow humanitarian access and order an immediate cease-fire, Macron’s office said. Macron spoke with the Russian leader on the phone for 70 minutes. Earlier in the day, Putin had a conversation with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who also pressed for an immediate cease-fire. Macron, who has spoken numerous times with Putin, revisited complaints over repeated attacks on civilians and Russia’s failure to respect human rights in Ukraine, the presidential Elysee Palace said. It said that Putin, in turn, laid the blame for the war on Ukraine. Macron, who is campaigning to renew his mandate in April elections, said during a town hall-style meeting shortly before the call that he talks to Putin because he believes there is a way toward peace, between the Ukrainian resistance, tough Western sanctions and diplomatic pressure. “We must do everything to find it,” he said.

Over 9,100 Ukrainians evacuated through humanitarian corridors More than 9,100 Ukrainians were evacuated from the war-torn country on Friday through humanitarian corridors, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said in a video posted to Telegram. At least 500 people were transported by bus, while others fled by car. Ten evacuation buses will be available Saturday from the port city of Berdyansk, Vereshchuk said. The evacuees, the majority from the northeastern region of Sumy, used seven of nine previously established humanitarian corridors. They were less effective in the Kharkiv region, Vereshchuk said, adding that Ukraine is working to establish new corridors in the regions of Kharkiv, Kherson and Luhansk. Share this -







Ukrainian engineers repairing power lines at nuclear plant Engineers repairing one of three damaged power lines linking Europe's largest nuclear power plant to Ukraine's electricity grid expect work to be completed by early next week, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency. Russian forces took control of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant on March 4, damaging two high-voltage external power lines. A third lost connection last week but is expected to be reconnected Tuesday. All safety systems at the plant remain fully functional, and there are no safety concerns, IAEA said. In Kharkiv, a nuclear research facility previously damaged by shelling continues to have no external power supply. Personnel remain at the facility, which is used for research, development and radioisotope production for medical and industrial applications. Overall, eight of Ukraine's 15 reactors are operational, the agency said, and radiation levels are in the normal range. Share this -







Biden and China's Xi discuss Ukraine crisis, Taiwan President Joe Biden on Friday warned Chinese President Xi Jinping against aiding Russian President Vladimir Putin's assault on Ukraine. In a video conference, Biden ""described the implications and consequences if China provides material support to Russia,"" the White House said. The two leaders also discussed Taiwan. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has stoked fears that China could use military force to annex that self-governing democratic nation. ""The President reiterated that U.S. policy on Taiwan has not changed, and emphasized that the United States continues to oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo,"" The White House said in a brief summary of the video call.

Xi tells Biden that China committed to international norms, ministry says Biden holds call with Chinese President Xi Jinping March 18, 2022 03:29 In a Friday morning video call, Chinese President Xi Jinping told President Joe Biden that China is committed to international norms regarding Ukraine, the Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement. It said the two leaders spoke about the situation in Ukraine, on which China has taken a neutral position. The U.S. has been concerned that China is considering supplying Russia with military equipment to bolster its invasion. ""China stands for peace and opposes war. This is embedded in China’s history and culture. China makes a conclusion independently based on the merits of each matter. China advocates upholding international law and universally recognized norms governing international relations. China adheres to the UN Charter and promotes the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security,"" the ministry said. Xi told Biden the U.S. and NATO should have a dialogue with Russia about what precipitated Russia's invasion into Ukraine, the ministry said, and Xi also expressed concerns about sanctions. ""Sweeping and indiscriminate sanctions would only make the people suffer,"" he said, in part, according to the ministry. If further escalated, they could trigger serious crises in global economy and trade, finance, energy, food, and industrial and supply chains, crippling the already languishing world economy and causing irrevocable losses.""

Ukrainian negotiator tells experts to 'take a break,' says, 'We have everything in order' Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian presidential adviser and negotiator in the peace talks with Russia, told experts on Friday to ""take a break"" from commenting on how to wage war against and negotiate with Russia, suggesting that doing so implies Ukraine's leaders are unclear about what actions to take. ""Please, stop the 'experts' blabbering about how to wage a war or negotiate properly while hiding in an unknown place,"" he tweeted. ""We know what we’re doing & we‘ll correct all their mistakes."" ""We have everything in order,"" Podolyak said in a video posted with the tweet. ""We are absolutely defending our freedom."" ""If we continue what we have been doing for many years, when we split our country, we can get a very insignificant result, and we only need a winning result,"" he added. Podolyak said the war has united Ukraine and shows the country's strength. ""Look, we all know, we understand very well what values are in Ukraine now, what a powerful country Ukraine is, and we will definitely not give up any interest, especially for our children who are sitting in basements under Russian fire and for our heroes who die in the battles,"" he said.

Some big name firms are balking at shunning Russia, despite Ukraine invasion While hundreds of well-known companies like McDonald's and Coca-Cola are shutting down or suspending their operations in Russia in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine, a Kansas-based oil, gas and manufacturing giant is sitting tight for now. Koch Industries, whose subsidiary Guardian Industries operates two glass-manufacturing plants in Russia that employ 600 people, said closing up shop now would put its workers there “at greater risk and do more harm than good.” “The horrific and abhorrent aggression against Ukraine is an affront to humanity,” Koch Industries President Dave Robertson said in a statement, adding that the company is “complying with all applicable sanctions, laws and regulations governing our relationships and transactions within all countries where we operate.” But Koch Industries, which has contributed millions of dollars to the Republican Party and has a couple of other operations in Moscow that employs a dozen more people, is hardly the only well-known firm bucking the tide of iconic companies exiting Russia, according to a list compiled by Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a senior professor at the Yale University School of Management. As of Friday, there were 26 other companies that Sonnenfeld has categorized as “digging in” and defying international calls to get out of Russia. Read the full story. Share this -







Russian cosmonauts set to launch to space station against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine Three Russian cosmonauts are set to launch to the International Space Station on Friday, a normally routine mission to the orbiting outpost that is now taking place against the backdrop of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Scrutiny over the planned liftoff has grown as the conflict in Ukraine has strained relations between Russia and its space station partners, including NASA, and has called into question the future of the iconic orbiting lab. Cosmonauts Oleg Artemyev, Denis Matveev and Sergey Korsakov are scheduled to launch aboard a Soyuz rocket and capsule at 11:55 a.m. ET from Russia's spaceport, the Baikonur Cosmodrome, in southern Kazakhstan.

U.S. ambassador: Moscow's bioweapons allegations 'malarky,' like a 'chain email from some dark corner of the internet' The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, denounced Russia on Friday for what she called false allegations that Ukraine performs biological weapons research and has U.S. support for the effort. At a U.N. Security Council meeting, she said the Russian representative to the United Nations went on a ""tirade of bizarre conspiracy theories"" last week and this week ""we're hearing a whole lot more where that came from — things that sound like they were forwarded to him on a chain email from some dark corner of the internet."" ""President Biden has a word for this kind of talk: malarkey,"" she said. Thomas-Greenfield reiterated that despite Russia's claims, Ukraine does not have a biological weapons program. ""There are no Ukrainian biological weapons laboratories — not near Russia's border, not anywhere. There are only public health facilities, proudly — and I say proudly — supported and recognized by the U.S. government, the World Health Organization, and other governments and international institutions,"" she said. ""In fact, it is Russia that has long maintained a biological weapons program in violation of international law. It is Russia that has a well-documented history of using chemical weapons. It is Russia who is the aggressor here."" The ambassador said the U.S. has deep concerns that Russia's decision to call Friday's meeting over the allegations ""is a potential false flag effort in action."" ""Russia has repeatedly — repeatedly — accused other countries of the very violations it plans to perpetrate. We continue to believe it is possible that Russia may be planning to use chemical or biological agents against the Ukrainian people,"" she said. Share this -

At least 816 civilians killed in Ukraine since invasion, U.N. Rights Office says At least 816 civilians have died since Russia invaded Ukraine last month, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a statement Friday. Seven girls and 16 boys were among the dead, the statement said, although it added that it believed the actual figures were ""considerably higher,"" because many reports were still pending corroboration and others had been delayed. A further 1,333 civilians had been injured in the conflict, it said. NBC News has not independently confirms these numbers. ""Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes,"" the statement said.

Burger King partner in Russia refuses to close 800 locations Burger King is moving to divest its 15 percent stake in its Russian business, but the burger chain said it can’t legally suspend operations in the market right away. The Restaurant Brands International chain announced last week it was suspending all corporate support for its 800-plus franchised locations in Russia in response to the Kremlin’s ongoing attacks on Ukraine. The suspension includes refusing approvals for further investment or expansion and pausing operations, marketing and its supply chain. But the company’s International President David Shear laid out in an open letter to employees on Thursday that the structure of the company’s Russian business hampers its ability to shutter restaurants in the market like some of its competitors. “Would we like to suspend all Burger King operations immediately in Russia? Yes. Are we able to enforce a suspension of operations today? No,” Shear said. Burger King entered Russia through a joint venture with businessperson Alexander Kolobov, Investment Capital Ukraine and VTB Capital, which has been hit by U.S. sanctions as an affiliate of a major Russian bank.

Facing resistance in Ukraine, Putin turns to a familiar playbook: Bombing civilians It was a desperate plea from a city under siege: ""CHILDREN"" in huge bold letters. Satellite images from Maxar Technologies, a U.S. Defense contractor, this week showed the word clearly written in front of and behind a theater that Ukraine says was sheltering women and children in the port city of Mariupol. But on Wednesday, the building was blown up with hundreds of civilians inside, according to the Mariupol City Council. ""Russians could not have not known this was a civilian shelter,"" Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said. The number of casualties is not yet known — and the Kremlin denies targeting civilians — but experts say the incident is an indication that Russian President Vladimir Putin has turned to a familiar and pitiless playbook. With his troops bogged down in the mud, running out of food and fuel and hemorrhaging casualties, many analysts believe that Putin's battle plan is in the mire — and in desperation he has pivoted to the brutal tactics used in the Russian republic of Chechnya in 1999 and in Syria in 2015.

Ukrainians take a page from Tolkien in nickname for Russian troops Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko on Friday referred to Russian forces as ""orcs."" Ukrainian resistance fighters and protesters are using the term, too. The nickname appears to be a reference to the brutish monsters of the same name from J.R.R. Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" fantasy series. In the books (and their film adaptations), the Dark Lord Sauron dispatches the orcs to do his bidding on the battlefield. In the decades since Tolkien's novels were published, orcs have taken root in the popular consciousness — but the author's conception of the malevolent goblins has also drawn accusations of racism.

Democrats link Ukraine’s democracy struggle to one closer to home WASHINGTON — Top Democrats are drawing parallels between the existential fight for democracy in Ukraine and the struggle to protect American democracy, citing the war to reaffirm their desire for new guardrails around institutions like free and fair elections. “I’m hoping that seeing the Ukrainians come under attack because they’re a democracy and defend their country so bravely because they believe in democracy increases faith in ours here at home,” Rep. Colin Allred, D-Texas, said in an interview. “I feel very strongly that we’ve had, really, an unprecedented period of questioning our own small-d democratic values and, culminating in January 6, an attempt to overthrow a presidential election here. “The best thing we can do for the world is to present an example of a functioning democracy at a time when, around the world, autocracies are on the rise and are literally attacking democracies like in Ukraine,” Allred said, suggesting that the death and destruction inflicted by Russian leader Vladimir Putin will give pause to Americans who may want to ""put our faith in a strongman.""

Biden and Xi to hold call as U.S. steps up pressure on China U.S. President Joe Biden will hold a phone call with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, on Friday as Washington raises concerns over China’s growing ties with Russia. The direct talks, which are the first between the two leaders since November, will be held at 9 a.m. ET. On Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Biden “will make clear that China will bear responsibility for any actions it takes to support Russia’s aggression, and we will not hesitate to impose costs.” Beijing has so far avoided direct condemnation of the Russian invasion and has criticized the wide-ranging sanctions imposed on Moscow by the West. Some U.S. lawmakers have raised the idea of sanctioning China as well if it is found to be supporting Russia’s war effort. “China opposes all forms of unilateral sanctions and ‘long-arm jurisdiction’ by the U.S.,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said at a news briefing on Wednesday. “We will resolutely defend the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies and individuals.” “If the U.S. insists on having its own way, China will definitely take strong countermeasures,” he added.

India reportedly bought 3 million barrels of oil from Russia India has reportedly bought 3 million barrels of crude oil from Russia, according to The Associated Press. Eighty-five percent of oil in India is imported, and the country is under strain to meet demand domestically. Russia reportedly offered India a discounted price of 20 percent below global benchmark prices, according to the AP. “India imports most of its oil requirements. We are exploring all possibilities in the global energy market. I don’t think Russia has been a major oil supplier to India,” External Affairs Minister Arindam Bagchi told AP about the sale. Countries including the United States have called on India to suspend trade relations with Moscow and to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Earlier this month, India abstained from a United Nations vote censuring Russia. “Think about where you want to stand when history books are written at this moment in time. Support for Russian leadership is support for an invasion which has a devastating impact,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said after earlier reports of India buying discounted oil.

Several missiles hit near Lviv airport, mayor says Several missiles destroyed buildings at an aircraft repair facility near the airport in the Ukrainian city of Lviv, the mayor said. There were no immediate report of casualties. The missiles did not strike the airport itself, the mayor said Friday through his Telegram channel. The information was preliminary, and more details were not immediately clear. NBC News has not independently confirmed the attack. The mayor said rescuers and other personnel were headed to the site, but that there was no work being done at the repair facility at the time of the attack.

Getty Images An air alarm was sounded in Lviv at about 6:08 a.m., and at about 6:25 a.m. three explosions were heard on the outskirts of the city. Lviv is in western Ukraine, around 40 miles from the border with Poland. Russia recently launched a series of strikes in the western part of the country, including a missile attack early Sunday that killed 35 people. Share this -







90 percent of Mariupol is destroyed, Ukraine defense ministry says The southern port city Mariupol has been 90 percent destroyed amid incessant shelling and advances by Russian troops, Ukraine’s defense ministry said Friday. The besieged city is bearing the brunt of Russian strikes with no electricity, gas or heat with temperatures dropping to 22 degrees Fahrenheit. The ministry has accused Russia of keeping the residents hostage by blocking agreed-upon humanitarian corridors in the city, with people struggling to find safe shelters. This week, a Mariupol theater where people were seeking shelter was hit by a Russian airstrike. Satellite images from the U.S. government-linked technology firm Maxar appeared to show the word ""CHILDREN"" written outside the building in large white letters. It was unclear how many people were in the building, but officials said Thursday that the shelter held up. Share this -

The threatened expansion of the war alarmed world officials even as President Biden warned his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, against assisting Russia militarily or economically.

In a telephone call that lasted nearly two hours, Biden told Xi that China would suffer “consequences” if it came to Russia’s aid, the White House said. Beijing said Xi advocated for negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, and between the U.S. and Russia to address Moscow’s security concerns. China has repeatedly refused to condemn the invasion of Ukraine.

More civilians were killed or wounded in the besieged capital of Kyiv on Friday, and painstaking attempts to rescue any survivors from a bombed shelter in the battered port city of Mariupol continued, after more than 100 people came out of the ruins alive but hundreds more remained missing and possibly buried.

In Lviv, about 40 miles from the Polish border, missiles landed before sunrise at the decommissioned repair center outside the city’s airport, which is currently used only for military flights, according to Mayor Andriy Sadovyi, who said at least one person was injured in the attack.

In a Facebook post, Sadovyi said the strikes destroyed the building. He warned residents, who have become accustomed to daily air-raid sirens but often ignore them because their city has been largely spared from shelling, to be more vigilant in looking out for danger.

“Be careful, follow instructions when air-raid sirens alert,” he said.

Hours after the attack, plumes of smoke were still rising from the stricken facility on the western edges of Lviv. Several military vehicles converged on the site.

According to the Ukrainian Air Force, Russian forces launched six missiles from the Black Sea, two of which were intercepted.

Friday’s strikes marked the second time in a week that missiles have struck the Lviv area, which has been largely insulated from the war raging in the vicinity of the capital, Kyiv, and elsewhere in the country. A swarm of Russian cruise missiles early Sunday hit a military training facility northwest of Lviv, killing at last 40 Ukrainian military personnel.

Each of those attacks has raised the specter that Russian firepower, by accident or design, could hit neighboring Poland, whose NATO membership might trigger response by other European countries and the U.S. The United States recently beefed up its deployment of American troops in Poland and other countries on NATO’s eastern flank.

In Kyiv, residents awoke Friday to another airstrike that hit an apartment building. According to Ukraine emergency service officials, one person was killed and 19 were injured in a fire that engulfed the building after the attack on Podilskyi, a district northwest of the city center.

The attack brought to 222 the total death toll in Kyiv since Russia’s invasion of its neighbor began Feb. 24, the Kyiv city administration said.

Ukrainian officials said Friday that they had agreed with Russia on opening nine humanitarian aid and evacuation corridors in areas including the hard-hit southeastern city of Mariupol, where an airstrike injured at least 130 in a crowded bomb shelter this week, and the eastern city of Sumy, from which thousands of people have already escaped.

Some of the evacuation routes have routinely been blocked over the last several days, according to Ukraine. On Thursday, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said more than 2,000 people were bused out of Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia, about 150 miles away. That represents only a tiny fraction of Mariupol residents wishing to flee their blockaded city, where living conditions have grown increasingly desperate.

Negotiations between Ukraine and Russia have taken place every day this week, with no agreement on an end to the fighting. Earlier in the week, representatives for both sides cited progress in the talks, but in a call Friday with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Putin accused the Ukrainians of stalling. A readout of the conversation in TASS, the Russian state-owned news agency, said the Russian leader accused the “Kyiv regime” of trying to delay negotiations by “putting forward more and more unrealistic proposals.”

Putin has insisted that his own demands — including Ukraine’s “de-militarization” and its renunciation of any intention to join NATO or the European Union — be completely fulfilled before any cessation of armed hostilities.

Pursuit of NATO membership is enshrined in Ukraine’s constitution, but President Volodymyr Zelensky shifted on the issue this week, saying he accepts that the country will not join the alliance.

Zelensky tweeted Friday that aspirations to join the EU remain, saying he had a “substantial conversation” with Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm. Zelensky said the commission’s “opinion on [Ukrainian] application for EU membership will be prepared within a few months.”

Putin also claims Russian ownership of Crimea, which it annexed in 2014. The reclusive Russian leader, who has rarely appeared publicly since the invasion, spoke Friday at a Moscow stadium for a celebration of the eighth anniversary of the annexation. Moscow officials said 200,000 people attended the rally, which featured a singer performing the song “Made in the USSR,” whose lyrics open with “Ukraine and Crimea, Belarus and Moldova, it’s all my country.”

Praising Russian troops, Putin paraphrased the Bible and said: “There is no greater love than giving up one’s soul for one’s friends.” He repeated the false claim that the war was necessary to stop the “genocide” of Russian speakers.

Vereshchuk said Ukraine would not recognize the Crimean peninsula as part of Russia — which has been floated as a possible concession by Kyiv to help bring an end to the war.

“Recognition of Crimea as Russian is impossible. Too much blood and sacrifices have already been spilled on our part to keep Ukrainian territory intact and undivided,” Vereshchuk said on Facebook.

She reiterated Kyiv’s demands for a cease-fire, the complete withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian territory and a new agreement that would ensure Ukraine’s security in the future.

Throughout three weeks of bombardment, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have fled their country’s eastern regions for Lviv, Kyiv and other areas in the west. But local residents say the daily rocket attacks on the capital’s residential neighborhoods have made them feel less safe even as Russian forces are stalled outside the city. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said a kindergarten and a school were damaged, along with at least six other buildings, in Friday’s strike on a residential building.

“It’s a war against civilians. … It’s just apartments,” not a military installation, Klitschko told reporters.

He said he expected Kyiv to come under stronger onslaught: “If you look in Mariupol, if you look in Kharkiv, if you look in other cities — Chernihiv, right now — where ... the city will be destroyed, I expect the Russians [will] do it exactly the same way in Kyiv.”

World & Nation Full coverage of the war in Ukraine Russia’s war in Ukraine is causing a European refugee crisis on a scale not seen since World War II and raising fears of a return to Cold War-era dynamics.

The impact of Friday’s explosion in Kyiv’s Podilskyi district could be seen far beyond the large crater it left in the central courtyard outside a number of apartment buildings. That courtyard was carpeted with glass granules, hunks of masonry and metal. The shock wave ripped through the buildings around it, popping window frames out of the walls, pulverizing glass and turning furniture into jumbles of wood and metal.

A supermarket more than 500 feet away from the crater had its windows blown out, with shelves laden with syrup bottles and gumdrops displaced by the force of the explosion.

Residents packed bags to evacuate. Evgenia Gavrylenko, a bank teller who lived on the fourth floor of one building, had her suitcases laid out on the bed of her guest room, the one area that seemed to have escaped the destruction. She used an expletive to describe Russian President Vladimir Putin as she took a drag of her cigarette and looked around her apartment.

On the floor above, one man was boarding up his residence while Skyping with his wife and daughter to show them the destruction. Outside, others lugged bags and suitcases.

In the port city of Mariupol, officials said the rescues continued after airstrikes this week on a theater where more than 1,000 people were sheltering. The death toll at the theater, which had the word “children” written on the ground outside of it, was still unknown.

Sergiy Taruta, a Ukrainian lawmaker and former regional official, said in a television interview that it was a struggle to rescue individuals because Russian attacks have decimated the city’s resources.

“People are doing everything themselves. My friends went to help, but due to constant shelling it was not safe. People are clearing away the rubble themselves,” Taruta said. “There is no rescue operation, because all the services that are supposed to rescue people, to treat them, to bury them — these services no longer exist.”

The war, now in its 23rd day, has sent more than 3.1 million people fleeing Ukraine.

The United Nations has counted 816 civilians killed — at least 52 of them children — since the invasion started. U.N. officials acknowledge that the real number is likely far higher.

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Russian troops launched a new round of attacks on parts of the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv as forces also launched missiles at the outskirts of Lviv, a city that had been seen as a refuge for those trying to escape the war-torn country.

Chilling photographs show the devastating aftermath of the attacks against a residential district in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital. Russian forces, led by President Vladimir Putin, also launched a series of missiles strikes targeting the western city of Lviv.
