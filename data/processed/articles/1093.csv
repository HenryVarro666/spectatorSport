This is how Joe Biden's government describes them, and in their fifth package of sanctions against Vladimir Putin's government, they have directly attacked the family of the Russian leader. Specifically his two daughters, Katerina and Mariya Tikhonova.

Meanwhile, Russian attacks on Ukrainian soil have waned as Putin's troops have gradually withdrawn from Ukraine's main cities, focusing on the Donbas region, particularly Lugansk and Donetsk. The governor of Donetsk urged residents to leave the city.

In relation to Putin's possible strategy, Washington announced new sanctions against companies and the Russian president's inner circle for the ""war crimes"" in Bucharest, for which Russia is accused of being the main and only party responsible.

The US have not hesitated to tighten sanctions on Russia even further, so much so that Putin's two eldest daughters are the main targets.

Russian prime minister Mikhail Mishustin, the wife and children of foreign minister Sergey Lavrov and several members of Russia's Security Council are also named.

""I made it clear that Russia would pay a severe and immediate price for its atrocities in Bucha. Today, together with our allies and partners, we are announcing a new round of devastating sanctions,"" Joe Biden announced on his Twitter account.

The fifth set of measures against Russia:

A total blocking of sanctions against Russia's largest financial institution, Sberbank, and Russia's largest private bank, Alfa Bank;

A ban on new investments in Russia. Biden will sign a new Executive Order that includes a ban on investments by US persons;

Full-blown blocking sanctions against major Russian state-owned companies;

Full-blown blocking sanctions against Russian elites and their families, including sanctions against Putin's adult children.

Who are Vladimir Putin's daughters?

Katerina Tikhonova is a scientist and the head of an artificial intelligence institute at Moscow State University.

According to the US, she is a ""technology executive whose work supports the Russian government and defence industry"".

Mariya Khitonova is an endocrinologist and co-owner of a healthcare investment project. In the eyes of Washington, Mariya ""runs state-funded programmes that have received billions of dollars from the Kremlin for genetic research and are personally overseen by Putin"".",https://www.marca.com/en/lifestyle/world-news/2022/04/07/624ec26646163f18a08b45bc.html

4,3ef8277c-04b9-4027-8635-ea25899ce4c2,"['Laura Kelly', 'Tobias Burns', 'The Hill Via Nexstar Media Wire']",2022-04-06 15:49:03+00:00,"(The Hill) — The Biden administration on Wednesday announced a wave of new sanctions targeting Russia’s two largest banks, daughters, the wife and daughter of Russia’s top diplomat and blacklisted members of Russia’s Security Council.

A senior administration official said the measures are being imposed in alignment with allies in the Group of Seven nations and the European Union and are in response to “the sickening brutality” recently discovered in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha following the retreat of Russian forces.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of committing genocide, while the U.S. and other international leaders have said the images of civilians discovered bound, shot at close range, piled in cellars and left for dead on the street likely amount to war crimes.

The senior administration official said the U.S. and allies are “intensifying the most severe sanctions ever levied on a major economy” and that the result is to send Russia “into economic and financial and technological isolation.” The official added the country will “go back to Soviet-style living standards from the 1980s.”

The administration allowed a carve-out for energy, given the E.U.’s dependence on Russian oil and gas, but said it is working with allied nations to reduce such imports.

The measures announced Wednesday impose full blocking sanctions on Russia’s largest state-owned bank, Sberbank, and its largest private bank, Alfa Bank, freezing any assets “touching” the U.S. financial system and prohibiting Americans from doing business with them.

“Any transaction, in any currency with a U.S. person or U.S. institution is prohibited,” the official said of the full blocking sanctions, targeting Russian efforts to receive payment in currencies other than the U.S. dollar to undercut sanctions.

“This is the most severe action we can take in terms of financial measures,” the official said.

Alfa Bank is Russia’s largest privately-owned financial institution and its fourth-largest financial institution overall. The administration had sanctioned Sberbank on Feb. 24, the day Russia launched its invasion, blocking all U.S. business with the financial institution.

Sberbank is Russia’s largest bank, controls about a third of all bank assets in Russia and is majority-owned by the government.

“In total, we’ve now fully blocked more than two-thirds of the Russian banking sector, which before the invasion held about $1.4 trillion in assets,” the senior administration official said.

The administration imposed personal sanctions against two of Putin’s adult daughters, Maria Putina and Katerina Tikhonova and the wife and daughter on Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

The U.S. also imposed sanctions on former President and Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev, who is a prominent voice supporting Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.

“These individuals have enriched themselves at the expense of the Russian people. Some of them are responsible for providing the support necessary to underpin Putin’s war on Ukraine,” the administration said in a statement. “This action cuts them off from the U.S. financial system and freezes any assets they hold in the United States.”

Other sanctions include a ban on new investment in Russia, which will be imposed with an executive order by President Joe Biden. It adds to the exit of nearly 600 multinational companies, the administration official said, and robs the Russian economy of “private sector know-how and skills that travel with investment.”

“The knock-on effects to the ongoing brain drain from Russia will be profound,” the official said.

The official said that the administration on Monday had “cut off Russia’s ability to use its frozen central bank funds to make debt payments,” requiring Moscow to find “new sources of dollars from outside the U.S. and to find a new payment route other than U.S. banks, to avoid falling into default.”

The Russian Finance Ministry on Wednesday said it was forced to pay $649.2 million to foreign debt-holders in rubles amid the sanctions, with the Moscow Times reporting it raised the prospect of Moscow potentially defaulting on its debt.

The U.S. sanctions, however, include carve-outs to support access to telecommunications and information to provide “outside perspectives to the Russian people,” the administration said. There are also carve-outs to allow access to medicine and medical devices and humanitarian efforts, including to ensure the availability of basic foodstuffs and agricultural commodities.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday warned that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the sanctions response by the international community is contributing to a spike in food, energy and fertilizer costs impacting 1.2 billion people in 74 developing countries.

Russia’s war against Ukraine is entering its second month and while Moscow’s retreat from Kyiv is being viewed as an important victory for Ukraine, Ukrainian officials and other global leaders are warning that the Kremlin is massing forces to focus on the east of the country, in particular the Donbas, and cities in the South.

The Ukrainian southern port city of Mariupol, under a Russian siege for more than a month, is viewed as suffering some of the most heinous atrocities of the war. The U.N. coordinator for humanitarian efforts, Martin Griffith, described it as the “center of hell” during a Security Council meeting on Tuesday.

The Biden administration said its sanctions are meant as a broader strategy that includes support for Ukraine’s military to push back against Moscow’s offense.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced on Tuesday that the U.S. would provide an additional $100 million in security assistance to Ukraine, in particular Javelin anti-armor systems, and brings the total amount provided by the U.S. since the start of the invasion to more than $1.7 billion.

“The world has been shocked and appalled by the atrocities committed by Russia’s forces in Bucha and across Ukraine. Ukraine’s forces bravely continue to defend their country and their freedom, and the United States, along with our Allies and partners, stand steadfast in support of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Blinken said in a statement.

In total, the Biden administration has provided $2.4 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since January 2021.",https://www.fox46.com/news/world-news/ukraine-crisis/biden-targets-putins-daughters-russian-banks-in-new-wave-of-sanctions/

The United Kingdom and the European Union were set to take additional steps, including a ban on new investment in Russian and an EU embargo on coal, after the recent evidence of atrocities that has emerged in the wake of the retreat by Russian forces from areas around Kyiv, including the town of Bucha.

In addition to sanctions aimed at Putin’s adult daughters, Mariya Putina and Katerina Tikhonova, the US is targeting Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin; the wife and children of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov; and members of Russia’s Security Council, including Dmitry Medvedev, a former president and prime minister.

The penalties cut off all of Putin’s close family members from the US financial system and freeze any assets they hold in the United States.

US President Joe Biden called the latest round of sanctions “devastating”.

“I made clear that Russia would pay a severe and immediate price for its atrocities in Bucha,” Biden said in a tweet.

Biden was expected to will sign an executive order that would ban new investment in Russia by Americans no matter where they are living. The US Treasury Department is preparing more sanctions against major Russian state-owned enterprises, according to the White House.

Videos and images of bodies in the streets of Bucha after it was recaptured from Russian forces have unleashed a wave of indignation among Western allies, who have drawn up new sanctions as a response.

The European Commission’s proposed ban on coal imports would be the first EU sanctions targeting Russia’s lucrative energy industry over its war in Ukraine.

EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said energy was key to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war coffers.

“A billion euro is what we pay Putin every day for the energy he provides us since the beginning of the war. We have given him 35 billion euro. Compare that to the one billion that we have given to the Ukraine in arms and weapons,” Borrell said.

After several European countries announced the expulsion of Russian diplomats, the European Commission proposed a fifth package of sanctions including a ban on coal imports that could be adopted as soon as Wednesday once unanimously approved by the 27-nation bloc's ambassadors.

The United States and Western allies plan to impose a ban on all new investment in Russia. Among the other measures being taken against Russia are greater sanctions on its financial institutions and state-owned enterprises, and sanctions on government officials and their family members, according to White House press secretary Jen Psaki.

Separately, the Treasury Department moved Tuesday to block any Russian government debt payments with US dollars from accounts at US financial institutions, making it harder for Russia to meet its financial obligations.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the coal ban is worth 4 billion euros per year and that the EU has already started working on additional sanctions, including on oil imports.

She didn’t mention natural gas, with consensus among the 27 EU countries on targeting the fuel used to generate electricity and heat homes difficult to secure amid opposition from gas-dependent members like Germany, the bloc’s largest economy.

“The new package includes a ban on coal imports,” Michel said on Wednesday. “I think that measures on oil, and even gas, will also be needed, sooner or later.”

The new package of measures proposed by the commission also includes sanctions on more individuals and four key Russian banks, among them VTB, the second-largest Russian bank. The bloc also would ban Russian vessels and Russian-operated vessels from EU ports.

Estimated read time: 6-7 minutes

WASHINGTON — The U.S. rolled out a new wave of financial sanctions on Wednesday against Russia that President Joe Biden said would place a lasting penalty on the country's economy.

The United Kingdom quickly followed suit, and more pain was coming from the European Union as the allies pressed forward with an escalating campaign to tighten the economic screws on Russian President Vladimir Putin for ""war crimes"" in Ukraine.

Making it personal, the U.S. sanctions singled out the Putin's family, targeting his two adult daughters in addition to blocking two key Russian banks.

Biden said that ""Russia has already failed in its initial war"" after the country's forces were turned back from the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. He cautioned, however, that ""this fight is far from over.""

""This war could continue for a long time,"" but the United States will continue to stand with Ukraine and Ukrainians in the fight for freedom, Biden said. ""We're going to stifle Russia's ability to grow for years to come.""

The latest sanctions underscore the financial pain that Russia faces, as evidence that its troops killed Ukrainian civilians has led to ever harsher penalties by the U.S. and its Western allies that are eroding Putin's ability to fight.

While rounds of increased sanctions have not forced Putin out of the war, they have put Russia in increasingly desperate economic circumstances as Ukrainian forces withstand his barrages. Key to the effectiveness of the sanctions has been the unity between the U.S. and European nations. And the atrocities revealed in Ukraine have intensified pressure on Germany and other countries to go further and join the U.S. and Lithuania in blocking all Russian energy exports.

The U.K. piled on Wednesday with asset freezes against major banks, a ban on British investment in Russia and a pledge to end dependency on Russian coal and oil by yearend.

The European Union was also expected to soon take additional steps, including a ban on new investment in Russia and an embargo on coal, after the recent evidence of atrocities emerging in the wake of the retreat by Russian forces from the town of Bucha.

I made clear that Russia would pay a severe and immediate price for its atrocities in Bucha. Today, along with our Allies and partners, we're announcing a new round of devastating sanctions. https://t.co/LVqTDIOSvz — President Biden (@POTUS) April 6, 2022

The U.S. acted against two of Russia's largest banks, Sberbank and Alfa Bank, prohibiting assets from going through the U.S. financial system and barring Americans from doing business with those two institutions.

In addition to sanctions aimed at Putin's adult daughters, Mariya Putina and Katerina Tikhonova, the U.S. is targeting Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin; the wife and children of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov; and members of Russia's Security Council, including Dmitry Medvedev, a former president and prime minister.

The penalties cut off all of Putin's close family members from the U.S. financial system and freeze any assets they hold in the United States.

Biden was expected to sign an an executive order that would ban new investment in Russia by Americans no matter where they are living. The U.S. Treasury Department was preparing more sanctions against Russian state-owned enterprises, according to the White House.

Britain announced asset freezes targeting Sberbank and the Credit Bank of Moscow and designated eight Russian oligarchs whom it says Putin ""uses to prop up his war economy.""

""Together with our allies, we are showing the Russian elite that they cannot wash their hands of the atrocities committed on Putin's orders,"" British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said.

Britain had already announced a plan to phase out Russian oil, which accounts for 8% of the U.K. supply. Russia is the top supplier of imported coal to the U.K., though British demand for the polluting fuel has plummeted in the past decade.

Britain has not ended imports of Russian natural gas, which account for 4% of its supply, saying only that it will do so ""as soon as possible.""

Videos and images of bodies in the streets of Bucha after it was recaptured from Russian forces have unleashed a wave of indignation among Western allies, who have drawn up new sanctions as a response.

The European Commission's proposed ban on coal imports would be the first E.U. sanctions targeting Russia's lucrative energy industry over its war in Ukraine.

Utah expert says nations have obligation to prosecute Russian atrocities Even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is calling for tribunals for Russians responsible for gruesome atrocities against civilians in Ukraine, a panel of legal experts say it is unlikely that the threat of prosecution under international law will stop Russian President Vladimir Putin.

E.U. foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said energy was key to Putin's war coffers. And because the war has pushed prices higher, Russia has benefited from being able to sell its natural gas and oil to the rest of the world.

""A billion euro is what we pay Putin every day for the energy he provides us since the beginning of the war. We have given him 35 billion euro. Compare that to the 1 billion that we have given to the Ukraine in arms and weapons,"" Borrell said.

The steady intensifying in sanctions is less a sign of their shortcomings than the building pressure against Russia as it seeks foreign investment and basic goods, Brian Deese, director of the White House National Economic Council, told reporters at a Wednesday breakfast. ""We need to have patience and perspective when it comes to the impacts on Russia of this unprecedented and crippling sanctions regime,"" Deese said at the event sponsored by The Christian Science Monitor.

Deese noted that Russian inflation is running at 2% weekly, which would compound to annual inflation above 200% annually. He noted that the Biden administration expects Russian prices will not ultimately rise more than 200% this year.

While the White House has said Russia should not attend the G-20 meeting in Indonesia this November, he noted that it may drop out of the organization anyway because its economy has shrunk in size so dramatically.

After several European countries announced the expulsion of Russian diplomats, the European Commission proposed a fifth package of sanctions including a ban on coal imports that could be adopted once unanimously approved by the 27-nation bloc's ambassadors.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the coal ban is worth $4.4 billion per year and that the E.U. has already started working on additional sanctions, including on oil imports.

She didn't mention natural gas, with consensus among the 27 E.U. countries on targeting the fuel used to generate electricity and heat homes difficult to secure amid opposition from gas-dependent members like Germany, the bloc's largest economy.

But European Council President Charles Michel said the bloc should keep up the pressure on the Kremlin, suggesting that an embargo on gas imports should also be required at some point in the future.

US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield made the call for Russia to be stripped of its seat on the 47-member Human Rights Council in the wake of videos and photos of streets in the town of Bucha strewn with corpses of what appeared to be civilians. The videos and reporting from the town have sparked global revulsion and calls for tougher sanctions on Russia, which has vehemently denied responsibility.

“We believe that the members of the Russian forces committed war crimes in Ukraine, and we believe that Russia needs to be held accountable,” Thomas-Greenfield said Monday. “Russia’s participation on the Human Rights Council is a farce.”

He said the 100 drones, which are essentially remotely controlled flying bombs which are crashed into targets where they explode, have been sent to Ukraine to bolster the military's fight against Russian troops.
