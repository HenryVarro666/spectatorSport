At a briefing in Rzeszów on the humanitarian response to the ongoing crisis, Biden, again, called Russian President Vladimir Putin a ""war criminal,"" after the State Department announced this week its formal assessment that Russian forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine.

""The single most important thing that we can do from the outset is to keep the democracies united in our opposition and our effort to curtail the devastation that is occurring at the hands of a man who I quite frankly think is a war criminal,"" Biden said, flanked by Poland’s President Andrzej Duda and USAID Administrator Samantha Powers. ""I think it will meet the legal definition of that as well.""

Biden's schedule was slightly delayed Friday after the plane flying Poland’s president turned back en route to Rzeszow to make an emergency landing in Warsaw.

Earlier, Biden and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin greeted members of the 82nd Airborne division in Rzeszów to thank them for their service -- and ended up staying for a slice of pizza.

""Thank you very, very much for all you do. And it's not hyperbole to suggest you're the finest fighting force, not in the world -- in the world. That's not hyperbole,"" Biden told the room.

But the president also raised eyebrows when he appeared to tell the group that American troops will be going into Ukraine, though he has repeatedly said that he will not send troops there.

""You know, with the Ukrainian people, Ukrainian people have a lot of backbone, they have a lot of guts and I'm sure you're observing it,"" Biden said. ""And you're gonna see when you're there, and some of you have been there. You're gonna see, you're gonna see women, young people standing, standing in the middle, in front of a damn tank, just saying I'm not leaving. I'm holding my ground. They're incredible. But they take a lot of inspiration from us.""

Asked to clarify Biden's comment, a White spokesperson told ABC News, “the President has been clear we are not sending U.S. troops to Ukraine and there is no change in that position.”

Biden also told the room that what they are engaged in is ""much more than just whether or not you can alleviate the pain and suffering of the people of Ukraine.""

""What's at stake, and not just in what we're doing here in Ukraine to try to help the Ukrainian people and keep the massacre from continuing, but beyond that, what's at stake is...what are your kids and grandkids gonna look like in terms of their, their, their freedom.""

Raising his familiar line of the current fight between autocracies and democracies, Biden told these troops what they are doing is ""really consequential"" and goes beyond just helping Ukrainians from this invasion.

""The fact of the matter is that you are the finest -- this is not hyperbole. You're the finest fighting force in the history of the world. Let me say it again, the finest fighting force in the history of the world. Part of the reason is you've had to fight so much for the last 20 years. For real,"" he said.

He also brought up his late son, Beau, saying, ""Proudest thing he ever did was put that uniform on. Like many of you, he didn't have to go either,"" Biden said.

National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan confirmed earlier Friday that the president will meet with refugees Saturday when he is in Warsaw and deliver a ""major address"" ahead of his departure.

""He will also have the opportunity to meet with Ukrainian refugees, and with American humanitarians who are they're trying to help feed and respond to the material needs of the refugee population in Warsaw,"" Sullivan told reporters on Air Force One. ""And he will give a major address tomorrow that will speak to the stakes of this moment, the urgency of the challenge that lies ahead, what the conflict in Ukraine means for the world, and why it is so important that the free world sustain unity and resolve in the face of Russian aggression,"" Sullivan added.

In neighboring Ukraine, the war continues.

In one of the worst attacks yet, the city council of the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol has said 300 people were killed in a devastating bombing of its drama theater, where hundreds of people were sheltering. The building was marked with the words ""Children"" written in giant Russian letters on the ground to either side.

Biden and the leaders of the other 29 NATO member countries came together in Brussels Thursday in a powerful show of solidarity against Russia’s invasion.

Biden announced new sanctions against Russia, targeting a majority of the Duma, the lower level of parliament, over 40 Russian defense companies and yet more Russian oligarchs. He also announced the U.S. will provide $1 billion in humanitarian aid to support people within Ukraine and those impacted by Russia’s war against Ukraine. That funding will go to food, shelter, clean water, medical supplies and other assistance.

Pushed on what the U.S. and NATO would do if Russia used chemical weapons in Ukraine, Biden would not get specific or confirm intelligence that Vladimir Putin is moving chemical weapons into Ukraine but said they ""would respond"" and that ""the nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use.""",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-calls-putin-war-criminal-meeting-troops-poland/story?id=83670309

Russia signaled a possible recalibration of its war aims in Ukraine on Friday as the Kremlin faced spreading global ostracism for the brutal invasion, hardened Western economic punishments and a determined Ukrainian resistance that appeared to be making some gains on the ground.

A statement by Russia’s Defense Ministry said the goals of the “first stage of the operation” had been “mainly accomplished,” with Ukraine’s combat capabilities “significantly reduced,” and that it would now focus on securing Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, where Russia-backed separatists have been fighting for eight years.

The Defense Ministry statement was ambiguous about further possible Russian territorial ambitions in Ukraine, where its ground forces have been mostly stymied by the unexpectedly strong Ukrainian military response.

But on a day when President Biden was visiting U.S. soldiers in Poland near the Ukrainian border, the statement suggested the possibility that the Russians were looking for a way to salvage some kind of achievement before the costs of the war they launched a month ago became impossibly onerous.

While Russia “does not exclude” that its forces will storm major Ukrainian cities such as Chernihiv, Mykolaiv and the capital, Kyiv, the Defense Ministry statement said that taking them over was not the primary objective.

“As individual units carry out their tasks — and they are being solved successfully — our forces and means will be concentrated on the main thing: the complete liberation of the Donbas,” Col. Gen. Sergei Rudskoi, a senior Russian military commander, said in the statement, his first since Russia’s invasion on Feb. 24.

Whether General Rudskoi’s statement was sincere or simply strategic misdirection was difficult to assess. But the statement amounted to the most direct acknowledgment yet that Russia may be unable to take full control of Ukraine and would instead target the Donbas region, where Russia has recognized the independence of two Kremlin-backed separatist areas that it calls the “Donetsk People’s Republic” and the “Luhansk People’s Republic.”

Russia has also insisted that Ukraine recognize its control of Crimea, which President Vladimir V. Putin’s forces seized from Ukraine in 2014.

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has ruled out ceding those regions to stop the war.

Pavel Luzin, a Russian military analyst, cautioned that the public pronouncements of Russian military commanders should be regarded skeptically. While Russia could indeed be narrowing its war aims, he said, General Rudskoi’s statement could also be a feint as Russia regroups for a new offensive.

“We could say that this is a signal that we’re no longer insisting on dismantling Ukrainian statehood,” Mr. Luzin said. “But I would rather see it as a distracting maneuver.”

General Rudskoi’s statement came as Ukraine acknowledged that Russian forces had been “partially successful” in achieving one of their key objectives — securing a land corridor from Russia to the Crimean Peninsula.

While Russia already controlled much of the area, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said the route allowed Russian troops and supplies to flow between Crimea and Russia.

But some Ukrainian officials said the significance of such a route might be overstated. Oleksandr Danylyuk, a former secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine under Mr. Zelensky, described the land bridge as a minor Russian victory and said the Kremlin was moving to secure Donetsk and Luhansk to “sell to the Russian public as a potential victory.”

In Moscow, Mr. Putin, who has made any criticism of the war a potential crime, used a televised videoconference with the winners of a presidential arts prize on Friday to deliver a diatribe about “cancel culture” that made no mention of the war in Ukraine.

In embracing a term that has become a favorite of the American political right to reprise his contention that the West is trying to erase Russian culture and history, Mr. Putin cited J.K. Rowling, author of the “Harry Potter” books, whose comments about transgender women have been criticized as transphobic.

“Not so long ago, the children’s writer J.K. Rowling was also ‘canceled’ for the fact that she — the author of books that have sold hundreds of millions of copies around the world — did not please fans of so-called gender freedoms,” Mr. Putin said.

Ms. Rowling responded on Twitter that, “Critiques of Western cancel culture are possibly not best made by those currently slaughtering civilians for the crime of resistance, or who jail and poison their critics.” She added the hashtag #IStandWithUkraine.

As Mr. Putin spoke, there were indications that Ukrainian forces were making some progress in the second week of their counteroffensive. A senior Pentagon official said that Russian forces no longer had full control of the southern port of Kherson and that the city, the first major urban center to be captured in the Russian invasion, was now “contested territory.”

The Pentagon assessment contradicted General Rudskoi’s claim on Friday that the Kherson region was “under full control.”

In another sign of the bloody stalemate in Ukraine, Russian soldiers have adopted “defensive positions” near Kyiv, the Pentagon official said, adding that Russia appeared to be “prioritizing” the fight in eastern Ukraine, as General Rudskoi had indicated.

“Clearly, they overestimated their ability to take Kyiv and overestimated their ability to take any population center,” the Pentagon official said.

Mr. Biden, on the second day of his three-day visit to Europe because of the Ukraine crisis, traveled to Rzeszow, Poland, about 50 miles from the Ukrainian border, where he met with members of the 82nd Airborne Division who are serving as part of NATO’s efforts to protect Poland and other member states from Russian aggression.

Greeting American service members who were eating pizza in a cafeteria, Mr. Biden called them “the finest fighting force in the history of the world,” and added, “I personally thank you for what you do.”

Later, Mr. Biden met with President Andrzej Duda of Poland and officials managing the humanitarian response to the more than two million Ukrainian refugees who have fled to Poland to escape the shelling and deprivation.

Mr. Biden also announced a deal to increase U.S. shipments of natural gas to help wean Europe off Russian energy. But it remained unclear exactly how the administration would achieve its goals.

The deal calls for the United States to send an additional 15 billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas — roughly 10 to 12 percent of current annual U.S. exports to all countries. But it does not address the lack of port capacity to ship and receive more gas on both sides of the Atlantic.

Still, American gas executives welcomed a renewed emphasis on exports as a sign that the Biden administration was now seeking to promote the U.S. oil and gas industry rather than punish it for contributions to climate change.

“I have no idea how they are going to do this, but I don’t want to criticize them because for the first time they are trying to do the right thing,” said Charif Souki, executive chairman of Tellurian, a U.S. gas producer that is planning to build an export terminal in Louisiana.

Robert Habeck, the vice chancellor and economic minister of Germany, said his country expected to halve imports of Russian oil by midsummer and nearly end them by year’s end — sooner than many thought possible. He estimated that Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, could be free of Russian gas by mid-2024.

Images and videos from Ukraine that emerged on Friday underscored the escalating death toll and destruction.

Newly surfaced security camera footage, verified by The New York Times, showed an attack on people in line for emergency aid outside a post office and shopping center in the battered northeastern city of Kharkiv on Thursday. Oleg Sinegubov, the head of the regional government there, said that at least six civilians had been killed and 15 wounded.

Photographs out of Kharkiv on Friday also showed a large fireball and nearby cars and buildings on fire, as residents fled on foot and bicycle, carrying whatever belongings they could grab in the aftermath of the attack.

In the central city of Dnipro, Russian missile strikes on a military facility destroyed buildings late Thursday night, according to Ukrainian officials, who said that casualties were still being assessed.

And in Mariupol, the southern port savaged by Russian attacks, Ukrainian officials said that an estimated 300 people had been killed in a March 16 strike on a theater used as a bomb shelter.

It was unclear how officials had arrived at that estimate. Ukrainian officials have said that about 130 people were rescued from the theater, which was attacked even though “children” had been written in giant letters on the pavement on both sides of the building.

The United Nations said on Friday that more than 1,000 civilians have been killed, including 93 children, since Russia’s invasion began, many in what appeared to have been indiscriminate bombardments that could constitute war crimes.

The United Nations cautioned that it had not been able to verify the death toll in areas of intense conflict, including Mariupol, and said the actual number of injured and dead was likely to be considerably higher.

In a sign that diplomatic efforts were struggling, Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, rejected comments by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, who had suggested that Ukraine was open to concessions in four key areas.

In an interview released Friday, Mr. Erdogan, who is hosting talks between Ukrainian and Russian delegations, said that Ukraine was willing to drop its bid for NATO membership, accept Russian as an official language, make “certain concessions” about disarmament and agree to “collective security.”

But Mr. Kuleba said the negotiations had proved “very difficult” and that Ukraine had “taken a strong position and does not relinquish its demands.”

“We insist, first of all, on a cease-fire, security guarantees and territorial integrity of Ukraine,” he said, adding that there was “no consensus with Russia on the four points mentioned by the president of Turkey.”

“In particular,” he said, “the Ukrainian language is and will be the only one state language in Ukraine.”

More than 2 million Ukrainians have fled to Poland since the start of Russia’s invasion of their country, and Biden will meet with Ukrainian refugees and American humanitarian workers Saturday in Warsaw, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said.

“The suffering that's taking place now is at your doorstep,” Biden said in remarks at Poland's Rzeszów–Jasionka Airport. “You're the ones who are risking, in some cases, your life and risking all you know to try to help. And the American people are proud to support your efforts.”

Polish President Andrzej Duda and other U.S. and international officials also attended. Duda thanked Biden for visiting Rzeszów, which has seen some of the largest influx of Ukrainian refugees in Poland.

Biden said he was disappointed that he would be unable to go to Ukraine to see firsthand what is happening in the country. Biden on Thursday pledged $1 billion in U.S. humanitarian assistance to refugees fleeing the invasion.

“It’s just devastating to see those little babies, little children, looking at mothers who you don't have to understand the language they speak. You see in their eyes the pain,” Biden said. “I don't think there's anything worse for a parent than to see a child suffering, their child suffering.”

Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces continue to mount fierce, effective resistance around the country with indications that they have pushed back Russian forces near some cities. Near Kyiv, Russian troops have dug into defensive positions and heavy fighting is happening just northwest of the city, a senior Defense official said Friday.

The Russians have largely turned their focus of ground troops and airstrikes on eastern Ukraine, said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence assessments. The shift, which the Kremlin appeared to confirm, could signal an important narrowing of Moscow's military objectives as Russian forces appeared to have halted, at least for now, in their ground offensive in capturing Kiev, the country's capital.

Heavy fighting is now occurring in the Donbas region, where Russian-backed forces have fought with Ukrainians since 2014.

Col.-Gen Sergei Rudskoi, deputy chief of the Russian general staff, said the main objective of the first stage of the operation — reducing Ukraine's fighting capacity — has ""generally been accomplished,” allowing Russian forces to focus on “the main goal, liberation of Donbas.”

The seeming shift in Moscow’s stated war aims — after weeks in which Vladimir Putin denied Ukraine’s right to exist as an sovereign country and appeared bent on capturing many of its cities and toppling its government — could point to a possible exit strategy for Russia, which has suffered fiercer resistance and heavier losses than anticipated.

Latest developments

►The U.N. human rights office said it has been challenging to confirm fatalities in Mariupol given the organization's strict methodology for counting the number of civilian deaths in conflict. The office says at least 1,035 civilians have been killed in Ukraine and 1,650 injured, but acknowledges that is an undercount.

►A Minnesota native who was living in Ukraine and was ""unjustly"" detained by Russian forces about two weeks ago has been released and reunited with his wife and child, according to Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. Tyler Jacob was detained at a Russian checkpoint while trying to leave Ukraine, Klobuchar said.

►Finland's national rail company on Friday said it would suspend its service between Helsinki and the Russian city of St. Petersburg, closing one of the last public transit routes between the EU and Russia.

►Spotify is halting its services in Russia in light of the country’s strict new censorship law, which it says puts its employees and possibly even listeners at risk.

►Russia's military said it would offer safe passage to foreign ships that have been stranded in Ukrainian ports.

►Author J.K. Rowling pushed back after Russian President Vladimir Putin dragged her into a rant against Western efforts to “cancel” Russian culture. “Critiques of Western cancel culture are possibly not best made by those currently slaughtering civilians for the crime of resistance, or who jail and poison their critics,” the Harry Potter author said.

Zelenskyy: Ukraine will not cede territory to end Russian invasion

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has again appealed to Russia to negotiate an end to the war, but says Ukraine would not agree to give up any of its territory for the sake of peace.

In his nightly video address to the nation Friday, Zelenskyy appeared to be responding to Col. Gen Sergei Rudskoi, deputy chief of the Russian general staff, who said Russian forces would now focus on “the main goal, the liberation of Donbas.”

Russian-backed separatists have controlled part of the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine since 2014, and Russian forces have been battling to seize more of the region from Ukraine, including the besieged city of Mariupol.

Rudskoi’s statement also was a suggestion that Russia may be backing away from trying to take Kyiv and other major cities where its offensive has stalled. Zelenskyy noted that Russian forces have lost thousands of troops but still haven’t been able to take Kyiv or Kharkiv, the second-largest city.

Ukraine says 300 people killed in Mariupol theater attack last week

About 300 people were killed in the Russian airstrike last week on a Mariupol theater that was being used as a shelter, Ukrainian authorities said Friday in what would make it the war’s deadliest known attack on civilians yet.

For days, the government in the besieged and ruined port city was unable to give a casualty count for the March 16 bombardment of the grand, columned Mariupol Drama Theater, where hundreds of people were said to be taking cover, the word “CHILDREN” printed in Russian in huge white letters on the ground outside to ward off aerial attack.

In announcing the death toll on its Telegram channel Friday, the city government cited eyewitnesses. But it was not immediately clear how witnesses arrived at the figure or whether emergency workers had finished excavating the ruins.

The scale of devastation in Mariupol, where bodies have been left unburied amid bomb craters and hollowed-out buildings, has made information difficult to obtain.

Ukraine destroys Russian vessel; Moscow taps troops in Georgia

Ukrainian forces destroyed a Russian transport ship in the port city of Berdyansk that appeared to be on a resupply mission, a senior Defense official said Friday.

The attack on Thursday blew up a tank-landing ship at its pier, said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence assessments. The Russians have 22 warships in the Black Sea.

Russian combat power in Ukraine, which dipped below 90% for the first time this week, is now between 85% and 90%, the official said. For the first time, Russia appears to be drawing reinforcements from its troops based in Georgia. Combat power includes troops, tanks, armored vehicles, artillery, warplanes, warships and ballistic missiles.

Russia has also drawn down its stockpile of precision-guided weapons and is relying more on so-called dumb bombs to bombard cities, the official said. Russia has used about 50% of its air-launched cruise missiles. Russia’s cruise missiles have at times failed to launch or hit their targets.

Biden thanks ‘finest fighting force’ in history during visit with US troops

President Joe Biden used his first stop in Poland on Friday to personally thank U.S. troops stationed near the border of Ukraine.

“You are the finest fighting force in the history of the world, and that’s not hyperbole,” Biden said during a visit with members of the 82nd Airborne Division in Rzeszów, Poland, about 60 miles from the border of Ukraine.

Thousands of U.S. troops are stationed in Poland to help shore up NATO’s eastern flank amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Minutes after landing in Poland, Biden stopped by a barbershop where around a dozen service members sat in folding chairs awaiting haircuts and others were getting a cut. He shook hands with several soldiers and joked about their closely shorn hair.

“You are an amazing group of women and men,” Biden said. “I just want to thank you for your service. As your commander in chief, I meant it from the bottom of my heart.”

U.S. to increase gas exports to Europe to reduce dependence on Russia

The United States and the European Union announced a new task force Friday that aims to reduce Europe’s dependence on Russian energy.

“Putin has issued Russia's energy resources to coerce and manipulate his neighbors. He's using the profits to drive his war machine,” President Joe Biden said following a bilateral meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

Biden said the task force will focus on two initiatives: helping Europe reduce its dependency on Russian gas as quickly as possible and reducing Europe's demand for gas overall.

Biden, on Friday, also announced a plan where the U.S. a few like-minded partners will increase exports of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, to Europe by 15 billion cubic meters this year. Those exports would triple in the years afterward, a necessary move if the EU can back up its claim to be rid of Russian imports in five years.

It will take huge investments, and getting more liquefied natural gas to Europe could be difficult. U.S. export facilities are already operating at capacity, and most new terminals are still only in the planning stages. Most U.S. shipments already go to Europe.

Even if more gas can be shipped to Europe, the continent may struggle to receive it. Import terminals are in coastal areas, and Europe’s pipeline system doesn’t have all the connections needed to send the natural gas throughout the continent.

The moves come weeks after the United States announced a ban on all Russian energy imports. At the time, Biden said he made the decision in consultation with European allies and would create a long term plan with them.

“I know that eliminating Russian gas will have a cost for Europe,” Biden said. “But it's not only the right thing to do from a moral standpoint, it's going to put us on a much stronger strategic footing.”

Nuclear watchdog warns of attacks on town near Chernobyl plant

Russian shelling in Slavutych, a town near the Chernobyl nuclear power plant where many of its workers live, threatens the ability of the staff at the plant to rotate safely, an international nuclear watchdog said Thursday.

International Atomic Energy Agency Director-General Rafael Mariano Grossi said in a statement Ukrainian personnel had informed the agency of the Russian attacks that threatened the Chernobyl plant's operational staff, their families and homes.

The staff was able to rotate out for a shift change recently after four weeks, Grossi said, but the shelling poses concerns. Russian forces took control of the plant early on in their invasion of Ukraine, raising worries about the safety of nuclear operations at the site.

NATO chief: Chemical or nuclear weapons 'totally change' nature of war

NATO's Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Friday the use of nuclear or chemical weapons in Ukraine would ""totally change the nature of the war in Ukraine. It will be absolutely unacceptable.""

Stoltenberg made the comments during a visit to a Cold Response drill, which occurs every two years and brings together NATO members and non-NATO members including Finland and Sweden.

Russia declined to participate, but Stoltenberg said NATO ""always invite other countries to observe.""

Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said during a meeting Friday that Russia was facing a ""total war declared on us"" as the West seeks to ""to destroy, break, annihilate, strangle the Russian economy, and Russia on the whole.""

'Need to look for peace': Zelenskyy reassures Ukraine in address

In an evening address to Ukraine late Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke of hope and determination as the war headed into its second month.

“It is already night. But we are working,” Zelenskyy said in a video address. “The country must move toward peace, move forward. With every day of our defense, we are getting closer to the peace that we need so much. We are getting closer to victory. … We can’t stop even for a minute.

Earlier in the week, Zelenskyy called on people worldwide to gather in public to show support for his embattled country. “Come to your squares, your streets. Make yourselves visible and heard,” he said.

'Catastrophe' unfolding in Ukrainian city, government official says

Russian troops are purposefully targeting food stores in the Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, a local government official said.

In an audio message to The Associated Press, city council secretary Olexander Lomako said a ""catastrophe"" is unfolding in the northern city. Lomako added that a Russian airstrike destroyed a bridge over the Desna River this week, a key route for bringing in food and other supplies from Ukraine-controlled territory further south.

“Humanitarian help, medicines and food used to be delivered into the city via this bridge,” he told The Associated Press.

Less than half of the residents, around 130,000, are left in the city from the pre-war population of 285,000, Lomako said.

Poll shows Americans support Russian sanctions, think Biden should be tougher

A majority of Americans are supportive of the harsh sanctions on Russia but believe Biden needs to be tougher on the Kremlin after its invasion of Ukraine, according to a poll commissioned by the Associated Press and NORC released Thursday.

The poll, which surveyed 1,082 U.S. adults from Thursday to Monday, found 56% of Americans believe Biden's response to Russia hasn't been tough enough, including a majority of 53% of Democrats. A very small percent, about 6%, said they thought Biden had been ""too tough,"" the poll shows.

Across the board, Americans of both political parties were supportive of the harsh economic blows to Russia. The poll showed 68% were supportive of economic sanctions in general with 70% saying they supported the recent banning oil imported from Russia, which in turn caused gas prices to rise.

The presidents then received a briefing on the humanitarian response to the exodus of refugees fleeing Ukraine.

“It is fair to say, I think, that none of us have ever seen the speed and the scale of this destruction in our lifetimes,” Power said. “It took a little over four years for four million refugees to flee the Syrian war.

25 Mar 2022 17.03 Speaking in Poland earlier today, Biden compared the Ukrainian resistance to Russia’s brutal invasion to the the student-led protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989 while reaffirming his belief that Russian president Vladimir Putin was a “war criminal.” “I mean, talk about what happened to Tiananmen Square,” he said. “This is Tiananmen Square squared.” He said that Putin was “a man who, quite frankly, I think is a war criminal” and added that he thinks the Russian leader’s actions will “meet the legal definition” of a war criminal under international law. This week the US determined that the Russian military had committed war crimes in Ukraine, citing examples of the indiscriminate bombing of civilian areas, including a maternity hospital and a theater where Ukrainians had taken refuge. Speaking to US troops stationed in Poland, Biden said: “You’re in the midst of a fight between democracies and autocrats. What you’re doing is consequential, really consequential.” Biden will deliver a “major” speech laying out the stakes of the war in Europe from Warsaw, before returning to the US on Saturday.

25 Mar 2022 16.21 In a background briefing with reporters, a senior US defense official said the Pentagon had assessed for the first time that Kherson, a port city in southern Ukraine, is no longer under full Russian control. Kherson was the first major Ukrainian city that Russian forces captured as part of Moscow’s invasion of its democratic neighbor. Any progress by Ukrainian forces in reclaiming the region would be a major development in the war and a significant setback for Russian troops. “It doesn’t appear to be as solidly in Russian control as it was before. Ukrainians are trying to take Kherson back and we would argue that Kherson is actually contested territory again,” the senior defense official said, according to the Washington Post. For the first time in weeks, the Pentagon assessed today that Kherson, a port city in southern Ukraine, is no longer under full Russian control. — Dan Lamothe (@DanLamothe) March 25, 2022 The situation remains unclear, as a top Russian military official said the Kherson region remained under their “full control”.

25 Mar 2022 16.02 A Maryland judge on Friday struck down the state’s new congressional map that would have given Democrats seven safe seats and endangered the state’s lone Republican. New: a Maryland court has struck down Democrats' 7D-1C-0R map as an illegal partisan gerrymander, the first such state-level victory in the GOP's direction. If replaced w/ a neutral map, this could end up costing Dems 1-2 seats. pic.twitter.com/ceMsDlJfzB — Dave Wasserman (@Redistrict) March 25, 2022 The decision is a set back for Democrats, already facing strong headwinds in the November election as they attempt to defend a paper-thin majority in the House. According to Reuter’s, Anne Arundel county senior judge Lynne Battaglia “agreed with Republican arguments that the map violated the state constitution’s equal protection guarantee, among other provisions, by diluting Republican voters’ electoral power.”

“The 2021 plan is an outlier and a product of extreme partisan gerrymandering,” Battaglia wrote in a 94-page opinion. The Democratic-controlled legislature has until Wednesday to draw a new map. Democrats have fared better than expected in the decennial congressional redistricting, given that Republicans control a majority of the state legislatures in the country and therefore in many cases control the process by which lawmakers can draw congressional maps that give their party the partisan advantage. This cycle, Democrats have had a string of legal successes challenging Republican maps in several swing states, including Ohio, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. Maryland stands out as a rare example of a judge throwing out a map heavily gerrymandered by Democrats.



25 Mar 2022 15.32 In a new essay for the New York Times, Hillary Clinton reflects on the legacy and wisdom of her friend and mentor Madeleine Albright, who died this week at 84. “Madeleine’s death is also a great loss for our country and for the cause of democracy at a time when it is under serious and sustained threat around the world and here at home,” she wrote. “Now more than ever we could use Madeleine’s vital voice, her clear-eyed view of a dangerous world and her unstinting faith in both the unique power of the American idea and the universal appeal of freedom and democracy.”

Clinton outlined three lessons she believed the US could learn from Albright on preserving democracy around the world. Stand up to bullies Protect and defend Nato Attacks on democracy at home fuel authoritarianism abroad Even at the end of her life, she treasured her first glimpse of the Statue of Liberty, sailing into New York Harbor in 1948 as an 11-year-old refugee on a ship called the S.S. America,” Clinton wrote. “She would have been thrilled by President Biden’s announcement on Thursday that the United States will welcome up to 100,000 refugees fleeing Ukraine, and she would encourage us to do more to respond to this unfolding humanitarian nightmare. She would warn, as she did in her book, about the “self-centered moral numbness that allows Fascism to thrive,” and urge us to keep pushing the envelope for freedom, human rights and democracy. We should listen.

25 Mar 2022 14.52 There may be more text messages exchanged between Ginni Thomas, a longtime conservative activist, and former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, according to the Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Robert Costa, who broke the story. There might very well be texts we have not seen. Twenty-nine were provided to the committee,” said Costa, referring to the congressional committee investigating the January 6 assualt on the US capitol, in an interview on CBS Morning. “Twenty-one from Ginni Thomas to Meadows. Eight from Meadows to Ginni Thomas. These were part of a collection of over 2,300 text messages Meadows provided to the committee. But there are gaps. The last text in what we’ve reported comes in late November 2020. Then there is a stray one about Vice President Pence and the end of America in January of 2021, days after the insurrection. So, this is a story that is beginning, not ending.” Ginni Thomas has publicly denied any conflict of interest between her work as a political activist and her marriage to supreme court justice Clarence Thomas. Watch the full interview here.



25 Mar 2022 14.28 The Washington Post has spoken with Wesley Hawkins, a defendant who judge Jackson sentenced for possession of child pornography when he was a teenager in 2013. His case was repeatedly cited by Republicans as an example of what they said was a tendency by the judge to be lenient on child sex crime offenders, a charge Jackson forcefully denied. In an interview with the Post from a relative’s home in DC, Hawkins was shocked to learn that his case had been the subject of several contentious back and forths between Biden’s historic nominee for the supreme court and Republicans. Of his actions, Hawkins told the Post: “When I got to a place that I could think about what I had done, retrospectively, I was disgusted. And if someone else wants to continue to see me that way, I can’t stop them. But what I hope is that when people look over time they can see he was just a young man, that he’s grown and learned from his actions.” Jackson sentenced Hawkins to three months in prison, followed by three months of home detention and six years of supervision. He was also required to register as a sex offender. In sentencing Hawkins, Jackson told him she was imposing a punishment that would allow him to “spend enough time in prison to understand and appreciate the consequences of your actions … but not so long that you will be subjected to harm in prison or introduced to incorrigible influences such that you are lost to society forever.” Hawkins noted that many Republicans continued to support candidates who faced allegations of sexual misconduct. “While I’m not defending my actions, because, again, they are undefendable, I feel that their hypocrisy should be pointed out,” he said. Reading about Jackson’s confirmation hearing, Hawkins told the Post he felt sympathy for the judge who he had once been angry with over her decision to send him to prison. I wasn’t very happy that she gave me three months, though, after reflection when I was in jail, I was hearing from other people who said it was their first time arrested and they got five years, six years,” he said. I feel that she chose to take into consideration the fact that I was just getting started [in life] and she knew this was going to hold me back for years to come regardless,” he said, “so she didn’t really want to add on to that.” Read the full story here.

25 Mar 2022 13.53 Hugo Lowell As the House committee investigating the January 6 Capitol attack was negotiating with Donald Trump’s former strategist Steve Bannon to cooperate with its inquiry, the panel affirmed a rule: no third-party lawyers could attend witness depositions.



So when Bannon’s then-attorney asked whether a lawyer for Trump could be present for the closed-door interview to decide what issues were covered by the former president’s invocation of executive privilege, the committee flatly refused. Now, that refusal appears set to feature as one of Bannon’s central arguments to defend against his contempt of Congress indictment that came after he skipped his deposition last October and refused to produce documents as required.

The former Trump aide is advancing a high-stakes – and arcane – defense as he battles the Department of Justice (DoJ) in a case that could mean up to a year in federal prison and thousands of dollars in fines if convicted, but could also de-fang congressional power should he prevail.



The all-or-nothing nature of the defense is characteristic of Bannon, a fierce defender and confidante of the former president even after he left the White House seven months into the Trump administration after a turbulent tenure as his chief strategist. It was precisely because of his contacts with Trump in the days before January 6 that the select committee made Bannon one of its first subpoena targets as it seeks to uncover whether Trump oversaw a criminal conspiracy that culminated in the Capitol attack.



The crux of Bannon’s argument is that he could reasonably believe the subpoena was invalid when the select committee refused to allow a Trump lawyer to attend the deposition, after the former president asserted executive privilege over the materials covered by the subpoena.

25 Mar 2022 13.27 Ed Pilkington In light of the revelations about Ginni Thomas, Justice Clarence Thomas and the deadly assault on the US Capitol on January 6, Gabe Roth, executive director of Fix the Court, which campaigns for reform of the supreme court, tells the Guardian the rule of law depends not just on impartiality, but on the appearance of impartiality. “There is a lack of moral authority on the supreme court right now, there is a lack of trust, and the court needs to acknowledge it and take steps to ameliorate it,” Roth said. The commotion about Ginni Thomas’s contacts with the Trump White House and activities around the Capitol attack has come at a torrid time for the supreme court on which her husband sits. On Friday Clarence Thomas himself was discharged from hospital having been treated for days with an infection. Millions of Americans also viewed the televised spectacle of the first Black woman to be nominated for the highest court, Ketanji Brown Jackson, being subjected to bizarre and hostile questioning by Republicans in her confirmation hearings. Senators including Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley pressed her on her sentencing record regarding offenders in child-abuse imagery cases, and on anti-racist teaching in schools in ways that at times came closer to dog-whistle politics than a solemn constitutional process.

25 Mar 2022 13.09 Martin Pengelly The Oregon senator Ron Wyden has called for Clarence Thomas to recuse himself from any cases before the supreme court concerning January 6 and the 2024 election. “In light of new reporting from numerous outlets, Justice Thomas’ conduct on the supreme court looks increasingly corrupt,” Wyden said in a statement, referring to the stunning revelation of Ginni Thomas’s texts with Mark Meadows, then Donald Trump’s chief of staff, around the deadly Capitol attack. (Ed Pilkington’s Guardian report is here.) “At the bare minimum, Justice Thomas needs to recuse himself from any case related to the January 6 investigation, and should Donald Trump run again, any case related to the 2024 election.” In January, Clarence Thomas was the only justice to say Trump should not have to release records to the January 6 committee. Since then, his wife’s activities around the rally that preceded the attack have come into sharp focus. Emily Flitter, a New York Times reporter, points out that Thomas has recused himself on grounds of family before: Justice Thomas has recused himself from SCOTUS cases in the past bc of family members’ activities. When his son worked for Wachovia, he stepped back from a slew of bank-regulatory cases that reached the Court. NOT doing it now looks like breaking precedent https://t.co/PZnSE4eO8P — Emily Flitter (@FlitterOnFraud) March 25, 2022 Another Democratic senator, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, has meanwhile said Clarence Thomas should consider “voluntarily appearing” before the January 6 committee to resolve questions about his wife’s texts with Meadows. That seems … unlikely.



25 Mar 2022 12.47 Scandal erupts over Ginni Thomas and January 6 Ed Pilkington Calls have erupted for ethical conflict-of-interest rules on America’s top court after it was revealed that Ginni Thomas, wife of the supreme court justice Clarence Thomas, pressed Donald Trump’s chief of staff to overturn the 2020 presidential election. The Washington Post reported that it had obtained a stash of 29 text messages between Ginni Thomas and Mark Meadows, then Trump’s top White House aide, which were exchanged in the tumultuous days after the November 2020 election. In the texts, Thomas blatantly urged Meadows to do anything he could to subvert the democratic result so as to frustrate Joe Biden’s victory and keep Trump in power. Ethics groups, members of Congress, law professors, pundits and a slew of other interested parties responded to the revelations with astonishment and concern. The Thomas-Meadows texts were contained in a trove of 2,320 digital communications Meadows handed to the House select committee investigating the storming of the US Capitol by Trump supporters on January 6. Those communications were only obtained after the supreme court ordered them transferred to Congress, rejecting claims by Trump that they were covered by executive privilege. The court forced disclosure of the material, including the Ginni Thomas texts, by a vote of 8-1 – with Clarence Thomas providing the only dissent. Norman Ornstein, a senior emeritus fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, called the development “a scandal of immense proportions”. Branding Ginni Thomas a “radical insurrectionist”, he said it was time for the January 6 committee to subpoena her texts and emails to see what other incriminating evidence was out there. Laurence Tribe, a professor of constitutional law at Harvard law school, called on the justice department to investigate the apparent conspiracy between Thomas, Meadows and Trump. “Hard to see Justice Thomas not recusing when that reaches” the supreme court, he said.

25 Mar 2022 12.26 After a brief delay, Polish President Andrzej Duda arrived at Rzeszów–Jasionka Airport, where he met Biden, who was joined by USAID administrator Samantha Power. The presidents then received a briefing on the humanitarian response to the exodus of refugees fleeing Ukraine.

“It is fair to say, I think, that none of us have ever seen the speed and the scale of this destruction in our lifetimes,” Power said. “It took a little over four years for four million refugees to flee the Syrian war. Ukraine could reach that number four days from now, just over a month since the war began.” Happening Now: President Biden receives a briefing on the humanitarian response to ease the suffering of civilians inside Ukraine and to respond to the growing flow of refugees fleeing Putin’s war of choice. https://t.co/hL3YMKafZS — The White House (@WhiteHouse) March 25, 2022 Biden began his remarks by reaching out and squeezing Duda’s hand in a show of solidarity. To the humanitarian leaders at the table, he thanked them for their work and expressed his “disappointment” that he could not firsthand the devastation and the desperation of the crisis in Ukraine, due to security reasons. “It’s like something out of a science fiction movie,” Biden said of the destruction wrought by the Russian assault on Ukraine.

The defence ministry stated Russian-backed separatists now controlled 93% of Luhansk and 54% of Donetsk, the self-proclaimed republics in Ukraine’s east. The two together are commonly known as the Donbas region. “The main objectives of the first stage of the operation have generally been accomplished,” Sergei Rudskoi, the head of the Russian general staff’s main operational directorate said during a briefing. In Friday’s announcement, Russia also appeared to hint that Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine may be turning to more limited objectives, adding that the main goal of the operation was the “liberation of the Donbas”. “The combat potential of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has been considerably reduced, which ... makes it possible to focus our core efforts on achieving the main goal, the liberation of Donbas.” Russia has been shifting its objectives in Ukraine throughout the war. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, earlier said that the “denazification” of the Ukrainian leadership – generally understood as regime change – was the main motivation for the invasion. Michael Kofman, the director of the Russia studies programme at the CNA thinktank, on Friday tweeted that the military briefing suggested Russia would focus on “taking as much of the Donbas as possible,” while claiming Donbas was always the main goal of what Kremlin refers to a “special military operation”. “I had a hypothesis that the more minimal aims Moscow could have at this point is to try to take all of the Donbas, pursue some political settlement, then turn around and claim that’s what this operation was really all about in an effort to salvage something & declare victory,” Kofman tweeted.

26 Mar 2022 23.09 The UK has sanctioned 65 individuals and entities with supporting links to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including Kronshtadt, a Russian defence company and the main producer of Russia’s Orion drone and other unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In a statement, the UK ministry of defence said drone systems have been “widely deployed” in Russia’s invasion. “Robust Ukrainian air defences has almost certainly limited manned flights beyond their frontlines, hence Russia has highly likely been forced to use more UAVs instead. This is probably leading to greater demand for, and attrition of, these assets. These sanctions will damage Russia’s defence industrial complex and limit their ability to replace their UAV losses,” the statement said.

26 Mar 2022 22.54 In a video address late on Friday night, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said his country’s forces had delivered “powerful blows” to Russia and that “meaningful, urgent, fair” talks were needed.

Zelenskiy thanked Ukrainians who have fought against the Russian invasion, stating: “Over the past week, our heroic armed forces have dealt powerful blows to the enemy, significant losses.” He said more than 16,000 Russians have been killed, including commanders. Russia says 1,351 soldiers had died in combat.

“I am grateful to our defenders who showed the occupiers that the sea will not be calm for them even when there is no storm. Because there will be fire,” he said in the video address. “The armed forces continue to repel enemy attacks, in the south of the country, in Donbas, in the Kharkiv direction and in the Kyiv region. By restraining Russia’s actions, our defenders are leading the Russian leadership to a simple and logical idea: talk is necessary. Meaningful, urgent, fair.” Zelenskiy said that Ukrainian sovereignty must be guaranteed and its territorial integrity ensured. He added that over the past week 18 humanitarian corridors had been established and 37,606 people rescued from blocked cities.

26 Mar 2022 21.47 The Institute for the Study of War, a US thinktank, has released some analysis of comments made on Friday by Sergei Rudskoi, first deputy chief of the Russian general staff. Rudskoi said Russia had completed “the main tasks of the first stage of the operation”, weakened Ukrainian forces and that it would focus on “liberating” Ukraine’s breakaway eastern Donbas region. The comments appeared to suggest Russia may pursue more limited objectives in Ukraine. In its analysis, the ISW says the Rudskoi’s comments “were likely aimed mainly at a domestic Russian audience and do not accurately or completely capture current Russian war aims and planned operations”. Here is some of ISW’s analysis: Rudskoi’s assertion that securing the unoccupied portions of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts was always the main objective of Russia’s invasion is false. The Kremlin’s initial campaign aimed to conduct airborne and mechanized operations to seize Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odesa, and other major Ukrainian cities to force a change of government in Ukraine. Rudskoi’s comments could indicate that Russia has scaled back its aims and would now be satisfied with controlling the entirety of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts, but that reading is likely inaccurate. Russian forces elsewhere in Ukraine have not stopped fighting and have not entirely stopped attempting to advance and seize more territory. They are also attacking and destroying Ukrainian towns and cities, conducting operations and committing war crimes that do not accord with the objectives Rudskoi claims Russia is pursuing.

26 Mar 2022 20.25 This is Rebecca Ratcliffe in Bangkok, taking over from my colleague Sam Levin. The UK will fund £2m ($2.6m) in vital food supplies for areas of Ukraine encircled by Russian forces, following a direct request from the government of Ukraine.

Warehouses in Poland and Slovakia are being prepared to supply dried food, tinned goods and water from early next week. Around 25 truckloads will then be transported by road and rail to the local Ukrainian communities in greatest need, according to the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office.



Alice Hooper, the FCDO humanitarian adviser, said: “The need on the ground in Ukraine is clear, with so many people in encircled areas trapped in basements without access to food or water. Nearly 6 million children remain in Ukraine, many sheltering inside buildings, which are coming under attack.”

25 Mar 2022 19.30 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy again has urged Russia to negotiate an end to war, but also asserted that Ukraine would not agree to give up any of its territory to achieve peace, according to AP’s report on his nightly video address Friday evening. Zelenskiy appeared to be responding to Col Gen Sergei Rudskoi, deputy chief of the Russian general staff, who earlier said Russian forces would now focus on “the liberation of Donbas” as the main goal. The AP explains:

Russian-backed separatists have controlled part of the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine since 2014, and Russian forces have been battling to seize more of the region from Ukraine, including the besieged city of Mariupol. Rudskoi’s statement also was a suggestion that Russia may be backing away from trying to take Kyiv and other major cities where its offensive has stalled. Zelenskiy noted that Russian forces have lost thousands of troops but still haven’t been able to take Kyiv or Kharkiv, the second-largest city. The president also claimed that Russia has lost more than 16,000 troops: Ukraine's Zelensky claims more than 16,000 Russian troops lost #UkraineWar #RussianUkrainianWar #ukraine

https://t.co/wSUBQ57iQO — CNNWynn (@WynnWs) March 25, 2022 The casualty reports of Russian troops have varied widely. Nato officials earlier this week estimated that 7,000 to 15,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in Ukraine, CNN reported, and US officials have put forward similar estimates, but also have said they could not be confident in those numbers. Russia’s defence ministry earlier said that 1,351 Russian soldiers have died.



25 Mar 2022 19.05 More details from the AP’s new report on Russia’s attacks on medical facilities in Ukraine: Among the most thoroughly documented strikes was the 9 March bombing of a children’s and maternity hospital in Mariupol. Two AP journalists, the last international media to remain in the city after it was encircled by Russian forces, arrived at the hospital minutes after the explosion. They saw a smoldering two-story deep crater in the interior courtyard, surrounded by the twisted and burned remains of several cars. The force of the explosion tore the facades off three surrounding buildings, blowing out the windows and wrecking rooms inside. The AP journalists took photos and video of stunned survivors coming out of the hospital. A pregnant woman being carried on a stretcher held her belly, blood staining her sweatpants, her face pale. She later died following an emergency cesarean section at another nearby hospital, according to Dr Timur Marin, one of the surgeons who tried to save her. The woman’s baby also did not survive. The AP’s analysis notes that these kinds of attacks on hospitals and staff are considered “particularly heinous under international law”, which notes they must be protected. Prosecutors must show the destruction is intentional or reckless for a hospital bombing to be considered a war crime, according to the AP, which is working with Frontline to document such cases. The AP said the evidence for potential war crimes was “mounting and horrendous” and clearly refutes the Russian claims that the stories were “fake news” or that the attacks were militarily justified. Pavlo Kovtoniuk, a former deputy minister of health and WHO consultant who co-founded the Ukrainian Healthcare Center, told the AP that Russia is bombing “medical infrastructure on purpose, fighting sick people as if they were military”. Kovtoniuk added: “Bombing hospitals is especially cruel because it shows civilian people that there is no safe place for them on Earth,” he said.

25 Mar 2022 18.53 Ukraine’s deputy interior minister, Anton Gerashchenko, said in a statement on Facebook this evening that Sergei Shoigu, the Russian defence minister, has been absent from public events since mid-March because he suffered a heart attack. The claim, which has not been independently verified, adds to the mystery surrounding Shoigu, who had not been seen in public for 12 days until he appeared on Russians’ television screens for just a few seconds on Thursday, sitting in the corner box of a teleconference with Vladimir Putin. Prior to that TV appearance, rumours were spreading that Shoigu may have been punished for the bungle invasion of Ukraine and the failure to capture Kharkiv or Kyiv. Agentstvo, an independent Russian news website, earlier cited a source saying that Shoigu, one of the most trusted men in the nation according to opinion polling, had heart problems, the Guardian’s Andrew Roth noted. “The defence minister has a lot to deal with right now, as you can understand,” Dmitri Peskov, a Kremlin spokesman, said during a briefing. He denied Shoigu was sick. “A special military operation is ongoing. Certainly, now isn’t exactly the right time for media activities. This is quite understandable.” More here on Shoigu and his mysterious and brief TV appearance: Russian defence minister resurfaces on TV – but for just a few seconds Read more

25 Mar 2022 17.51 More than half of Ukraine’s children have been displaced after one month of war, according to Unicef. Unicef’s spokesman James Elder was just on CNN to discuss the toll, saying: First and foremost, these kids need protection from the war that keeps raging around them. They wake up everyday, and there’s another horror story from a family member somewhere in a city that is still under siege ... Countries have to lead by example to support what is millions of people who didn’t want to leave their homes.” Some disturbing statistics: “An estimated 1.4 million people now lack access to safe water, while 4.6 million people have limited access to water or are at risk of being cut off. Over 450,000 children aged 6 to 23 months need complementary food support.” Families in Ukraine have faced horrors that were unimaginable just a month ago.

25 Mar 2022 17.40 Some key details from a senior US defense official’s briefing from Warsaw today: The US has observed more than 1,250 missile launches since the start of the invasion.

It appears that the Russians are at the moment not pursuing a ground offensive towards Kyiv, but, “They are digging in, they are establishing defensive positions, they don’t show any signs of being willing to move on Kyiv from the ground.”



The US is still observing airstrikes on Kyiv, but nothing on the ground “in keeping with our assessment of a couple of days ago that they are going to prioritise the eastern part of the country”.

“We’re seeing the Ukrainians really go now on the offense around Kyiv. That includes to the west of it ... The Russians are in a defensive position around Kyiv on the ground.”

Asked if the US has seen indications that Putin has become more reckless in his tactics as Russia has not achieved its goals, the senior official said, “It’s there for the world to see. I can’t get inside Putin’s mind, and I wouldn’t want to speculate about his personal level of frustration, or whatever decisions he’s making based on the fact that they have been stymied and stalled throughout the country. But you can see for yourself how they have tried to make up for the fact that they haven’t been able to move well on the ground by the increasing use of airstrikes and missile strikes and artillery strikes on population centers.” You can read the full remarks from the background briefing here.
