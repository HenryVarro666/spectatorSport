0,e9cddebc-fad9-4da3-8d11-85015ac43af4,[],,"QUESTION: Secretary Blinken, thanks for coming on again tonight. We heard the President list these new sanctions today against several Russian banks, among other steps being taken. The President also said direct sanctions against Vladimir Putin, himself, are still on the table here. You’ve got Putin invading Ukraine from the north, the east, the south, ignoring all calls from the U.S. to stop. So why is the U.S. not sanctioning him right now?

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, first of all, David, the sanctions that we’ve taken – not just us, in coordination with European partners and allies – are going to have severe consequences on Russia – some immediate, some that play out over time. We’ve taken the 10 largest financial institutions, holding about 80 percent of Russia’s banking assets; can’t do transactions in dollars or for the most part in Euros. The ability for Russia to raise money on international market – we’re taking that away. Their ability to import the technology necessary to modernize their economy, to put into critical industries like defense, like aerospace – that too being taken away. And this is going to have a very significant impact.

Now, having said that, as the President said, other things remain on the table. If they continue to escalate, we’ll have the ability to do the same thing.

QUESTION: Is there any sign here, though, that Putin cares about these sanctions? The threats don’t appear to be working so far.

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Sanctions have an immediate impact. We’re seeing that in terms of Russia’s currency, in terms of its markets. But the impact is really felt over time as, again, it spreads across the economy, about their ability to raise money, to conduct transactions around the world. That will be felt more and more and more over time. So, if this continues, the pain will continue, the pain will grow, and that’s going to have an effect too.

QUESTION: But to be clear here, you are willing to sanction Putin directly, if you have to.

SECRETARY BLINKEN: As the President said, everything’s on the table, including that.

QUESTION: I want to ask you about the fighting we know that’s taking place at a military airfield about 20 miles from the capital of Kyiv. Do we know who is in control of that airfield tonight? And is it possible Kyiv falls in the next 24 hours?

SECRETARY BLINKEN: I’m not in a position to comment on exactly what’s going on, on the ground, at this moment. But what we do know, and part of the Russian plan has been, to put Kyiv in danger, to assault the capital, to go after other major cities. We’re seeing forces come in from the north, from the east, from the south, and that’s all part of the plan that we’ve laid out for the world in recent weeks.

QUESTION: You’re convinced Putin’s going to overthrow this government.

SECRETARY BLINKEN: I’m convinced he’s going to try to do that.

QUESTION: We’ve seen Ukrainians fight back, the resistance to the Russians in the east. Is there any chance the Ukrainians can hold on here?

SECRETARY BLINKEN: One of the things that Vladimir Putin has done, starting back in 2014 when they first went into Ukraine, seizing Crimea, seizing a part of eastern Ukraine, is to totally alienate the Ukrainian people from Russia. Before 2014, actually, Russia was pretty popular in Ukraine. It had a 70 percent favorability rating. Right now, it’s exactly the opposite – more than the opposite. Ninety percent of Ukrainians now, if I can use the word, “detest” Russia and certainly detest President Putin. My prediction would be that one way or another, they will strongly resist any effort to take away their sovereignty, take away their independence, take away their government.

QUESTION: They’ll resist, but can they beat the Russians here?

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Over – whether it’s in the near term, whether it’s in the medium term, whether it’s in the long term, I am convinced that democracy and the independence of Ukraine is going to prevail.

QUESTION: Secretary Blinken, I know you know there are a lot of people watching tonight, likely wondering could Vladimir Putin go further here. The President was asked today what if this goes beyond Ukraine, and he said if Putin moves into NATO countries, “we will be involved.” He said, “We will be involved.” Is this a possibility?

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Is it a possibility that Putin goes beyond Ukraine? Sure, it’s a possibility, but there’s something very powerful standing in the way of that. That’s something we call Article 5 of NATO. That means an attack on one member of NATO is an attack on all members of NATO. The President’s been very clear that we will defend every inch of NATO territory. I think that’s the most powerful deterrent against President Putin going beyond Ukraine.

QUESTION: You know the President has said all along U.S. troops will not fight in Ukraine against the Russians, but again, this hypothetical – if he goes beyond Ukraine and into NATO – given what you just cited, that means all bets are off the table here.

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, it’s not a question of all bets being off the table. It’s being very clear that we are committed to Article 5. We’re committed to defending our NATO Allies; and if it comes to that, we’ll do it. But right now, our focus is on Ukraine, our focus is on trying to prevent President Putin from going even further, but it looks like he’s going for everything he can get. And so, we’re doing what we said we would do all along. We’re imposing massive costs. We’re doing it with allies and partners. We’re doing it together. We’re doing it swiftly. And you’ve seen that already today.

QUESTION: Secretary Blinken, we do appreciate your time again tonight. Thank you.

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Thanks, David. It’s good to be with you.",https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-on-abc-world-news-tonight-with-david-muir/

During an interview on ABC’s “World News Tonight,” anchor David Muir asked Blinken if he was convinced that Putin was going to overthrow the Ukrainian government.

“I’m convinced he’s going to try to do that,” Blinken answered.

Muir also asked Blinken if he believed it might be a possibility that American troops could be involved if Russian troops moved into North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries, beyond Ukraine.

“Is it a possibility that Putin goes beyond Ukraine? Sure, it’s a possibility, but there’s something very powerful standing in the way of that. That’s something we call Article 5 of NATO. That means an attack on one member of NATO is an attack on all members of NATO,” Blinken answered. “The President’s been very clear that we will defend every inch of NATO territory.

“You know the President has said all along U.S. troops will not fight in Ukraine against the Russians, but again, this hypothetical — if he goes beyond Ukraine and into NATO — given what you just cited, that means all bets are off the table here,” Muir pressed the secretary of state.

Blinken answered that the U.S. was committed to supporting its NATO allies, saying if the situation required American assistance, “We’ll do it.”

“We’re committed to defending our NATO allies; and if it comes to that, we’ll do it. But right now, our focus is on Ukraine, our focus is on trying to prevent President Putin from going even further, but it looks like he’s going for everything he can get,” Blinken said.

“And so, we’re doing what we said we would do all along. We’re imposing massive costs. We’re doing it with allies and partners. We’re doing it together. We’re doing it swiftly. And you’ve seen that already today,” he added.

Since Putin ordered a military operation in Ukraine, the U.S. and its allies have announced new waves of sanctions against Russia, with Biden on Thursday saying U.S. sanctions would target Russian banks and impose export controls restricting Russian imports of sensitive U.S. technology.

Blinken, who also noted that it is ""a possibility"" that Russia could invade a NATO member, provided his bleak assessment of Ukraine during a Thursday evening appearance on ABC's World News Tonight with David Muir.

Putin announced a military operation in Ukraine during a speech that aired early Thursday morning, and within roughly a day, 137 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed and 316 injured, Zelensky announced as his country's forces face attacks from the north, south, and east.

WILL BIDEN'S 'FULL-SCALE' RESPONSE TO RUSSIAN INVASION SUCCEED WHERE HIS FIRST ROUND OF SANCTIONS FAILED?

""Is it a possibility that Putin goes beyond Ukraine? Sure, it’s a possibility, but there’s something very powerful standing in the way of that,"" Blinken said. ""That’s something we call Article 5 of NATO. That means an attack on one member of NATO is an attack on all members of NATO. The president’s been very clear that we will defend every inch of NATO territory. I think that’s the most powerful deterrent against President Putin going beyond Ukraine.""

A senior defense official told reporters earlier Thursday that there have been “in total more than 160 missiles for airstrikes"" in the time since Russia launched its military incursion into Ukraine.

Zelensky, in a video address to his people, claimed that he has evidence to show that Russian forces are targeting him.

""According to our information, the enemy marked me as target No. 1 — my family as target No. 2. They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state. We have information that enemy sabotage groups have entered Kyiv,"" he said.

Zelensky has been moved to a bunker, according to CNN. The White House declined to provide specifics about his location, though Zelensky did acknowledge that he remains in Kyiv with his central government.

Blinken's assessment of Russia's goal to topple the Ukrainian government is similar to the senior defense official, who told reporters, “We still believe … they have every intention of basically decapitating the government and installing their own method of governance.""

Tensions between Ukraine and Russia escalated rapidly in recent days after Putin recognized two Russia-backed regions in eastern Ukraine as independent entities earlier this week. He also ordered ""peacekeeping"" troops to go into those areas at the time.

The Ukrainian government declared a state of emergency meant to stay in place for at least 30 days Wednesday. Upon declaring martial law, Zelensky banned all men ages 18 to 60 from leaving the country.

The United States, which usually has more than 80,000 troops stationed in Europe, has deployed an additional 12,000 to European allies, and 2,000 more from within Europe have been relocated, though as it stands, they will not be fighting Russians.",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/blinken-says-hes-convinced-putin-aims-to-overthrow-ukraines-government

KYIV, Ukraine -- Russia pressed its invasion of Ukraine to the outskirts of the capital Friday after unleashing airstrikes on cities and military bases and sending in troops and tanks from three sides in an attack that could rewrite the global post-Cold War security order.

Explosions sounded before dawn in Kyiv as Western leaders scheduled an emergency meeting and Ukraine's president pleaded for international help. The nature of the explosions was not immediately clear, but the blasts came amid signs that the capital and largest Ukrainian city was increasingly threatened following a day of fighting that left more than 100 Ukrainians dead.

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the government had information that “subversive groups” were encroaching on the city, and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Kyiv “could well be under siege"" in what U.S. officials believe is a brazen attempt by Russian President Vladimir Putin to dismantle the government and replace it with his own regime.

U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told lawmakers on a phone call Thursday evening that Russian mechanized forces that entered from Belarus were about 20 miles from Kyiv, according to a person familiar with the call.

The assault, anticipated for weeks by the U.S. and Western allies and undertaken by Putin in the face of international condemnation and cascading sanctions, amounts to the largest ground war in Europe since World War II.

Russian missiles bombarded cities and military bases in the first day of the attack, and Ukraine officials said they had lost control of the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear power plant, scene of the world’s worst nuclear disaster. Civilians piled into trains and cars to flee and patrons of a hotel were directed into a shelter as explosions sounded in Kyiv.

“Russia has embarked on a path of evil, but Ukraine is defending itself and won’t give up its freedom,” Zelenskyy tweeted. His grasp on power increasingly tenuous, he called Thursday for even more severe sanctions than the ones imposed by Western allies and ordered a full military mobilization that would last 90 days.

Zelenskyy said in a video address that 137 “heroes,” including 10 military officers, had been killed and 316 people wounded. The dead included border guards on the Zmiinyi Island in the Odesa region, which was taken over by Russians.

He concluded an emotional speech by saying that “the fate of the country depends fully on our army, security forces, all of our defenders.” He also said the country had heard from Moscow that ”they want to talk about Ukraine’s neutral status.""

Biden was to meet Friday morning with fellow leaders of NATO governments in what the White House described as an “extraordinary virtual summit” to disuss Ukraine.

U.S. President Joe Biden announced new sanctions against Russia, saying Putin “chose this war” and had exhibited a “sinister” view of the world in which nations take what they want by force. Other nations also announced sanctions, or said they would shortly.

“It was always about naked aggression, about Putin’s desire for empire by any means necessary — by bullying Russia’s neighbors through coercion and corruption, by changing borders by force, and, ultimately, by choosing a war without a cause,” Biden said.

Blinken said in television interviews that he was convinced that Russia was intent on overthrowing the Ukrainian government, telling CBS that Putin wants to “reconstitute the Soviet empire"" and that Kyiv was already “under threat, and it could well be under siege.”

Fearing a Russian attack on the capital city, thousands of people went deep underground as night fell, jamming Kyiv's subway stations.

At times it felt almost cheerful. Families ate dinner. Children played. Adults chatted. People brought sleeping bags or dogs or crossword puzzles — anything to alleviate the waiting and the long night ahead.

But the exhaustion was clear on many faces. And the worries.

“Nobody believed that this war would start and that they would take Kyiv directly,” said Anton Mironov, waiting out the night in one of the old Soviet metro stations. “I feel mostly fatigue. None of it feels real.”

The invasion began early Thursday with a series of missile strikes, many on key government and military installations, quickly followed by a three-pronged ground assault. Ukrainian and U.S. officials said Russian forces were attacking from the east toward Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city; from the southern region of Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014; and from Belarus to the north.

Zelenskyy, who had earlier cut diplomatic ties with Moscow and declared martial law, appealed to global leaders, saying that “if you don’t help us now, if you fail to offer a powerful assistance to Ukraine, tomorrow the war will knock on your door.”

Though Biden said he had no plans to speak with Putin, the Russian leader did have what the Kremlin described as a “serious and frank exchange"" with French President Emmanuel Macron.

Both sides claimed to have destroyed some of the other's aircraft and military hardware, though little of that could be confirmed.

Hours after the invasion began, Russian forces seized control of the now-unused Chernobyl plant and its surrounding exclusion zone after a fierce battle, presidential adviser Myhailo Podolyak told The Associated Press.

The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency said it was told by Ukraine of the takeover, adding that there had been “no casualties or destruction at the industrial site.”

The 1986 disaster occurred when a nuclear reactor at the plant 130 kilometers (80 miles) north of Kyiv exploded, sending a radioactive cloud across Europe. The damaged reactor was later covered by a protective shell to prevent leaks.

Alyona Shevtsova, adviser to the commander of Ukraine’s ground forces, wrote on Facebook that staff members at the Chernobyl plant had been “taken hostage."" The White House said it was “outraged” by reports of the detentions.

The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense issued an update saying that though the plant was “likely captured,” the country's forces had halted Russia's advance toward Chernihiv and that it was unlikely that Russia had achieved its planned Day One military objectives.

The chief of the NATO alliance, Jens Stoltenberg, said the “brutal act of war"" shattered peace in Europe, joining a chorus of world leaders decrying an attack that could cause massive casualties and topple Ukraine’s democratically elected government. The conflict shook global financial markets: Stocks plunged and oil prices soared amid concerns that heating bills and food prices would skyrocket.

Condemnation came not only from the U.S. and Europe, but from South Korea, Australia and beyond — and many governments readied new sanctions. Even friendly leaders like Hungary’s Viktor Orban sought to distance themselves from Putin.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he aimed to cut off Russia from the U.K.’s financial markets as he announced sanctions, freezing the assets of all large Russian banks and planning to bar Russian companies and the Kremlin from raising money on British markets.

“Now we see him for what he is — a bloodstained aggressor who believes in imperial conquest,” Johnson said of Putin.

The U.S. sanctions will target Russian banks, oligarchs, state-controlled companies and high-tech sectors, Biden said, but they were designed not to disrupt global energy markets. Russian oil and natural gas exports are vital energy sources for Europe.

Zelenskyy urged the U.S. and West to go further and cut the Russians from the SWIFT system, a key financial network that connects thousands of banks around the world. The White House has been reluctant to immediately cut Russia from SWIFT, worried it could cause enormous economic problems in Europe and elsewhere in the West.

While some nervous Europeans speculated about a possible new world war, the U.S. and its NATO partners have shown no indication they would send troops into Ukraine, fearing a larger conflict. NATO reinforced its members in Eastern Europe as a precaution, and Biden said the U.S. was deploying additional forces to Germany to bolster NATO.

European authorities declared the country’s airspace an active conflict zone.

After weeks of denying plans to invade, Putin launched the operation on a country the size of Texas that has increasingly tilted toward the democratic West and away from Moscow’s sway. The autocratic leader made clear earlier this week that he sees no reason for Ukraine to exist, raising fears of possible broader conflict in the vast space that the Soviet Union once ruled. Putin denied plans to occupy Ukraine, but his ultimate goals remain hazy.

Ukrainians were urged to shelter in place and not to panic.

“Until the very last moment, I didn’t believe it would happen. I just pushed away these thoughts,” said a terrified Anna Dovnya in Kyiv, watching soldiers and police remove shrapnel from an exploded shell. “We have lost all faith.”

With social media amplifying a torrent of military claims and counter-claims, it was difficult to determine exactly what was happening on the ground.

Russia and Ukraine made competing claims about damage they had inflicted. Russia’s Defense Ministry said it had destroyed scores of Ukrainian air bases, military facilities and drones. It confirmed the loss of one of its Su-25 attack jets, blaming “pilot error,” and said an An-26 transport plane had crashed because of technical failure, killing the entire crew. It did not say how many were aboard.

Russia said it was not targeting cities, but journalists saw destruction in many civilian areas.
