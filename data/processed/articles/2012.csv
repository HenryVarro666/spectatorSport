March 11, 2022.

Every single day of this war, there have been images that hit like a gut punch. Some are simply hideous—the images of dead soldiers charred into pugilistic poses by the way that heat cooks the muscles, or the bodies of civilians lying limp in a park beside the meager belongings they were trying to carry away as they fled their homes. Others are so evocative that they tell a story at a glance, like a line of abandoned strollers sitting between the craters left by artillery shells on a highway, or an old woman sitting with her head bowed in a subway station turned bomb shelter.

So many of the images conjure up the past. They click in our minds with dates like 1968, or 1941, or 1917. They capture some of the same eerie, timelessness of frozen violence that Matthew Brady carried back from the battlefields of America when he hauled his clumsy camera gear out to capture images of the dead in the Civil War.

They are terrible, but transfixing. Heartbreaking even when they are heroic. They are as iconic, and as awful, as Nick Ut’s photograph of young Phan Thi Kim Phuc fleeing naked and burned along the highway outside Trảng Bàng.

They will be with us even when this war is over; reminders that we’ve seen their like before, and warnings that they could as easily come to us from the future as the past.
