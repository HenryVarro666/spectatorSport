As the most reliable and balanced news aggregation service on the internet, DML News App offers the following information published by DailyMail: These chilling satellite images show hundreds of Russian armoured vehicles heading for a major confrontation with Ukrainian troops which could decide the outcome of the war. The grainy pictures show a column of trucks, some towing artillery, stretching for more than eight miles through Russian-held territory. The article goes on to state the following: The convoy is heading towards eastern Ukraine where decisive battles are expected.

Having failed to capture any major cities, the Kremlin is sending tens of thousands of Russian troops to the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, known as the Donbas.

Satellite imagery firm Maxar Technologies released images this weekend, showing the Russian convoy traveling through the town of Velykyi Burluk, near the city of Kharkiv, on Friday.

The convoy has been described as about 8 miles long.

To actually try and address the question, aside of the various points people have raised that it's, as crazy sounds, actually pretty down low on the list of priorities for a reason:This is arguably part ofAzov were integrated into the armed forces proper, when they had originally spawned as a paramilitary group.

Ammunition they receive as part of military inventory - including that which is received via foreign aid - can be logged, and then questioned on what they've used it for, and if they haven't used it, then where is it.Whatever they gain, they gain through a, and thus can be hopefully kept in check.The bigger issue on any potential far-right types getting weapons are, ironically, those whoAzov because they may notin the system the same way.

Lured by steep discounts following Western sanctions on Russian entities, India has bought at least 13 million barrels of Russian crude oil since the country invaded Ukraine in late February. That compared with some 16 million barrels for the whole of last year, data compiled by Reuters shows.

Biden, who last spoke to Modi in March, recently said that only India among the Quad group of countries was ""somewhat shaky"" in acting against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.



The South Asian nation has tried to balance its ties with Russia and the West but unlike other members of the Quad countries - United States, Japan and Australia - it has not imposed sanctions on Russia.

Russia has long been India's biggest supplier of defence equipment despite growing purchases from the United States in the past decade. Defence analysts say Russian supplies are more cost competitive and vital for India as it faces a superior Chinese military.""

Russian Goebbels...Important interview in an Italian newspaper.CORRIERE DELLA SERA INTERVIEWKaraganov, Putin's adviser: 'This war is against the West. European targets could also be hit""Federico Fubini8 April 2022.Sergei Karaganov was foreign policy adviser to both Boris Yeltsin and Vladimir Putin. Even today, as head of the Centre for Foreign and Defence Policy, he remains close to Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and to the dictator himself, so much so that his proposed measures for the Russian minority remaining in the former Soviet republics are known as the ""Putin Doctrine"".In 2019, Karaganov was the first to articulate what is happening today: the total occupation of Ukraine . Putin says the intervention is justified by the aim of preventing Ukraine from joining NATO. But Kiev's accession would have been many years away.How does he explain the attack?""Putin said that if Ukraine joined NATO, it would be the end of Ukraine . Efforts by Russia and Germany and France blocked it, but since then Ukraine has been integrated into NATO. They have been armed, their troops have been trained by NATO, their army has grown stronger. We have been forced to witness an upsurge of neo-Nazi sentiment. Ukraine was becoming like Germany around 1937-38. War was inevitable because they had become the spearhead of NATO. We took the difficult decision: to strike first, before the threat became lethal.""But there was time to negotiate.""In these thirty years we have received all kinds of promises from the West. But they lied to us or forgot their promises.""How can you think that a small country like Ukraine would attack a nuclear power like Russia? And how can it be a Nazi when it has a Jewish president?""Ukraine has been turned into a spearhead by the US and other NATO members, perhaps offensively, but at least as a means of exerting pressure to bring the Western military machine closer to the heart of Russia. Now we are just seeing how ready they are for war. And Nazism is not just anti-Jewish. Nazism proclaims the superiority of one nation over another. Nazism is the humiliation of other nations.""The countries of Central and Eastern Europe have themselves asked to join NATO. And Moscow accepted enlargement under the 1997 Founding Treaty on Russia-NATO relations. Don't you agree?""This has been the biggest mistake of Russian foreign policy in the last thirty years. We signed it because we were desperately impoverished, on the verge of collapse. But I was completely shocked when NATO raped Serbia in 1999. Then most NATO members waged a brutal war in Iraq and committed aggression in Libya. So we don't trust their word. We know NATO's Article 5 - that if one member state of the Alliance is attacked, it is as if the whole Alliance is attacked - and we know that it does not work. There is no automatic guarantee that the Alliance will intervene to defend a member state under attack. This enlargement is like an aggression. A cancerous lesion that we wanted to stop before it spreads. We have to operate on the tumour.""Iraq was a serious mistake, but it does not justify other mistakes. The Americans elected another leader, Obama, who was against that war. Can the Russians do the same?""I don't think there will be a change in Russia's leadership because we are fighting for our survival. We are fighting a war against the West and the people are standing by the leader. And nobody in the United States has paid the price for the war in Iraq, so we have reservations about the effectiveness of democracy.""In Libya, Gaddafi bombed protesters. NATO declared a no-fly zone at the request of the UN Security Council, and Moscow did not veto.""Yes, we believed the reassuring words. Then we saw an aggression that destroyed the country. That led us to have no confidence in the West at all.""In Serbia in 1999, NATO stopped a war in which 13,000 people died, for which Slobodan Milosevic was tried by a court that convicted him of crimes against humanity.""The mass murder of Serbs (sic!) in Kosovo happened after the violence against Serbia. It was unspeakable violence. And the sad and humiliating trial of Milosevic was a despicable European spectacle.""It was a UN court, not a European Union court.""We do not recognise the jurisdiction of that court.""You claim that the war is against Western expansionism. What do you mean by that?""We see the ongoing Western expansionism and that the anti-Russianism (Russophobia) is reaching a level that anti-Semitism reached between the two world wars. In other words, the likelihood of conflict has already increased. And we see deep divisions and structural problems in Western societies. So the Kremlin decided to strike first. This military operation, by the way, also has the potential to realign the ranks of the elite and Russian society. It will be a militant society based on the nation, which will expel the unpatriotic elements from the ruling class.""Mussolini in 1919 did not recognise the order resulting from the Versailles Peace Treaties. Does the Kremlin recognise the European order that emerged with the fall of the Berlin Wall?""We do not have to recognise an order that was established against Russia. We tried to integrate, but it was a Versailles 2.0. We should have crumbled that order. Not by force, but by constructive destruction, by not participating in it. But when our last request to stop NATO was rejected, it was decided that we would use force.""Is the aim to counter NATO's presence in Central and Eastern Europe?""We think most of the institutions are one-sided and illegitimate. They threaten Russia and Eastern Europe. We wanted a just peace, but the greed and stupidity of the Americans and the short-sightedness of the Europeans made it clear to us that they did not want that. We must correct their mistakes.""Is the European Union part of the institutions that Russia considers illegitimate?""No. But sometimes we don't like the policies the EU pursues, especially when they become too belligerent.""Do you think an escalation of war towards other countries is inevitable?""Unfortunately, this is becoming more and more likely. The Americans and their partners in NATO continue to supply arms to Ukraine. If this continues, European targets could be hit or a situation could arise where supply routes are disrupted. Then the war could spread. This is increasingly a possibility. I imagine the US generals see it as I do.""Demilitarisation is the opposite of what Putin has achieved: Ukraine is full of weapons. Germany and all of Europe are arming, NATO has moved troops closer to the Russian conflict, the West is united and sanctions are getting tougher. Do you consider Putin's war a success?""We don't know how it's going. Demilitarisation means the dismantling of Ukrainian forces: that's underway and it will accelerate. Of course, if Ukraine is helped, the death toll will continue. We can only talk about victory in quotes, because there are many victims on both the Russian and Ukrainian sides. Either way, the war will be victorious. I assume that the Nazis will be denazified, as in Germany and Chechnya. The Ukrainians will be more peaceful and friendly with us.""But the Russian army had to withdraw after the siege of Kiev.""And what if the aim of the Kiev operation was to draw Ukrainian forces away from the main southern, south-eastern battlefield? The Russian troops were very careful not to strike civilian targets, with only 30-35 per cent of their weaponry deployed. If we had used all of it, it would have destroyed Ukrainian cities and led to a quicker victory. We did not carpet bomb, as the Americans did in Iraq. The outcome will probably be a new agreement, possibly with Zelensky still in power. This will result in the creation of a country in the south, in the south-east of Ukraine, on friendly terms with Russia. Perhaps there will be two Ukrainias. But right now, in the fog of war, it is impossible to see this clearly.""In Mariupol, civilians have been attacked and killed by Russians in Buca and elsewhere: deliberate war crimes. Are they being prosecuted?""The story of Buca was staged, a provocation.""There is evidence.""99 percent staged. But there is a war and the civilian population is suffering. Neo-Nazi forces used civilians as human shields, especially in Mariupol.""The Russian army has not opened humanitarian corridors.""But we did. The nationalist forces blocked them.""Were they expecting cohesion between Europe and the United States?""The cohesion will collapse because of the problems in the West. The West is declining, losing its role in world politics, so it needs an enemy. I hope that Europe will not commit suicide by giving up its independence. I hope it will pull back from the wave of hatred.You speak as if another country had started this war.""We started it. Now we are in the same position as the West. The West has committed a series of aggressions. So now we are on the same moral ground. Now we are equal, we are more or less doing what you are doing. I am sorry that we have lost our moral high ground, but we are fighting a life and death struggle.""Sanctions are getting tougher. Will Russia become more dependent on China?""We will be more connected to China and more dependent on them. There are positive elements of that, but overall we will be much more dependent on them. I'm not afraid that we will become China's vassal, because Russia has a very strong spirit of sovereignty and we are culturally different from the Chinese. I don't think that China can or wants to take us over. Even with that, we are not satisfied, in fact we would have much preferred to have better relations with Europe.""So China, not Russia, will be the winner of this war?""We will win because the Russians always win. But in the meantime we will lose a lot. People. Resources. And we will be impoverished, temporarily. But we are prepared to sacrifice everything to build a more viable international system. We want to build a more just and sustainable international order. One that is different from the order that came into being with the collapse of the Soviet Union, which is now collapsing. We are now descending into chaos. We want to build Fortress Russia to defend ourselves, even if it means making ourselves poorer. Unfortunately, the chaos could reach Europe if Europe does not act in its own interests: what it is doing now is suicide.""Is that a threat? Don't you think the nuclear deterrent is still in place?""I know that in certain circumstances the US may use nuclear weapons to defend Europe. There is a one percent chance of that, so we have to be But the President of the United States would be crazy to take such a decision.""",https://www.militaryimages.net/threads/russia-ukraine-crisis.10344/post-222107

Assuming that Russia has also stopped pumping oil into the Russia-Ukraine pipelines this could serve to over time create a fuel crunch as it leaves Ukraine dependent on imports by rail. (If that is indeed the intention and not merely to create flashy visuals.)

Mind you, so far diesel remains available even for civilians, but there is some rationing as well as shortage for agriculture in the south.

The Russian campaign against rail is perhaps more promising, particularly in the immediate. The Russians have hit several railway marshaling yards in cities directly behind Donbass through which Ukrainian reinforcements and supplies are transported.

Through the fog of war, it is difficult to say what effect that may have had. Did it cut the rail completely, or merely created a headache for a day or two until the damaged cars were cleared?

One question that certainly arises is why did Russia wait until 40 days into the war to comprehensively target these links?

Ideally, the Russians want to capture rail intact because of how reliant they are on it themselves. But if you’re not going to capture it quickly then denying it to the enemy sounds somewhat important.

Also, it’s not as if rail is impossible to repair especially when we are talking about Russia which has nearly 30,000 Railway Troops that do nothing but run and rebuild railroads.

Another question might be why has Russia failed to target railway bridges across the Dnieper? There are only around half a dozen railway crossings across the great river. (Admittedly two of these are across dams that aren’t easily disrupted.) With these gone or disrupted Ukraine would be sliced in two for rail purposes.

Is it simply optics, or does the Russian military still harbor the hope it might capture them whole? That’s quite unlikely, and even if it does that won’t be any time soon.

Russian forces that were withdrawn from the Kiev theater continue to arrive to the southeast but so far there is no mega offensive just the continuation of the previous Izyum push with the forces that were already there. This could be a sign that Russians intend to amass the new arrivals and throw them in all at once — rather than piecemeal — which is theoretically exactly how you want to conduct an ambitious offensive. Ideally, you would also give the transferred forces a little bit of rest and ample resupply.

That said, there are other circumstances that dictate urgency and speed. Every week gives the Ukrainians more time to train and raise the cohesion of new and reserve units, and the US is escalating arms shipments. The first $800 million package has been delivered and another $300 million package is on the way. That will still leave another $2.4 billion to be supplied of the $3.5 billion Congress allocated for arms transfers in March. Doubtlessly when that has been distributed, if Ukraine is still standing, even more will be voted in.

For comparison, Ukraine spent about $900 million on military procurement annually before the war. Now it will receive nearly 4X as much from the US alone, and another €1.5 billion from the EU.

The US has so far supplied 50 million rounds of ammunition, 45 thousand armored vests, and 5 thousand rifles, as well as 12 thousand anti-tank missiles. Not game-changing but already significant and this is just the beginning.

The Senate has actually voted in a bill that would allow Biden to funnel arms to Ukraine as Lend-Lease, without having to seek special authorization from legislators. (Lend-Lease pretends to be a sale with deferred payment rather than a giveaway so falls under less Congressional scrutiny.) They’re even talking about ramping up Javelin and Stinger production capacity just to serve as Ukraine’s military-industrial complex.

“The Ukrainians are running out of 152mm ammunition. Where are they going to get it?” asked Chris Donnelly, an adviser to four former NATO secretaries-general on the Soviet and Russian military. “No one in the west uses it or makes it apart from the Serbs — and they’re on Russia’s side.”

Meanwhile, information has been placed that Ukrainians are running out of 152mm artillery ammo that in Europe only the Serbs are still manufacturing. How I read that is that the public is being prepared for eventual transfers of big-item hardware of Western make to Ukraine, starting with 155mm artillery for which ammo exists in Western storage aplenty.

Let’s say 60 days from now, if the war is still going on and the Ukrainians are still giving a good account of themselves I wouldn’t be surprised at all to see them start getting Western artillery pieces. (At which point the question of whether the Ukrainians still have railway junctions and bridges will become even more acute.) Operating a howitzer isn’t far different from operating any piece of heavy and precise machinery. Like a lathe operator switching to a new lathe, a person who is already an artilleryman can retrain to a new tube inside a week.

Incidentally, drone-guided artillery has been the premier killer in this war and that goes for both sides. Armed drones are getting outsized publicity, but are present only in low numbers on either side (48 TB2 for Ukraine now gone, 32 Inokhodets for Russia) don’t come close in big-picture impact. In fact, this dominance of artillery (and the relatively low number of men involved overall) has made it into a kind of contactless war where there isn’t a traditional frontline with the two sides staring at each other from static positions half a kilometer apart. Instead, much of the fighting is resolved at long range, with advances or defensive lines broken up from tens of kilometers away.

This is just as what was anticipated, but what wasn’t necessarily predicted is that Ukrainian artillery would still be in the fight. The Russians are in a position to fire from more tubes and for longer (before relocation to avoid a counter-barrage), but the Ukrainian artillery continues to exact a deadly toll as well. Likely part of that is due to US intelligence support, namely US satellite imagery and analysis. If you have the coordinates of an enemy camp (eg via the Americans) you only need to know your own coordinates and you can fire at the enemy relatively precisely using a simple range card. (Though having a drone for adjustments due to atmospheric conditions is even better.)

In this drone-artillery war, the Russians also have the advantage in that they can employ camera drones with near impunity since the Ukrainians have few surviving air defense systems with radar units. (Ukrainians are dependent on visual detection.) There is a caveat, however. At the low attitudes these small drones fly they can’t be detected by radar from very far, so in practice the Russian anti-drone coverage is patchy.

It’s an unusual war in that, thanks to US involvement, the weaker side has certain hardware advantages. Firstly the Ukrainians probably have access to somewhat better satellite imagery. Secondly, they have better night vision devices for the elite infantry. Not necessarily more devices, but more advanced — 3rd generation instead of 2nd. Thirdly they are absolutely saturated with anti-tank missiles (over 15,000) and increasingly with anti-aircraft MANPADs.

The popular Russian military-oriented site Voennoe Obozrenie (Military Review) expects Russia to prevail by autumn, but not sooner:

So far, the main thing is not visible: a clear and thoughtful plan. It is clear that the military part of the special operation will sooner or later (I am sure that later, by autumn, not earlier) will come to its logical conclusion. The armed forces of Ukraine will run out of fuel, shells and tanks, and peace will come. More precisely, hostilities will cease.

Moreover, its prediction is for a win through simple attrition.

I am not so certain that attrition presents a clear path to victory.

I find the suggestion by some that Ukraine had 600,000 men under arms when the war started laughable, but by fall the figure could become reality, depending on how feverishly the Ukrainians are mobilizing and training up. (4-million Bosnia fielded over 250,000 across all sides of its civil war. 35-million Ukraine could raise far more.)

If these hypothetical 600,000 take positions in Ukraine’s cities — which has been Kiev’s strategy so far — then Russian victory without horrendous costs for everyone involved becomes very difficult.

Doubly so if America becomes Ukraine’s military-industrial complex and opens up a Lend-Lease air bridge supplying Kiev with a stream of artillery tubes, shells, and small reconnaissance and suicide drones.

Yes, it is true that Russia has decent strike capabilities and could potentially threaten to intercept these supplies, but what Russia doesn’t have is around-the-clock surveillance. There is no way for Russia to monitor every truck or train entering the country, and so far it has been unwilling to take the Dnieper bridges or most railway junctions out of commission.

The storming of Mariupol is taking 6 weeks and immense destruction, and it’s an ethnic Russian city where Ukrainian forces have little support which won’t always be the case. How does Russia tackle much larger cities like Kharkov and Dnipro and at what cost?

This is from the Western media so take it with a grain of salt, but reportedly the Russians have (only now) named an overall commander of their campaign. It is Alexander Dvornikov the commander of the Southern Military District. The Southern District has so far had more success and has performed better than the others. Moreover, this is Southern District’s turf. It is the Russian Military District across from Donbass. For my part, I can say that in the northern Kiev operation I failed to detect much cooperation between the Eastern District advancing south from Belarus and the Central District advancing west from Russia. I find the news plausible and think the Russians will benefit from a more unified effort.

Russia has publicized 1351 confirmed dead and 3825 wounded for a total of over 5000. This was after a month of war, 17 days ago. This does not include Rosgvardia losses that fall under the Interior Ministry, and does not include captured and missing. For the Russian military you aren’t a confirmed dead until they have your body in their possession and matched to your name. As long as you remain unidentified or lie behind enemy lines you aren’t dead.

Since the Kiev retreat temporarily fewer men have been involved in fighting, but even so up to 8000 total casualties seems realistic by now, just by taking the Russian MoD at face value. This speaks to how very bloody this war is. If the figure seems low it is only because there is relatively few men involved compared to what would have been the case historically. (For example, the 6 million fielded by the Red Army.) Russia is pursuing this war with perhaps 160,000 Russian soldiers in the theater with perhaps 80,000 of them in maneuver elements (BTGs) that take the bulk of the casualties. 6000 wounded and 2000 dead may seem “low” for a country of 140 million. But 7000 casualties (mainly wounded) sustained by 80,000 men in the span of 7 weeks is anything but low. As I have said repeatedly, a lot is being asked of the Russian active-duty soldier in this one.",https://anti-empire.com/russia-in-new-approach-to-war-but-the-clock-is-ticking/

godz. 18.38 - Wiceminister rolnictwa Ukrainy: w najgorszym razie uda się zasiać 70 procent pól

Tej wiosny uda się zasiać przynajmniej 70 procent pól uprawnych na Ukrainie - poinformował ukraiński wiceminister polityki rolnej i żywności Taras Wysocki. W telewizji Ukraina24 podkreślił, że jest to jednak pesymistyczny scenariusz.

Zdaniem Tarasa Wysockiego jeśli uda się rozminować wszystkie pola uprawne w obwodach czernihowskim i sumskim - w których znajdują się największe areały - ogólny procent obsiewów wzrośnie do 80. ""Na razie trwają analizy, ich wyniki poznamy niedługo"" - dodał wiceminister.

Wiceszef ukraińskiego resortu rolnictwa zapewnił, że w tym roku zboża wystarczy potrzeby wewnętrzne. Dodał, że będzie możliwy także jego eksport. ""Planujemy obsiać 80 procent pól. 30 procent plonów - jak każdego roku - zostanie przeznaczone na wewnętrzny rynek. Wystarczy także na eksport. Ukraina jest przygotowana i będzie nadal odgrywać swoją ważną rolę w zapewnieniu bezpieczeństwa żywnościowego"" - podkreślił.

Ukraina jest jednym z największych światowych eksporterów kukurydzy, pszenicy i oleju słonecznikowego. Przez napaść Rosji eksport zbóż jest obecnie ograniczony do 500 tysięcy ton miesięcznie. Przed wojną kraj sprzedawał za granicę pięć milionów ton w ciągu miesiąca. Jak przekazał resort polityki rolnej i żywności Ukrainy, to dla Kijowa strata w wysokości 1,5 miliarda dolarów.
