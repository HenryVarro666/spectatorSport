I thank my friend Mr. President of 🇹🇷 @RTErdogan and the people of 🇹🇷 for their strong support. The ban on the passage of 🇷🇺 warships to the Black Sea and significant military and humanitarian support for 🇺🇦 are extremely important today. The people of 🇺🇦 will never forget that! — Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa) February 26, 2022

Turkey has so far made no public statements on closing the straits to Russian warships, although President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan spoke with Zelenskiy by phone earlier on Saturday, stating that Ankara is attempting to push for an immediate ceasefire.

Turkish officials have briefed no decision has been taken and the Russian news agency Interfax reported that Russia has received no official notification from the Turkish side about a closure.

Cutting off the Bosphorus and Dardanelles to Russian warships, preventing them from accessing the Black Sea, would be a significant move, not only in terms of cutting off long-term Russian support to its troops in Ukraine but also as a significant show of support to Ukraine.

A ban would prevent Russian warships normally permanently stationed around the world from sailing into the Black Sea to assist troops in Ukraine. However, Turkey is unable to prevent ships permanently stationed in the Black Sea from returning to their bases.

Shipping industry experts Lloyd’s List on Friday pointed out that commercial traffic through the Bosphorus has already slowed significantly in the past two days.

Black sea shipping appears to have ground to a halt this morning. Nothing is moving off Ukraine. Odessa exodus for international vessels is largely complete however 13 vessels remain in port. 6 non-Ukrainian vessels appear to be sheltering offshore but not moving. @LLIntelligence pic.twitter.com/GQ5bgCBYdt — Richard Meade (@Lloydslisted) February 25, 2022

Turkey’s foreign ministry described the Russian invasion as “unacceptable” but described it as a “military operation” rather than a war, as doing so has implications for the Montreux convention.

The convention defines Turkish control of the straits as well as setting limits on the size, tonnage and duration of warships that can cross the straits, although warships belonging to countries bordering the Black Sea are normally able to pass unrestricted.

Foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu on Friday laid out Turkey’s position regarding the closure of the straits to the daily newspaper Hürriyet, stating that officials are discussing whether the conflict meets the definition of a war under the Montreux convention.

If officials decide that the definition has been met, this allows them to block warships from both Ukraine and Russia from passing through the straits, although the move is likely to be far more significant for the Russian side.

“Turkey can stop the passage of warships through the straits,” he said, adding that the convention stipulates that “if there is a demand for ships from the warring countries to return to their bases, then it must be allowed”.

“If we accept the state of war legally, this process will begin,” he added. “Secondly, if we accept the state of war we will prohibit the passage of warships... but even if we ban them, the Russians have such a right.”

Turkey maintains alliances with both Russia and Ukraine, and has so far emphasised its neutrality in the conflict despite selling its Bayraktar TB2 drones to Ukraine and condemning Russia’s actions.

Turkey’s own Nato membership was put under pressure by its decision to buy Russia’s S400 missile defence system in 2017, although Erdoğan has recently sought to show how much Turkey values membership of the organisation, telling journalists that “Nato should have taken a more decisive step”.

The conflict in Ukraine and a rebuke from Russia should Turkey choose to close the straits is likely to heavily affect Turkey’s economy, already hobbled from a year where the lira lost half of its value and as rising energy costs spark protests and discontent. Turkey imports roughly a third of its natural gas supply from Russia, as well as much of its wheat from Russia and Ukraine.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/26/kyiv-piles-pressure-on-ankara-to-close-straits-to-russia-warships-ukraine

3,e2cc06ed-acdb-4829-9d05-df35b342efd5,[],2022-02-25 00:00:00,"Ukraine has appealed to Turkey to block Russian warships from passing through the Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits which lead to the Black Sea.

The Turkish foreign minister has said Turkey cannot stop Russian warships accessing the Black Sea via its straits, as Ukraine has requested, due to a clause in an international pact.

Ukraine has appealed to Turkey to block Russian warships from passing through the Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits which lead to the Black Sea, after Moscow on Thursday launched a full-blown assault on Ukraine from land, air and sea.

Russian forces landed at Ukraine’s Black and Azov Sea ports as part of the invasion.

Turkey has control over the straits under the 1936 Montreux Convention, and can limit the passage of warships during wartime or if threatened. However, the request has put the NATO member in a difficult position as it tries to manage its Western commitments and close ties with Russia.

Speaking in Kazakhstan on Thursday, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Turkey was studying Kyiv’s request but said Russia had the right under the Convention to return ships to their home base, in this case, the Black Sea.

If Turkey decided after a legal process to accept Ukraine’s request and close the straits to Russian warships, he said, they would only be prevented from travelling in the other direction, away from their home base into the Mediterranean.

“If countries involved in the war make a request to return their vessels to their bases, that needs to be allowed,” the Hurriyet newspaper quoted Cavusoglu as saying.

Turkey’s role

Cavusoglu added that Turkish legal experts were still trying to determine whether the conflict in Ukraine could be defined as a war, which would allow the convention mandates to be invoked.

Ukraine’s ambassador to Turkey, Vasyl Bodnar, said on Friday Kyiv was expecting a “positive response” from Ankara to its request.

Cavusoglu also reiterated Ankara’s opposition to imposing economic sanctions against Russia, a stance that has set Turkey apart from most of its NATO allies which have already announced such measures.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan criticised Western countries on Friday for giving “ample advice” without the determination to match.

Speaking to reporters hours before he was due to take part in a virtual NATO summit, Erdogan said the alliance should have taken a “more decisive” stance over the Russian aggression against Ukraine.

Turkey has close ties to both Russia and Ukraine.

In an address to an international gathering in Ankara on Thursday, Erdogan said Turkey “sincerely regrets” that the two countries are confronting each other.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/25/cannot-stop-russian-warships-returning-in-black-sea-turkey

The 1936 Montreux Convention governs the free movement of commercial ships in peacetime through the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles straits.

But it grants Turkey the right to block the passage of warships in the Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits, that connect the Aegean, Marmara, and Black Sea, in wartime if threatened.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had just clarified Turkey's position as a NATO member: “not to abandon either Russia or Ukraine” and not to “cede Turkey's national interests”.

“We have decided to use the Montreux Convention to prevent the escalation of the crisis,” he said after a cabinet meeting.

Ukraine had last week officially asked Turkey to close the Dardanelles Strait -- and thus access to the Black Sea -- to Russian ships.

NATO member Turkey, which has strong ties with both Russia and Ukraine, did not immediately respond to this request.

“Russia asked us if we would apply the Montreux Convention if necessary. We told them we would apply it word for word,” Cavusoglu said.

He added that Turkish experts had been studying the situation to assess “whether there is a state of war from a legal point of view”.

Turkey is navigating its own narrow passage, diplomatically, between its ally Ukraine, to which it has sold combat drones used against Russian tanks, and Russia, on which it depends for its gas and grain supplies.

However, Turkey on Sunday officially recognised Russia's attacks on Ukraine as a “state of war”.

Erdogan on Monday said he considers “Russia's attack on Ukrainian territory as unacceptable” and hailed the struggle of the Ukrainian government and people.

The Russia-Ukraine conflict continues to rage with the Russian army been given orders to broaden its offensive in Ukraine “from all directions” after Kyiv refused to hold talks in Belarus.

In the midst of this battle and chaos, the spotlight has moved to the Black Sea after Ukraine urged Turkey to close the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits to Russian ships.

Ukraine's ambassador to Ankara said the country expected solidarity from NATO member Turkey and that it should not remain impartial after Russia launched an offensive.

How exactly does this fit into the Ukraine-Russia crisis? What’s the importance of the Black Sea in this issue and is it possible for Turkey to do what Ukraine has asked?

Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits

First off, let’s try to understand what are these two areas and the geographical significance they hold.

The straits, also known as the Turkish Straits or the Black Sea Straits, connect the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea via the Sea of Marmara. The Bosphorus connects the Black Sea with the Sea of Marmara, while the Dardanelles connects the Aegean Sea with the Sea of Marmara.

The Bosphorus is about 19 miles long and varies in width between one-third and two miles. The Dardanelles is about 35 miles long, its width decreases from four miles at the Aegean to about 0.7 miles at its narrowest.

The Bosphorus Strait has played a major role in world trade for centuries. About 48,000 vessels transit the straits each year, making this area one of the world’s busiest maritime gateways.

The Bosphorus is also one of the world’s most important chokepoints for the maritime transit of oil.

Over 3 per cent of global supply or three million barrels per day, mainly from Russia and the Caspian Sea, passes through the waterway.

The route also ships vast amounts of grains from Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan to world markets.

For the unversed, the Black Sea which is located between Europe and Asia, has Russia to its northeast, Ukraine to the north, Georgia to the east, Turkey to the south and Bulgaria and Romania to the west.

Interestingly, three of these six nations — Turkey, Bulgaria and Romania — are members of NATO.

Rustem Umerov, a Ukrainian member of parliament from Crimea, explained to The Independent in a report the importance of the water way. “The Black Sea is Russia’s entrance to the world – including the Mediterranean and Atlantic spheres of influence.”

A 2020 report also highlighting the importance of the Black Sea to Russia, had said, ""The Black Sea is important because of the significant access that it offers to Russia – in particular, access to global sea lines of communication and opportunities to project power at a strategic distance and expand its air and coastal defences.""

Trade through the Black Sea

A Bloomberg report stated that the Black Sea is a major artery for the movement of commodities at the crossroads of Europe and Asia.

Crude oil, refined oil, agricultural product and iron and steel are all transported through the Black Sea.

According to the Bloomberg report, Ukraine and Russia together account for more than a quarter of global wheat exports, nearly a fifth of corn trade and the bulk of sunflower oil.

Romania and Bulgaria have also become increasingly prominent crop shippers. Rich, fertile soils have helped Ukraine become the second-largest grain shipper.

Those products are sent by truck, rail and barge to ports for shipment to Asia, Africa and the European Union.

Due to this conflict, shipping from the Sea of Azov was suspended on Thursday, stranding more than 150 vessels.

Additionally, Ukraine’s steel makes up about a tenth of Europe’s imports, so disruption to mills or shipments would tighten the continent’s already strained market and help keep prices high after they reached a record last year.

Montreux Convention

On Thursday, Ukraine asked Turkey to close Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits, also known as the Turkish Straits, under the Montreaux Convention.

For those wondering what this agreement is and how it plays into the battle, here’s some clarity on the issue.

Signed in 1936, the Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Straits {known as the Montreux Convention} gives Turkey control over the Bosphorus and Dardanelles Straits and regulates the transit of naval warships.

Signed on 20 July 1936 at the Montreux Palace in Switzerland, the Convention permitted Turkey to remilitarise​ the Straits. It went into effect on 9 November 1936 and was registered in the League of Nations Treaty Series on 11 December 1936.

The Montreux Convention guarantees free passage of civilian vessels to use the Turkish straits, unless they are from a country that Turkey is engaged in war with, giving it the authority to close the straits to all merchant ships if it chooses.

However, the accord isn’t that clear when it comes to warships and that’s where the controversy arises.

The accord states that if Turkey is at war, Ankara has the right to do whatever is necessary, including closing the straits. If other states are at war and Turkey is neutral, the straits are closed for those belligerent countries.

In peacetime, the rules are a bit more complicated.

The convention does not allow aircraft carriers, but it does not mention ships that are designed for other purposes but can also carry aircraft. In this case, Ankara is the ultimate decision-maker depending on war and peacetime.

The Turkish government must also authorise aircraft if they cross over the straits.

Submarines are also not allowed to pass the Turkish straits. But Black Sea states — Russia, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Romania and Georgia — can build submarines outside the Black Sea and transport them through the straits, and can exit the Black Sea for maintenance by providing adequate notice.

Turkey now in a precarious situation

The Ukraine request has put Ankara in a bind, as it shares good diplomatic ties with Moscow. On the other hand, it also has to fulfil its obligations as a NATO ally.

President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said that Turkey could not abandon its ties with either country and that it would take steps to ensure relations remain intact.

Reacting to Ukraine’s call, Turkey’s foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said his country was studying Kyiv’s request but said Russia had the right under the Convention to return ships to their home base, in this case, the Black Sea.

If Turkey decided after a legal process to accept Ukraine’s request and close the straits to Russian warships, he said, they would only be prevented from travelling in the other direction, away from their home base into the Mediterranean.

“If countries involved in the war make a request to return their vessels to their bases, that needs to be allowed,” the Hurriyet newspaper quoted Cavusoglu as saying.

Cavusoglu added that Turkish legal experts were still trying to determine whether the conflict in Ukraine could be defined as a war, which would allow the convention mandates to be invoked.

It is left to be seen what happens in the future, but most experts believe that Turkey will not accede to Ukraine’s demands.

Cavusolgu also highlighted that Turkish experts are studying the issue and in case “a war-time situation is officially declared, the process will begin.”

“Clearly, all it requires is for Turkey to describe Russia’s attack as a war,” the foreign minister explained.

“We demand the closure of the Dardanelles. We want sanctions on the Russian side,” the Ukrainian envoy to Turkey, Vasyl Bondar, said during a news conference in front of the country’s embassy in Ankara.

The Montreux Treaty was established in 1936 with the aim of regulating the movement of warships and merchants through the Turkish Straits to the Black Sea.

Since the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the treaty saw major shifts in response to several countries bordering the Black Sea moving towards the west’s sphere of influence.

According to the agreement, the countries bordering the Black Sea are obliged to inform Turkey of the date their ships will pass through the straits, and the number of ships passing simultaneously should not exceed nine.",https://thecradle.co/Article/news/7282

Turkey issued the first official clarification since Zelenskyy's appeal, stating that Turkey has agreed to cut off the waterways to Moscow’s warships in one of the crucial moves with respect to Russia’s maritime warfare capabilities. Russia, in its fierce response to Turkey, disputed a claim over Black Sea access via the Interfax news agency, that no official notification of the closure was sent to Moscow. Under Montreux convention, asserted Russia, war vessels sailing in Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits will be allowed to return to port. “If Turkey did go ahead and ban warships from the strait, it would break the convention,” warned Russia via its state-affiliated Interfax agency.

The 1936 international treaty Montreux Convention makes Turkey a strategic and a key player in the Ukraine-Russia war as it has the power to control the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus straits, the main choke point to the Black Sea used by Russian Naval forces to transit in the region. The treaty grants Turkey the sole right to block naval vessels in an event of a war, including if Turkey’s own security is threatened. As several foreign commercial cargo ships, including Turkey’s own Marshall Islands-flagged bulk carrier and Japan’s Panama-registered freighter Namura Queen was hit by a bomb off the coast of Odessa and ports of Mariupol, Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan summoned top security officials meeting to take the risky step of blocking Black sea access.

Kremlin's access to key naval base in Syria risks a 'cut-off'

Despite having close ties with Russia's President Vladimir Putin in recent years, Turkey is considering blocking the crucial maritime waterways to Russian vessels. Kremlin has a key naval base in Syria, that conducted large naval drills in the Mediterranean and Gulf of Oman. Russia’s warships have been heading towards the Black Sea from the Mediterranean for its military manoeuvres. As Russia’s offensive on Kyiv intensified, Russian navy’s Baltic Fleet and the Northern Fleet were passing the Bosphorus in ""a planned manner.”

As many as 140 military warships and more than 10,000 Russian naval forces conducted drills in the Black Sea ahead of Kyiv’s all-out invasion. Turkey, which shares a maritime border with Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea, had failed to mediate between Moscow and Kyiv to de-escalate the situation.

Ankara had earlier appeared reluctant to unilaterally execute a blockade of the Black Sea straits to the Russian navy, citing a clause in the international pact. Ships in the Mediterranean and Black sea, it said, were able to return to their home defence bases after transit through the Dardanelles and Bosphorus, the Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu had said.
