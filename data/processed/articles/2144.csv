Speaking to MPs at Westminster, Barclay said he was appalled by what he called “an unprovoked attack” and the UK and its allies would respond decisively.

He added that the prime minister would address parliament later, “to outline the UK response, including overwhelming sanctions”.

After speaking to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy,early in the morning, the prime minister said: “This is a catastrophe for our continent.” He said the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, had “chosen a path of bloodshed and destruction”.

The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said she had summoned the Russian ambassador “to meet me and explain Russia’s illegal, unprovoked invasion of Ukraine”. She is expected to speak to her counterparts in various countries throughout the day.

Following a meeting of the government’s emergency Cobra committee at 7.30am on Thursday, Johnson is expected to give an address to the nation, followed by a call with G7 leaders in the afternoon and a statement in the House of Commons at 5pm.

Ukraine’s president declared martial law, while Russia’s military said it had targeted Ukrainian airbases and other military assets and not populated areas.

A Downing Street spokesperson said the Cobra committee meeting, chaired by Johnson, discussed the response to the “horrific attacks”.

Britain, in common with other Nato allies, has said it will not fight Russia, because Ukraine is not a Nato member. But the UK has supplied arms to Kyiv and has already announced limited economic sanctions.

The UK previously said it expected Russia to launch an invasion along “multiple axes” – aimed at Ukraine military forces in the east of the country and above all, the capital, Kyiv, in what could be a bloody attempt to force a change of regime.

Western officials have said they expect Russia to seek to encircle Ukraine’s major cities and rely on the FSB intelligence service to deliver them with limited fighting. The US has warned key Ukrainian figures could be targeted in this phase.

In a statement posted on Twitter at 4.53am, Johnson said he had spoken with Zelenskiy to discuss “next steps”.

He said: “I am appalled by the horrific events in Ukraine and I have spoken to President Zelenskiy to discuss next steps. President Putin has chosen a path of bloodshed and destruction by launching this unprovoked attack on Ukraine. The UK and our allies will respond decisively.”

A Downing Street spokesperson said Johnson had assured Zelenskiy the west “would not stand by as President Putin waged his campaign against the Ukrainian people”.

“The prime minister said he hoped Ukraine could resist and that Ukraine and its people were in the thoughts of everyone in the United Kingdom during this dark time,” the spokesperson said.

The Foreign Office minister James Cleverly promised there would be an “unprecedented” fresh set of sanctions imposed on Russia for the “appalling decision” to invade Ukraine. He accused Putin of “recreating some kind of tsarist, expansionist Russia” and being driven by ego as well as a “foolish attempt to write himself into the history books”.

Cleverly said on Sky News that the Russian stock market had already dropped 30% in value. In London, the FTSE 100 also fell 2.5% to 7,311.69 as Europe awakened to news of the Russian invasion.

Gen Sir Richard Shirreff, a former senior British army officer, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “Absolutely there is a possibility that we as a nation will be at war with Russia. Because if Russia puts one boot-step across Nato territory, we are all at war with Russia – every single member of the Nato alliance.”

Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, cancelled a speech on the economy in Huddersfield and called for Johnson to unveil the “hardest possible sanctions” against all those linked to Putin.

After the government was criticised for what were derided as weak sanctions announced by the prime minister on Tuesday, Starmer urged the prime minister to “match our rhetoric with action”, and added: “The influence of Russian money must be extricated from the UK.”

Britain’s ambassador to Ukraine urged UK nationals to leave the country immediately. Melinda Simmons wrote on Twitter: “We advise GB nationals to leave Ukraine immediately if you judge that it is safe to do so from your location. Please call +380 44 490 3660 if you need assistance.”

Putin announced the action during a televised address early on Thursday morning, saying the move was a response to threats from Ukraine. He said Russia did not have a goal to occupy Ukraine, but that the responsibility for bloodshed lay with the Ukrainian “regime”.

He also warned other countries that any attempt to interfere with the Russian action would lead to “consequences they have never seen”.

The UK’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, described Russia’s actions as “naked aggression against a democratic country” and said no one had been fooled by the Kremlin’s “false flags and fake narratives”.

“The Russian Federation has today further violated Ukrainian sovereignty,” he said. “Despite the efforts of the international communities, Russia has chosen conflict. No one has been fooled by the Kremlin’s false flags and fake narratives.

“This is naked aggression against a democratic country which had dared to express a different aspiration than being a supine neighbour to Russia. No one should forget this day.

Putin early Thursday launched an air and ground assault on Ukraine after a surprise television address.

UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, who spoke to her US counterpart Antony Blinken Wednesday evening ahead of the Russian leader’s announcement, joined Johnson in condemning the attack “on the people of Ukraine”.

“We stand with Ukraine and we will work with our international partners to respond to this terrible act of agression,” she said following the start of Russia’s offensive.

Her foreign ministry colleague, lawmaker James Cleverly, told the BBC that the government feared it is “the start of a quite extensive military operation”.

The ministry has deployed teams to five countries in eastern Europe to support Britons leaving Ukraine, Truss noted.

Meanwhile Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he had instructed the UK Civil Aviation Authority to ensure airlines avoid Ukraine airspace “to keep passengers and crew safe”.

The UK slapped sanctions Tuesday on five Russian banks and three billionaires, in what Johnson called “the first barrage” of measures in response to the Kremlin’s actions in Ukraine.

UK media reported early Thursday he would detail another round of measures in parliament later in the day.

Leading members of Johnson’s ruling Conservatives, as well as the main opposition Labour party, have urged him to hit the Kremlin as hard as possible with the new sanctions.

Cleverly vowed London would respond with “unprecedented” steps “to punish this aggression and to hopefully persuade the people around Vladimir Putin that this is completely the wrong thing to do, and that he should reverse this attack”.",https://www.channelstv.com/2022/02/24/uk-pm-chairs-crisis-meeting-after-russias-horrific-ukraine-attack/

Mr Putin accused the US and its allies of ignoring Russia’s demand to prevent Ukraine from joining Nato and offer Moscow security guarantees.

He said the Russian military operation aims to ensure a “demilitarisation” of Ukraine, adding that all Ukrainian servicemen who lay down arms will be able to safely leave the zone of combat.

Explosions could be heard in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv shortly after Mr Putin’s address, while explosions were also reported in the cities of Odesa and Kharkiv.

Ukraine’s border guard agency said the Russian military attacked the country from neighbouring Belarus.

The agency said that the Russian troops unleashed an artillery barrage as part of an attack backed by Belarus. They said the Ukrainian border guards were firing back, adding that there was no immediate report of casualties.

Defence Secretary Ben Wallace described Russia’s actions as “naked aggression against a democratic country” and said no one had been fooled by the Kremlin’s “false flags and fake narratives”.

Mr Biden said on Twitter: “President Zelenskyy reached out to me tonight and we just finished speaking. I condemned this unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces. I briefed him on the steps we are taking to rally international condemnation, including tonight at the UN Security Council.

“He asked me to call on the leaders of the world to speak out clearly against President Putin’s flagrant aggression, and to stand with the people of Ukraine.

“Tomorrow, I will be meeting with the Leaders of the G7, and the United States and our Allies and partners will be imposing severe sanctions on Russia. We will continue to provide support and assistance to Ukraine and the Ukrainian people.”

A British-Ukrainian student living in Kyiv said she woke up to the sounds of explosions on Thursday morning.

Valentina Butenko is studying politics at University College London, but returned to Ukraine a few weeks ago to offer help with the security crisis there.

“I woke up this morning to the sound of an explosion,” the 19-year-old, who has a British mother but was raised in Ukraine, told the PA news agency.

“I live on the outskirts of Kyiv so I expect it must have been pretty huge for me to hear it.

“Have been hearing explosions intermittently since 5am … the sky has lit up a few times although it seems to have calmed down slightly now.”

Ms Butenko said “a lot” of people are leaving the Ukrainian capital and roads out of the city are blocked, making it “impossible to get out”.",https://www.gbnews.uk/news/boris-johnson-to-chair-cobra-meeting-after-russia-attacks-ukraine/233838

Boris Johnson will announce details of new sanctions following Russian escalation

The Prime Minister is chairing a emergency Cobra meeting to decide the UK's next response to ""horrific attacks"" by Russia.

The Prime Minister said he was ""appalled"" by the launch of a full scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in the early hours of Thursday morning, with Russian forces advancing from Belarus in the north and Crimea in the south.

Johnson will hold an emergency Cobra meeting this morning before providing an update to the nation and then a statement to Parliament later today to set out the UK's response, which is expected to include a wave of tough new sanctions against President Putin and his allies.

Writing in a statement shortly after explosions were heard across Ukraine, including in the capital, Kyiv, Johnson said Putin had chosen ""a path of bloodshed and destruction"" and vowed the west would ""respond decisively"".

Johnson also held an early morning phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymry Zelensky in which he said the UK would ""not stand by as President Putin waged his campaign against the Ukrainian people"".

A Downing Street spokesperson added: ""The Prime Minister said he hoped Ukraine could resist and that Ukraine and its people were in the thoughts of everyone in the United Kingdom during this dark time.""

In a TV address broadcast shortly before the invasion, Putin warned the west not to ""interfere"".

""If you do, you will face consequences greater than any you have faced in history. All relevant decisions have been taken. I hope you hear me,"" he said.

The Russian action has prompted calls from Labour leader Keir Starmer for a much tougher package of sanctions against the regime, saying there could be ""no space for equivocation when faced with the evil that Putin has unleashed"".

""There will be dark days ahead. But Putin will learn the same lesson as Europe’s tyrants of the last century: that the resolve of the world is harder than he imagines and the desire for liberty burns stronger than ever. The light will prevail,"" he said.

""We must now match our rhetoric with action. We must urgently reinforce our NATO allies. The hardest possible sanctions must be taken against all those linked to Putin. The influence of Russian money must be extricated from the UK.""

Speaking on Thursday morning, Foreign Office minister James Cleverly said the UK would respond with ""unprecedented"" sanctions against Putin and vowed to ""punish this appalling decision"" to invade.

""Sadly, President Putin has been really clear in what he's trying to achieve. He is trying to recreate a Russian Empire in his mind, claim back places which he defines as Russia,"" he said.

""But the international community recognises that these are individual sovereign states.

""Ukraine is not part of Russia and the fantasy that Vladimir Putin is trying to play out in recreating some kind of czarist expansionist Russia absolutely has to be stopped.""

Conservative MP and chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee Tom Tugendhat warned the sanctions announced on Monday, which included measures against five Russian banks and three ""high-net worth"" individuals with close links to Putin did not go far enough to dissuade the Russian leader.

""I'm afraid weak sanctions like the ones that were imposed on Monday just encourage others to believe we are weak because we’re clearly not willing to do anything serious,"" he told the BBC's Today programme.

""It gave the suggestion or made clear that we weren’t wiling to do anything serious.""

He added: ""One of the reasons I was were given for leaving the European Union was that we could do independent sanctions. That's what I was told by the then Foreign Secretary [Boris Johnson] in 2018. Well let's see them.""

Responding to the Russian attack, US President said the west would respond in a decisive way to the ""unprovoked and unjustified attack"" by Russian military forces.

""President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a castastrophic loss of life and human suffering,"" he said.

""The world will hold Russia accountable.""

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also condemned Putin for ""bringing war back to Europe"" as she insisted the bloc would later announce details of a ""massive"" sanctions regime.

""We will weaken Russia's economic base and its capacity to modernise,"" she said on Thursday.

""These sanctions are designed to take a heavy toll on the Kremlin's interests and on their ability to finance the war.""

On Thursday morning, Mr Putin held a televised address to declare war on Ukraine, which he said was in response to threats made by the country.

Shortly afterwards explosions were heard in cities across Ukraine, including the capital Kyiv, and pictures showed red hot flames soar above the city and plumes of thick black smoke shot high in the air.

Explosions were also reported in the cities of Odesa and Kharkiv.

Eight people have been killed and nine wounded so far, Ukraine’s interior minister has said.

US President Joe Biden has denounced Russia’s actions as an “unprovoked and justified attack”.

She said: “We are facing an unprecedented act of aggression.

“Russian’s target is not only Donbas, the target is not only Ukraine, the target is the stability of Europe.”

The EU chief vowed to “hold President Putin accountable” and said Europe will continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine and its citizens.

Earlier on Thursday the president of the European Council, Charles Michel, also condemned Russia’s actions and called on Russia to “stop this war immediately”.

Mr Michel said he had spoken with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy as the Belgian condemned Russian’s “unjustified large scale military aggression” as well as expressing his solidarity with Ukraine.

“Today both the European Council and G7 leaders will meet to agree on further steps against Russia’s illegal acts and in support of Ukraine,” he tweeted.

“I call on President Putin to stop this war immediately.”

Mr Coveney said a “strong response” was needed from the international community.
