It came as Russian forces were closing in on the Ukrainian capital Kyiv and attacks across the country's main cities intensified seven days after the start of the invasion.

""Children, women and defence forces are losing their lives every hour,"" the Ukrainian emergency service said.

The mayor of the southern city of Kherson has said Russian troops are now in the streets and have forced their way into the council building.

Meanwhile, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court confirmed he would immediately open an investigation into possible war crimes committed in Ukraine, following a request to do so by 39 of the court's member states.

British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said earlier that the UK and 37 allies had ""referred atrocities in Ukraine"" to the court.

Earlier on Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed outrage after a Russian strike targeting a TV tower in Kyiv also caused damage to the nearby site of the Babi Yar Holocaust memorial.

Russia has also renewed its assault on Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, in a pounding that lit up the skyline with balls of fire above populated areas.

Despite the bombardment, Russia expects to discuss a ceasefire with Ukraine during the next round of peace talks in Belarus on Thursday morning, Russian news agencies citing Moscow's negotiator Vladimir Medinsky reported.

Today's main developments in the Ukraine crisis:

• Russia acknowledges hundreds of military casualties

• UN says at least 800,000 Ukrainians have fled their homes

• Boris Johnson accuses Putin of 'war crime'

• Opposition leader Navalny calls for daily protests

• Joe Biden closes US airspace to Russian aircraft

For the first time since the war began, Russia has admitted it has suffered casualties.

Russia's defence ministry said 498 of its troops have been killed in Ukraine, with 1,597 injured.

Those numbers are well short of those cited by Ukrainian officials, with a military adviser to Mr Zelenskyy saying that more than 7,000 Russian servicemen have been killed and hundreds have been taken prisoner.

What's happening in Kyiv?

Kyiv's mayor said Russia is gathering forces ""closer and closer"" to the Ukrainian capital after a long convoy of military vehicles stalled around 20 miles northwest of the city in the early hours of Wednesday.

Ukraine said it destroyed two Russian planes in an airborne battle over the capital.

Ukraine's air force said Ukrainian MIG-29 fighters fought two Russian planes in a battle over the region, destroying two planes and losing one fighter of their own.

Following damage to the Holocaust memorial in the capital, Mr Zelenskyy expressed concern that other historically significant and religious sites could be targeted and called on Jews around the world to protest the invasion.

""This is beyond humanity,"" Mr Zelensky, who is Jewish, said in a speech posted on Facebook. ""They have orders to erase our history, our country and all of us.""

Russia's defence ministry has urged Kyiv residents to flee, saying it would strike unspecified areas used by Ukraine's security services and communications.

But with a large convoy of Russian armoured vehicles approaching, a defiant mayor Vitali Klitschko said: ""We are preparing and will defend Kyiv! Kyiv stands and will stand.""

What's the situation in other key cities?

Russian troops have responded by shelling Kharkiv with heavy rocket launchers and air attacks after their advance on the city was stopped, a Ukrainian official has said.

""Kharkiv today is the Stalingrad of the 21st century,"" said Oleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to Mr Zelenskyy.

Oleg Sinehubov, head of the Kharkiv regional administration, said that over the past 24 hours, 21 people were killed and at least 112 were injured by Russians.

Explosions have thundered on Constitution Square, near the buildings of the City Council and the Palace of Labor.

A missile attack also destroyed the building of the regional police department in Kharkiv and the university building, which is located across the street.

Kharkiv, the country's second-largest city, has suffered some of the worst attacks from the air, including a paratrooper assault on a military hospital overnight.

Mr Arestovich said that several Russian planes have been shot down over Kharkiv.

Meanwhile, Russia claims to have seized the southern city of Kherson after taking the railway station and port overnight, although local authorities said it was still under their control.

If the Russian claim is true, it would be the largest city in Ukraine to fall so far.

Fighting is also escalating in the southeastern city of Mariupol, with its mayor saying Russian forces are ""actively preventing the evacuation of citizens"".

Elsewhere, at least four people, including a child, have been killed after homes were hit by a missile strike in the northwest city of Zhytomyr.

Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces are also attempting to keep Sumy, Lebedyn and Okhytrka surrounded, according to Ukrainian military sources.

And Russia also reportedly has naval forces in the Black Sea preparing a landing - and has cut off Ukrainian access to the Sea of Azov.

In a comment addressed to the Russian people, Mr Blinken also told a news conference the US knew many of them wanted nothing to do with Mr Putin's decision to invade Ukraine.

Schuetze', 'Michael Schwirtz']",2022-03-02 00:00:00,"BEIJING — On Wednesday night, the organizers of the Paralympic Winter Games were resolute that they had no option except to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete. On Thursday afternoon, they were equally resolute when they came to the opposite conclusion.

In a stunning reversal, the International Paralympic Committee bowed to heavy internal pressure and barred athletes from Russia and Belarus on the eve of the opening ceremony, extending the global sporting isolation of both countries in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine.

Citing threats by several federations to boycott the Paralympic Games, mounting discontent in the athletes’ village and fears that a “deteriorating” situation there could lead to violence, the International Paralympic Committee said the situation had changed so dramatically overnight that the viability of the Games would be in jeopardy if organizers did not expel the Russian and Belarusian delegations.

“The environment in the village is deteriorating,” said Andrew Parsons, the president of the I.P.C. He said rising anger and threats by multiple national committees, some under pressure from their governments, to withdraw from the Games had made the situation “untenable.”

Russia’s sports minister, Oleg Matytsin, told journalists in Moscow that the country was preparing an immediate appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland that would seek to overturn the exclusion of Russian athletes before the Games open.

“Today’s decision of the International Paralympic Committee to bar our team is a blatant violation of athletes’ rights and a manipulation of the Olympic Charter and human lives’ values in pursue of political goals,” Matytsin said, according to the state-run news agency TASS.

The announcement came less than a day after the committee had said it would allow athletes from both countries to compete as neutrals in Beijing, a response to the invasion that was widely criticized as inadequate. By Thursday morning, Paralympic officials met again and decided they had little choice but to throw out the two teams.

Parsons said that there had been no reports of confrontations or violence between athletes, but that tensions were rising. He said there was a “huge” concern for the safety of participants, including 71 Russians athletes.

“The village is not the place for fights,” Parsons said.

The move made the Paralympics the latest international sporting organization to bar Russian and Belarusian athletes and teams in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which was staged with Belarusian support. Sports like soccer, tennis, auto racing and figure skating already have barred Russian and Belarusian athletes since the International Olympic Committee took the extraordinary step this week of suggesting global federations and event organizers put in place a global ban on athletes from the two countries as a result of their actions in Ukraine.

The Russian and Belarusian Paralympic delegations — whose athletes initially had been cleared to compete if they agreed to do so without their national names, flags or anthems — could appeal the decision in court. But the Games are set to hold their opening ceremony on Friday, and their first events on Saturday.

Russia’s Paralympic committee criticized the reversal as “completely unfounded,” and said it unfairly portrayed the Russian committee and its Paralympic athletes “as the perpetrators of the current political conflicts.”

“In this regard, the R.P.C. considers the I.P.C.’s decision illegal and reserves the right to defend the rights and interests of Russian para athletes” in court, it said in a statement.

Athletes from both Ukraine and Russia practiced on Thursday, sometimes side by side, but Parsons said the I.P.C. now would work with the Russian and Belarusian delegations to get their teams home from China.

On Wednesday, Parsons had said the I.P.C. could not remove the athletes from Russia and Belarus because there was no specific mechanism to do so in the organization’s constitution; at the time, he said it was the I.P.C.’s “duty” to allow the Russians to participate.

On Thursday, he acknowledged that the legal situation had not changed, but that the situation on the ground had. The executive board, he argued, was equally bound to protect the viability of the Paralympic Games in the face of growing discontent. By Thursday, for example, teams in wheelchair curling and sled hockey had informed Paralympic officials that they would refuse to play against Russian opponents.

“The I.P.C. is a membership-based organization,” he said, “and we are receptive to the views of our member organizations.”

By then, Parsons said, a large number of members had reached out and urged the I.P.C. to reconsider its decision. Ukraine’s athletes released a statement voicing their disapproval, saying the claims of “political neutrality” from sports administrators were “a convenient lie used to deflect calls to stand up for human rights and peace.”

On Thursday, their team’s leader left no doubt about the country’s position. “Russia and Belarus must leave the Paralympic Games as soon as possible,” said Valerii Sushkevich, a member of Ukraine’s parliament and the president of the nation’s Paralympic committee.

Parsons, who had declared on Wednesday that the Russian and Belarussian athletes had a right to compete because they were not responsible for the invasion, expressed regret on Thursday that their dreams of competing at the Games would not be fulfilled.

“To the para athletes from the impacted countries, we are very sorry that you are affected by the decisions that your government took last week in breaching the Olympic truce,” he said. “You are victims of your government’s actions.”

The Games, though, will go ahead. The opening ceremony will take place in Beijing on Friday night, and competition begins Saturday in Alpine skiing, sled hockey, cross-country skiing and wheelchair curling.

Said Parsons: “We can at least preserve the experience for the around 600 athletes that are still competing here.”",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/03/02/world/ukraine-russia-war

Russia claims control of the strategic port city of Kherson, while Ukraine says battle ongoing.



Ukraine and Russia set to resume talks on Thursday aimed at stopping war.



Russia gives first casualty estimate.

Russia continued to pound major cities across Ukraine Wednesday, including the capital Kyiv and Kharkiv, while the status of another vital port, Kherson, a Black Sea shipbuilding city of nearly 300,000, remained unclear.

Ukraine denied Russia's claim earlier Wednesday that its forces had taken Kherson, saying that the battle for control was still underway.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's office said fighting was occurring around the strategic city, but the city's mayor, Igor Kolykhayev, said Russian troops were in the streets and had forced their way into the city council building.

Kolykhayev urged Russian soldiers not to shoot at civilians and publicly called on civilians to walk through the streets only in daylight and in ones and twos.

""We do not have the Armed Forces in the city, only civilians and people who want to live here!"" he said in a statement Wednesday.

In a video address released early Thursday in Ukraine, Zelensky didn't comment on whether the Russians have seized several cities, including Kherson.

""If they went somewhere, then only temporarily. We'll drive them out,"" he said.

Kherson is located on the banks of the Dnieper River near where it flows into the Black Sea. If Russian troops were to take the city, they could unblock a water canal and restore water supplies to the Crimean Peninsula.

The battle in the Kherson region began last Thursday, the first day of the invasion, and by the next day, the Russian forces were able to take a bridge that connects the city with territory on the western bank.

More than 1 million people have fled Ukraine following Russia's invasion, in the swiftest refugee exodus this century, the United Nations said Thursday. The tally the U.N. refugee agency released to The Associated Press was reached Wednesday and amounts to more than 2 per cent of Ukraine's population being forced out of the country in less than a week.

Meanwhile, a senior U.S. defence official said Wednesday that they have seen claims that the Russians have taken Kherson, but that the Ukrainian military is rejecting that claim.

""Our view is that Kherson is very much a contested city at this point,"" said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to make military assessments.

With fighting going on on multiple fronts across the country, Britain's Defence Ministry said Mariupol, a large city on the Azov Sea, was encircled by Russian forces.

Also in his videotaped address Thursday, Zelensky called on Ukrainians to keep up the resistance.

""We are a people who in a week have destroyed the plans of the enemy,"" he said. ""They will have no peace here. They will have no food. They will have here not one quiet moment.""

He said the fighting is taking a toll on the morale of Russian soldiers, who ""go into grocery stores and try to find something to eat.""

""These are not warriors of a superpower,"" he said. ""These are confused children who have been used.""

More talks scheduled

Earlier, most of the world lined up against Moscow in the United Nations to demand that it withdraw from Ukraine, as Russian forces renewed their bombardment of Kharkiv, the country's second-biggest city.

Russia continued to escalate its attacks on crowded urban centres, even as both sides were set to resume talks on Thursday aimed at stopping the new devastating war in Europe.

Envoys from Ukraine and Russia are expected to meet in Belarus, but there appeared to be little common ground between the two sides.

In a move that aimed to politically isolate Russia, the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday voted to demand that Russia stop its offensive and immediately withdraw all troops. The vote was 141 to five, with 35 abstentions. It came after the 193-member assembly convened its first emergency session since 1997.

Countries that voted against the resolution included Belarus, North Korea, Syria and Eritrea. The abstentions included China and India, as expected, but also two usual Russian allies, Cuba and Nicaragua. Assembly resolutions aren't legally binding, but they do have clout in reflecting international opinion.

Ramped-up rhetoric of nuclear war

Still, Russia ramped up its rhetoric, with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reminding the world about the country's vast nuclear arsenal. In an interview with Al-Jazeera, he said: ""A third world war will be nuclear, and devastating,"" according to Russian news sites.

The Pentagon announced in Washington that it is postponing a nuclear missile test launch scheduled for this week to avoid any possible misunderstanding in light of Putin's recent decision to put his nuclear forces on higher alert.

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said the decision to delay the test of a Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile was made by Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin.

""We wanted to make sure we were being very clear about our responsibilities in the nuclear realm,"" Kirby said at a Wednesday afternoon briefing. He said the delay is not affecting the U.S.'s strategic nuclear posture and that Austin is ""comfortable that the strategic deterrence posture that we have in place is up to the task of defending the homeland and our allies.""

The head of the UN nuclear watchdog agency warned that the fighting poses a danger to Ukraine's 15 nuclear reactors.

Rafael Grossi of the International Atomic Energy Agency noted that the war is ""the first time a military conflict is happening amid the facilities of a large, established nuclear power program,"" and he said he is ""gravely concerned.""

""When there is a conflict ongoing, there is of course a risk of attack or the possibility of an accidental hit,"" he said. Russia already has seized control of the decommissioned Chernobyl power plant, the scene in 1986 of the world's worst nuclear disaster.

On Wednesday, a Russian strike hit the regional police and intelligence headquarters in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city of about 1.5 million people. At least 21 people were killed and 112 injured over the past day, said Oleg Sinehubov, head of the Kharkiv regional administration.

A blast blew the roof off the five-storey police building and set the top floor alight, according to videos and photos released by the service. Pieces of the building were strewn across adjacent streets.

Several Russian planes were also shot down over Kharkiv, according to Oleksiy Arestovich, a top adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

""Kharkiv today is the Stalingrad of the 21st century,"" Arestovich said, invoking what is considered one of the most heroic moments in Russian history, the five-month defence of the city from the Nazis during the Second World War.

From his basement bunker, Kharkiv Mayor Igor Terekhov told the BBC: ""The city is united and we shall stand fast.""

The attack came a day after one in Kharkiv's central square that killed at least six people and shocked many Ukrainians for hitting at the centre of life in a major city.

In the south, Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying that city officials, ""cannot even take the wounded from the streets, from houses and apartments today, since the shelling does not stop.""

Zelensky tweeted that he spoke to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Wednesday, thanking him for the sanctions imposed on Russia so far, but reiterating the need for more.

Talked to <a href=""https://twitter.com/JustinTrudeau?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@JustinTrudeau</a>. Thanked him for the leadership in imposing anti-Russian sanctions. Stressed the need to expand restrictive measures. The bombing of civilians in Ukraine must be stopped immediately. —@ZelenskyyUa

The prime minister's office later said Trudeau expressed solidarity and further support to the people of Ukraine. It said Trudeau ""commended President Zelensky's outstanding bravery and front-line leadership, calling it inspirational for Canadians and people around the world,"" and that two leaders discussed ways Canada could continue to support Ukraine.

The overall death toll from the seven-day-old war is not clear.

On Wednesday, Russia put a figure on its casualties for the first time since the invasion began last week.

Russia's Defence Ministry said on Wednesday that 498 Russian soldiers had died in Ukraine and another 1,597 had been wounded since the beginning of Moscow's military operation there,

The ministry also said that more than 2,870 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed and about 3,700 wounded, according to Interfax. The numbers could not be independently verified. Ukraine insisted Russia's losses were far higher but did not immediately disclose its own casualties.

Earlier Wednesday, Ukraine's emergency service issued a statement saying the Russian invasion has killed more than 2,000 Ukrainian civilians and destroyed hundreds of structures including transport facilities, hospitals, kindergartens and homes.

Children, women and defence forces ""are losing their lives every hour,"" said the statement, which could not be independently verified.

A sprawling convoy of hundreds of Russian tanks and other vehicles advanced slowly on Kyiv, a city of nearly three million people.

Another Russian airstrike hit a residential area in the city of Zhytomyr. Ukraine's emergency services said Tuesday's strike killed at least two people, burned three homes and broke the windows in a nearby hospital. About 140 kilometres west of Kyiv, Zhytomyr is the home of the elite 95th Air Assault Brigade, which may have been the intended target.



In the north: Ukrainian UNIAN news agency quoted the health administration chief of the northern city of Chernihiv as saying two cruise missiles hit a hospital there. The hospital's main building suffered damage, Serhiy Pivovar said, and authorities were working to determine the casualty toll. No other information was immediately available.

Medical aid arriving

The World Health Organization said Wednesday that a shipment of medical aid for Ukraine is expected to arrive in Poland on Thursday.

Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's emergencies program, said Wednesday that ensuring health facilities have reliable access to oxygen supplies is critical, for both those who required it before the invasion and those who are being injured as a result of the fighting.

""You need it when you need it. You can't wait until tomorrow for oxygen,"" Ryan said. ""Oxygen saves your life, right now.""

The same is true for insulin, he said, noting that the shipments heading toward Ukraine are carrying supplies of the vital drug.

People are dying needlessly on the ground in Ukraine, Ryan said — but that situation will be even worse if medicines don't make it to health facilities quickly.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Ukraine's president have agreed on a call that sanctions need to go further to exert maximum pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin in coming days, a Downing Street spokesperson said on Wednesday.

The White House announced additional sanctions Wednesday against Russia and its ally Belarus, including extending export controls that target Russian oil refining and entities supporting the Russian and Belarusian military.

Among the new measures are sanctions targeting 22 Russia defence entities that make combat aircraft, infantry fighting vehicles, electronic warfare systems, missiles, and unmanned aerial vehicles for Russia's military.

Towns and villages in the path of the Russian advance have also been devastated. But it is the cities, which were home to about two-thirds of Ukraine’s 44 million people before the invasion, that are the focus of the Russian assault.

My friends are afraid even to go out for food because someone went to the store and had his legs blown off by an explosion after died. And the other guy survived only because his father covered him with his body from the explosion. Now the father is a hero, and the boy is an orphan.



News flow

These stories are similar to sketches for scary films or novels, they pour on me from everywhere. The frightened voice of my friend on the phone, the hysteria of my mother who does not want to leave her hometown. From news, broadcasts and chats. I've never read a news bulletin in my life every day, and now I read it every ten minutes. Because explosions are not important, well, you get used to them quickly.

What matters is whether everyone survived. And you look in which area the bomb fell and then check if everyone in this area is alive. You watch the news bulletin in the morning, barely waking up, in the evening, during lunch (if you don’t forget to eat lunch).

And all week I beg my relatives to leave Kharkiv, and they hold on to their houses and say: no, well, there will be no large-scale missile attack. It's impossible to shoot at peaceful people, Russians won't do it. But ""they"" do not know that someone else thinks of them humanely, and arrange new missile attacks on the city.

If on the first day of the war Russia fired at military infrastructure, periodically missing, from the second day they shamelessly attack peaceful areas. Not hiding. In places where for tens of kilometres there is nothing but houses. My mother needed a bomb in the house next door to believe that everything was really bad. Then she practically decided to go from Kharkiv. Due to the curfew, the departure was again postponed by a day. I felt that we were already a week late in making decisions. But the next day greater hell broke out.



Home

In the morning, while there were train tickets Kharkiv-Kyiv, my mother refused to go again. And then she agreed, but there were no tickets. And then I was looking for tickets for a long time. It could have been a comedy episode if it hadn't been a tragedy. It is very hard to leave your house behind knowing that it could be bombed at any moment. Leave relatives and friends who, for various reasons, cannot leave. I myself rarely think about the house in Kharkiv now, where I grew up. I am very worried about my grandfather, who refused to leave.

He still remembers as a child the 2nd World War and how he hid in the cellars from the fascist Nazi fighters. And here he is again, on stiff legs, forced to go down to the cellar from the new fascists from Russia. Now I try to think about it less often because I will break. But then I will definitely think a lot about these moments. Then I will surely miss home: my flowers and home trees, my carefully assembled library and collection of stones from mountain hikes, children's books and drawings. It was my haven for returning from rented apartments and long-distance travelling. And now it is being bombed by a ""Russian military ship"" which don’t want to go to the appointed address.

Volunteers

In addition to Grads, Iskanders, Kalibr and other artillery, fighter aircraft are still bombing us. They are afraid to fly over Kyiv, but they can easy bombard Kharkiv from the territory of Russia. Yesterday, in several runs, they shelled at residential areas of Kharkiv from fighters. Many people are dead, among them children. Some people in Kyiv and Kharkiv are living in the subway for several days: children are born there, news are discussed, they are looking for something to feed themselves and their pets. Volunteer chats are bursting with requests: “A 6-month-old baby, already an orphan, needs food fusion.

Please bring any! From this message alone, I could have gone into depression for a month in my past life. And now I'm scrolling through hundreds of these to find what I can do today. One day before writing this article, I can buy drugs for territorial defence. I leave early, the first 7 pharmacies on my way are closed. The city is empty, in some places, there are tank hedgehogs. There is no desire to ask for a lift of rare cars - what if there are disguised saboteurs there?

They were already changing into our military and police uniforms, bombing our soldiers from a tank with a white flag. Better to be careful and go on your own. The siren is howling, but I want to do something useful, and not tremble at home or in the basement with fear, so I continue to walk along the highway. Snowflakes are falling on my face. A week ago spring came to us, and then, as if looking back at the horrors around, left us. And now the corpses of the killed military men are bashfully covered in places by a snowball. I saw it in the photos, fortunately not alive. To my joy, these are Russian soldiers.

About death and revenge

Yes, this week I learned to enjoy someone else's death. It turned out to be very easy. When the houses of your parents and friends are bombed with such disgusting brutality, the fried corpses of enemies really begin to cause joy. Because another thousand of those doll-like bodies in the snow wouldn't do any harm for us. And this is very good. And I like that from today there would be no prisoners from people shooting us with heavy artillery and fighter planes.

Those killing tens and hundreds of people from far away deserve only death. In general, we are a very humane nation, many young Russian soldiers who have surrendered are now in captivity and are receiving medical assistance, they are treated well. You can watch a bunch of videos of them online. Of course, in Russia, these soldiers who surrendered, and the mountains of corpses of Russians, are not publicized. For this information in the ""great country"", people can even be put in jail for 15 years. For any ""unverified"" - read “true” - information for many many years in prison. I didn't care how a whole nation endures such treatment, as long as they didn't attack us. But now I care.

Europe did not hear us 8 years ago

I was hurt when Russia took away Crimea, where I spent my childhood, covering these ""military operations"" with women and children. Their fake referendum was our pain, and even more the pain of those who were forced to leave their homes. Because many Tatars and Ukrainians, all the patriots of their country, were declared ""terrorists"" and feared for their lives and their families.

Donbas, where there were not so many pro-Russian people, but decoy disguised Russians, who now, after 8 years, have finally changed the stripes on their chevrons and revealed their true face. It would be a relief, the end of a theatre, in which we did not initially believe, but the world community did. Believed for almost a decade. We have been at war for 8 years. But at 4 am on February 24, missile attacks on almost all major cities of Ukraine - this was something that even we did not expect. Now the Hague Tribunal has already begun an investigation about Russia’s guilt into the events in Ukraine since 2013. But if they had begun 9 years ago, then this war might not have happened.

2nd of March

And then March 2 came. And my mother, along with a crowd of women and children, was waiting for the train to leave Kharkiv at least to Kyiv, Lviv, or immediately to the border with Poland. And fighter jets flew in the sky bombarding the city. And it was not clear whether to wait for the train further or to rush into the shelter. At that moment they bombed another central square of the Constitution. The Palace of Labour was built back in 1916.

The residential area where mom just left. There, the bomb fell into garages 300 meters from the entrance to the house, into those garages from which they left an hour ago. And now crowds of women and children are standing in the cold wind, but not everyone will get on the train. Some people have to wait for the next one. Only women with children are accepted in this one. And those who bought a ticket ended up waiting 6 hours before departure.

At the same time, Russians began to shell Kyiv. A huge bomb could bring new destruction in residential areas, fortunately, it was shot down, but even the fragments that fell near the Kyiv railway station caused a lot of noise and stress. Shell at the station, where only women and children are below the deepest bottom. On our planet, the bottom of this level is somewhere on the other side of the globe and a couple more kiloparsecs into space.

Addressing his German counterpart, Bennett says, “We also have a responsibility to make sure that Iran does not have nuclear weapons, and that there will be no possibility of acquiring nuclear weapons — not on our watch, and never,” in line with Israel’s longstanding view of nuclear Iran as one of its greatest security threats.

“We are following with concern the talks in Vienna, and the possibility that an agreement will be signed that will allow Iran to install centrifuges on a large scale within a few years is not acceptable to us.”

Regarding the war in Ukraine, Bennett expresses support for civilians, but does not address military aid, requests for which Israel has previously denied.

“Israel stands by the Ukrainian people,” Bennett says, noting that Israel on Monday and Tuesday sent 100 tons of humanitarian aid to Ukraine. “We are dedicated to continue [supporting the Ukrainian people] and to do more.”

However, Bennett declined to respond to questions regarding whether Israel would change its decision not to send military aid to Ukraine.

Israel is walking a tightrope in its policy toward Ukraine, professing support for Ukraine while endeavoring to maintain good relations with Russia, which has a military presence in Israel’s northern neighbor Syria.

Focusing on the German-Israeli relationship, Bennett says he and Scholz are forging new partnerships, in addition to thanking Scholz for insisting on their visit to Yad Vashem earlier in the day.

“I’m happy to report that today the chancellor and I agreed upon the creation of new strategic cooperation between Germany and the State of Israel,” says Bennett. “It’s the format of a dialogue that will happen twice a year, on security and state issues.”

Despite Scholz’s short visit, Bennett says that the chancellor “insisted that the visit to Yad Vashem would [happen in full]. And I could see that your mind was there as well as your heart.”

Russian missile debris fell near Kyiv’s central train station on Wednesday night, damaging a major heating pipeline, with the blast wave breaking the station’s windows. Thousands of civilians, particularly women and children, are sheltering in the station at night as they await evacuation trains to western Ukraine. Ukrainian officials said the missile was shot down by Kyiv’s air defenses.

In the southern part of the country, Russian forces have gained a swath of land and have entered the Black Sea port city of Kherson.

For the first time, Russia’s Defense Ministry acknowledged extensive losses in the seven days of war, saying that 498 Russian troops have been killed and 1,597 injured. Moscow said its forces killed 2,870 Ukrainian soldiers.

Ukraine hasn’t released its casualties, but says its military has killed 5,840 Russian troops. Ukrainian officials have put the invasion’s civilian death toll at about 2,000.

Kharkiv residents said the city of 1.4 million people suffered heavy bombardment for the third day in a row, including airstrikes that hit residential areas and civilian infrastructure. Kharkiv’s municipal and police headquarters, as well as the nearby university building, were severely damaged and caught fire. Local authorities reported 21 dead and 112 injured in the past 24 hours. Moscow says it isn’t targeting civilians.

Russian forces also attempted to seize the city’s military hospital, local authorities said. However, the front line held and the city, located 30 miles from the Russian border, remained under firm Ukrainian control.

“We have understood their tactic: They can’t enter the city because every time they try, we hit them in the teeth,” Kharkiv’s deputy governor, Roman Semenukha, said on Ukrainian TV. “So, instead, they are trying to sow panic with missile strikes, hitting critical infrastructure and residential areas, trying to demoralize us.”

Kyiv, too, was hit by several strikes on Wednesday night.

Russia’s war on Ukraine has now ended its first week with few signs that Moscow is closing in on Russian President

Vladimir Putin’s

goal of ousting the country’s elected government and ending its alignment with the West.

With the exception of a Russian advance north of Crimea, Ukrainian defenses are holding in all major urban areas under attack. The Russian attempt to quickly seize Kyiv and topple the Ukrainian leadership has stalled amid fierce resistance, low morale and logistical difficulties, Western and Ukrainian military officials said.

Ukrainian and Russian officials were slated to hold a second round of cease-fire talks near the Polish border in Belarus on Thursday. The previous round, on Monday, didn’t achieve concrete results and was followed by an intensification of Russian bombing and shelling.

Ukrainian soldiers advanced toward the frontline Wednesday through a broken bridge on the outskirts of Kyiv.

In the past seven days, one million people in Ukraine have fled to neighboring countries, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees

Filippo Grandi

said on Twitter. Mr. Grandi has previously estimated that up to 4 million refugees could flee from the fighting.

The U.N. General Assembly voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, in a largely symbolic rebuke to Mr. Putin and his supporters that is unlikely to alter the course of the war. U.N. members voted, 141-5, to condemn Russia’s military operation and affirm that no territorial gains stemming from the use of force—or threatened use of force—will be recognized as legal there. Thirty-four countries including China and India abstained from the vote. Russia, Belarus, North Korea, Syria and Eritrea condemned the resolution as a hypocritical signal from the West.

Washington, meanwhile, announced another wave of economic penalties against Russia, including export controls aimed at the country’s oil-and-gas industry, and launched a new task force to target the assets of Russian oligarchs. Secretary of State

Antony Blinken

leaves Thursday for a six-day trip to Belgium, Poland, Moldova and the Baltic states to coordinate the continued international response to Russia’s attack.

French President

Emmanuel Macron

pledged Wednesday to increase his country’s defense spending. “Europe must now accept the price for peace, freedom and democracy,” Mr. Macron said in a televised national address.

The large Russian force moving from Belarus northwest of Kyiv was held and repelled by Ukrainian forces in towns like Bucha, where the central street was littered with burned-out Russian military vehicles. On Wednesday, units of Ukrainian troops cautiously walked on the rubble of a blown-up bridge on a main road from Kyiv as they headed toward Bucha, carrying sniper rifles, heavy machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades. Only a handful of artillery rounds could be heard over a half-hour.

“The Russians thought they could break through and be in Kyiv in a couple of days. They didn’t realize that we have learned how to wage war in the past eight years,” said a Ukrainian colonel at the site. “Now they sit there, hungry, without fuel, demoralized, and we just come in every little while and pop them off. And every day, we are pushing them back.”

Ukrainian forces on the bridge leading to Bucha were allowing civilians to cross, carefully checking their documents and belongings to screen out potential Russian infiltrators.

Russian forces, however, continued to attempt pushing west and southwest of Kyiv, trying to take the town of Fastiv and come closer to the vital highway leading south to Odessa, the Ukrainian military said. On Wednesday night, the Ukrainian military said its counteroffensive recaptured the strategic town of Makariv, which sits astride the highway between Kyiv and the western city of Lviv.

Oleksii Reznikov

said that in recent days Ukraine had received and deployed a new batch of the Bayraktars, and was receiving other critical weaponry from Europe.

“We have become the front line of the free world,” Mr. Reznikov said.

The Ukrainian military said Wednesday it shot down two Russian Su-35S jet fighters and lost one of its own MiG-29 jets. “For now, the enemy has an advantage in the quantity and quality of its aircraft and weapons, but not in its skills,” Ukraine’s general staff said.

Russia’s main successes in the campaign were in the south of Ukraine, where forces spreading north from Crimea, a Ukrainian peninsula that Russia annexed in 2014, have reached Kherson in the west, Mariupol in the east and Enerhodar further north.

While Mariupol and Enerhodar remain in Ukrainian hands, Russian forces have entered Kherson, where Ukrainian resistance continues. Kherson Gov. Hennadiy Lahuta said on social media that the city was completely surrounded, and asked for a humanitarian corridor to supply civilians with food and other basic necessities.

Russia said it is ready to provide such humanitarian corridors to Ukrainian cities, including Mariupol, Kharkiv and Kyiv.

In smaller Ukrainian towns that have been seized by Russia, such as Kupyansk, Melitopol and Berdyansk, unarmed protests against occupation forces began. Residents coming to the streets with Ukraine’s blue-and-yellow flags tried to stop the movement of Russian military columns.

In Kharkiv, residents say the city is running low on food. Shops are barely functioning. Some districts reported water, heating and electricity outages.

“I have the impression that Russia wants to wipe the city off the face of the earth,” said Oleksandr Skoryk, who owns a meat company based in a district in Kharkiv’s east.

The defense of the city is led by the Ukrainian army, along with several volunteer militias including nationalist groups and one made up of soccer fans.

“There are fights in the city. Russian warplanes are constantly bombing residential districts,” said Heorhiy Tarasenko, a Kharkiv resident and volunteer fighter. “Russia is taking big losses and doesn’t want to fight with the army but with civilians.”

Andriy Ivanov, a Kharkiv resident and city councilor who is helping evacuate children, women and the elderly, said many people were trying to leave the city in trains and cars, mostly heading for cities that have had less fighting, such as Dnipro to the south.

The mayor of Konotop—a northern Ukrainian city about halfway between Kharkiv and Kyiv that has experienced heavy fighting—told residents he had been given an ultimatum by Russian forces to surrender or face an artillery barrage. A video captured Mayor Artem Semenikhin asking a crowd, “Who is in favor of fighting?”

“Of course,” one man yelled, then the rest of a crowd of dozens shouted their agreement.

“Let’s evacuate the women and children, then fight,” another man said.

Hundreds of residents of the southern city of Enerhodar, home to Europe’s biggest nuclear power station and six of Ukraine’s 15 operational nuclear reactors, blocked the road to the city as Russian troops approached.

A video posted online by the city’s mayor showed hundreds of people, many of them waving Ukrainian flags, gathered behind several barricades made of sandbags, trucks and wrecked cars.

A video from a strike that hit a residential district of Kharkiv on Tuesday showed two dead civilians, including one with his face mangled and pinned down by a tree branch. Several people wandered dazed amid rubble and burning buildings.

Mr. Skoryk said his district was hit by a rocket attack Tuesday that destroyed a supermarket. His company isn’t working, but he is emptying his warehouses of meat, handing it out on the streets and trying to deliver it to hospitals and orphanages.

“The whole city has come together as one to help each other,” said the 46-year-old. “Soldiers are defending us. We’ll fight to the end. No one will take Kharkiv.”

A local militia member helped a fleeing family across a destroyed bridge on the outskirts of Kyiv on Wednesday.

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s office told The Associated Press on Wednesday night that it was a missile strike.

Officials said it wasn’t immediately clear how damaging the strike was, whether there were any casualties or where exactly the missile hit.

The Southern Railway station is one of two stations that make up the main passenger rail complex that thousands have used to flee the war over the past week. The two stations are connected by an overhead corridor that crosses over about a dozen tracks.

The stations are about 2 miles from Maidan Nezalezhnosti, the square that was the site of huge protests in 2014 and 2004.

More developments on the Russia-Ukraine war:

WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken this week will visit six European countries, including the Baltic states and Moldova, which are on particular edge as Russia intensifies its war in Ukraine.

The State Department says Blinken will travel Thursday to Belgium for a meeting of NATO foreign ministers before heading to the Polish border with Ukraine to meet refugees, and then Moldova, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.

Poland and the three Baltics are members of NATO and fall under its Article 5 defense provisions, which means the allies are bound to defend them if they are attacked. Given their location immediately adjacent to Russia, they are believed to be at special risk should the Ukraine conflict spread.

Western-leaning Moldova is not a NATO member but has relations with the alliance and has long objected to the presence of Russian troops in the disputed territory of Transnistria.

As the Russian invasion of Ukraine has picked up steam, most NATO members, including the Baltics, have steadily increased military and financial assistance to Kyiv even as Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned of reprisals for any nation that interferes in what he calls a “special military operation.” Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has decried Russia’s escalation of attacks on crowded cities as a blatant terror campaign.

WARSAW, Poland — An international organization made up only of democracies held an emergency meeting on Wednesday following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The Warsaw-based Community of Democracies said in a statement that its members at the gathering “condemned Russia’s aggression and backed Ukraine’s sovereignty, territorial integrity, and democratic aspirations of its people.”

Romania’s Foreign Minister Bogdan Aurescu, whose country holds the community’s rotating presidency, called for continued support for Ukraine’s right to choose its own foreign policy and for more attention to be given to other places facing Russian pressure, including Moldova, Georgia and the Western Balkan region.

“This seems to be the beginning of the most difficult period in generations. And this is the fight of our generation and a real test on our democracies,” Aurescu said.

Thomas Garrett, the organization’s secretary general, “underlined that democracies worldwide must unequivocally show they stand with Ukraine.”

A Ukrainian lawmaker in Kyiv addressed the political representatives. She called on Russia to “stop bombing our towns and cities” and appealed to the U.N., E.U., and other international organizations to help Ukraine obtain a ceasefire for humanitarian relief. The lawmaker was not identified for security reasons.

WASHINGTON — A senior U.S. defense official says the Russian convoy still appears to be stalled outside the city center of Kyiv, and has made no real progress in the last couple days.

The official on Wednesday said the convoy is still plagued with fuel and food shortages and logistical problems, as well as facing continued fierce resistance from Ukrainians.

He said there has been an increase in the number of missiles and artillery targeting the city, suggesting the Russians are trying to make a more aggressive move to try and take the city.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military assessments, said Russians have not been able to achieve air superiority and Ukrainian air defenses remain operable and their aircraft continue to fly.

The official said that about 82% of the Russian troops that had been arrayed around Ukraine are now inside the country — just a slight uptick over the last 24 hours, and that Russia has launched more than 450 missiles at various targets in the country.

In other areas of the country, the U.S. official said that the U.S. is seeing preliminary indications that Russian forces are going to try to move south towards Mariupol from Donetsk, in what appears to be an effort to encircle the city.

BRUSSELS — European Union finance ministers on Wednesday convened for the second time in less than a week to weigh the likely impact on Europe of the full-scale Russian military assault on Ukraine, a country that borders the bloc’s eastern flank.

Policymakers are scrambling to recalculate economic projections made less than a month ago, when the European Commission — the EU’s executive arm — predicted the bloc’s economic growth would slow from 5.3% last year to 4% this year and 2.8% in 2023.

Top European commissioners said on Wednesday those figures are too optimistic because the conflict in Ukraine will probably stoke rises in energy prices, financial-market turbulence, supply-chain bottlenecks and a weakening of consumer confidence.

“We don’t expect the recovery to be derailed completely but to be weakened,” said European Commissioner for Economy Paolo Gentiloni.

The gloomier outlook has also raised the prospect of a prolonged period of unrestrained spending by member countries to support their economies.

ZAHONY, Hungary — Some of the nearly 1 million people who have fled Russia’s devastating war in Ukraine in recent days count among society’s most vulnerable, unable to make the decision on their own to flee and requiring careful assistance to make the journey to safety.

At the train station in the Hungarian town of Zahony on Wednesday, more than 200 young Ukrainians with disabilities — residents of two orphanages in Ukraine’s capital of Kyiv — disembarked into the cold wind of the train platform after an arduous escape from the violence gripping Ukraine.

The refugees, most of them children with mental and physical disabilities, were evacuated from their care facilities once the Russian assault on the capital intensified.

“It wasn’t safe to stay there, there were rockets, they were shooting at Kyiv,” said Larissa Leonidovna, the director of the Svyatoshinksy orphanage in Kyiv. “We spent more than an hour underground during a bombing.”

The U.N. refugee agency says more than 874,000 people have fled Ukraine since Russia’s invasion last week and the figure is “rising exponentially,” putting it on track to cross the 1 million mark on Wednesday.

Moving from the train in groups of 30, the children — also from the Darnytskyy orphanage in Kyiv — were escorted to buses waiting to take them to Opole, Poland, where they would be settled and receive further care

WASHINGTON — The White House has announced additional sanctions against Russia and its ally Belarus, including extending export controls that target Russian oil refining and entities supporting the Russian and Belarusian militaries.

Among Wednesday’s new measures are sanctions targeting 22 Russia defense entities that make combat aircraft, infantry fighting vehicles, electronic warfare systems, missiles, and unmanned aerial vehicles for Russia’s military.

The U.S. Commerce Department also announced additional export controls on oil and gas extraction equipment that would hurt Russia’s refining capacity over the long term.

The Biden administration, and Western allies, have largely stayed away from hitting the Russian energy sector to avoid causing tremors to the global supply of energy. The White House, however, said in a statement that U.S. and allies “share a strong interest in degrading Russia’s status as a leading energy supplier over time.”

The latest sanctions imposed on Wednesday include the U.S. closing off its air space to all Russian flights. President Joe Biden previewed that he would making the move in his State of the Union address on Tuesday evening.

JERUSALEM — Israel’s prime minister spoke by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin, shortly after a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Israeil officials said.

Prime Minister Naftali Bennett’s office confirmed that the calls with the Russian and Ukrainian leaders took place but provided no further details.

Israel has close relations with both countries and has acted as an intermediary between the two countries.

Israeli media reported that that Zelenskyy repeated Ukraine’s request for Israeli military equipment, but that Bennett said Israel wouldn’t give Ukraine anything that could potentially be used by the military. Bennett’s office did not respond to requests for comment.

Earlier in the day, Zelenskyy’s official Facebook page posted a Hebrew translation of his remarks, in which he called on “all Jews of the world” not to remain silent about Russia’s invasion.

Israel has largely refrained from taking actions to anger Moscow, in part because it relies on Russia for security coordination in neighboring Syria, where Russia maintains a military presence supporting President Bashar Assad, and where Israel frequently carries out airstrikes targeting Iranian forces and their Lebanese proxies.

Israel has denounced Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but has also offered to act as broker for cease-fire talks.

In addition, Israel’s Foreign Ministry says it is weighing sending additional humanitarian aid to Ukraine, after having dispatched 100 tons of supplies this week. It says it is also evaluating the possibility of setting up a field hospital in Ukraine.

LONDON — With the threat of financial sanctions looming, Chelsea’s Russian owner Roman Abramovich confirmed Wednesday he is trying to sell the Premier League club he turned into an elite trophy-winning machine with his lavish investment.

The speed of Abramovich’s pending exit from Chelsea is striking as he was trying to instigate a plan this past weekend to relinquish some control in order to keep the club under his ownership.

But as Russia’s war on Ukraine entered a seventh day, pressure was growing on the British government to include him among the wealthy Russians to be targeted in sanctions.

“In the current situation, I have therefore taken the decision to sell the club, as I believe this is in the best interest of the club, the fans, the employees, as well as the club’s sponsors and partners,” Abramovich said in a statement.

Abramovich said he will not be asking to be repaid 1.5 billion pounds ($2 billion) in loans he has granted the club during 19 years of injecting cash to elevate the team into one of the most successful in Europe.

“I have instructed my team to set up a charitable foundation where all net proceeds from the sale will be donated,” he said. “The foundation will be for the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine.”

THE HAGUE, Netherlands — A pretrial panel of International Criminal Court judges has been assigned to evaluate an upcoming request to open an investigation into alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine.

The court took the procedural step Wednesday to be ready when Prosecutor Karim Khan files the request.

He announced his intention on Monday to launch an investigation dating back to 2013 but also including “any new alleged crimes falling within the jurisdiction of my office that are committed by any party to the conflict” that erupted following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

There have been widespread reports of Russian military strikes killing civilians in Ukraine.

The court says in a statement that the pretrial chamber “will have to consider whether there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation, upon examination of the Prosecutor’s request and the supporting material.”

Canada and Lithuania have both said they plan to ask him to investigate alleged crimes in Ukraine. If they do, Khan can open an investigation without first seeking approval from judges.

“As far as I know, the Ukrainian delegation has already departed from Kyiv, is en route ... We’re expecting them tomorrow,” Vladimir Medinsky, the head of the Russian delegation, told reporters Wednesday evening

According to Medinsky, the two sides agreed on the Brest region of Belarus, which borders Poland, as the site of the talks.

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s office confirmed to The Associated Press that the delegation is on its way, but gave no details on the time of the arrival.

NEW DELHI — India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin for the second time in the past week as Moscow intensified its invasion of Ukraine.

Putin and Modi on Wednesday reviewed the situation in Ukraine, especially in the city of Kharkiv where many Indian students are stuck, according to a statement from Arindam Bagchi, India’s External Affairs Ministry spokesperson. They discussed the safe evacuation of the Indian nationals from the conflict areas, Bagchi said.

The telephone conversation between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Putin came as the U.N. General Assembly approved a resolution demanding that Russia stop war in Ukraine and withdraw all troops.

India last week had abstained from voting on a U.N. Security Council resolution demanding that Russia cease its invasion of Ukraine. Russia vetoed the resolution while China and the United Arab Emirates also abstained.

Earlier in the day, India asked all its nationals to leave Ukraine’s second largest city of Kharkiv by Wednesday evening based on information received from Russia.

Bagchi also said nearly 17,000 Indian nationals, mostly students, out of an estimated 20,000, have left Ukraine. India is trying to evacuate the rest to nearby countries.

TIRANA, Albania —The Albanian Football Federation has denounced Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and will offer shelter to Ukrainian players’ families.

The federation passed a resolution at its assembly on Wednesday in support of the Ukrainian people.

“Stop to military violence and occupation! Stop to the war that brings only destruction and victims! Respect to Ukraine’s sovereignty!” said that resolution.

The federation is in contact with its Ukraine’s counterpart to offer shelter to some players’ families “in a sign of human support and solidarity.”

A few days earlier Albania’s government joined the wave of European opposition to playing any sports games against Russia following the invasion of Ukraine.

Albania is among the few national teams in men’s soccer with games scheduled against Russia in official competitions.

Albania was due to host Russia in Tirana on June 2 in the group stage of the UEFA Nations League competition.

MOSCOW — The spokesman of the Russian Defense Ministry says 498 Russian troops have been killed in Ukraine and 1,597 more sustained wounds.

Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov on Wednesday rejected reports about “incalculable losses” of the Russians as “disinformation.” It was the first time Russia has addressed the number of military casualties in Ukraine since the start of the invasion last Thursday. He assured that families of those killed are receiving all necessary assistance.

Konashenkov also said that neither conscripts, nor cadets have been involved in the operation in Ukraine, dismissing media reports alleging otherwise.

Konashenkov also said more than 2,870 Ukrainian troops have been killed and some 3,700 more sustained injuries, while 572 others have been captured by the Russians. Ukrainian officials have not yet commented on the claim and it could not be immediately verified.

PARIS — France’s National Center for Scientific Research, a huge state-run network of scientists across the country, is suspending all new collaboration with Russian counterparts.

In its announcement Wednesday, the CNRS, as it is known, strongly condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

“It is unacceptable that in the 21st century such a conflict could see the light of day within Europe,” a statement said.

It acknowledged that its own move was exceptional because “science has no borders,” but added that shared scientific values “cannot tolerate this war.”

The CNRS praised the courage of “several hundred” Russian scientists who have spoken out against their country’s aggression. It assured that Russian scientists currently working in its labs can continue their activities.

The CNRS said it is ready to take in Ukrainian researchers under the Pause program which provides emergency funds from the Ministry of Higher Education to help Ukrainian scientists in danger.

SOFIA, Bulgaria — Bulgaria’s foreign ministry says two Russian diplomats accused of spying by Bulgarian prosecutors will be expelled from the country.

An official note in which Bulgaria declares the two diplomats “persona non grata” was handed to the Russian Embassy. They have been given 48 hours to leave the country.

Earlier on Wednesday, the prosecution announced that a pre-trial investigation established that they allegedly had carried out “unregulated intelligence activities, incompatible with their diplomatic status.” It added that the suspects could not be charged with espionage because of their diplomatic immunity.

The prosecution said also a Bulgarian army retired general has been taken into custody and faces charges of espionage. He is accused that as a Defense Ministry employee he had passed NATO-related classified information to Russian diplomats.

Bulgaria, Moscow’s closest ally during the Cold War, has expelled nine Russian diplomats for suspected spying over the last couple of years.

UNITED NATIONS — The U.N. General Assembly voted Wednesday to demand that Russia stop its offensive in Ukraine and withdraw all troops, with nations from world powers to tiny island states condemning Moscow’s actions.

The vote was 141 to 5, with 35 abstentions. It came after the 193-member assembly convened its first emergency session since 1997.

Assembly resolutions aren’t legally binding, but they do have clout in reflecting international opinion. A Russian veto sank a similar resolution in the more powerful U.N. Security Council on Friday, but the assembly allows no vetoes. Under special emergency session rules, a resolution needs approval of two-thirds of those countries voting, and abstentions don’t count.

More than 90 countries co-sponsored the assembly resolution. It deplored Russia’s “aggression” against Ukraine “in the strongest terms” and demanded an immediate halt to Moscow’s use of force and the immediate, complete and unconditional withdrawal of all Russian forces from Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders. The measure also called on Russia to reverse a decision to recognize two separatist parts of eastern Ukraine as independent.

GENEVA — A top Ukrainian diplomat received a standing ovation from diplomats after a heartfelt speech Wednesday to the U.N.’s top human rights body, calling on the Human Rights Council to help hold Russia’s government accountable by creating a panel of experts to scrutinize the invasion of Ukraine.

Speaking by video from Kyiv, Emine Dzhaparova, Ukraine’s first deputy minister of foreign affairs, described being awoken by the sound of an explosion on Feb. 24 as the invasion began. She said her government was “fully operational” and lashed out at “false claims” by Russian President Vladimir Putin that Ukraine was committing “genocide.”

“Do you know how Russia treats and deals with genocide in Ukraine? By airstrikes using cruise and operational tactical missiles, tanks and artillery, reconnaissance groups and sabotage groups,” she said. “Ukrainian babies are born in the bomb shelters in bunkers … As we speak here today, Russian armed forces keep attacking maternity wards, kindergartens, orphanages, hospitals.”

Dzhaparova noted an “urgent debate” at the council about the situation in Ukraine, calling for countries in the 47-member-state body’s to set up a Commission of Inquiry – the council’s most powerful tool to scrutinize human rights violations and abuses.

GORENKA, Ukraine — Amid the sounds of shelling, Ukrainian reservists — some wearing civilian clothes and carrying rifles — have set up checkpoints in the road to stop vehicles.

Andrey Goncharuk, 68, is a pensioner who said there might be good people among those invading Ukraine but that doesn’t matter to him because they weren’t invited.

“They have come to kill my people,” he said. He said he was prepared to take weapons from enemies killed in combat. “In my old age, I had to take up arms. I have this rifle. We will try to get (more) weapons even if they don’t bring them to us. We’ll do it ourselves. We’ll kill (the) enemy and take their weapons,” he said.

KHARKIV, Ukraine — A Ukrainian official says the advance of Russian troops in Kharkiv has been stopped, but that Russians have responded by shelling the city with heavy rocket launchers and air attacks.

“Kharkiv today is the Stalingrad of the 21st century,” said Oleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Oleg Sinehubov, head of the Kharkiv regional administration, said that over the past 24 hours 21 people were killed and at least 112 were injured by Russians.

Explosions on Wednesday thundered on Constitution Square, near the buildings of the City Council and the Palace of Labor. A missile attack also destroyed the building of the regional police department in Kharkiv and the university building, which is located across the street.

Arestovich said that several Russian planes were shot down over Kharkiv.

The Russians used Iskander missile systems to bombard Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Kharkiv and Chernihiv.

Arestovich said Iskander missile systems can deviate from their target, making them “a danger to civilian objects.”

LONDON — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has accused President Vladimir Putin of committing war crimes in Ukraine.

Johnson told lawmakers on Wednesday: “What we have seen already from Vladimir Putin’s regime in the use of the munitions that they have already been dropping on innocent civilians, in my view, already fully qualifies as a war crime.”

When asked about Russian attacks on the Babi Yar holocaust memorial in Kyiv and targeting of apartment blocks, Johnson’s spokesman said that “no one can be in any doubt that what we’re seeing daily, almost hourly now, are horrific acts that would certainly appear to be war crimes.”

The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court said Monday that he plans to open an investigation “as rapidly as possible” into possible war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine.

BRUSSELS — The European Union has slapped 22 more Belarus officials with sanctions and is slated to impose additional sanctions on Russia’s ally for its involvement in the invasion of Ukraine.

The EU already punished 20 Belarus officials last week when it imposed unprecedented sanctions on Russia itself. Now 22 more have been added.

The EU is set to expand economic sanctions either later Wednesday or Thursday.

The 27 nation bloc has sanctioned some 200 Belarus officials over the past years linked to what it saw were fraudulent elections to keep authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko in office two years ago and added more sanctions last June when a passenger jet was diverted to arrest a dissident journalist.",https://www.tampabay.com/news/nation-world/2022/03/02/ukraine-latest-un-says-ukraine-refugee-surge-will-soon-hit-1-million/
8,e4f2c3f2-7f99-4863-907e-1db791515730,['Agence France Presse'],2022-03-02 23:52:56+00:00,"Kyiv (AFP), Mar 2 – The United States raised the alarm Wednesday over the “staggering” human cost of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, as the apparent deployment of cluster bombs and other treaty-violating weapons raised fears of a brutal escalation in the week-old conflict.

The American warnings came as Russia revealed 498 of its troops had been killed in the assault on ex-Soviet Ukraine — the first official death toll it has given and one Kyiv says is by far an undercount.

And they came on the eve of the resumption of ceasefire talks after a first round Monday failed to produce a breakthrough.

On the ground in Ukraine, Russia appeared despite determined resistance to be intensifying the offensive ordered seven days earlier by President Vladimir Putin — in defiance of almost the entire international community.

“Today was the hardest, cruellest of the seven days of this war,” said Vadym Boychenko, the mayor of the key southeastern port of Mariupol who said Russian forces pummelled the city for hours and were attempting to block civilians from leaving.

“Today they just wanted to destroy us all,” he said in a video on Telegram, accusing Russian forces of shooting at residential buildings.

Boychenko said more of the city’s vital infrastructure was damaged in the assault, leaving people without light, water or heating.

In Washington, top US diplomat Antony Blinken warned the human costs were already “staggering,” accusing Russia of attacking places that “aren’t military targets.”

“Hundreds if not thousands of civilians have been killed or wounded,” said the secretary of state, who will travel to eastern Europe next week to shore up support for Ukraine — and for efforts to secure a ceasefire.

Kyiv is sending a delegation to the Thursday ceasefire talks, at an undisclosed location on the Belarus-Poland border, but has warned it would not accept “ultimatums.”

– UN rebuke –

At the United Nations, the General Assembly overwhelmingly adopted a resolution Wednesday that “demands” Russia “immediately” withdraw from Ukraine, in a powerful rebuke of Moscow by a vast majority of the world’s nations.

After more than two days of extraordinary debate, which saw the Ukrainian envoy accuse Russia of genocide, 141 out of 193 member states backed the non-binding resolution — with only Eritrea, North Korea, Syria and Belarus joining Russia against.

At least 350 civilians including 14 children have so far been killed, Ukrainian authorities say, and hundreds of thousands have fled the country since the invasion began, triggering punishing Western sanctions intended to cripple Russia’s economy.

The UN rights office, OHCHR, said it had registered 752 civilian casualties including 227 deaths — but believes the reality is “considerably higher.”

“The humanitarian consequences will only grow in the days ahead,” Blinken warned.

At the UN, the US ambassador echoed Blinken’s alarm about mounting civilian deaths — accusing Moscow of moving cluster munitions and other arms banned under international conventions into its neighbour.

“It appears Russia is preparing to increase the brutality of its campaign against Ukraine,” Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the General Assembly.

Russia said Wednesday it had captured the Black Sea port of Kherson, population 290,000, though the claim was not confirmed by mayor Igor Nikolayev who appealed online for permission to transport the dead and wounded out of the city and for food and medicine to be allowed in.

“Without all this, the city will die,” he wrote.

AFP witnessed the aftermath of apparent Russian bombing on a market and a residential area in Zhytomyr in central Ukraine, and in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second biggest city.

“There is nowhere in Kharkiv where shells have not yet struck,” said Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister, after Russian airborne troops landed in the city before dawn.

Shelling in the northeastern city of 1.4 million a day earlier drew comparisons to the massacres of civilians in Sarajevo in the 1990s.

– ‘Erase us all’ –

As Russian artillery massed outside Kyiv, the former champion boxer turned city mayor Vitali Klitschko vowed to stand strong.

“The enemy is drawing up forces closer to the capital,” he said. “Kyiv is holding and will hold. We are going to fight.”

Residents have been hunkered down in Kyiv for a week and dozens of families were sheltering Wednesday in the Dorohozhychi metro station.

In a video address, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russian forces wanted to “erase our country, erase us all”.

Five people were killed in an attack a day earlier on the Kyiv television tower at Babi Yar, the site of a Nazi massacre in which over 33,000 people were killed — most of them Jews.

The 44-year-old Zelensky, who is himself Jewish, urged Jewish people around the world to speak up.

“Nazism is born in silence. So, shout about killings of civilians. Shout about the murders of Ukrainians,” he said.

– New US sanctions –

With the civilian toll mounting, opposition to the conflict is also growing within Russia.

Dozens of anti-war demonstrators were detained in Moscow and Saint Petersburg after jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny called Russians to the streets, dismissing Putin as “an insane little tsar”.

Internationally, meanwhile, the United States announced a new set of sanctions, this time targeting Russian ally Belarus and Russia’s defense industry.

Authoritarian Belarus and Russia are closely linked and Belarus has been used as a key staging ground for the invasion of neighboring Ukraine.

Western countries have already imposed heavy sanctions on Russia’s economy and there have been international bans and boycotts against Russia in everything from finance to tech, from sports to the arts.

In France, President Emmanuel Macron said in an address to the nation Europe had entered a “new era,” and would need to both invest in its defences and wean itself off reliance on Russian gas.

EU and NATO members have already sent arms and ammunition to Ukraine, although they have made clear that they will not send troops and the EU has dampened Zelensky’s hopes of membership of the bloc.

– Chelsea for sale –

In its latest move to isolate Russia, the European Union banned broadcasts of Russian state media RT and Sputnik and excluded seven Russian banks from the global SWIFT bank messaging system.

In London, meanwhile, Chelsea’s Russian owner Roman Abramovich said he had made the “incredibly difficult” decision to sell the Premier League club, pledging proceeds would go to Ukraine war victims.

Abramovich, alleged to have close links to Putin, has not been named on a British sanctions list targeting Russian banks, businesses and pro-Kremlin tycoons.

But the Chelsea owner’s concern about potential seizing of assets is understood to have sparked his move.

The Russian military assault on Ukraine is on its seventh day.

Russian forces launch a massive strike on local government headquarters in the centre of Ukraine’s second city Kharkiv, killing at least 10 people. Russia’s defence ministry urges people to flee.

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky says in a phone call with US President Joe Biden that it is important to stop “aggressor” Russia “as soon as possible’.

Here's a round-up of all top developments on March 2:

12:00: Kherson not captured by Russia, fighting continues

An adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Wednesday that Russia had not captured Kherson, a southern port city that Russia had earlier said it had seized.

Oleksiy Arestovych said fighting continued for the provincial capital of around a quarter of a million people, which sits at the Dnipro river’s exit into the Black Sea.

“The city has not fallen, our side continues to defend,” Arestovych told a live briefing broadcast on the website of the president’s office. “Fighting in the streets continues.”

“Information that Kherson has fallen and so on - that’s not true. Our military and local defenders continue resisting in the city and around it.”

11:40pm: Fighting rages in Ukraine as Russian troops claim city

Russian forces said they had captured a port on the Black Sea on Wednesday as Russian and Ukrainian troops battled for another city and Ukraine’s leader said Moscow wanted to “erase” his country.

The Russian army said it had taken control of Kherson, as its troops advanced and pounded cities across southern and eastern Ukraine, defying sanctions and international isolation.

Russian paratroopers also landed in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-biggest city, triggering clashes in the streets, Ukrainian forces said.

11:15pm: Russia batters Ukraine; both sides say ready for more talks

Russia renewed its assault Wednesday on Ukraine’s second-largest city in a pounding that lit up the skyline with balls of fire over populated areas, even as both sides said they were ready to resume talks aimed at stopping the new devastating war in Europe.

The escalation of attacks on crowded cities followed an initial round of talks between outgunned Ukraine and nuclear power Russia on Monday that resulted in only a promise to meet again. It was not clear when new talks might take place — or what they would yield. Ukraine’s leader earlier said Russia must stop bombing before another meeting.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has decried Russia’s bombardment as a blatant terror campaign, while U.S. President Joe Biden warned on Tuesday that if the Russian leader didn’t “pay a price” for the invasion, the aggression wouldn’t stop with one country.

10:39pm: EU Commission proposes temporary residence rights for Ukraine refugees

The European Commission on Wednesday proposed granting automatic temporary protection for up to three years to people fleeing war in Ukraine, including a residence permit and access to employment and social welfare.

European Union members Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Hungary all have land borders with Ukraine and the Commission said that more than 650,000 people have fled there since Ukraine was attacked by Russia on Feb. 24.

Refugees will get temporary protection as soon as the proposal is approved by EU interior ministers, which the European Commission hoped would be done on Thursday.

9:27pm: 498 Russian troops had been killed in Ukraine

Russia said Wednesday that 498 Russian troops had been killed in Ukraine, its first announced death toll since President Vladimir Putin launched an invasion of the country last week.

“Four hundred and ninety-eight Russian servicemen have died in the line of duty. 1,597 of our comrades have been wounded.”

9:20pm: Kyiv mayor says Russia is massing troops closer to the capital

Russia is gathering troops closer and closer to Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital’s mayor Vitali Klitschko wrote in an online post on Wednesday.

“We are preparing and will defend Kyiv!,” he added. “Kyiv stands and will stand.”

8:39pm: Ukrainian refugees arrive in Prague

Ukrainian men with worried looks, weary women and restless children, many staring into the distance, wait patiently in the long queue as Czech volunteers call out instructions left and right.

“We left everything there as they came and ruined our lives. They’re bombing even civilian houses where there are kids, small kids, children, they die now,” Svitlana Mostepanenko told AFP.

The young woman travelled to Prague from Mykolaiv, a southern Ukrainian town near the larger Black Sea port city of Kherson which the Russian military claimed to control on Wednesday.

“We had to leave our own city, our native town. They’re bombing it,” Mostepanenko added.

She and other refugees await their turn at Prague’s foreigner registration centre, a drop in the sea of nearly 875,000 people who have fled Ukraine since Russia attacked last week.

The Czech Republic says it has so far welcomed around 20,000 Ukrainian refugees.

7:34pm: Zelenskiy waiting for positive signals on EU bid

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Wednesday after talking on the phone with European Council President Charles Michel he was waiting for news on Kyiv’s bid to join the European Union.

Zelenskiy called Michel, who chairs the EU national leaders, Ukraine’s “trusted friend”.

“We discussed the current situation on the battlefield and diplomatic efforts. Waiting for the positive signals about Ukraine’s membership in the EU”

7:30pm: Russians face more sports sanctions, but not at Paralympics

With the exception of the upcoming Paralympics, Russian athletes were restricted from competing in more sporting events around the world on Wednesday.

Sports including biathlon and table tennis were among those to join more than a dozen other Olympic sports in excluding competitors from Russia and Belarus because of the attack of Ukraine. The International Paralympic Committee, however, said Russians and Belarusians would be able to compete in Beijing as “neutral athletes” without national symbols.

Blanket bans have been imposed in soccer, track, basketball and hockey, among other sports, following an appeal from the International Olympic Committee to exclude Russians and Belarusians from international events.

7:26pm: EU sanctions 22 Belarus officers over Ukraine attack

The European Union on Wednesday imposed sanctions on 22 senior Belarusian military officers over Minsk’s role in aiding Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The six generals and 16 colonels were added to the EU blacklist because “Belarus is participating in a Russian unprovoked invasion against Ukraine by allowing military aggression from its territory,” the official sanction document said.

The blacklist bans travel into the bloc and imposes asset freezes.

The sanctions-hit Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which markets Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine against COVID-19, on Wednesday said it hopes that Russian and Ukrainian officials can reach a peace deal.

The United States and Britain have announced sanctions against RDIF, a financial entity functioning as a sovereign wealth fund and designed to attract capital into high-growth sectors, over Moscow’s attack of Ukraine.

6:20pm: 875,000 refugees on the move from Ukraine

Nearly 200,000 people have fled Ukraine in just 24 hours, bringing to 875,000 the number of refugees seeking shelter in neighbouring countries since the full-scale Russian military attack began on February 24.

The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) has projected that more than four million Ukrainian refugees may eventually need protection and assistance, while the European Union’s crisis management commissioner has said the figure could reach seven million.

More than 37 million people lived under the Kyiv government’s control before last week’s aggression.

5:07pm: Over 2,000 civilians dead in week of war

The Russian attack of Ukraine has killed more than 2,000 Ukrainian civilians and destroyed hundreds of structures including transport facilities, hospitals, kindergartens and homes, Ukraine’s emergency service said on Wednesday.

“Children, women and defence forces are losing their lives every hour,” it said in a statement.

5pm: Chinese national wounded trying to leave Ukraine

A Chinese national was injured by gunshot while trying to leave Ukraine, China’s foreign ministry said on Wednesday, marking the first confirmed case of a Chinese casualty as a result of the Russian attack.

Unlike many countries, China did not tell its roughly 6,000 citizens in Ukraine to leave the country in the days leading up to last Thursday’s attack by Russia, announcing evacuation plans soon after it had begun.

“A Chinese national was injured by a gunshot while evacuating on his own on March 1 Beijing nighttime,” spokesman Wang Wenbin told a regular daily media briefing, adding that the person was not in critical danger.

3:41pm: Russia, Ukraine ready for new talks on war

Russian and Ukrainian officials say they are standing by to resume talks about their war, though the time and place for negotiations was unknown and hopes for a breakthrough remain low.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Wednesday that “in the second half of the day, closer to evening, our delegation will be in place to await Ukrainian negotiators.”

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Ukrainian officials are ready for new talks but said the venue is undecided and Kyiv won’t accept any Russian ultimatums.

“Russia’s demands remain the same as (Russian President Vladimir) Putin announced in his address before the war started.”

9.00am: UN General Assembly set to censure Russia over Ukraine attack

The United Nations General Assembly is set to reprimand Russia on Wednesday over its attack of Ukraine and demand that Moscow stop fighting and withdraw its military forces, a move that aims to diplomatically isolate Russia at the world body.

By Tuesday evening nearly half the 193-member General Assembly had signed on as co-sponsors of a draft resolution ahead of a vote on Wednesday, diplomats said. The text “deplores” Russia’s “aggression against Ukraine.”

“Russia’s war marks a new reality. It requires each and every one of us to take a firm and responsible decision and to take a side,” Germany’s Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told the General Assembly on Tuesday.

8.07am: Ukraine gets $34 million in cryptocurrency donations
