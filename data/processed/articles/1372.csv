Example video title will go here for this video

KYIV, Ukraine — When the children start crying, the adults start playing Ukrainian folk songs, or make up fairy tales to chase away the fear. Food and water are sometimes scarce. Everyone hopes for peace.

These are the vagaries of life in makeshift shelters around Ukraine, where families try to protect the young and old and make conditions bearable amid the distant clatter of bullets, missiles or shells outside.

Hundreds of thousands of citizens rushed to spend yet another night in Kyiv's subway network as air raid sirens howled Sunday. Among those taking refuge in shelters are some Associated Press journalists bearing witness to how Ukrainians are coping with the war tearing their country apart, like piano teacher Alla Rutsko.

“A terrible dream ... It seems to me that all this is not happening to me. The eyes see, but the mind refuses to believe,” said Rutsko, 37, sitting on an air mattress in Kyiv's Pecherskaya subway station.

“On the fourth night, I can even sleep and dream,"" she said. “But waking up is especially hard.”

She focused her thoughts on her grand piano and her fears of losing it – “an excellent instrument, inherited from my grandfather, survived the last war.”

The fighting is still raging in the southeastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, where Ukrainian forces have so far thwarted the Russian military from taking the strategic stronghold on the Azov Sea.

“God forbid that any rockets hit. That’s why we’ve gathered everyone here,” said local volunteer Ervand Tovmasyan, who helped organize a shelter in the basement of a city gym. His young son clung to him.

The workout equipment lining the walls contrasts sharply with the gym's revised purpose. The shelter has seen shortages in drinking water, food and gasoline for generators since the fighting began last week, so residents are bringing what they can to stock up.

Many at the shelter remembered shelling in 2014, when Russia-backed separatists briefly captured the city. Anna Delina survived that, and went on to have two children. Now she's doing the best she can to comfort them with soothing words and caresses as they cuddle under blankets on a cold gym floor.

“Now the same thing is happening, but now we’re with children,” she said.

Countless human moments shaped by war are playing out across Ukraine.

While Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, waits for the expected Russian onslaught, the platform at Kyiv's Pecherskaya subway station where residents sleep is lined with baby carriages interspersed with pet carriers.

At first, authorities barred pets, but then they turned a blind eye. Anxious cats and dogs now huddle alongside their owners.

Denis Shestakov, a 32-year-old architect, made up a fairy tale to ease his 5-year-old daughter Katya’s fears.

“But how can you explain it to a dog? He began to lose his fur from stress,” he said.

“You can get used to a nightmare,” he said, trying to shrug the pressure off. ""And this is also a nightmare.”

Despite the shortages, the lack of privacy and all the challenges that come with life on an underground railway platform, complaining comes hard to families.

“It’s much harder for soldiers at the front. It’s embarrassing to complain about the icy floor, drafts and terrible toilets,” said 74-year-old Irina, who would not give her last name. Her grandson Anton is among those fighting in eastern Ukraine.

The internet mostly works and everyone reads the news. The potential participation of Belarus in the war on the side of Russia has become one of the most discussed topics.

“Oh, Ukrainians, Belarusians and Russians can hardly be called brothers now,” said Dmitro Skorobogaty, a 69-year-old engineer. Then he added, “though you can’t choose your relatives.”

Citizens are constantly warned about Russian saboteurs reportedly trying to provoke panic in Kyiv.

Police squads descend into the subway station, check documents, distribute water, and, among other things, advise people whether it's safe to step out.

Amid the din of parents singing folk songs to their children, foreign students from Africa joined some Ukrainians in singing the melodic national anthem: “Ukraine has not died yet, Glory to Ukraine!”

The city of Ternopil, some 80 miles east of Lviv and Ukraine's border with Poland, is hundreds of miles from the active front lines further east, north, and south. But Russian air and missile attacks have all of Ukraine within range.

Air raid sirens blare through the city several times a day, sending some residents toward the crpyt for safety. Others head to the basements of other large buildings for shelters. Internet access remains adequate and most people pass the time texting with friends and loved ones and reading the news.

Early in the afternoon on Sunday, air raid sirens started blaring. Dozens of people descended the narrow stairs into the shelter. One woman slipped and Father Roman Demush helped steady her to her feet. He said that many churches had prepared bomb shelters in the past weeks as the ecclesiastical leadership had instructed them to create safe spaces.

""We must help with the overflow of people coming here [from Kyiv and other regions of Ukraine] and we are providing not just physical safety but also spiritual comfort,"" Father Demush told me. ""We've had sirens for three days now. Death has never been this close. People are truly in fear. They say war doesn't have non-believers, so we ask God in prayer to protect and save. To live through such trying times is much easier with God – than without.""

Olga Bagriy, a teacher from Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, was among those seeking refuge. ""I love this church,"" she told me. ""They give tea, food, and water.""

Her family left Kyiv after Feb. 25 – the second night of Russian bombing. ""I came with my family – we decided to go when we heard the night sirens. The children were very much afraid. It was 5 am.""

Along with her husband and two sons, they headed toward Ternopil, where the family has property. She said she welcomes the quiet. ""The city is peaceful so far. But I have no idea how long we have to stay,"" she said.

New checkpoints and defensive anti-tank obstacles continued to go up at different locations around Ternopil. Road signs have been taken down to make it harder for potential Russian invading units to find their way.

People continued to journey to the west to Lviv and Poland. Police at the train station stopped journalists from working there, though, because they said that the sight of people getting on trains would increase panic, ""whereas, as you know, it's like this on the train much of the time normally, anyway.""

Ihor Volenuk (below), who works in sales in his hometown of Ternopil, admitted that he loves the outdoors and animals and … feeding the pigeons. ""Yes, I bring the kids on the weekends here sometimes and we feed the pigeons,"" he said, as his two daughters squealed with laughter while the birds frolicked all over them in the plaza in front of Ternopil's Taras Shevchenko Theater.

Volenuk's sister Oksana, a corporate manager, had fled the Russian invasion from Kyiv to stay with her brother and his family. ""It's so important to have a little happiness right now,"" she said. ""We've been so stressed. This is how we do not lose our minds.""

Dusk comes quickly in winter, and loudspeakers announced a 10 pm to 6 am curfew. But because of the blackout against Russian aircraft, the streets were quiet much earlier than 10.

Posters condemning Russian President Vladimir Putin were also spotted across central Kyiv.

Ukraine's armed forces in a statement on Monday said, ""All Russian efforts to occupy it have failed.""

However, Russia has urged civilians to evacuate Kyiv.

The United Nations (UN) estimates that the Russian invasion of Ukraine has already claimed the lives of 102 civilians, including at least seven children. At the same time, the crisis has reportedly displaced an estimated 100,000 Ukrainians who have fled to neighbouring countries.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday sought immediate membership of the European Union (EU) for his country.

Peace talks begin

Russian state media reported that peace talks between high-level delegations from Russia and Ukraine have begun at the Belarusian border. The peace talks are aimed at ending hostilities between the two countries.

On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin put Russia's nuclear deterrent forces on high alert. The decision is being seen as retaliation for sanctions imposed by the West against Russia and its top leaders, including President Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.

The European Union (EU), meanwhile, has closed off its airspace to Russian airlines. EU chief Ursula von der Leyen also pledged that the 27-nation bloc will bear the cost of procurement of arms for Ukraine.",https://www.indiatoday.in/world/russia-ukraine-war/story/air-raid-sirens-sounded-in-kyiv-russia-urges-ukrainians-to-evacuate-1918890-2022-02-28

Joe Whitcomb is a trauma-informed relationship psychotherapist who moved from San Diego, California, to Kyiv last year. His research company, BondFire Project, works with a Ukrainian business to develop virtual or mixed reality to treat trauma victims, including military veterans and first responders.

In recent days, Whitcomb, 54, has been hunkered down in his apartment complex, hearing the sounds of gunfire and air raid sirens warning residents to head to a bomb shelter.

""Yesterday was really super intense,” he said during a Facebook call on Sunday. “While we're in there, [there was] a lot of shouting, gunfire. And we were hunkered into our car, and it felt very, very dangerous. And we felt very powerless and helpless to be in that kind of situation.""

Whitcomb said things were quieter on Sunday after earlier explosions. He’s been posting live videos on social media describing the sights and sounds from his apartment window.

""Honestly, I didn't think it was going to get as intense as it has been,” he said. “But I just start doing them when the sirens will come on and, and just kind of keep people informed and in the know, and kind of see what's really happening on the ground.”

Whitcomb said he didn't leave Ukraine when tensions began heating up weeks ago, in part because most Ukrainians thought Russian President Vladimir Putin was saber-rattling and never imagined he’d send troops to Kyiv.

Now, Whitcomb said he’s worried about his safety if he tries to leave, and he also has loved ones in Kyiv that he doesn't want to leave behind.

Whitcomb said he thinks it's important to keep sharing the story of the Ukrainian people's struggle for freedom and against oppression.

He said his decades of work with trauma victims has been beneficial in getting through the crisis, and understanding what Ukrainians are experiencing.

“Having that kind of as a shared context language tool resource for me is definitely helpful,” he said. “It's helped me also see the impact of this type of war on humanity and the impact that can have on the people around me.”

A Veteran Conflict Reporter', 'Evans Has Covered Civil Wars', 'Strife In Angola', 'Chad', 'Sudan', 'As Well As The Myriad Battlefields Of The Middle East.']",,"As the minutes ticked down Saturday to the start of a weekend curfew in Kyiv, Lydia Sokolova was one of the few ordinary citizens out on the streets of the Ukrainian capital.

Her mission — to feed her son's cat — was more than worth any risk, she says. At 74, she appears determined not to let the threat of a Russian invasion instil any sense of panic in her.

""I am not going to a shelter,"" said Sokolova. ""We live in an apartment. My mom is very old though. She'll be 97 soon, so I am taking care of her. Right now I am going to feed my son's cat.""

Sokolova's desire to keep life as normal as possible aside, her journey through a city that feels like a ghost town offers a sense of how quickly and completely day-to-day life in Kyiv has been turned on its head since the Russian invasion began Thursday.

Considerations about feeding a family cat now have to take into account curfews, air-raid sirens and the uncertainty of when and where Russian troops might enter the capital.

And while Sokolova might be choosing to stay above ground, many others have gone underground and remained there. Hotel car parks, basements and Kyiv's underground stations are all serving as temporary bomb shelters.

Car park becomes temporary home

""I never, ever believed [it was possible],"" said Kate Savinna, 33, about her city being the possible target of an invasion.

Sitting with her dog Toufi on her lap in the underground car park of a hotel in the centre of the capital, she adds: ""We were like, 'No one will do something like that in Kyiv.' We thought that something might happen around the borders or occupy [areas close to others already] occupied.""

Savinna and her partner, Taras Baran, aren't guests at the hotel, but a friend of theirs is. When the air-raid sirens started wailing across the capital earlier this week, the couple didn't feel safe in the apartment they share close to Kyiv's main airport where there's been intense fighting.

""It definitely feels much safer than staying home alone, like in your apartment,"" said Baran, 26, who's an architect.

""It feels much safer here. And then also, as we decided, like to stay the first night in Kyiv, the things were getting worse and worse.""

The couple has been sleeping on a mattress brought to them by their friend. Given the curfew, they've had to teach Toufi to make do with quick toilet breaks.

The car park has become a temporary home to an assortment of Ukrainians, foreign journalists and workers from an international aid agency, which has set up shop in one corner of the garage.

The rest of it is covered with a sea of mattresses and blow-up beds and, for the less fortunate, strips of cardboard laid out under a blanket.

On the animal front, there are at least three dogs, a couple of cats and a rabbit tucked in with their owners.

Savinna's and Baran's car is parked in the garage. They were hoping to reach Baran's family in west Ukraine and had planned to stay only one night in the car park.

But now, they feel it would be safer to stay. They also don't like the idea of getting stuck on a road out of town — it usually takes five hours by car to get there, but some people were spending 30 to 40 hours on the road and fuel isn't readily available.

Savinna's family is in Luhansk, one of the divided territories in Eastern Ukraine where fighting — between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists in two self-declared People's Republics recently recognized by Russia — has been ongoing since 2014.

""Right now it's more quiet than here,"" said Savinna, ""and [my family are] pretty distressed because of us.""

Ukrainians worry about their country's future

For now, Savinna and Baran are coping with the day-to-day trials of their situation with as much good cheer as possible.

Thinking about the future of their country is a more difficult prospect.

They worry that if the cost of peace is an enforced neutrality for Ukraine that they will remain forever trapped between East and West.

""I guess Ukraine and the Ukrainian people will never feel safe,"" said Baran. ""It would be a grey zone between Russia and the rest of the world. So I guess it's not acceptable for anybody here.""

That's a sentiment echoed by Sokolova, above ground and of a different generation.

""I don't want Ukraine to be neutral,"" she said. ""I believe that we will win and I want Ukraine to use this win to be a more independent, absolutely independent country.""

Sokolova says she wants Ukraine to be a member of NATO and the European Union.

She also holds hate in her heart for Russia.

""My father is Russian from Moscow. My mother is Ukrainian from around Kyiv,"" she said. ""It's not toward the Russian people — it's toward the government and Putin. We hate him very much. Terribly.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/margaret-evans-kyiv-residents-ukraine-russia-invasion-1.6366507
