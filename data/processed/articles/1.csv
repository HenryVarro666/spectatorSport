British foreign secretary to visit Poland, call for tougher sanctions on Russia British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss will visit Poland on Monday to call for tougher sanctions on Russia, her office said, as major western countries work together to ramp up the pressure on President Vladimir Putin and end the conflict in Ukraine. ""Putin is yet to show he is serious about diplomacy. A tough approach from the UK and our allies is vital to strengthen Ukraine's hand in negotiations,"" Truss said. ""Britain has helped lead the way with sanctions to cripple the Putin war machine. We will do more to ramp up the pressure on Russia and we will keep pushing others to do more."" Truss is due to meet Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba in Poland's capital Warsaw later today and her Polish counterpart Zbigniew Rau on Tuesday. Britain, a former European Union member, has coordinated with international allies to impose sanctions on key Russian industries and Moscow's wealthy elites with the aim of crippling its economy in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Russia's chief investigator orders probe into Ukraine's Bucha claims Russia's chief investigator ordered an official probe into Ukraine's accusations of Russian forces killing hundreds of civilians in the town of Bucha, near Kyiv. In a statement Monday, Russia's Investigative Committee said it was looking into Ukraine's claims, as well as images shared by Ukrainian officials that it said aimed to ""discredit the Russian military personnel."" Russia has rejected the claim that its forces killed civilians in Bucha, despite photos and video appearing to show dead bodies on city streets as its troops pulled out of Bucha and other cities near Kyiv.

Zelenskyy decries war atrocities in new address, saying, 'Evil will be punished' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy delivered his harshest rebuke yet Sunday as Russian forces retreated from the war-torn city of Bucha, Ukraine, leaving in their wake a mass of what appeared to be civilian fatalities. ""Today this appeal will be without congratulations. I do not want any extra words. Presidents do not usually record appeals like this. But today I have to say just that. To say after what opened in Bucha and our other cities, from which the occupiers were chased out. Hundreds of people were killed. Tortured, shot — civilians. Bodies on the streets. Mined territory,"" Zelenskyy said. ""The bodies of the dead were mined."" Zelenskyy switched from speaking Ukrainian and made a direct appeal in Russian, saying: ""I want every mother of every Russian soldier to see the bodies of the killed people in Bucha, in Irpin, in Hostomel. What did they do? Why were they killed? What did the man who was riding his bicycle down the street do? Why were ordinary civilians tortured to death in an ordinary peaceful city? Why were women strangled after their earrings were torn out of their ears? How could women be raped and killed in front of children? Their bodies were mocked even after death. Why did they crush the bodies of people with tanks? What did the Ukrainian city of Bucha do to your Russia? How did all this become possible?"" He added: ""Russian mothers! Even if you raised marauders, how did they also become executioners? You couldn't help but know what's inside your children. You could not help but notice that they are deprived of everything human. No soul. No heart. They killed deliberately and with pleasure."" Speaking again in Ukrainian, Zelenskyy said that ""evil will be punished"" and that he had created a ""special mechanism of justice"" in Ukraine to investigate and prosecute every crime of Russian occupiers in the country. ""The essence of this mechanism is the joint work of national and international experts: investigators, prosecutors and judges. This mechanism will help Ukraine and the world to bring to justice those who unleashed or in any way participated in this terrible war against the Ukrainian people and in crimes against our people,"" he said.

Bucha residents say Russian troops killed civilians BUCHA, Ukraine — Residents of the Ukrainian town of Bucha, near the capital of Kyiv, have given harrowing accounts of how Russian troops shot and killed civilians without any apparent reason. Bodies of civilians lay strewn across the northern town, which was controlled by Russian soldiers for about a month. At a logistics compound that residents say was used as a base by Russian forces, the bodies of eight men could be seen dumped on the ground, some with their hands tied behind their backs.

NATO chief: This is 'not a real withdrawal' NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Sunday said Russia is shifting its strategy in Ukraine, explaining that Putin's retreat from Kyiv is not a sign that he is withdrawing from the country. “What we see is not a real withdrawal,"" Stoltenberg said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday. ""What we see is that Russia is repositioning its troops, and they are taking some of them back to rearm them, to reinforce them, to resupply them. But we should not in a way be too optimistic because the attacks will continue."" His remarks came after Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned of a Russian buildup of forces in the east of his war-torn country, in a video posted to Telegram on Saturday. In an intelligence briefing, British defense officials said Moscow's naval forces have continued to blockade areas on Ukraine's southern coast, preventing resupply by sea. There is concern about ""potential increased attacks, especially in the south and in the east. So this is not a real withdrawal but more a shift in the strategy, focusing more on the south and the east,"" Stoltenberg added. Share this -

""And at the same time, they may be regrouping. They may be recalibrating."" In a video posted to Telegram on Saturday night, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia was building up forces in the east of the country and called on Western countries to provide more anti-missile systems. Russia wants to ""capture both the Donbas and the south of Ukraine,"" he said. The U.S. has a strong interest in ending the violence, Blinken said, and ""the way to do that is to give Ukraine the strongest possible hand to put as much pressure as we possibly can on Russia, while we're strengthening our own defenses."" ""That's exactly what we've been doing,"" he added. ""Time is certainly not on Vladimir Putin's side, because, as I said, a sovereign, independent Ukraine has demonstrated it's going to be around a lot longer than Vladimir Putin is on the scene.""

Russian naval forces block Ukraine's resupply by Black Sea, U.K. military intelligence says Russian naval forces continue to blockade the Ukrainian coast on the Black Sea and Sea of Azov, preventing resupply by sea, British military intelligence said Sunday. In its latest assessment of the situation, the U.K.'s defense ministry tweeted that Russia still retains the capability to attempt an amphibious landing, but such an operation is likely to be increasingly high risk given the time Ukrainian forces have had to prepare. ""Reported mines within the Black Sea pose a serious risk to maritime activity,"" it added. The report said the origin of the mines was unclear and disputed, but their presence was almost certainly the result of Russian naval activity in the area, demonstrating how its invasion of Ukraine is affecting neutral and civilian interests.

These offenses were committed between Feb. 27 and March 14, it said. Russian soldiers were also implicated in looting civilian property, including food, clothing and firewood, it said. “The cases we documented amount to unspeakable, deliberate cruelty and violence against Ukrainian civilians,” said Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “Rape, murder, and other violent acts against people in the Russian forces’ custody should be investigated as war crimes.” Share this -

LAS VEGAS — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has appeared in a video at the Grammy Awards asking for support in telling the story of Ukraine’s invasion by Russia.

During the pre-recorded message that aired on the show Sunday night, he spoke in English, likening the attack to a deadly silence threatening to extinguish the dreams and lives of the Ukrainian people, including children.

In his words: “Our musicians wear body armor instead of tuxedos. They sing to the wounded in hospitals, even to those who can’t hear them. But the music will break through anyway.”

The Recording Academy, with its partner Global Citizen, prior to the ceremony highlighted a social media campaign called “Stand Up For Ukraine” to raise money and humanitarian support.

Zelenskyy told the audience: “Fill the silence with your music. Fill it today to tell our story. Tell the truth about the war on your social networks, on TV, support us in any way you can any, but not silence. And then peace will come to all our cities.”

Following Zelenskyy’s message, John Legend performed his song “Free” with Ukrainian musicians Siuzanna Iglidan and Mika Newton and poet Lyuba Yakimchuk as images from the war were shown on screens behind them.

OTHER DEVELOPMENTS:

KYIV, Ukraine — The Ukrainian military says that its forces have retaken some towns in the Chernihiv region and that humanitarian aid is being delivered.

The news agency RBK Ukraina says the road between Chernihiv and the capital of Kyiv is to reopen to some traffic later Monday.

Chernihiv is a city 80 miles north of Kyiv and it had been cut off from shipments of food and other supplies for weeks. The mayor said Sunday that relentless Russian shelling had destroyed 70% of the city.

Russian forces also withdrew from the Sumy region, in Ukraine’s northeast, local administrator Dmitry Zhivitsky said in a video message carried by Ukrainian news agencies Sunday. The troops had occupied the area for nearly a month.

In other areas recently retaken from Russian troops, Ukrainian officials say they have recovered hundreds of slain civilians in the past few days. Ukraine’s prosecutor-general says the bodies of 410 civilians have been recovered from Kyiv-area towns.

KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine’s prosecutor-general says the bodies of 410 civilians have been removed from Kyiv-area towns that were recently retaken from Russian troops.

Iryna Venediktova says on Facebook that the bodies were recovered Friday, Saturday and Sunday. She says 140 of them have undergone examination by prosecutors and other specialists.

Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk says the mayor of the village of Motyzhyn in the Kyiv region was murdered while being held by Russian forces. Vereshchuk adds that there are 11 mayors and community heads in Russian captivity across Ukraine.

In a video address Sunday, Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy denounced the allegedly targeted killings of civilians in towns that the Russians occupied, calling the killers “freaks who do not know how to do otherwise.” He warns that more atrocities may be revealed if Russian forces are driven out of other occupied areas.

International leaders have condemned the reported attacks in the Kyiv-area towns after harrowing accounts from civilians and graphic images of bodies with hands tied behind their backs.

Russia’s Defense Ministry has rejected the claims of atrocities against civilians in Bucha and other suburbs of Kyiv.

BALAKLIYA, Ukraine — The governor of the Kharkiv region says Russian troops fired on a convoy of buses that was trying to evacuate patients from a hospital that had been heavily damaged in shelling a day earlier.

The governor, Oleh Synyehubov, said Sunday that about 70 patients needed to be taken away from the damaged hospital in the town of Balakliya but that the buses were not able to enter the town.

He said there was preliminary information that one of the bus drivers was killed.

Balakliya is about 75 kilometers (45 miles) southeast of the city of Kharkiv, which has been heavily hit by Russian attacks.

BERLIN — Germany’s defense minister says European officials should talk about halting gas supplies from Russia in light of the alleged attacks on civilians in the Ukrainian town of Bucha.

Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht said Sunday night on German public broadcaster ARD that “there must be a reaction. Such crimes must not go unanswered.”

So far, Germany and several other European governments have shied away from an immediate boycott of Russian natural gas over fears of the impact it would have on their economies.

Europe gets 40% of its gas and 25% of its oil from Russia, and since the war, has scrambled to set out proposals to reduce its dependency. Russia is just as reliant on Europe, with oil and gas its dominant sector and paying for government operations.

Estimates of the impact of a gas boycott or embargo on Europe vary but most involve a substantial loss of economic output.

JERUSALEM __ Israel’s foreign minister is condemning the reported atrocities in Ukraine, saying deliberate harm to civilians is a war crime.

Foreign Minister Yair Lapid wrote on Twitter that one “cannot remain indifferent” after seeing images from the town of Bucha near Ukraine capital.

Israel has walked a tightrope since Russia invaded Ukraine, simultaneously denouncing the invasion while avoiding taking too strident a stance out of concern of angering Moscow, with whom it has security coordination in neighboring Syria. Israel has good relations with both countries and has mediated between them since the invasion on Feb. 24.

Lapid says that intentionally harming a civilian population is a war crime and strongly condemned it.

MOTYZHYN, Ukraine — A resident says the mayor of the Ukrainian town of Motyzhyn was killed in an execution-style slaying along with her husband and son.

Another resident of the town 50 kilometers (31 miles) west of Kyiv told the The Associated Press on Sunday that Russian troops targeted local officials in a bid to win them over and killed them if they did not collaborate. That man, Oleg, declined to give his full name for security reasons.

The mayor, Olga Sukhenko, and her family were shot and thrown into a pit in a forest behind a plot of land with three houses where Russian forces had slept. A fourth body was not yet identified.

The mayor and her family had been reported by others as kidnapped by Russians on March 23 and taken in an unknown direction.

LONDON — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson says Russia’s attack on Ukranian civilians in towns on the outskirts of Kyiv “are yet more evidence that Russian President Vladimir Putin and his army are committing war crimes in Ukraine.”

Johnson called the attacks in the towns of Irpin and Bucha “despicable” and says he “will do everything in my power to starve Putin’s war machine.” Johnson added that the U.K. will step up its sanctions and military support for Ukraine, but did not provide details.

Other European leaders also condemned the reported attacks on Ukranian civilians in response to images of bodies in the streets and some of the dead with their hands tied behind their backs.

Leaders in France, Germany, Italy, Greece, Czech Republic and Poland expressed outrage at the images. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala called the images ”horrifying” and says Russia has been committing war crimes.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz says international organizations should be given access to the areas to independently document the atrocities.

French Foreign Affairs Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian says his country will work with Ukrainian authorities and the International Criminal Court “to ensure these acts don’t go unpunished.”

BRUSSELS — NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg says the graphic images coming out of Bucha, Ukraine, after Russian troops withdrew show “a brutality against civilians we haven’t seen in Europe for decades.”

He tells CNN’s “State of the Union” that “it’s absolutely unacceptable that civilians are targeted and killed” and that it’s Russian President Vladimir Putin’s responsibility to stop the war.

Stoltenberg says it’s “extremely important” that the International Criminal Court has opened an investigation into potential war crimes in Ukraine and that those responsible are held to account.

His comments echoed those by other European leaders, who condemned alleged war crimes and civilian killings by Russian forces in Ukrainian towns including Bucha near Kyiv, the capital.

BUCHA, Ukraine — Residents of the Ukrainian town of Bucha near the capital of Kyiv have given harrowing accounts of how Russian troops shot and killed civilians without any apparent reason.

Bodies of civilians lay strewn across the northern town, which was controlled by Russian soldiers for about a month.

At a logistics compound that residents say was used as a base by Russian forces, the bodies of 8 men could be seen dumped on the ground, some with their hands tied behind their backs.

Residents say Russian troops would go from building to building, take people out of the basements where they were hiding from the fighting, check their phones for evidence of anti-Russian activity and take them away or shoot them.

Russia’s Defense Ministry has rejected the claims of atrocities against civilians in Bucha and other suburbs of Kyiv as a “provocation.”

The ministry says that “not a single civilian has faced any violent action by the Russian military“ in Bucha.

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, told a U.S. television interview Sunday that Russian attacks in Ukraine amount to genocide.

ROME — The head of Italy’s Democratic Party called for a full oil and gas embargo in reaction to images emerging of atrocities against civilians by Russian soldiers retreating from the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv.

“How many #Buca before we move to a full oil and gas Russia embargo,” Enrico Letta wrote on Twitter Sunday. “Time is over.”

Italy gets 40% of its natural gas from Russia and officials have said it would take three years to make the transition to other sources.

Premier Mario Draghi acknowledged last week that energy payments were fueling Russia’s invasion, and the foreign minister has been traveling to oil and gas producing countries to line up alternatives to Russia.

WASHINGTON — White House chief of staff Ron Klain says the U.S. remains fully committed to providing a full range of economic and military support to Ukraine in its war against Russia, which he describes as “far from over.”

Klain credits Ukrainians for fighting off Russian troops in the northern part of Ukraine and says the U.S. and its allies are sending weapons into the country “almost every single day.”

But he also tells ABC’s “This Week” that there are signs that Russian President Vladimir Putin is redeploying Russian troops to the eastern part of Ukraine.

Klain says while it will be up to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to decide if the political endgame is to allow Russia to occupy the eastern part of Ukraine, from the U.S. standpoint, the “military future of this attack has to be push back.”

He says regarding a potential Russian occupation of eastern Ukraine: “I will tell you, as President Zelenskyy has said, that’s not acceptable to him, and we are going to support him with military aid, with economic aid, with humanitarian aid.”

KYIV, Ukraine — The Ukrainian military says Russian troops have completed their pullback from the country’s north.

The military’s General Staff said in Sunday’s statement that Russian units have withdrawn from areas in the country’s north to neighboring Belarus, which served as a staging ground for the Russian invasion.

The Ukrainian military said its airborne forces have taken full control of the town of Pripyat just outside the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear power plant and the section of the border with Belarus. It posted a picture of the Ukrainian soldier putting up the country’s flag with a shelter containing the Chernobyl reactor that exploded in 1986 seen in the background.

VILNIUS, Lithuania — Lithuania says it has cut itself off entirely of gas imports from Russia and that it’s the first of the European Union’s 27 nations using Russian gas to break its energy dependence upon Moscow.

“Seeking full energy independence from Russian gas, in response to Russia’s energy blackmail in Europe and the war in Ukraine, Lithuania has completely abandoned Russian gas,” Lithuania’s energy ministry said in a statement late Saturday, adding that the measure took effect in the beginning of April.

Lithuania reduced imports of Russian gas to zero on Saturday, a move seen a milestone in achieving energy independence in the former Soviet republic of 2.8 million, the ministry said.

“We are the first EU country among Gazprom’s supply countries to gain independence from Russian gas supplies, and this is the result of a multi-year coherent energy policy and timely infrastructure decisions,” Minister of Energy Dainius Kreivys said.

Lithuania’a president posted an upbeat tweet on his account and urged other European nations to do the same.

KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine’s top diplomat has called for tougher sanctions on Russia over growing evidence of what he called a massacre of civilians in the suburbs of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.

Ukrainian officials said earlier Sunday that scores of killed civilians have been found on the streets of Kyiv’ suburbs of Bucha, Irpin and Hostomel after the withdrawal of Russian troops. They said that some of the victims were shot in the head and had their hands bound.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted Sunday that the killings were “deliberate,” adding that “Russians aim to eliminate as many Ukrainians as they can.”

He urged the West to impose an oil, gas and coal embargo, and close all ports to Russian vessels and goods. He also called for all Russian banks to be disconnected from the SWIFT international payment system.

In Germany President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said in Berlin that “the war crimes committed by Russia are visible before the eyes of the world.”

German news agency dpa reported that Steinmeier said “the images from Bucha shake me, they shake us deeply.”

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock pledged to tighten sanctions against Russia but did not give details.

BERLIN — Poland’s most powerful politician says he is open to the permanent stationing of U.S. nuclear weapons in Eastern Europe.

Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of Poland’s ruling conservative party, Law and Justice, said Sunday in an interview with German weekly Welt am Sonntag that “in principle, it makes sense to extend nuclear participation to the eastern flank.”

Kaczynski added that “if the Americans asked us to store U.S. nuclear weapons in Poland, we would be open to it. It would significantly strengthen deterrence against Moscow.”

Kaczynski acknowledged that “at the moment, this question does not arise, but that may change soon.”

The Polish leader also called for a much stronger presence of U.S. soldiers in Europe in the future, especially on NATO’s eastern flank.

He said that “Poland would welcome an increase in the American presence in Europe in the future from the current 100,000 soldiers to 150,000 soldiers because of Russia’s increasing aggressiveness.”

MOSCOW — The Kremlin says that by imposing sanctions on Russian President Vladimir Putin the West has demonstrated it has abandoned its sense of reason.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in televised remarks Sunday that the sanctions against Putin were going “beyond the edge of reason,” adding that they showed that the West is “capable of any stupidities.”

Peskov added that Putin’s meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is “hypothetically possible” once negotiators from the two countries prepared a draft agreement to be discussed.

KYIV, Ukraine — A Ukrainian presidential adviser says authorities have found evidence of serious war crimes by Russian troops on the outskirts of Kyiv.

Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said Sunday scores of killed civilians have been found on the streets of Kyiv’ suburbs of Irpin, Bucha and Hostomel after the withdrawal of Russian troops. He compared the scene to “a horror movie.”

Arestovych said some victims were shot in the head and had their hands bound, and some of the bodies had signs of torture. He accused Russian troops of raping women and trying to burn their bodies.

Arestovych said Ukrainian authorities will investigate the alleged war crimes and track down the perpetrators.

The reports drew international condemnation. In Britain, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said there is increasing evidence of “indiscriminate attacks against innocent civilians” and said they must be investigated as war crimes.

“We will not allow Russia to cover up their involvement in these atrocities through cynical disinformation and will ensure that the reality of Russia’s actions are brought to light,” she said.

MOSCOW — Russia’s top negotiator in talks with Ukraine says it’s too early to talk about a meeting between the two countries’ president.

Vladimir Medinsky, who led the Russian delegation in Tuesday’s talks in Istanbul, Turkey, said “there is still a lot of work to do” to finalize a draft agreement before Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy could meet.

Speaking Sunday in remarks carried by the Interfax news agency, Medinsky reaffirmed that the parties reached a tentative agreement on the need for Ukraine to adopt a neutral status and refrain from holding foreign military bases in exchange for international security guarantees.

Asked about Ukrainian negotiator Davyd Arakhamia’s claim that Moscow’s negotiators had informally agreed to most proposals by Ukraine during the talks in Istanbul this week and the two presidents could discuss the draft deal, Medinsky said he doesn’t share Arakhamia’s optimism. He said the talks will continue online Monday.

Medinsky emphasized that Russia’s stand on Crimea and rebel regions in Ukraine’s east remained unchanged. The Kremlin demands that Ukraine acknowledge Russia’s sovereignty over Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014, and recognize the independence of Russia-backed separatist regions in Donbas, Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland.

BERLIN — The mayor of the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, has expressed shock at what he called “cruel war crimes” committed by Russian soldiers in the town of Bucha northwest of the capital.

Referring to reports of executed civilians, Klitschko told German daily Bild on Sunday that “what happened in Bucha and other suburbs of Kyiv can only be described as genocide.”

An AP crew on Sunday saw the bodies of at least nine people who appear to have been executed. At least two of them had their hands tied behind their backs. They were all in civilian clothes and at least three were naked from the waist up. One appeared shot in the chest from close range.

Klitschko said Russian President Vladimir Putin was responsible for the “cruel war crimes,” adding that civilians had been “shot with tied hands.”

He called on the the whole world and especially Germany to immediately end gas imports from Russia.

He said that “especially for Germany, there can only be one consequence: Not a penny should go to Russia anymore, that’s bloody money used to slaughter people. The gas and oil embargo must come immediately.”",https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-business-middle-east-black-sea-religion-a97f60a50df0d8dc1e0f126a33144560

He described a column of dark smoke rising from the targets and flames from the buildings.

""What we can see is a dense screen of dark smoke, and one explosion after the other,"" Orlandi said.

Attacks in Kharkiv

The governor of the Kharkiv region says Russian troops fired on a convoy of buses that was trying to transport patients from a hospital that had been heavily damaged in shelling a day earlier.

Gov. Oleh Synyehubov said Sunday that about 70 patients needed to be taken away from the damaged hospital in the town of Balakliya — about 75 kilometres southeast of the city of Kharkiv — but that the buses were not able to enter the town. He said there was preliminary information that one of the bus drivers was killed.

Earlier on Sunday, Synyehubov said Russian artillery and tanks carried out more than 20 strikes on Kharkiv and its outskirts over the past 24 hours.

Synyehubov had said said four people were wounded in a Russian missile strike on Lozova, in the south of the Kharkiv region.

Russians withdrawing from north

The Ukrainian military says Russian troops have completed their pullback from the country's north.

The military's General Staff said in Sunday's statement that Russian units have withdrawn from areas in the country's north to neighbouring Belarus, which served as a staging ground for the Russian invasion.

Officials working on Mariupol evacuations

Work on evacuating Mariupol was to continue on Sunday with buses attempting to come close to the besieged city, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said.

Vereshchuk said Ukrainian officials were in talks with Russia to allow several Red Cross buses to enter the city. The Red Cross abandoned earlier attempts due to security concerns. Russia blamed the Red Cross for the delays.

Mariupol is Russia's main target in Ukraine's southeastern region of Donbas — an area that's been partly controlled by Moscow-backed separatists since 2014 — and tens of thousands of civilians there have been trapped for weeks with scant access to food and water.

The fall of the southern port city would help Russia establish a land bridge from the Donbas to Crimea, a southern region annexed by Russia in 2014.

Vereshchuk also said on Sunday that 2,694 people were rescued from conflict zones in Mariupol and the region of Luhansk, which is also located in the Donbas region.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ukraine-russia-war-1.6406800

11:10 p.m. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala says the country should cut its dependence on Russian energy resources within five years, calling the current situation one of the Czech Republic's ""greatest security risks."" The EU member meets its gas needs almost entirely through shipments directly or indirectly from Russia, and gets roughly half its crude imports from the same source. Fiala adds the country's energy sector has to change ""completely.""

9:59 p.m. European Union countries sharing borders with Russia and Belarus bar some cargo vehicles registered in the two countries from entering due to sanctions, the Russian customs service says, according to Reuters. Vehicles used as international transport that have Russian and Belarusian number plates will not be able to move goods on EU territory, the Russian customs service says. This comes after the EU on Friday formally adopted new sanctions against Russia, including bans on the import of coal, wood, chemicals and other products, while also preventing many Russian vessels and trucks from accessing the bloc.

3:31 p.m. S&P lowers Russia's foreign currency ratings to ""selective default"" on increased risks that Moscow will not be able and willing to honor its commitments to foreign debtholders.

11:50 a.m. Russia's justice ministry says it has revoked the registration of 15 foreign organizations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. The Russian units of the 15 organizations, which include the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, ""were excluded due to the discovery of violations of the current legislation of the Russian Federation,"" the ministry said in a statement on Friday.

The decision, which did not give details of any violations, was announced days after New York-based HRW said it had found ""several cases of Russian military forces committing laws-of-war violations"" in Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly denied war crimes allegations by Ukraine and Western countries during its six-week-long invasion of Ukraine and denies targeting civilians.

4:10 a.m. Germany is working to end imports of Russian oil and believes it may do so this year, Chancellor Olaf Scholz says in London during a news conference with U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

The European Union is studying ways to phase out its imports of Russian oil, according to EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. But ending German dependence on Russian natural gas poses a higher hurdle. No timeline has been set for such a transition.

The U.K. has announced plans to phase out imports of Russian coal and crude oil by the end of 2022, followed by gas imports at an early date.

3:17 a.m. The U.S. believes Russia used a short-range ballistic missile to strike a railway station in east Ukraine on Friday, a senior U.S. defense official says. Ukraine said at least 50 people were killed and many more wounded in the strike.

Friday, April 8

10:30 p.m. The ruble rallied after Russia's central bank cut its main interest rate in a surprise move. The cut, which follows new sanctions on Russia including a U.S. ban on crude oil imports, partly reverses an emergency rate hike in late February after the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

""Today's decision reflects a change in the balance of risks of accelerated consumer price growth, decline in economic activity and financial stability risks,"" the Central Bank of Russia says in a statement reported by Interfax.

8:50 p.m. Russian citizens are spending on average 40% of their disposable income on food, about double the amount from before Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, the director of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization's Russia liaison office tells Reuters. Russian government data shows annual food inflation hit 18.75% on April 1 as the economy reels from Western sanctions. The average European Union household spends about 12% of its income on food, the director says.

Meanwhile, global food prices have hit record levels in the wake of the Ukraine war, the latest FAO data shows.

6:00 p.m. More than 30 people were killed and over 100 were wounded in a Russian rocket strike on a railway station in eastern Ukraine on Friday as civilians tried to evacuate to safer parts of the country, the state railway company says. It said two Russian rockets struck a station in the city of Kramatorsk, which is used to evacuate civilians from areas under bombardment by Russian forces.

4:50 p.m. Japan's Foreign Ministry says it will expel a number of Russian diplomats stationed in the country in Tokyo's latest response to the civilian killings reported during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Eight Russians, including diplomats, will be expelled, it announced Friday. Japan has been cautious about expelling Russian diplomats up to now, but changed course as the U.S. and European countries have moved to punish Russia diplomatically. Tokyo's decision is likely to prompt Moscow to make tit-for-tat expulsions of Japanese diplomats from Russia.

3:30 p.m. India's central bank cuts its economic growth forecast for the fiscal year that started April 1 to 7.2%, from the 7.8% projected in February, citing the Russia-Ukraine war.

""Although India's direct trade exposure to countries at the epicenter of the conflict is limited, the war could potentially impede the economic recovery through elevated commodity prices and global spillover channels,"" Reserve Bank of India Gov. Shaktikanta Das says.

There are several other factors at work, he adds. ""Financial market volatility induced by monetary policy normalization in advanced economies, renewed COVID-19 infections in some major countries with augmented supply-side disruptions and protracted shortages of critical inputs, such as semiconductors and chips, pose downside risks to the outlook.""

3:18 p.m. Ukraine says it aims to establish up to 10 humanitarian corridors to evacuate trapped civilians on Friday, but civilians trying to flee the besieged southern city of Mariupol will have to use private vehicles. The 10 planned safe corridors announced by Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk were all in southern and eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian officials say Moscow plans to seize as much territory as it can in the eastern part of Ukraine known as Donbas bordering Russia.

11:00 a.m. The chairman of Russian aluminum giant Rusal calls for an impartial investigation into the killing of civilians in the Ukrainian town of Bucha, which he described as a crime, and urged an end to the ""fratricidal"" conflict. While the statement from Chairman Bernard Zonneveld, a Dutch national, did not touch on who was to blame for the deaths of civilians in the town, it is unusual for a large Russian company to comment publicly on the conflict. ""We support an objective and impartial investigation of this crime and call for severe punishment for the perpetrators,"" he said.

10:18 a.m. Japan will phase out Russian coal imports as part of its sanctions against Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine, Japan's industry minister says, joining other Group of Seven industrialized nations. Koichi Hagiuda told a regular news conference that Japan will gradually reduce the amount imported from Russia, and eventually break Japan's dependence on its coal, saying, ""We seek to stop importing in the end."" The move comes a day after G-7 foreign ministers vowed to ""expedite"" plans to end their energy dependence on Russia by phasing out and banning Russian coal imports to punish Moscow.

9:05 a.m. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says work has begun to dig through the rubble in Borodianka, a city northwest of Kyiv that was occupied by Russian military forces. He also said ""it is much scarier"" there, with even more victims of Russian troops. In his daily nighttime video address to the nation Thursday, Zelenskyy said the Russians were preparing to shock the world in the same way by showing corpses in Mariupol and falsely claiming they were killed by the Ukrainian defenders.

4:30 a.m. Pink Floyd is releasing its first new music in almost three decades to raise money for the people of Ukraine, the band announces. ""Hey Hey Rise Up"" features Pink Floyd members David Gilmour and Nick Mason, with vocals from Ukrainian singer Andriy Khlyvnyuk of the band BoomBox.

The track features Khlyvnyuk singing a patriotic Ukrainian song from a clip he recorded in front of Kyiv's St. Sophia Cathedral and posted on social media.

2:51 a.m. Russia has sustained ""significant"" troop losses in Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov tells British television channel Sky News.

""We have significant losses of troops, and ... it's a huge tragedy for us,"" he says when responding to interviewer Mark Austin's question: ""You've lost thousands of troops. How many troops have you lost?""

Peskov expresses hope that the operation will achieve its goals, or end via negotiations, in the coming days but also calls verified imagery of dead civilians in Bucha a ""bold fake.""

Russia's Defense Ministry reported March 25 that 1,351 service members had been killed, and 3,825 wounded, since the start of the operation, state news agency Tass says in a brief story about the interview.

2:00 a.m. The United Nations suspends Russia from the Human Rights Council in a vote. Ninety-three member states voted for the resolution. Twenty-four voted against, including Russia and China.

Thursday, April 7

11:55 p.m. The U.S. Senate overwhelmingly backs legislation to remove ""most favored nation"" trade status for Russia and its close ally Belarus over the invasion of Ukraine, allowing for higher tariffs on imports from the two countries. As voting continues, the tally in the 100-member Senate was 65-0 in favor of removing Permanent Normal Trade Relations status.

Senate approval will send the measure to the House of Representatives, where passage is expected later on Thursday, sending the legislation to the White House for President Joe Biden to sign into law.

6:30 p.m. Russia's communications watchdog said on Thursday it was taking punitive measures against Google, including a ban on advertising the platform and its information resources, for violating Russian law. Roskomnadzor accused Google's YouTube video-sharing platform, which has shut out Russian state-funded media globally, of becoming ""one of the key platforms spreading fakes (fake images) about the course of (Russia's) special military operation on the territory of Ukraine, discrediting the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.""

3:40 p.m. Shell will write down up to $5 billion following its decision to exit Russia, higher than previously disclosed, while soaring oil and gas prices boosted trading activities in the first quarter, the company says. The post-tax impairments of between $4 billion and $5 billion in the first quarter will not impact the company's earnings, Shell said in an update ahead of its earnings announcement on May 5. It had previously said the Russia write-downs would reach around $3.4 billion.

1:30 p.m. The U.N. General Assembly will vote on Thursday on a U.S. push to suspend Russia from its Human Rights Council over reports of ""gross and systematic violations and abuses of human rights"" by Russian troops in Ukraine. A two-thirds majority of voting members -- abstentions do not count -- can suspend a country from the 47-member council. Western diplomats are confident they have enough support among the 193-member General Assembly to adopt a resolution to suspend Moscow.

10:30 a.m. International Energy Agency states have agreed to tap 60 million barrels of oil from storage, the director of the group says, on top of a 180-million-barrel release announced by Washington last week aimed at cooling prices after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The move by the U.S.-allied IEA countries, which represent 31 mostly industrialized countries but not Russia, would be their second coordinated release in a month and would be the fifth in the agency's history to confront oil market outages.

10:18 a.m. U.S. sanctions against two of Russia's largest banks are ""a direct blow to the Russian population [and] ordinary citizens,"" the Tass news agency cites Russia's U.S. ambassador as saying on Wednesday.

5:00 a.m. The U.S. believes Russian forces have completely withdrawn from the area around Kyiv, a senior American official says.

The troops were pulling back to Belarus and Russia to regroup, the official says. They may join the fighting in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donbas, which Russia has designated the new focus of its ""special military operation"" -- what Moscow calls its invasion.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also says a small number of Ukrainians are receiving training in the U.S. to use tank-killing Switchblade drones. These Ukrainians are supposed to return to their country soon, the official says.

4:00 a.m. Chinese President Xi Jinping's personal alliance with Russian President Vladimir Putin is hampering China's diplomacy. That is becoming clearer as the war in Ukraine rages on.

Both men have laid the groundwork to stay in power until the middle of the 2030s. Both have territorial ambitions: reestablishing the former Soviet Union's sphere of influence for Putin, Taiwan for Xi. But the association comes with significant risk. Read more in this week's China Up Close.

2:00 a.m. One world leader willing to accept Russia's demand to pay for natural gas in rubles is Hungary's Victor Orban.

The Hungarian prime minister, whose right-wing ruling party won by a landslide in a parliamentary election Sunday, tells a news conference he has called on Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine immediately and says he is reconsidering his country's close ties with Moscow. Yet Orban says ""if the Russians request it, we will pay in rubles,"" the Financial Times reports.

Germany and other countries have rejected Putin's demand for payment in rubles, which Russia has yet to enforce.

2:10 a.m. New U.S. sanctions on Russia add the country's top bank, Sberbank, to the list of targets, as well as family members of Russia President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. These and other international responses to Russia's invasion of Ukraine are not lost on China, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman says.

""The strong and coordinated response from the international community, including nations in the Indo-Pacific, to Russia's flagrant violations on international law and principles like sovereignty and territorial integrity sends a strong signal that such actions will not go ignored,"" Sherman tells the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

The range of sanctions and ""unprecedented"" coordination between the U.S. and its partners give Chinese President Xi Jinping a ""good understanding of what might come his way should he in fact support Putin in any material fashion,"" Sherman says.

On support for U.S. partners, Republican Congressman Michael McCaul of Texas says: ""Putin's invasion of Russia shows us how critical it is to give our allies the weapons they need before an invasion and not after."" McCaul is preparing to introduce a bill that would create ""a security assistance program for Taiwan.""

Wednesday, April 6

8:00 p.m. Mere months ago Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was on the ropes. The lira had crashed and his unorthodox monetary policy was being ridiculed in financial markets.

But the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and its subsequent struggles on the battlefield, have led to a dramatic diplomatic turnaround for Turkey, which finds itself at the center of efforts to establish a cease-fire.

It stands in contrast to China and India, who have been criticized by the global community for sitting on the fence. Read more.

6:00 p.m. Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar says in parliament that New Delhi is ""deeply disturbed"" by the reports of civilians killed in Bucha. ""We strongly condemned the killings which have taken place there. This is an extremely serious matter, and we support the call for an independent investigation,"" he adds.

India, which has extensive defense dealings with Russia, has been reluctant to speak out against the invasion.

""If India has chosen a side, it is the side of peace and it is for an immediate end to violence,"" Jaishankar says.

5:37 p.m. Pope Francis condemns the ""massacre of Bucha,"" while holding up a Ukrainian flag sent to him from the town where hundreds of civilians were executed and mass graves have been found.

""Recent news from the war in Ukraine, instead of bringing relief and hope, brought new atrocities, such as the massacre of Bucha,"" he said during his weekly address. ""Cruelty that is increasingly horrendous, even against civilians, defenseless women and children. They are victims whose innocent blood cries out up to heaven and implores: 'Stop this war! Let the weapons fall silent! Stop sowing death and destruction.'""

The Kremlin said on Tuesday allegations that Russian forces committed war crimes by executing civilians in Bucha were a ""monstrous forgery"" aimed at denigrating its army.

11:18 a.m. U.S. chipmaker Intel says it has suspended operations in Russia, joining a slew of companies exiting the country following its invasion of Ukraine. The company, which last month suspended shipments to customers in Russia and Belarus, said it has implemented business continuity measures to minimize disruption to its global operations.

IBM, too, has suspended shipments, as Ukraine urged U.S. cloud-computing and software companies to cut off business with Russia. Servers from IBM, Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard top the market in Russia, where companies and government agencies have relied on technology developed by the West as the basis for their IT systems.

4:20 a.m. The U.S. and its Group of Seven and European Union allies on Wednesday will impose new sanctions against Russian banks and government officials and ban investment in Russia, a source familiar with the announcement tells Reuters.

The measures will ""degrade key instruments of Russian state power, impose acute and immediate economic harm on Russia and hold accountable the Russian kleptocracy that funds and supports (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's war,"" the source says.

3:00 a.m. NATO foreign ministers will meet with their counterparts from the Asia-Pacific this week, seeking to gain their cooperation in deepening the economic and diplomatic isolation of Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.

Top diplomats from eight countries and the European Union will take part, including Ukraine as well as Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. In light of reports of alleged war crimes by Russia in Ukraine, the ministers are expected to discuss their responses, including additional assistance to Kyiv.

""Targeting and murdering civilians is a war crime,"" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg tells reporters on Tuesday. Read more.

2:45 a.m. Asked whether the U.S. was providing military training to Ukrainians outside of Ukraine, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin says: ""To use some of the gear, certainly they have to have training, and we're doing that.""

Austin's comments come at a House Armed Services Committee hearing with Joint Chiefs of Staff Chair Gen. Mark Milley.

2:30 a.m. The United Nations has failed to function in the face of the worst war crimes since World War II, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has told the U.N. Security Council.

Tuesday, April 5

11:13 p.m. The Czech Republic has sent T-72 tanks and BVP-1 infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine, a Czech defense source tells Reuters.

10:00 p.m. The 30 NATO allies would welcome Finland and Sweden into the alliance if they decided to join, but any such move is up to the two nations, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg says.

NATO likely would find ways ""to address the concerns they may have about this interim period between having applied and until the last ratification [by allies] has taken place,"" he says, referring to possible Russian retaliation before the pair were fully under NATO protection.

5:52 p.m. Italy has expelled 30 Russian diplomats because of security concerns, according to Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio. Denmark says it will expel 15 Russian diplomats, in line with steps taken by other European Union countries, after reports of mass graves of civilians being found in Bucha.

5:30 p.m. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Ukraine has no option but to negotiate with Russia to end the fighting but that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin may not personally hold talks. ""All of us, including myself, will perceive even the possibility of negotiations as a challenge,"" Zelenskyy says in an interview with Ukrainian journalists broadcast on national television.

2:50 p.m. Ukrainian forces have retaken key northern terrain, forcing Russian forces to retreat from areas around the city of Chernihiv and north of the capital, Kyiv, British military intelligence says. Low-level fighting is likely to continue in some of the recaptured areas but reduce this week as the remainder of the Russian forces withdraw, the defense ministry said in a regular bulletin on Twitter. Many of the withdrawing Russian units are likely to require significant reequipping and refurbishment before they redeploy for operations in the country's east, the ministry added.

12:10 p.m. The U.S. has stopped the Russian government from paying holders of its sovereign debt totaling more than $600 million from reserves held at American banks. Under sanctions put in place after Russia invaded Ukraine, foreign currency reserves held by the Russian central bank at U.S. financial institutions were frozen. But the Treasury Department had been allowing Moscow to use those funds to make coupon payments on dollar-denominated sovereign debt on a case-by-case basis.

11:54 a.m. Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi returns home from Poland, bringing 20 evacuees from Ukraine in a show of Tokyo's latest support for the war-torn nation and neighboring countries.

9:56 a.m. Russia will respond proportionately to the expulsion of its diplomats from a number of Western countries, says Dmitry Medvedev, former Russian president and current deputy secretary of the country's Security Council. ""Everyone knows the answer: It will be symmetrical and destructive for bilateral relations,"" he said on his Telegram channel. ""Who have they punished? First of all, themselves.""

8:42 a.m. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he will address the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday and predicted that further and worse instances of mass killings of civilians by Russian troops would be discovered. Tuesday's Security Council session is to consider Ukrainian allegations of the murder of civilians by Russian soldiers in Bucha, northwest of Kyiv, following the discovery of hundreds of bodies, some bound and shot at close range.

4:33 a.m. A team from the International Committee of the Red Cross is detained by police during an attempt to reach the Ukrainian city of Mariupol to evacuate civilians and is being held nearby in Manhush, a spokesperson tells Reuters.

2:30 a.m. France and Germany will expel Russian diplomats in response to the alleged killings of civilians in Bucha.

Germany will declare about 40 Russian diplomats as personae non gratae, Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock says. Germany media say these diplomats will have to leave the country within five days of such a declaration.

Moscow says it will respond to Paris' decision, RIA Novosti reports.

2:05 a.m. The U.S. will work with its partners to try to suspend Russia's membership on the United Nations Human Rights Council, says Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. representative to the U.N.

The ambassador is part of an international chorus of voices denouncing Russia after new allegations of war crimes in Ukraine. Moscow denies that its forces were responsible for civilian deaths in Bucha.

12:35 a.m. U.S. President Joe Biden labels Russian President Vladimir Putin a war criminal and calls for a war crimes trial as the global outcry mounts over civilian killings in the Ukrainian town of Bucha.

""You saw what happened in Bucha,"" Biden tells reporters at the White House, referring to the discovery of a mass grave and tied bodies shot at close range. ""This warrants him -- he is a war criminal."" The Kremlin denies any accusations related to the murder of civilians, including in Bucha.

12:30 a.m. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says it will be more difficult for Ukraine to negotiate with Russia after the scale of atrocities carried out by Russian troops in occupied territories has become known. The Ukrainian leader speaks on national television from the town of Bucha in the Kyiv region, where tied bodies shot at close range, a mass grave and other signs of executions have been found in territory retaken from Russian troops.

Moscow has denied any accusations related to the killing of civilians in Bucha.

8:28 p.m. France faces a repeat of the 2017 presidential election showdown between Emmanuel Macron and far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, with Macron still favored but in a much tighter race as his lead narrows, opinion polls show ahead of the first round of voting on Sunday.

Five years ago, Macron beat Le Pen with 66.1% of the vote in the runoff, with voters of all stripes rallying behind the centrist. But the latest poll forecasts just a 53%-47% margin of victory for President Macron. Le Pen has improved her standing with a campaign focused on the declining purchasing power of middle- and lower-income voters.

5:00 p.m. Russia's chief investigator orders an official investigation into what he calls a ""provocation"" from Ukraine after Kyiv accused the Russian military of massacring civilians in the town of Bucha.

12:05 p.m. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made a surprise video appearance at the music industry's star-studded Grammy Awards celebration in Las Vegas and appealed to viewers to support his country ""in any way you can."" ""What is more opposite to music? The silence of ruined cities and killed people,"" said Zelenskyy in the video. ""Fill the silence with your music. Fill it today, to tell our story. Support us in any way you can. Any, but not silence."" He added, ""Our musicians wear body armor instead of tuxedos, they sing to the wounded, in hospitals, even to those who can't hear them, but the music will break through.""

10:10 a.m. Oil prices extend losses Monday as investors eye the release of supplies from strategic reserves from consuming nations, while a truce in Yemen could ease supply disruption concerns in the Middle East. Brent crude futures fell 79 cents, or 0.8%, to $103.60 a barrel by 0037 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was at $98.45 a barrel, down 82 cents, or 0.8%.

The United Nations has brokered a two-month truce between a Saudi-led coalition and the Houthi group aligned with Iran for the first time in the seven-year conflict. Saudi oil facilities have come under attack by the Houthis during the conflict, adding to supply disruption from Russia.

8:00 a.m. Hungary's nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban scored a fourth consecutive landslide win in Sunday's election, as voters endorsed his ambition for a conservative, ""illiberal"" state and shrugged off concerns over Budapest's close ties with Moscow. Russia's invasion of Ukraine had appeared to upend Orban's campaign, forcing him into awkward maneuvering to explain decade-old cozy business relations with President Vladimir Putin. But he mounted a successful campaign to persuade his Fidesz party's core electorate that the six-party opposition alliance of Peter Marki-Zay promising to mend ties with the European Union could lead the country into war, an accusation the opposition denied.

5:50 a.m. Pope Francis pays tribute to journalists killed during the Ukraine war, saying he hoped God would reward them for serving the common good whatever side they were on. At least six journalists have died since Russian forces invaded Ukraine in late February.

Speaking with journalists aboard the papal plane returning from Malta, Francis reiterates that he is ready to visit Kyiv but adds that he has yet to decide whether it is feasible.

12:28 a.m. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba accuses Russian forces of carrying out a ""massacre"" in the town of Bucha as images of corpses in civilian clothes left behind by departing Russian troops prompt calls from officials in Ukraine and Europe for tougher sanctions on Russia.

11:26 p.m. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken tells CNN the images of dead Ukrainian civilians found in Bucha after Russian troops left are a ""punch in the gut"" and that those responsible for any war crimes must be held accountable. Ukrainian forces had moved into the town near Kyiv and found what officials and witnesses say were the bodies of nearly 300 civilians killed by Russian troops.

Blinken would not confirm reports that the U.S. is facilitating the transfers of Soviet-era tanks to Ukrainian forces from eastern European allies, but says that there ""are or will soon be in Ukraine more than 10 anti-tank systems for every Russian tank.""

9:44 p.m. Bucha Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk shows journalists dead bodies in an area he says Chechen fighters controlled during the month that Russian forces occupied the Ukrainian city on the northern outskirts of Kyiv. One corpse appeared to have his hands bound by white cloth, and to have been shot in the mouth.

""The Russians have demonstrated that they were consciously killing civilians,"" Fedoruk alleges.

Reuters, which was taken to the scene by Ukrainian authorities, was not immediately able to verify the mayor's allegations. Russia's Defense Ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Chechnya is a region in southern Russia that has deployed troops to Ukraine to support Russian forces.

8:10 p.m. A leading rights group says it documented ""apparent war crimes"" committed by Russian military forces against civilians in Ukraine. Human Rights Watch says it found ""several cases of Russian military forces committing laws-of-war violations"" in Russian-controlled regions such as Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Kyiv.

The statement, published in Warsaw, comes one day after dead civilians were found lying scattered through the streets of Bucha, three days after the Russian army pulled back after a monthlong occupation of the area 30 km northwest of Kyiv.

7:16 p.m. Ukrainian grain exports in March were four times less than February levels, due to the Russian invasion, the economy ministry says. March grain shipments overseas included 1.1 million tons of corn, 309,000 tons of wheat and 118,000 tons of sun oil. Ukraine was the world's fourth-largest grain exporter in the 2020-21 season, according to International Grains Council data, with most of its commodities shipped out via the Black Sea.

7:00 p.m. Allegations of attacks against civilians during Russia's invasion of Ukraine must be investigated as war crimes, British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss says, adding that the U.K. will fully support any such move by the International Criminal Court.

""As Russian troops are forced into retreat, we are seeing increasing evidence of appalling acts by the invading forces in towns such as Irpin and Bucha,"" Truss says in a statement, referring to places near Kyiv. ""Their indiscriminate attacks against innocent civilians during Russia's illegal and unjustified invasion of Ukraine must be investigated as war crimes.""

2:15 p.m. Russian naval forces continue to blockade the Ukrainian coast on the Black Sea and Sea of Azov, preventing resupply by sea, British military intelligence says.

1:00 p.m. Missiles struck Ukraine's southern port city of Odessa in the early hours of Sunday, the city council says in an online post. One of the city's ""critical infrastructure facilities"" was hit, regional administration spokesperson Sergey Bratchuk tells Ukraine's public broadcaster.

6:29 a.m. Russian forces want to seize east and south Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says in a late night address, adding Western nations had not provided enough anti-missile systems in their aid. Ukraine's president also heaps praise on his forces defending Mariupol, saying the fierce resistance in the besieged port city was giving the country's other cities valuable time.

4:27 a.m. Ukrainian military reports Russia is sending soldiers to Moldova's breakaway region of Transnistria, where they were preparing to launch ""provocations"" along the border, near Odessa, the Financial Times reports.

Russian troops already in Transnistria were preparing for ""a demonstration of readiness for the offensive and, possibly, hostilities against Ukraine,"" says the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

Moldova's Foreign Ministry says it is unaware of a troop buildup while officials in Transnistria deny the reports as ""completely untrue.""

3:35 a.m. Ukraine says it has seized back all areas around Kyiv, claiming complete control of the capital region for the first time since the invasion.

We had thought that invasions of other countries, savage street fighting and atomic threats were grim memories of a distant past,"" the pope says in an address to Maltese officials after arriving on the Mediterranean island nation for a two-day visit.

""However, the icy winds of war, which bring only death, destruction and hatred in their wake, have swept down powerfully upon the lives of many people and affected us all.""

A statement released by the Russian side says that Putin thanked Turkey for its assistance in hosting another round of Russia-Ukraine talks.

11:00 p.m. Friday's European Union-China summit, the first since Russia invaded Ukraine, was ""not business as usual"" and took place in a ""very sober atmosphere,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says.

""We also made very clear that China should, if not support, at least not interfere, with our sanctions,"" von der Leyen tells a news conference.

The onset of the pandemic in 2020 led to a surge in remote working and learning, which in turn fueled demand for computers.

4:00 p.m. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has recalled his country's ambassadors to Georgia and Morocco, suggesting they haven't done enough to persuade those countries to support Ukraine and punish Russia for the invasion.

Meanwhile, Washington says there are indications Vladimir Putin may be receiving inaccurate information from commanders.

""We have information that Putin felt misled by the Russian military, which has resulted in persistent tension between Putin and his military leadership,"" White House communications director Kate Bedingfield tells reporters in a briefing.

The United States and the European Union plan to impose stiff new sanctions against Russia in retaliation for its “war crimes” in Ukraine after revelations of atrocities in towns near Kyiv, including the discovery Tuesday of six burned and blackened corpses.

The new penalties by the U.S. and its allies, which will be announced Wednesday, include a ban on new investment in Russia and are intended in part to ""impose acute and immediate economic harm on Russia.""

The European Union’s executive branch on Tuesday proposed a ban on coal imports from Russia, in what would be the first sanctions targeting Moscow's lucrative energy income for its war in Ukraine. The coal imports amount to an estimated 4 billion euros ($4.4 billion) per year.

""Today we are proposing a 5th package of sanctions. To take a clear stand is crucial for the whole world,"" the E.U. Commission said in a Twitter post. ""A clear stand against Putin’s war of choice. Against the massacre of civilians.""

►French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Tuesday there is a “total determination” from all 27 E.U. countries for more severe sanctions targeting oil and coal. Europe’s dependence on Russian oil, natural gas and coal had left energy sanctions off the table amid fears the entire continent could plunge into recession.

Six charred bodies the latest grisly discovery in Bucha

The evidence of heinous acts committed in the towns around the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv gets more horrific by the day.

On Tuesday, Associated Press journalists saw six burned and blackened corpses piled together just off a residential street near a playground, the latest gruesome scene to emerge from Bucha as world leaders push for Russia to be held accountable.

One charred body had arms raised in supplication, the face contorted in a scream. The skull of another had a bullet hole in the left temple. A child's small, blackened foot could be seen in the tangle of bodies.

The circumstances regarding their death remain a mystery, but they join the growing list of atrocities discovered after Russian troops withdrew from the areas around Kyiv.

While Russian officials deny responsibility and claim the abhorrent images seen worldwide were staged, eyewitness accounts, journalists' reports and satellite imagery confirm a tale of unspeakable savagery committed upon civilians young and old.

“It’s horrible,” said Ukrainian Interior Minister Denys Monastyrsky at the scene.

Pentagon pledges anti-tank missiles

The Pentagon announced late Tuesday that $100 million worth of Javelin anti-tank missiles will be sent to Ukraine to meet an urgent need, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said in a statement.

The missiles have helped Ukrainian forces mount a fierce, effective resistance to Russian troops who invaded Ukraine in late February.

The White House has sent $1.7 billion in military aid since then.

Biden to ban investment in Russia as part of new sanctions package

The Biden administration will announce new sanctions Wednesday that include a ban on new investment in Russia in response to atrocities in Ukraine, among them recent revelations of barbaric acts in the town of Bucha that “show further evidence of war crimes,” according to sources familiar with the decision.

The penalties, made in coordination with G7 and European Union allies, also involve increased sanctions on financial institutions and state-owned enterprises and also on Russian government officials and their family members.

A Biden administration official said the measures are designed to “degrade key instruments of Russian state power, impose acute and immediate economic harm on Russia, and hold accountable the Russian kleptocracy that funds and supports Putin’s war.”

As a result of sanctions on Russia following President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, Russia’s economy is forecast to contract as much as 15% or more in 2022, according to the official.

“The financial system in Russia is near the brink of collapse,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said, defending the effectiveness of sanctions to date. “It is more and more difficult for President Putin to fund this war every single day. That has an impact.”

Biden on Monday called for a war crimes trial for Putin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy detailed the carnage in towns around Kyiv during an address to NATO on Tuesday, accusing Russian troops of killing “entire families, adults and children.”

Milley urges US to build new bases in Eastern Europe

The U.S. should establish permanent bases with rotating forces in new Eastern European locations as a hedge against Russian aggression, the top U.S military officer told Congress on Tuesday.

Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the bases could be funded by other countries such as Poland and the Baltic nations — Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania -- that want more U.S. troops to provide protection from Russia. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said any effort to expand security in Eastern Europe is a “work in progress” that probably will be discussed at the NATO summit in June.

“I believe that a lot of our European allies, especially those such as the Baltics or Poland and Romania, and elsewhere — they’re very, very willing to establish permanent bases,'' Milley said. ""They’ll build them, they’ll pay for them.”

Zelenskyy urges UN to punish Russia for war crimes

In his address to the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reiterated that Russia had committed war crimes and said the U.N. must hold Russia leaders accountable to show other potential war criminals ""how they will be punished if the biggest one is punished.""

He also called for soldiers who savagely attacked civilians – and those who issued the orders – to face trial for the apparent massacre by Russian forces in and around Kyiv and other major cities.

The Russian military killed ""anyone who served our country,"" Zelenskyy said Tuesday. Women were shot outside their homes as they searched for friends and loves ones, he said, and some were raped in front of their children. Zelenskyy reaffirmed that Ukrainian forces that retook cities found mass graves, revelations of atrocities and infrastructure destroyed by Russian forces.

""They killed entire families, adults and children, and they tried to burn their bodies,"" said Zelenskyy, who urged the U.N. to provide security guarantees to Ukraine. Since Russia holds veto power, though, the Security Council will be unable to act.

However, there is growing momentum in Europe to ban Russian coal, and possibly to impose sanctions on imports of its oil and natural gas, which could deliver a major blow to the struggling Russian economy.

Ukraine says satellite images reveal brutality of Russian forces

Satellite images taken weeks ago of the town of Bucha outside Kyiv show bodies of civilians on a street, undercutting the Russian claims that Ukrainian forces staged the scene when they retook the city, Reuters reported.

Maxar Technologies provided nine images taken of Bucha on March 18, 19 and 31 to Reuters, and at least four of the images appear to show bodies on the street. Ukraine forces took back the city last week.

Ukraine says 410 dead civilians were found in Kyiv-area towns recently retaken from Russian forces. In Bucha, 280 people were buried in mass graves, according to Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The Ukrainian prosecutor-general’s office has described one room discovered in Bucha as a “torture chamber.”

Zelenskyy told the U.N. Security Council that satellite images show what really happened during the attacks on Bucha, adding, ""we can conduct full and transparent investigations.""

Atrocities near Kyiv fuel global outrage. Will it be a tipping point in the war?

Human Rights Watch: Russia using banned mines

Russian forces are using banned anti-personnel mines as they pull back from cities in Ukraine, a Human Rights Watch report says.

Russia is using a device known as the Pom-3 Medallion, a mine capable of killing people within a 50-foot radius, Human Rights Watch said.

The 1997 International Mine Ban Treaty prohibits the manufacture and use of antipersonnel mines. Ukraine is one of 164 nations that signed the treaty. The United States and Russia have not signed it.

""They are mining all this territory,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a video address. ""Mining houses, equipment, even the bodies of killed people. Too many tripwire mines, too many other dangers."" Read more here.

1.2 billion global citizens left vulnerable by war's disruption

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres addressed the Security Council before Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday, saying the world is ""dealing with a full-fledged invasion"" in violation of the U.N. Charter.

The result: More than 10 million Ukrainians have fled their homes and more than 4 million of them have fled the country.

The war's victims, Guterres said, also include more than 1.2 billion citizens of developing nations struggling with rising prices and other economic issues aggravated by the war.

""It is more urgent by the day to silence the guns,"" Guterres said.

Website links Ukraine refugees with hosts around the globe

A group of Harvard University students have created a website to help Ukrainian refugees find housing around the world.

Ukrainetakeshelter.com, created by Avi Schiffmann and Marco Burstein, encourages everyone with space in their homes to post a listing. Refugees and hosts must provide identity verification either through government issued ID card or passport. Over 18,000 prospective hosts have signed up on the site. On a recent day, Burstein and Schiffman logged 800,000 users.

Burstein said he, Schiffman and Irish software engineer Daniel Conlon have been ""blown away"" by the response.

“We’ve heard all sorts of amazing stories of hosts and refugees getting connected all over the world,” Burstein said. “We have hosts in almost any country you can imagine from Hungary and Romania and Poland to Canada to Australia.""

State Department calls atrocities part of a 'broader, troubling campaign'

The credible reports of torture, rape and civilian executions in Ukraine are probably not the acts of rogue soldiers, State Department spokesman Ned Price said Monday.

'“They are part of a broader, troubling campaign,” he said at a State Department briefing.

Price said the world has been shocked by “the horrifying images of the Kremlin's brutality” in Bucha and other cities near Kyiv. Civilians, many with their hands tied, were apparently executed in the streets.

Others were dumped in mass graves. As they’ve retreated, Russians have also left behind land mines and booby traps to injure more Ukrainians and slow recovery, Price said.

The apparent atrocities will be one of the topics of discussion when Secretary of State Antony Blinken meets with his NATO counterparts in Belgium this week.

Allies are already discussing additional sanctions and ways to help Ukraine document war crimes for a criminal prosecution, Price said. The U.S. has contributed both money and manpower to help Ukraine’s prosecutor general compile a case.

German president admits mistakes with Russia

Germany’s president is admitting mistakes in policy toward Russia in his previous job as foreign minister. President Frank-Walter Steinmeier served twice as foreign minister, most recently from 2013 to 2017, and pursued dialogue with Russian President Vladimir Putin to cultivate energy ties. Russia provides Germany with about one-third of it oil and gas and more than half its coal.

Ukraine and Polish officials have criticized Steinmeier for being too close to Russia. Ukraine's ambassador to Berlin boycotted a peace concert with Russian artists organized by Steinmeier.

Steinmeier told ZDF television Tuesday that “we failed on many points,” including efforts to encourage Russia toward democracy and respecting human rights.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said fresh sanctions from the West would not be ""enough"" to respond to the atrocities Ukrainians say have been committed in the town of Bucha, near Kyiv, where grisly images purportedly show slain civilians.

""There will definitely be a new sanctions package against Russia,"" Zelenskyy said in a video address Sunday night. ""But I'm sure that's not enough,"" he said as he made an impassioned plea for a stronger international response to Russia's invasion.

Residents of Bucha have accused Russian forces of targeting civilians in a deadly campaign that Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk said left more than 300 people dead before troops pulled out of the city. Russia's Defense Ministry has denied the claims, calling them a ""provocation,"" despite photographs and video showing damaged city streets strewn with dead bodies.

Meanwhile, in southern Ukraine, heavy fighting has continued in the besieged port city of Mariupol, according to Britain's defense ministry. It said as efforts to evacuate residents from the besieged city were set to continue Monday.

As Russian forces have retreated around Kyiv, Ukrainian forces have gained ground in the country’s northeast and south. The southern city of Mariupol has been encircled and under siege by Russian troops for weeks, but has not been captured. Neither has another southern coastal city, Mykolaiv, also a target of Russian attacks. Dueling artillery battles have become the norm as infantry forces on both sides dig in.

But even though Russia was plagued by low morale, logistical problems and casualties, its units, for the most part, did not surrender en masse or flee.

The Russian failure boiled down to one point, analysts said: doing too much at once.

“Eventually it became clear their initial campaign was a completely unworkable military strategy,” Mr. Kofman said. “They were competing along axes of advancement, and they were basically advancing in opposite directions on the way. There was no way they were going to succeed.”

'Failing that, the only option left to us is to put the predators to sleep,' he said, describing it as 'the only option'.

'It is unimaginably painful to talk about this, but the main priority now is the lives of people.'

He added on a video: 'After yesterday's massive shelling by missiles and planes, the [zoo] is practically destroyed.

'One more shelling - and the lions, tigers, bears, distraught with fear, may be free and go towards Kharkiv or to nearby villages,' said zoo owner Alexander Feldman (pictured)

Mr Feldman said that 'after yesterday's massive shelling by missiles and planes, the [zoo] is practically destroyed'

The zoo owner added that he will try to save 'the little jaguars' and 'little panthers' if possible

'The aviaries have been destroyed. All the infrastructure has been destroyed.

'By some miracle, the tigers and lions have survived. Their cages are badly damaged.

'By tonight, we will decide either to put the bears to sleep or move them. If there are any ideas, maybe we will save some and try to save the little jaguars.

'Maybe we will save little panthers. But all the other animals are likely to be destroyed.'

The owner of the popular zoo said: 'Feldman Ecopark no longer exists. Now this can be said quite definitely.

'Yesterday and today it was again subjected to massive shelling and bombardment. Infrastructure destroyed, enclosures destroyed.'

Shelling on 17 March killed two two orangutans and chimpanzees. Two days later nine deer were slaughtered and 20 escaped to the woods.

Last week a video showed kangaroos being transported to a new home from Feldman Ecopark.

A van driver fleeing with the frightened kangaroos had said: 'It is one month since the war began and we keep evacuating the animals.'

'These kangaroos are already safe,' said the zoo. 'This is very good, because their enclosures, unfortunately, were repeatedly shelled. We believe that now they will be fine.'

A statement said: 'Many thanks to volunteers and employees who take risks to save animals, as well as to our many friends - caring people, businesses and non-governmental organisations who help us financially and make our rescue operations possible.

'Your support truly saves lives.'

While the kangaroos were saved from Feldman Ecopark, sadly some have been killed in the attacks.

'We cannot avoid tragedies,' a spokesman said at the time. 'Four fallow deer and three Welsh goats became victims of another barbaric shelling.

'The list of victims of aggression among our pets is growing - it already includes large cats, primates, ungulates, marsupials, and birds...Feldman Ecopark has been on the line of fire for the last month.'

The zoo once had more than 300 species.

It comes as the Ukrainian emergency services posted photos of dead animals in Chernihiv, suggesting domestic creatures were killed by Russian troops as shells littered the region.

The post said: 'Chernihiv region, our land is unhappy...Shells in every cellar, in every nook and cranny...Poor demilitarized domestic dogs and cows that did not threaten anyone.'

'Unlike us humans, animals do not feel hatred for these creatures that came to our Ukraine for one purpose only. And even they, these cows and dogs, were destroyed.

'This is the whole Russian army - killing women, children, animals.'
