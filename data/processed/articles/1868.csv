In a tweet, Grossi said that the mission ""will be the first in a series of such nuclear safety and security missions to Ukraine"", reports Xinhua news agency

He also told a press conference in Vienna that the IAEA mission would be in Chernobyl ""very, very soon"".

The IAEA chief has just returned from his recent visits to and Russia, during which he held discussions with officials on both sides about ensuring the security of the war-torn nation's nuclear facilities.

The UN nuclear watchdog said on Thursday that Russian forces which had been in control of the Chernobyl plant were leaving the facility and had transferred control of the plant to Ukrainian personnel.

At Friday's press conference, Grossi said he had not discussed with Russian officials why Russian forces left Chernobyl.

Grossi said the IAEA was still unable to confirm reports that Russian forces were contaminated with radiation at the Chernobyl plant.

He added that the general radiation level around the plant was ""quite normal"".

""There was a relatively higher level of localized radiation because of the movement of heavy vehicles at the time of the occupation of the plant, and apparently this might have been the case again on the way out,"" he said.

Ukrainian authorities said Russian forces had been in control of the plant since Moscow started its invasion on February 24.

The Chernobyl plant, some 110 km north of the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, witnessed the worst nuclear accident in human history on April 26, 1986.

According to The Wall Street Journal, Grossi has returned to Vienna on Friday following a three-day journey to Ukraine and Russia. The IAEA chief further met with officials from both countries to discuss safeguarding Ukraine's nuclear facilities security. Taking to Twitter, Grossi said that the mission ""will be the first in a series of such nuclear safety and security missions to Ukraine.""

This came after the IAEA has asserted on Thursday that Ukraine had notified the agency that Russian troops who were in charge of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant were departing and handing the responsibility to Ukrainian troops. Further, during a news conference on Friday, Grossi stated that he had not discussed with Russian authorities why Russian personnel had been departing Chernobyl.

IAEA is still unable to validate reports that Russian soldiers were exposed to radiation

According to Grossi, the IAEA is still unable to validate reports that Russian soldiers were exposed to radiation at the Chernobyl facility. He went on to say that the level of radiation near the facility was ""quite normal"". ""There was a relatively higher level of localized radiation because of the movement of heavy vehicles at the time of the occupation of the plant, and apparently this might have been the case again on the way out,"" citing Grossi, Xinhua reported.

Grossi even highlighted that the IAEA would begin delivering critical supplies to Ukraine's nuclear facilities next week and dispatching IAEA experts and inspectors to provide help. He added that they would also attempt to restore the functionality of monitoring equipment at all of Ukraine's nuclear installations, allowing them to guarantee that radioactive material is not being transferred for illegitimate purposes, The Wall Street Journal reported.

According to Ukrainian officials, the Russian military had been in possession of the factory since February 24, when the Russia-Ukraine war commenced. On April 26, 1986, the Chernobyl nuclear power facility, located 110 kilometres north of Kyiv, Ukraine, experienced one of the greatest nuclear disasters.

Why it matters: The power plant — the site of the 1986 nuclear disaster — fell under Russian control in the first day of its invasion of Ukraine. While the plant is inoperative, the site still houses and processes nuclear waste.

The IAEA confirmed Thursday that several Russian troops had left the plant and the city of Slavutych, where many of the plant's staff live. The troops transferred control to Ukrainian personnel before moving toward Belarus.

Previously, Russia held the plant's staff members hostage and forced them to operate the plant for around 600 hours before they were allowed to leave.

The plant lost direct power and had to rely on emergency diesel generators for several days after power lines were damaged.

Ukrainian officials said there were still some Russian troops in the ""exclusion zone"" around the power plant on Friday morning but did not say what they were doing or where they might be headed, according to Reuters.

What they're saying: ""I will head an IAEA assistance and support mission to the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant as soon as possible. It will be the first in a series of such nuclear safety and security missions to Ukraine,"" said Rafael Grossi, director general of the IAEA, in a tweet Friday.

During a press conference Friday in Vienna, Grossi said the IAEA has not received data from the plant's monitoring systems for several days now.

He had just returned to Vienna from trips to Ukraine and Russia for meetings with government officials earlier this week about the safety of nuclear facilities amid the war.

The big picture: Russia still controls at least one other Ukrainian nuclear facility.

It seized the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station in southeastern Ukraine — the largest nuclear station in Europe — after battling with Ukrainian forces on March 4.

It's unclear if Russia intends to relinquish control of Zaporizhzhia as well, or if the withdrawal from Chernobyl was part of its supposed shift in focus toward the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine.

Grossi said Russian officials did not explain their withdrawal from Chernobyl in meetings earlier this week.

He said the “assistance and support” of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to the Chernobyl mission “will be the first in a series of such nuclear safety and security missions to Ukraine.”

“The general radiation situation around the plant is quite normal. There was a relatively higher level of localised radiation because of the movement of heavy vehicles at the time of the occupation of the plant and apparently this might have been the case again on the way out. So we heard about the possibility of some personnel being contaminated but we don’t have any confirmation about that,"" Grossi said at a news conference.

Grossi is currently in the Russian city of Kaliningrad for talks with senior officials about nuclear issues in Ukraine.

“What we know is what we want to see as far as the nuclear power facilities in Ukraine are concerned and this (Russian troop withdrawal) is undoubtedly a step in the right direction. We had been saying that the plant needed to be operated by its own natural operators which was the case, that it had to have a physical integrity protected, that the people there had to work under normal circumstances,” Grossi said.

Nine of Ukraine’s 15 operational reactors are currently in use, including two at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhya facility, the agency said.

It comes after Ukraine said Russian troops had left the radioactive waste facilities with radiation sickness though some remained nearby.

""As they ran away from the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the Russian occupiers took members of the National Guard, whom they had held hostage since Feb 24, with them,"" the state nuclear agency Energoatom said in a statement on Telegram, citing plant workers.

""There is also evidence that a column of Russian soldiers who are besieging the town of Slavutych is currently being formed to move towards Belarus,"" it said.

It gave no details on the condition of the soldiers it said were exposed to radiation, and it did not say how many were affected.

Since the Russian invasion, there have been fears of increased radiological risks in Chernobyl. The workforce there oversees the safe storage of spent fuel rods and the concrete-entombed ruins of the reactor that exploded in 1986.

Chernobyl's number four reactor exploded on April 26, 1986, causing the world's worst nuclear accident which killed hundreds and spread radioactive contamination west across Europe. The site lies near the Belarus border.

UN atomic watchdog chief Rafael Grossi was in Russia on Thursday ahead of talks the following day with top Russian officials, after visiting neighbouring Ukraine.

Grossi visited a nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine on Wednesday on his first trip to the country since Russia's invasion raised fears of a nuclear accident.

The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency has repeatedly warned of the dangers of the conflict -- the first in a country with a vast nuclear estate.

""Grossi arrived in Kaliningrad today for talks with senior Russian officials tomorrow morning,"" the IAEA wrote in a statement late Thursday.

After his visit to Ukraine, the agency was in close consultations with Ukrainian authorities towards sending its first ""assistance and support mission"" to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the next few days, it added.

Grossi was expected to return to the IAEA's headquarters in the Austrian capital Vienna on Friday and hold a press conference later in the afternoon.

Ukraine has 15 reactors at four active nuclear power plants, as well as stores of nuclear waste, including at Chernobyl -- the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster in 1986.

Ukrainian officials said late Thursday that Russians had withdrawn from Chernobyl after weeks of occupation.

Russian forces seized control of the defunct power plant site -- where radioactive waste is still stored -- on February 24, the first day of the invasion.

They also captured Europe's largest nuclear plant at Zaporizhzhia on March 4, sparking alarm when shelling caused a fire at a training facility.

Fears have been high throughout the five-week-long war of a potential nuclear accident, as Russia indiscriminately shells many parts of Ukraine. On March 3, shelling around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southeastern Ukraine exacerbated those fears.

“We delivered some equipment; this is a start,” International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi told reporters after returning to Vienna Friday from a field visit to Ukraine and meetings in Russia. “But we have a structured set of activities that are going to start as of next week.”

That assistance will include sending expert teams and equipment, as well as establishing a rapid assistance mechanism.

“In case there was a situation — an emergency — that maybe taking place, we are setting up a mechanism whereby we could be sending a team to assess and to assist almost immediately,” Grossi said.

Early in its invasion, Russian troops occupied the defunct Chernobyl plant. On Thursday, it was confirmed they were leaving. Reports emerged that hundreds of Russian soldiers had radiation poisoning after digging trenches in the most polluted part of the Exclusion Zone, known as the Red Forest.

Grossi said the general radiation situation around the plant is “quite normal” now and he could not confirm the reports about the Russian troops being sickened.

“There was a relatively higher level of localized radiation because of the movement of heavy vehicles at the time of the occupation of the plant, and apparently this might have been the case again on the way out,” Grossi said. “We heard about the possibility of some personnel being contaminated, but we don’t have any confirmation about that.”

The director general said that his staff would be moving to Chernobyl “very, very soon” and that there is a lot of technical work to be done there, as they have lost a lot of remote monitoring capabilities that need to be reconnected. He said that could be done quickly.",https://www.voanews.com/a/iaea-to-assist-in-safeguarding-ukraine-nuclear-sites-/6511136.html
