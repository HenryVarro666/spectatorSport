In addition to the 200 Stinger missiles, the Netherlands already dispatched the military equipment it committed to providing ""for Ukrainian self-defense against an armed attack by Russia,"" Hoekstra said. Some of that material was already sent, with more to be dispatched as soon as possible.

The cybersecurity assistance the Netherlands planned to provide earlier this week was delayed due to the Russian invasion. The government is still working with Ukrainian authorities to investigate how Dutch cyberdefense teams can be deployed to assist, Hoekstra said.

On Friday, military equipment was on its way from the Netherlands to Ukraine, Ollongren said on the television program Jinek.

The Cabinet previously announced it would supply 100 sniper rifles with associated ammunition, five weapon location radars, two battlefield surveillance radars, metal detectors and two wire-guided detection robots to detect naval mines. It would also send 3,000 combat helmets and 2,000 fragmentation vests, according to the Ministry of Defense.

The delivery was slightly delayed due to Russia‚Äôs complete invasion of Ukraine. ""We had a different logistical plan, but the attack by the Russians changed that,"" Ollongren said.

During a telephone conversation with Prime Minister Mark Rutte, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asked for even more military aid on Friday. The Ministry of Defense was already looking into the request that day, Ollongren said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to do our very best to help,‚Äù she said.

The Netherlands is also looking into how humanitarian and financial aid can be given to Zelensky's government. More clarity on this should be provided in the coming days.

The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making ‚Äúthe most important decision of their life -- to fight.‚Äù

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders ‚Äúgave us a maximum of five.‚Äù

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the major developments on Russia's invasion, how Kyiv is fighting back, the plight of civilians, and Western reaction. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.

Zelenskiy noted ‚Äúthose who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it‚Äôs to the bottom‚Äù of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

‚ÄúThe number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,‚Äù Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.‚Äù

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia‚Äôs accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

With Ukrainian forces putting up real resistance in the face of the Russian advance, Western officials say there is a genuine interest in ensuring President Vladimir Putin pays the maximum price for the invasion.

Germany in particular was criticised this month ahead the invasion for only stumping up some 5,000 helmets to send to Ukraine, a gesture that the mayor of Kyiv, former world boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, said had left him ""speechless"".

""What will they send us next? Pillows?"" he asked the Bild daily.

France and other Western states were wary of arms deliveries they feared could provoke President Vladimir Putin into action at a time when diplomacy was still alive.

Since Putin unleashed the attack on Ukraine on February 24 however, everything has changed.

Germany said Saturday its army would transfer 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger-class surface-to-air missiles to Ukraine, a U-turn from its longstanding policy of banning weapon exports to conflict zones.

France was also carrying out deliveries of defensive weapons to Kyiv, according to its military. Ukraine's embassy in Paris said it had in particular requested anti-aircraft hardware.

'Anti-war coalition'

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday that ""partners"" were sending weapons to help Kyiv fight Russian troops, adding that he had spoken by phone with French leader Emmanuel Macron.

""Weapons and equipment from our partners are on the way to Ukraine,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""The anti-war coalition is working!""

After the German announcement he tweeted: ""Keep it up!""

On Saturday, Belgium announced it was providing 2,000 machine guns and 3,800 tons of fuel to the Ukrainian army.

The Dutch defence ministry said it had delivered sniper rifles and helmets, while 200 Stinger anti-aircraft missiles would be on their way as ""soon as possible"".

The Czech Republic meanwhile is delivering 30,000 pistols, 7,000 assault rifles, 3,000 machine guns, several dozen sniper guns and about a million cartridges.

The United States is providing Ukraine with $350 million in additional military equipment to fight off Russia's ""brutal and unprovoked assault"", Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced Saturday.

Britain has said it is ready to provide Ukraine with additional military support, including lethal defensive weapons.

But with military analysts saying that Moscow has not even used half of the some 180,000 troops massed on the Ukrainian border in Russia and its ally Belarus, it remains unclear whether this sudden surge of help can make a difference.

'No time to lose'

The Russian defence ministry said Saturday the army had been given orders to broaden its offensive in Ukraine ""from all directions"" after Kyiv refused to hold talks in Belarus.

The problem is that few ""genuinely believed"" in a Russian invasion on all of Ukrainian territory -- ""not even Zelensky"", said General Vincent Desportes, a former director France's prestigious Ecole de guerre, which trains top officers.

Now, ""everyone is doing what they can"" but ""no one has billions of extra armaments. All European armies are under-equipped"", he told AFP.

""When you send 2,000 machine guns, you take them from your own stock. European armies are poor armies,"" Desportes said.

Western diplomats at NATO headquarters in Brussels say that even in the face of the Russian military there is an interest in slowing down the advance and making the invasion as costly for Putin as possible.

But after agreeing what to send to Ukraine there also remains the challenge of being able to get the equipment into the country and being able distribute it.

A French presidential official, who asked not to be named, said Paris was hoping that a combination of Ukrainian resistance combined with sanctions against Russia could together help force a ceasefire.

Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawieck lambasted the lack of Western help until now. Ukrainians, he said, ""are also fighting for us. For our freedom, our sovereignty. So that we aren't next in line.

""Russia wants to destroy our world as we know it. We have to act now. We have no time to lose,"" he added.
