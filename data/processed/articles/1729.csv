""It is now clear that the goals set in San Francisco in 1945 during the creation of a global international security organization have not been achieved. And it is impossible to achieve them without reforms,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the UN Security Council at the meeting on the Bucha massacre / Photo credit: Office of the President of Ukraine

23:54 Presidential Office: President Zelenskyy held a speech to the UN Security Council

His appeal took place on April 5, at the emergency meeting of the Council on the killings in Bucha. The Ukrainian President gave examples of war crimes committed by Russian occupiers in the city and stressed that there are more of their deeds in other occupied cities of Ukraine yet unknown. He called for a transparent and thorough investigation of these crimes.

""So where is the security that the Security Council must guarantee? There is no security. Although there is a Security Council, as if nothing happened. So where is the peace that the United Nations was created to guarantee?"" he said after pointing out that Russian aggression poses danger to the whole world, not just Ukraine. President said Russia is violating the UN Charter from the very first article, committing ""the most heinous war crimes of all time since the end of World War II"".

He offered two options to the United Nations: to exclude Russia, which abuses its veto power to continue its aggression, from the Security Council or to change the format of the UN's work. Ukraine's leader offered to convene a global conference on security and establish a new UN office in Ukraine:

""Just as the Geneva office specializes in human rights, just as the Nairobi office specializes in the field of environmental protection, the Kyiv U-24 Office can specialize in preventive measures to maintain peace.""

He said, if Russia continues to abuse its rights in the UN, the organization itself can be dissolved: ""if your current format is unalterable and there is simply no way out, then the only option would be to dissolve yourself altogether.""

22:50 Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights: the occupiers tortured Ukrainian women in captivity

Among the 86 soldiers released from Russian captivity were women who had been subjected to torture and ill-treatment in captivity. It was reported by Ombudswoman for human rights Lyudmyla Denisova. The women were taken to Belarus and then to a pre-trial detention center in Bryansk, Russia, where the women were tortured and threatened.

Russians unstoppably attempted to break the captives' morale: the women were stripped naked in the presence of men, forced to squat, constantly interrogated, and their hair was cut. Some of the women prisoners of war were forced to take part in the filming of propaganda stories, demanding to switch to Russian.

Such actions by the Russian Federation are a violation of Article 13 of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, stressed Ombudswoman Denisova.

22:24 Center for Countering Disinformation: world's countries continue to expel Russian diplomats

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Sweden has decided to expel three Russian diplomats. Last week, the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the expulsion of 15 Russian diplomats and Italy announced the expulsion of 30. Yesterday, the German government recognized 40 Russian diplomats as ""persona non grata"", 35 diplomats were granted this status from France, and another 35 from Slovakia, 27 from Spain. Activities of the expelled ones were declared as contrary to the interests of those countries' national security.

In total, more than 150 Russian diplomats were expelled from the EU in the past two weeks. By doing so, the European diplomatic community condemns the war crimes of the Russian occupiers in Ukraine, the Center noted.

The Guardian: furthermore, in just two days more than 200 Russian diplomats were expelled from the EU. The Guardian and France 24 draw connections between these decisions and the killings in Bucha.

According to The Guardian, 206 Russian diplomats and embassy staff have been told since Monday they are no longer welcome to stay by governments in Italy, France, Germany and elsewhere. It brings the total of expelled Russian diplomats and embassy workers to more than 325, with more expected to follow.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the meeting with representatives of the Ukrainian media / Photo credit: Office of the President of Ukraine

20:30 President Zelenskyy: after the end of this war, the issue of security should be number one in Ukraine.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy discussed the prospect of a security agreement in an interview to the Ukrainian media. The idea of security guarantees was first explained at the Ukraine-Russia peace talks in Istanbul at the end of March. The Ukrainian president said, there is no need for a large circle of guarantor countries, but a few ""serious players"":

""We need a circle of states that are ready to provide any weapons within 24 hours. We need individual countries on which sanctions policy really depends so that these sanctions are deeply elaborated in advance. So that in the first second when we feel the threat from the Russian Federation, these states will unite and within three days introduce everything at once, block everything""

According to Zelenskyy, representatives of some countries have already expressed a desire to become guarantors of security, but no joint meeting has taken place yet. Ukraine is discussing the provision of guarantees with France, the United States, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Poland, Italy, and Israel. Also, he noted that even if Ukraine signs the most powerful security agreement, Russia may return. Therefore, it is necessary to build a state that will be able to defend itself.

""I think all our people will be our great army. We cannot talk about ""Switzerland of the future"" – probably, our state will be able to be like this a long time after. But we will definitely become a ""big Israel"" with its own face. We will not be surprised that we will have representatives of the Armed Forces or the National Guard in all institutions, supermarkets, cinemas, there will be people with weapons. I am sure that our security issue will be number one in the next ten years,"" the President said.""

The less resources Chernihiv consumes now, the sooner we will restore it"", — Chaus said.

15:01 The Security Service of Ukraine: the occupiers are preparing a large-scale falsification in Mariupol. They plan to gather in one place the bodies of the Mariupol people they killed and pretend to be mass victims of Ukrainian troops.

08:40 US and UK to request Russia’s removal from the UN human rights council.

The United States and Britain announced plans to seek Russia’s suspension from the UN human rights council following allegations that Russian troops systematically executed civilians in Bucha, Ukraine, – The Guardian reports.

Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the United Nations, called for the international body to suspend Russia ideally some time this week. In a statement published late on Sunday, she said:

Russia’s participation on the Human Rights Council is a farce.

It hurts the credibility of the Council and the UN writ large. And it is simply wrong. Which is why we believe it is time for the UN General Assembly to suspend them.

“My message to those 140 countries who have courageously stood together is: the images out of Bucha and devastation across Ukraine require us to now match our words with action.”

“We cannot let a member state that is subverting every principle we hold dear to continue to participate” in the council, she said. A vote on Russia’s suspension could be held by Thursday, according to the US.

British foreign secretary Liz Truss was in agreement, saying: “Given strong evidence of war crimes, including reports of mass graves and heinous butchery in Bucha, Russia cannot remain a member of the UN Human Rights Council. Russia must be suspended.”

Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said he spoke with UN secretary general Antonio Guterres about events in Bucha and tweeted: “No place for Russia on the UN Human Rights Council.”

“Ukraine will use all available UN mechanisms to collect evidence and hold Russian war criminals to account,” Kuleba said.

08:20 The President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky is set to address the United Nations security council today, after saying it is in Kyiv’s interest to have the most open investigation into the killing of civilians in Ukraine.

During the address he is expected to demand tough new sanctions on Moscow over killings in the town of Bucha he has called “war crimes” and “genocide,” – The Guardian reports.

Speaking on Monday, April 4, he said that in Bucha, where mass graves and bodies were found after Ukraine took the town back from Russian forces, at least 300 civilians have been killed, and he expects that in Borodyanka and other towns the number of casualties may be even higher.

“I would like to emphasise that we are interested in the most complete, transparent investigation, the results of which will be known and explained to the entire international community,” Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address.

07:20 General Staff: operational information as of on 06.00 on April 5, 2022 regarding the Russian invasion. Key points:

The russian federation is regrouping troops and concentrating its efforts on preparing an offensive operation in the east of our country. The goal is to establish full control over the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.

The enemy is trying to improve the position of units in the Tavriya and Pivdennobuzhsky operational areas.

The aggressor’s units withdrawn from Polissya and Sivershchyna are moving to new operational areas. The redeployment of troops of the Central Military District from the territory of Ukraine has been completed. The designated units of the above, after the completion of the restoration of combat capability, will be moved to the area of the settlement Valuyki and included in the offensive groups of troops.

The russian federation redeploy its units from the Republic of Belarus to the territory of russia. A significant part of the aircraft and helicopters of the Air and Space Forces of the Armed Forces of the russian federation were relocated. The movement of columns of armaments and military equipment on the territory of the republic of belarus in the direction of the railway stations Gomel, Yelsk and Mozyr for loading on railway echelons is noted.

The enemy concentrated its main efforts on preparations for the resumption of the offensive with the help of separate units of the 6th and 20th All-Army, 1st Tank Army, Baltic and Northern Fleets, as well as attempts to surround the Joint Forces.

The occupiers continue to blockade Kharkiv, continuing artillery shelling and further destroying the city's residential neighbourhoods and infrastructure.

Invaders inflicted massive artillery and air strikes on the city of Mariupol.

In the Pivdennobuzhsky direction the occupying forces carry out assault actions with the support of artillery.

The russian troops carried out attacks of Mykolayiv with the cluster munitions forbidden by the Geneva convention. Civilian quarters and medical facilities, including a children's hospital, came under enemy fire. There are dead and wounded, including children.

The russian occupying forces continue to suffer losses. They have big problems with the staffing of combat units and support units. The enemy's personnel were demoralized, which led to an increase in the number of desertions and the refusal of servicemen of the armed forces of the russian federation to take part in the war on the territory of Ukraine.

07:40 The United Nations’ human rights office says there have been 3,455 civilian casualties since the war in Ukraine began on 24 February.

The figure includes more than 1,400 deaths and over 2,000 injuries but the actual number is believed to be considerably higher, the agency said in recently published report.

Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes.

The heaviest casualties continue to be reported from the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in the east.

07:00 The Center for Countering Disinformation at the National Security and Defense Council reports Russia creating ""information bubble"" regarding Bucha war crimes.

Russia is setting up the so-called information bubble defying the fact of the genocide of Ukrainians in Bucha. If users search “Bucha” on Russia’s Yandex, the engine displays the town’s pre-war photos, - Ukrinform reports ciying the Center for Countering Disinformation at the National Security and Defense Council,.

""One example is search results for ‘Bucha’ on Google and Yandex. Indeed, Google displays information about the destroyed town and people tortured to death, while Yandex shows only pre-war cityscapes. That's what Russian propaganda truth looks like,"" reads the report delivered via Telegram.

Irpin, Bucha, Hostomel, and the entire Kyiv region were recently liberated from Russian invaders. Mass killings of civilians by the occupation forces were recorded in the liberated settlements.

Already discovered in the areas are bodies of raped women, almost totally burned, slain local government officials, murdered children, the elderly, and draft-aged men. Many bodies have traces of torture and have their hands tied. Many were shot point-blank.

06:30 The President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky appeared in a video message at the Grammy awards, calling for viewers to “tell the truth about the war” across social networks and on TV.

“Fill the silence with your music. Fill it today to tell our story. Tell the truth about the war on your social networks, on TV, support us in any way you can any, but not silence. And then peace will come to all our cities the war is destroying,” – The Guardian reports.

03:50 The President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky: If we had got necessary weapons, we could have saved thousands of people.

Ukraine must get all the necessary weapons to drive Russian occupiers out as soon as possible and liberate Ukrainian cities.

The relevant statement was made by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in his video address, - Ukrinform reports.

“I emphasize once again: Ukraine must get all the necessary weapons to drive the occupiers out of our land as soon as possible, to liberate our cities. And if we had already got what we needed – all these planes, tanks, artillery, anti-missile and anti-ship weapons, we could have saved thousands of people,” Zelensky told.

According to the President of Ukraine, he does not blame the world leaders. He blames only the Russian military.

“But you could have helped. I will continue to say this to the face of all those on whom the decision on weapons for Ukraine depends,” Zelensky stressed.

A reminder that such settlements as Irpin, Bucha, Hostomel, and the entire Kyiv Region, were liberated from Russian invaders. The mass murders of civilians were recorded within the liberated areas.

Among the victims of war crimes committed by Russian forces are raped women whose bodies they tried to burn, as well as local government officials killed, children, the elderly, and men. Many have their hands tied, there are traces of torture, and many people were shot in the back of the head.

02:55 The New York Times: Satellite images show Bucha killings occurred during Russian occupation.

An analysis of satellite images by The New York Times rebuts claims by Russia that the killing of civilians in the town of Bucha occurred after its soldiers had left the town.

The relevant statement was made by NYT on Monday, April 4, - Ukrinform reports.

A review of videos and satellite imagery by the publication shows that many of the civilians were killed more than three weeks ago, when Russia’s military was in control of the town.

One video, filmed by a local council member on April 2, shows multiple bodies scattered along Yablonska Street in Bucha. Satellite images provided by Maxar Technologies show that at least 11 of those had been on the street since March 11, when Russia, by its own account, occupied the town.

To confirm when the bodies appeared, and when the civilians were likely killed, the NYT investigation team conducted a before-and-after analysis of satellite imagery. The images show dark objects of similar size to a human body appearing on Yablonska Street between March 9 and March 11. The objects appear in the precise positions in which the bodies were found after Ukrainian forces reclaimed Bucha, as the footage from April 2 shows. Further analysis shows that the objects remained in those positions for over three weeks.

The causes of death are unclear. Some of the bodies were beside what appears to be an impact crater. Others were near abandoned cars. Three of the bodies lay beside bicycles. Some have their hands bound behind their backs with white cloth. The bodies were scattered over more than half a mile of Yablonska Street.

A second video taken on Yablonska Street shows three more bodies. One lies beside a bicycle, another near an abandoned car. Satellite imagery shows that the abandoned cars and the nearby body appear between March 20 and 21.

These are just some of the civilian bodies discovered since Saturday. The Associated Press published images of at least six dead men lying together in the rear of an office building, some with hands tied behind their backs. The building is one mile west of the other victims found along Yablonska Street.

Another mile further along, a photographer with The Times discovered the body of a man with a gunshot wound to his head lying beside a bicycle.

Russia’s Ministry of Defense denied responsibility, claiming that the bodies had been recently placed on the streets after “all Russian units withdrew completely from Bucha”, i.e. after March 30, 2022.

Russia claimed that the images were “another hoax” and called for an emergency UN Security Council meeting on what it called “provocations of Ukrainian radicals” in Bucha.

However, Russia’s request was denied. On April 5, 2022, the United Kingdom is calling a UN Security Council meeting to discuss the mass killings of civilians in Kyiv Region, committed by Russian troops.

01:20 An adviser to the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine Viktor Andrusiv: russia’s advance in Donbas direction may slow down.

The relevant statement was made by Advisor to Ukrainian Internal Affairs Minister Viktor Andrusiv on Facebook, an Ukrinform correspondent reports.

“Only the insignificant forces of the troops withdrawn can be transferred to the Donbas direction. Most of them were subject to rotation and will be restoring, and they will be able to get involved not sooner than in a month. Hence, the advance in the Donbas direction may slow down,” Andrusiv wrote.

In his words, Russians intentionally shelled one of the central districts in the city. There are no military facilities nearby.

The Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal says that all Russian soldiers and their leaders will be brought to justice without fail.

""What happened in Bucha, Hostomel, Irpin, Motyzhyn and other towns and villages around Kyiv is an illustration of evil. This is one of the episodes of their terrible crimes, which are also happening right now in Mariupol, Izium, Kharkiv, Kherson, Donetsk, Luhansk, Mykolaiv, Zaporizhia regions,"" Shmyhal said in his address on Monday evening.

The Prime Minister noted that ""just as the Nazis wanted to finally solve the “Jewish issue” 80 years ago, so now Russia wants to finally solve the “Ukrainian issue””.

The Russian military have shelled a village in Kryvyi Rih District, Dnipropetrovsk Region.

The relevant statement was made by Dnipropetrovsk Regional Council Head Mykola Lukashuk on Telegram, an Ukrinform correspondent reports.

WAR BULLETIN

April 3, 6.30 p.m. EST

Liberation of the Kyiv region, particularly the towns of Bucha and Irpin, revealed the scale of Russia’s atrocities committed against Ukrainian people. The Bucha massacre proves that Russian hatred towards Ukrainians is beyond anything Europe has seen since World War II.

Law enforcement agencies collect all necessary information to assess the scale of atrocities. The mayor of Bucha Anatoly Fedoruk informed that 280 people were buried in mass graves. Killed people lie on the streets. Dozens of them were found with tied hands. While leaving, the invaders mined dead bodies and civilian buildings.

According to Ukraine’s Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova, 410 bodies of killed civilians have been taken out of the territory of the Kyiv region for examination. In the coming days, law enforcement agencies will uncover more details, and the real scale of the Bucha massacre will become more clear.

Since the beginning of the invasion, Russian army has already murdered thousands of civilians in Ukraine, including children, kidnapped and tortured activists and local leaders, looted houses and raped Ukrainian women and girls. Mass war crimes, reports of looting and rape prove that Russian troops have no red lines or moral values whatsoever.

The Human Rights Watch has sent its representatives to Kyiv, Chernihiv and Kharkiv regions to document the evidence of Russian war crimes in Ukraine.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has decided to establish a special mechanism of justice in Ukraine to investigate and prosecute all crimes committed by the invaders. This mechanism will bring together the efforts of national and international experts.

Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba urged the International Criminal Court and international organizations to send their missions to Bucha and other liberated towns and villages of the Kyiv region, to thoroughly collect all the evidence of Russian war crimes in cooperation with Ukrainian law enforcement authorities. This evidence will be used in courts, national and international, to bring all those who committed those atrocities to justice.

Ukraine activates all legal instruments to bring Russia and its citizens who are responsible for crimes against humanity to justice. More than 40 countries have already supported the investigation of Russia’s war crimes and appealed to the International Criminal Court. A number of countries launched their own criminal investigations of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by Russians on the territory of Ukraine.

Without communication, electricity, food, medicine and even water, looted shops, destroyed houses - this is how villages in the occupied Kherson region live today.

The Stanislav community was under constant fire from enemy artillery.

Stanislav is already half-destroyed. No connection with other villages of the community. Most of the houses and local school were destroyed. People are forced to live in rubble, hide in basements.

Civilians ask for evacuation, but the occupiers do not allow people to leave.

The third week in the occupation of the village of Vysokopillya.

People are left without water, electricity, gas, many have run out of food. The occupiers are constantly firing at the village. Many buildings are annihilated.

Russians rob, kidnap, and kill civilians. Documents and mobile phones were taken from civilians.

According to the local authorities of the city of Mariupol - almost 40 thousand citizens of the city were deported to the so called ""DPR"" or Russia. Counting deportees is complicated by the fact that Ukrainian documents are confiscated from people.

Russian invaders separate parents from children. 17 injured children were abducted from the local hospital where they were undergoing treatment. Their parents stayed and they were evacuated to the city of Zaporizhia.

Some of the forcibly deported Mariupol residents were found in Estonia, where they entered from the territory of the Russian Federation. In addition to the residents of Mariupol, people from the Kherson, Kharkiv, and Luhansk regions reached Estonia in the same way through Russia. According to them, some of these people decided to go through Russia because they could not go to Western Ukraine. At the same time, there were people who were forcibly sent to Russia and then allowed to travel at their own discretion.

POLICY

President of Ukraine

Address by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy

The global security architecture has failed. Peace for us will not be the result of any decisions of the enemy somewhere in Moscow as well. We should not cherish empty hopes that they will simply leave our land. We can only gain peace in hard battles and in parallel - in negotiations, and in parallel - in daily vigorous work.

Our defenders continue to regain control over communities in the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions. There are more and more Ukrainian national flags in the areas that have been temporarily occupied.

We are strengthening our defenses in the eastern direction and in Donbas. We are aware that the enemy has reserves to increase pressure in the east. The goal of Russian troops is to capture both Donbas and the south of Ukraine.

Heroic Mariupol continues to hold back a significant part of the enemy forces. Thanks to this resistance, thanks to the courage and resilience of our other cities, Ukraine has gained invaluable time. The time that allows us to undermine the enemy's tactics and weaken their capabilities.

Unfortunately, Ukraine has not yet received enough modern Western anti-missile systems or aircrafts. Hasn’t received what the partners could provide. Could - and still can!

Every Russian missile and every bomb dropped only adds black paint to the history that will describe everyone on whom the decision depended. Decision whether to help Ukraine with modern weapons.

I would like to thank the residents of our Enerhodar separately, who went to a rally today. In response, the occupiers opened fire and used grenades. There will be an answer for each wounded person.

I want to turn to person who does not seem to fully understand what is happening not only in Ukraine, but throughout Europe. To the Prime Minister of Hungary. He is virtually the only one in Europe to openly support Mr. Putin.

We did not ask for anything special from official Budapest. We didn't even get what everyone else is doing! We saw no effort to stop the war!

The whole of Europe is trying to stop the war, to restore peace. Then why is official Budapest opposed to the whole of Europe, to all civilized countries? For what?

The main thing for us is the opinion of the people. The Ukrainian people support the Hungarian people, while Hungarians support Ukrainians. I am convinced that our minorities should be the bridges that unite us even more.

If it's a war, then I call it a war, not a ""special operation."" If this is a threat to the whole of Europe, then I call it a threat to the whole of Europe. This is called the honesty that Mr. Orban lacks. He may have lost it somewhere in his contacts with Moscow.

I spoke today with the President of Colombia. I am very grateful to him for his support and solidarity with Ukraine. The list of countries that say that freedom matters and the war must stop is expanding.

I also spoke with British Prime Minister Johnson. A meaningful, pleasant conversation. We agreed on new defensive support for Ukraine, on the strengthening of sanctions against Russia. Agreed on joint steps to achieve peace. Thank you, Boris, for the leadership!

Address to Ukrainians

Today this address will be without greetings. I do not want any extra words.

Presidents do not usually record addresses like this. But today I have to say just that. After what was revealed in Bucha and our other cities the occupiers were expelled from. Hundreds of people were killed. Tortured, executed civilians. Corpses on the streets. Mined area. Even the bodies of the dead were mined!

The pervasive consequences of looting. Concentrated evil has come to our land. Murderers. Torturers. Rapists. Looters. Who call themselves the army. And who deserve only death after what they did.

I want every mother of every Russian soldier to see the bodies of the killed people in Bucha, in Irpin, in Hostomel. What did they do? Why were they killed? What did the man who was riding his bicycle down the street do? Why were ordinary civilians in an ordinary peaceful city tortured to death? Why were women strangled after their earrings were ripped out of their ears? How could women be raped and killed in front of children? How could their corpses be desecrated even after death? Why did they crush the bodies of people with tanks? What did the Ukrainian city of Bucha do to your Russia? How did all this become possible?

Russian mothers! Even if you raised looters, how did they also become butchers? You couldn't be unaware of what's inside your children. You couldn't overlook that they are deprived of everything human. No soul. No heart. They killed deliberately and with pleasure.

I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being fulfilled. Such orders. Such a fulfillment. And joint responsibility. For these murders, for these tortures, for these arms torn off by explosions that lie on the streets. For shots in the back of the head of tied people.

This is how the Russian state will now be perceived. This is your image.

Your culture and human appearance perished together with the Ukrainian men and women to whom you came.

I approved a decision to create a special mechanism of justice in Ukraine for the investigation and judicial examination of every crime of the occupiers on the territory of our state. The essence of this mechanism is the joint work of national and international experts: investigators, prosecutors and judges. This mechanism will help Ukraine and the world bring to concrete justice those who unleashed or in any way participated in this terrible war against the Ukrainian people and in crimes against our people.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Office of the Prosecutor General, the National Police, the Security Service, the Intelligence Service and other structures within their competence must make every effort to ensure that the mechanism is operational immediately.

I call on all our citizens and friends of Ukraine in the world who can join this work and help establish justice to do so.

The world has already seen many war crimes. At different times. On different continents. But it is time to do everything possible to make the war crimes of the Russian military the last manifestation of such evil on earth.

Everyone guilty of such crimes will be included in a special Book of Torturers, will be found and punished.

Ukrainians!

I want you to realize that. We drove the enemy out of several regions. But Russian troops still control the occupied areas of other regions. And after the expulsion of the occupiers, even worse things can be found there. Even more deaths and tortures. Because this is the nature of the Russian military who came to our land. These are bastards who can't do otherwise. And they had such orders.

All partners of Ukraine will be informed in detail about what happened in the temporarily occupied territory of our state. War crimes in Bucha and other cities during the Russian occupation will also be considered by the UN Security Council on Tuesday.

There will definitely be a new package of sanctions against Russia. But I'm sure that's not enough. More conclusions are needed. Not only about Russia, but also about the political behavior that actually allowed this evil to come to our land.

Today is the fourteenth anniversary of the NATO summit in Bucharest. Then there was a chance to take Ukraine out of the ""gray zone"" in Eastern Europe. Out of the ""gray zone"" between NATO and Russia.

Out of the gray zone, in which Moscow thinks they are allowed everything. Even the most dreadful war crimes.

Under optimistic diplomatic statements that Ukraine could become a member of NATO, then, in 2008, refusal to accept Ukraine into the Alliance was hidden. The absurd fear of some politicians towards Russia was hidden. They thought that by refusing Ukraine, they would be able to appease Russia, to convince it to respect Ukraine and live normally next to us.

During the 14 years since that miscalculation, Ukraine has experienced a revolution and eight years of war in Donbas. And now we are fighting for life in the most horrific war in Europe since World War II.

I invite Mrs. Merkel and Mr. Sarkozy to visit Bucha and see what the policy of concessions to Russia has led to in 14 years. To see with their own eyes the tortured Ukrainian men and women.

I want to be understood correctly. We do not blame the West. We do not blame anyone but the specific Russian military who did this against our people. And those who gave them orders. But we have the right to talk about indecision. About the path to such Bucha, to such Hostomel, to such Kharkiv, to such Mariupol. We have no indecision. No matter whether we are in a certain bloc or non-aligned, we understand one thing: we must be strong.

Fourteen years ago, Russia's leader in Bucharest told Western leaders that there was no country like Ukraine. And we prove that there is such a country. It was and it will be.

We will not hide behind the strong of this world. We will not beg anyone.

Honestly, we shouldn’t have asked for help with weapons to protect ourselves from this evil that came to our land. All the necessary weapons should have been given to us anyway - without requests. Because they themselves realized what evil had come and what it had brought with it.

We see what’s at stake in this war. We see what we are defending.

There are standards of the Ukrainian army - moral and professional. And it is not our army that has to adjust now. These are many other armies that should learn from our military.

And there are standards of the Ukrainian people. And there are standards of the Russian occupiers. This is good and evil. This is Europe and a black hole that wants to tear it all apart and absorb.

We will win this war. Even if individual politicians are still unable to overcome the indecision they will pass on to their successors together with their offices.

And all the necessary services are already working in Bucha to bring the city back to life. Restore electricity supply, water supply. Restore the work of medical institutions. Rebuild the infrastructure. Give security to people. Because Russia was expelled. And Ukraine is returning. And brings life back.

Today I visited our border guards, our heroes in the hospital of the Border Guard Service of Ukraine. Wounded warriors.

I presented state awards to the eight of them. I also awarded the orthopedist-traumatologist - medical service officer who is a leading military traumatologist in Ukraine and has already saved many Ukrainian defenders.

In total, 41 border guards received state awards under this decree.

It was the servicemen of the State Border Guard Service who first met the occupiers with fire when they went on the offensive on February 24. Now our boys and girls are returning to the state border as we expel the occupiers.

I am sure the time will come and the whole line of the state border of Ukraine will be restored.

And for this to happen sooner, we must all be focused, ready to boldly face evil and respond to every criminal act against Ukraine, against our people, against our freedom.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Face the Nation

Russians have pulled out from some localities. In others they are redoing the redeployment because the situation is difficult. There were some communities that they were trying to take several times, and this is a tragedy because Ukrainian army had to take these territories back as well. Bright example if the city of Chornobaivka. It was attacked nine times.

They were trying to take Kyiv and some cities in Kyiv region. Some of them have been occupied and then they destroyed everything. The civilians, the houses, they were stealing washing machines and equipment. There were multiple cases torture in the city.

Now Russians are focusing on the east of Ukraine. So this corridor, which is going from the Crimea to the east of Ukraine, this is in the south of Ukraine. And this is where they are trying to focus in terms of armament, in terms of deploying their personnel. They were bringing people in from different parts of the world because they were in deficit of their personnel and now they are grouping all of these troops in the south and east of Ukraine.

We believe in justice, in the justice of the Western world and therefore, the question is not only about the leader of Russian Federation. We wouldn't think that it would be fair to take only him. I think all the military commanders, everyone who gave instructions and orders should be punished adequately.

We are the citizens of Ukraine. We have more than 100 nationalities. This war is about the destruction and extermination of all these nationalities. We are the citizens of Ukraine and we don't want to be subdued to the policy of Russian Federation. This is the reason we are being destroyed and exterminated, and this is happening in the Europe in the 21st century.

Many people, many thousands of people have been evacuated. In certain cities, 35, 30, 40,000 Ukrainians have been evacuated. So altogether, hundreds of thousands. But nevertheless, there are still hundreds of thousand blocked. Some of them are blocked or behind the bars.

Before the beginning of this full-fledged war and the occupation of Mariupol, many people lived there. But today they are suffering. All the humanitarian corridors have been blocked. There is shortage of food and water supplies. Many dead people are left to lie on the streets…

“As the president of Ukraine, there cannot be just my personal view about President Putin and a dialogue with the Russian Federation. I must stand for the interests of my country. So, it's difficult to say how, after all- what has been done, we can have any kind of negotiations with Russia. That's on the personal level. But as a President, I have to do it. Any war must end.” – underlined the President of Ukraine.

“I would like to thank the United States and Biden administration and their bipartisan support in everything they're doing for us. But nevertheless, the United States have not provided the security guarantees to us. You have to understand this as a president of the country in war. The United States is our strategic partner and they are supporting us. But security guarantees is when you have an enforceable document. Even the Budapest Memorandum was a- a treaty. We have given away our nuclear power and it was just a piece of paper.” stressed Zelenskyy.

Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine

Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Dmytro Kuleba called on the missions of the International Criminal Court and international organizations to arrive in Bucha and other cities and towns of Kyiv region as soon as possible to gather evidence of Russian war crimes and crimes against humanity.

This was announced by the Foreign Minister of Ukraine on Sunday, 3 April, on the air of the British radio Times UK radio.

""I urge the International Criminal Court and international organizations to send their missions to Bucha and other liberated towns and villages of the Kyiv region, in cooperation with Ukrainian law enforcement agencies, to thoroughly collect all evidence of Russian war crimes,"" he said.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine has already sent a request to the International Criminal Court.

Dmytro Kuleba stressed that this evidence will be used in international and foreign courts to bring to justice those who committed these atrocities.

""We are still gathering and looking for bodies, but the number has already gone into the hundreds. Dead bodies lie on the streets. They killed civilians while staying there and when they were leaving these villages and towns, ""he said.

The Foreign Minister of Ukraine spoke about the mass crimes of the Russian army in Ukraine, including murder, torture, looting, rape: ""It was impossible to imagine this in the XXI century, but it is happening before our eyes. Russia is worse than ISIS. ""

""If I used to say that I will make every effort to bring the perpetrators to justice, now I am convinced that this is a matter of my life, which I will do until my last breath, until they are all held accountable,"" he said.",https://smallwarsjournal.com/blog/ukraine-war-bulletin-april-3-630-pm-est

Russian forces have reportedly completed their withdrawal from Kyiv and Chernihiv regions while continuing to pull out of the Sumy Region as of April 5. The move is almost certainly part of a tactical shift to refocus offensive operations toward capturing the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. Accordingly, preliminary information indicates that Russian forces have concentrated along the route from Izyum in the Kharkiv Region to Slovyansk in the Donetsk Region and will likely advance toward Slovyansk over the coming days; successfully capturing that city would facilitate the reinforcement of separatist forces operating around Severodonetsk in the Luhansk Region, as well as bolster prospects for encircling Ukrainian forces in the Donbas. However, despite their recent frontal assaults on Donetsk and Luhansk regions, Russian units have made little progress toward capturing the regions amid growing supply issues and weakening morale among their troops.

The battle for Mariupol is also continuing as of April 5. Although Ukrainian defenders have thus far prevented the Russians from completely capturing the city, the area under Ukrainian control continues to decrease; overall, Mariupol remains likely to fall to Russian forces over the coming weeks.

In Sumy Region, Russian forces have continued to withdraw troops from Konotop; however, Ukrainian forces have reportedly not yet advanced into this area as of April 5. Ukrainian troops have retaken control of the town of Biliopilia, but Russian forces are believed to still be present in Putyvl and Buryn.

Russian units continued to shell the city of Kharkiv as of April 4, likely as part of an effort to keep Ukrainian forces fixed in place. For their part, Ukrainian forces have engaged Russian forces near Nova Dmytrivka, through which Russian troops may attempt to advance on Slovyansk over the coming days. Russian forces have also reportedly gathered in Snizhkivka and Brazhkivka.

In Luhansk Region, separatist forces have focused their assaults on Borivske, Metolkine, and Novotoshkivske.

In Donetsk Region, Russian troops have reportedly captured Novobakhmutivka. Clashes between Ukrainian and Russia-aligned forces are focused on Makiivka, Marinka, and Svitlodarsk.

In Kherson Region, Ukrainian forces have recently conducted successful counterattacks, with counteroffensive operations now moving in the direction of Oleksandrivka and Blahodatne. Russian forces, on the other hand, have reportedly sought to bolster defensive positions around Kherson, shelling Ukrainian military targets in Maryanske and Novovorontsovka April 4.

Russian forces appear to remain on the defensive in the south and are withdrawing to positions east of and along the Dnieper. Ground offensives towards Mykolayiv, Zaporizhzhia, and Kryvyi Rih are unlikely in the short term.

Elsewhere, shelling and missile strikes continue to be reported against targets across the country. An airstrike occurred in Balovne in Mykolaiv Region, and shelling was reported in Komyshuvakha, Zaporizhzhia Region. Further intense shelling and missile strikes are likely, including strikes on targets in western regions.

Protests denouncing the Russian offensive and the subsequent occupation continue. Most protests are reported in Kherson Region. Russian troops have used tear gas and opened fire on protesters on several occasions, highlighting the difficulty Russian forces may encounter when attempting to impose order in some cities under their occupation. Russian military forces reportedly fired on protesters in Kakhovka April 3.

Disruptions and Shortages

Ukrainian Railways (UZ) continues to operate evacuation trains from Kyiv and other areas, including Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kryvyi Rih, Zakarpattia, Zaporizhzhia, and Odesa. Clashes and artillery strikes periodically prompt the suspension of evacuations. Large crowds continue to be reported at stations offering evacuation services. Intercity and regional rail services are available intermittently; rail services are subject to disruptions without warning. Civilian aviation remains suspended, and the nation's seaports are closed. As Ukrainian forces take more territory in Kyiv, some residents may start to return.

Nightly curfews are in effect in multiple regions during various time frames. In Kyiv Region, a curfew is in place from 21:00-06:00, except in the recently retaken Brovary, Vyshgorod, and Bucha districts where a full curfew has been imposed until 06:00 April 7. In Mykolaiv, a curfew is in place from 20:00-06:00; in Zaporizhzhia the curfew runs 21:00-05:00. In Rivne, authorities have declared a curfew from 22:00-06:00. Generally, civilians must stay indoors during curfew hours; exemptions exist for workers in critical infrastructure and persons seeking urgent medical care or bomb shelters. Authorities may extend or amend curfew hours on short notice, depending on local developments.

Intermittent telecommunications, internet, and utility disruptions continue across much of the country. Reports also indicate a shortage of basic supplies, including groceries and pharmaceutical products, in multiple cities facing Russian ground assaults. The most severe shortages and disruptions are consistently reported in Chernihiv, Kharkiv, and Mariupol, which have suffered heavy bombardments and repeated ground assaults. Similar situations are likely in other cities facing Russian ground offensives or heavy bombardments. Finally, the National Bank of Ukraine has limited foreign currency transfers and withdrawals.

Ukraine's borders with Belarus, Russia, and the Transnistria region of Moldova are closed to foreign nationals; only Ukrainian citizens can enter from these areas. Ukraine's borders with Hungary, Moldova, Poland, and Slovakia remain open. Though congestion has eased since the early days of the conflict, delays may worsen depending on conflict developments elsewhere in the country.

Context

Faced with the failure of its campaign to take Kyiv, the Kremlin appears to be refocusing back to one of Russia's more immediate objectives of seizing the entirety of Luhansk and Donetsk regions, as well as securing a land bridge to Crimea. Though progress has slowed considerably from the initial phase of the war, Russian and Russia-backed forces continue to make gains in the southeastern part of Ukraine, albeit while continuing to engage in heavy clashes with defenders in Mariupol city center.

Ukrainian officials have accused Russian troops of various atrocities against the civilian population in occupied territories. Such revelations might make negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow more difficult, as the public might pressure senior Ukrainian political leadership not to agree to any concessions until the Kremlin accepts the blame for any war crimes that Russian troops may have committed. On the Russian side, it is likely that officials will only present concrete proposals once they feel the military position in southeastern Ukraine is relatively secure. Recent talks have failed to yield any concrete de-escalation of the conflict, though both Russian and Ukrainian positions are believed to have softened.

Advice

Avoid travel to Ukraine until the situation stabilizes; consider exiting the country if safe to do so. Where fighting or airstrikes are occurring, shelter in place until the situation becomes clear. If officials report incoming fire, stay away from windows and exterior walls. Strictly heed the instructions of local security personnel, particularly when ordered to air-raid shelters. Stockpile food, fuel, and water when possible and safe to do so. Maintain contact with your diplomatic representation. Confirm that a thorough communication plan exists to ensure rapid accountability for all personnel operating in Ukraine. Reconfirm the status of public transport services, road routes, and borders before departure. Due to the threat of unexploded ordnance, consider avoiding off-road travel. Travel on well-used routes only. Do not approach suspected unexploded ordnance.
