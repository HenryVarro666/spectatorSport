0,2e7b5eb4-2fe2-49c7-b824-fbce6d9ebabb,[],2022-03-02 00:00:00,"War in Ukraine: What you need to know

The latest: Ukrainian forces struck the Russian warship Moskva with two Neptune missiles, causing it to sink, a senior U.S. defense official said Friday. The confirmation comes after dueling reports in which Ukrainian forces claimed a successful attack on the flagship vessel in Russia’s Black Sea fleet while Russian officials said the ship had experienced a fire.

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

How you can help: Here are ways those in the U.S. can help support the Ukrainian people as well as what people around the world have been donating.

3,800 troops at Fort Stewart ordered to deploy SAVANNAH, Ga. — About 3,800 troops based at Fort Stewart in southeast Georgia have been ordered to deploy quickly and bolster U.S. forces in Europe after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “It’s been very hectic and stressful, but overall it’s worked out,” Army Staff Sgt. Ricora Jackson said Wednesday as she waited with dozens of fellow soldiers to board a chartered flight at Hunter Army Airfield in Savannah. The soldiers are from the 1st Armored Brigade of the Army’s 3rd Infantry Division. In all, the Pentagon has ordered about 12,000 service members from various U.S. bases to Europe, with a couple of thousand more already stationed abroad shifting to other European countries. The soldiers’ mission overseas is to train alongside military units of NATO allies in a display of force aimed at deterring further aggression by Russia. Maj. Gen. Charles Costanza, the 3rd Infantry’s commander, said soldiers and their families were told to expect the deployment to last six months, though it could be extended or shortened depending on developments in Ukraine. “There is no intent to have any U.S. service member fight in Ukraine,” Costanza said. “And they know that.” Share this -







State Department: Russia restricting media, 'throttling' Twitter, Facebook Russia's government has restricted news organizations and throttled internet services to mislead its people about its attack on Ukraine, the State Department said Wednesday. The government restricted access to Radio Ekho Moskvy and Dozhd TV, the U.S. said. It is also ""throttling"" Twitter, Facebook and Instagram platforms, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said in a statement. ""Russia is engaged in an unprovoked war on Ukraine. At home, the Kremlin is engaged in a full assault on media freedom and the truth, and Moscow’s efforts to mislead and suppress the truth of the brutal invasion are intensifying,"" Price said. Russian officials have threatened independent media if they use terms that differ from the official narrative, like describing the attack and invasion against Ukraine as an ""invasion"" or a ""war,"" The Associated Press has reported.

Invasion forces Germany into diplomatic U-turn Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has accomplished what four years of hectoring by former President Donald Trump failed to do — persuade Germany to double its defense budget and boost its military contribution to NATO. And Germany is not the only country that has made a diplomatic U-turn since Putin launched the biggest land war in Europe since World War II, top diplomats say. “I was talking to my wife and saying that Biden did a good job in uniting the West,” said Ian Kelly, the former U.S. ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, as well as the nation of Georgia. “She said, ‘No, Putin did a good job of uniting the West.’” Read the full story here.

Spotify closes office in Russia Spotify said Wednesday it has closed its office in Russia indefinitely in response to what the audio streaming platform described as Moscow's ""unprovoked attack on Ukraine."" Since July, Russian legislation signed by President Vladimir Putin has obliged foreign social media companies with more than 500,000 daily users to open local offices or be subject to restrictions as severe as outright bans. Ahead of the March deadline, only a few companies, including Spotify, had complied. ""Our first priority over the past week has been the safety of our employees and to ensure that Spotify continues to serve as an important source of global and regional news at a time when access to information is more important than ever,"" Spotify said in a statement. Spotify said it has reviewed thousands of pieces of content since the start of the war and restricted the discoverability of shows owned and operated by Russian state-affiliated media. It also removed all content from state media RT and Sputnik this week in the European Union, the U.S. and other markets around the world, except for Russia, following similar steps by Twitter and Meta Platforms Inc.'s Facebook. Spotify said it would match employee donations 2-to-1 to support local humanitarian efforts. Share this -







What to know about Ukraine's first lady, Olena Zelenska With a massive Russian military convoy moving closer and closer to Ukraine’s capital city, Kyiv, all eyes are on President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his family. Zelenskyy, 44, has inspired many over the past week with his calls for strength and unity. And his wife, Olena Zelenska, 44, has been speaking out with equal passion. Zelenska’s exact location is unknown. She is believed to have remained in Ukraine along with her husband and their children, Sasha and Cyril — a risky decision, considering that Zelenskyy has said he is Russia’s “target No. 1” and that his family is “target No. 2.” Zelenska is drawing widespread praise for her presumed decision to remain in Ukraine and for sharing the realities of the crisis on social media.

At least 227 civilians killed in Ukraine, real toll 'much higher,' U.N. says At least 227 civilians have been killed in Ukraine and 525 have been injured, the United Nations' human rights office said — but the real toll is ""much higher,"" it said. The dead include 15 children, the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said Wednesday night. The casualties as of midnight Tuesday include only those recorded by the U.N. office. ""OHCHR believes that real figures are considerably higher,"" it said. Intense fighting in Ukraine has delayed reports, and many other reports are pending corroboration. Most of the casualties were from explosive weapons affecting wide areas, like artillery, rockets and airstrikes, it said. Ukraine’s state emergency services said Wednesday that since the war began, around 2,000 civilians have died. The agency later walked back that number, calling it “approximate,” as it is unknown how many people are under fire or debris. NBC News has not confirmed the numbers of any deaths. From 24 Feb—1 March, we recorded 752 civilian casualties in context of the Russia’s military action against #Ukraine: 227 killed, incl 15 children; 525 injured, incl 28 children, mostly caused by shelling & airstrikes.

Ukrainian President Zelenskyy: 'We will expel them' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday that the situation in parts of his country was ""very difficult"" but that ""we are resisting the terror."" Zelenskyy made the comments in a video address early Thursday as Russian forces intensified attacks on key Ukrainian cities. ""Even if they entered somewhere, it is only temporary. We will expel them, with disgrace,"" Zelenskyy said. The southern city of Kherson, a major port on the Dnieper River and the Black Sea, has been the subject of fierce fighting, and its status was unclear. Its mayor said Wednesday that the city was encircled and pleaded for an open corridor to move in supplies, such as food and medicine. Zelenskyy said Thursday that ""in just a week we broke the enemy's plans, plans that have been building for years."" He vowed that Ukrainians would fight, and he said that ""every occupier needs to know they won't get anything here, won't conquer anyone."" Zelenskyy said almost 9,000 Russians have been killed. NBC News has not verified those numbers. The Russian Defense Ministry said Wednesday that 498 of its service members have been killed and that 1,597 have been wounded. Share this -







Oil soars as markets, consumers brace for more volatility After a steady ascent over the past week, the price of oil skyrocketed Wednesday. Market observers said the spike will continue to fuel volatility in the days and weeks ahead as traders try to sort through the implications for inflation and central bank policy — and whether, or when, ordinary Americans and businesses will hit their limit. The broader question for investors is not just how much higher oil might go, but how much it could affect inflation. “Higher oil prices mean higher energy costs, and that’s really a key inflationary pressure,” said Will Rhind, the founder and CEO of GraniteShares. “Like any inflationary factor, there comes a point where it creates demand destruction.” Read the full story here.

Maryna Fenina, part of the organization's special monitoring mission to Ukraine, died while she was gathering supplies for her family in Kharkiv, ""a city that has become a war zone.""

""We strongly condemn the increased shelling in urban areas centres causing death and injury to civilians and reiterate our call on the Russian Federation for an immediate cessation of hostilities and to engage in a meaningful dialogue.""

International Criminal Court to investigate Russia's invasion of Ukraine The International Criminal Court said Wednesday that it has opened an investigation into Russia's invasion of Ukraine based on the referral of 39 member countries. The countries include Poland, Switzerland, Lithuania, Spain, the United Kingdom, Iceland, Canada, Colombia, Australia and New Zealand, among many others. The U.S. was not one of the countries because it is one of only seven countries that voted against the Rome Statute, the court's founding treaty. ""These referrals enable my Office to proceed with opening an investigation into the Situation in Ukraine from 21 November 2013 onwards, thereby encompassing within its scope any past and present allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide committed on any part of the territory of Ukraine by any person,"" Prosecutor Karim A.A. Khan said in a statement. The U.K. foreign office said it was leading the effort to gather referrals and push the court to investigate. ""Any Russian leader or officer carrying out orders that amount to war crimes should know they face ending up in the dock of a court and ultimately in prison,"" Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab said in a statement.

SWIFT to disconnect seven Russian banks on March 12 SWIFT, a service that facilitates global transactions among thousands of financial institutions, said it will cut off seven Russian banks as of March 12 in accordance with European Union guidance. ""Diplomatic decisions taken by the European Union, in consultation with the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States, bring SWIFT into efforts to end this crisis by requiring us to disconnect select Russian banks from our financial messaging services,"" SWIFT said in a statement Wednesday. ""As previously stated, we will fully comply with applicable sanctions laws."" Cutting off Russian access to SWIFT is one of the toughest financial steps, and it could damage Russia's economy in the long term. The impacts were being felt even in the short term: Because SWIFT handles international bank payments, some Moscow hotels requested that customers settle their bills early in case their credit card systems no longer worked. The U.S. and its allies moved last week to limit Russia's access to SWIFT, and many in the international community had been pushing for SWIFT to cut ties. As recently as Thursday, however, President Joe Biden had stopped short of pushing for the harsh financial penalty. ""Our deepest thoughts are with those suffering the tragic human consequences of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,"" SWIFT said in the statement. Share this -

""We, the United States of America, stand with the Ukrainian people,"" he said. Biden said the bravery the Ukrainian people have demonstrated is ""amazing,"" and he criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin for believing he could ""split"" NATO, Europe and the U.S. ""Vladimir Putin's latest attack on Ukraine is premeditated and unprovoked. He's rejected repeated efforts of diplomacy. He thought the West and NATO wouldn't respond. He thought they could divide us at home, but he was wrong. We are ready,"" Biden said. Share this -







U.S. postpones ballistic missile test in bid to lessen Russia nuclear tensions The U.S. military has postponed a long-planned intercontinental ballistic missile test scheduled for this weekend after Russian President Vladimir Putin said he was putting his country's nuclear forces on alert, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Wednesday. ""In an effort to demonstrate that we have no intention in engaging in any actions that could be misunderstood or misconstrued, the secretary of defense has directed that our Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile test launch scheduled for this week to be postponed,"" Kirby told reporters at his daily briefing. ""We did not take this decision lightly, but instead to demonstrate that we are a responsible nuclear power."" While the U.S. and their allies have said they have not seen any actual change in Russia's nuclear readiness posture, Kirby said, ""such provocative rhetoric and possible changes to nuclear posture involving the most consequential weapons in our respective arsenals is unacceptable. The United States has not taken any similar steps."" But, he added, ""we recognize at this moment of tension how critical it is that the United States and Russia bear in mind the risks of miscalculation and take steps to reduce those risks."" He said postponing the test would not affect U.S. military readiness. ""It's not going to change our strategic deterrent posture one bit. It's a wise and prudent decision by the secretary to send a strong, clear, unambiguous message to Mr. Putin how seriously we take our nuclear responsibilities at a potentially tense time.""

Sen. Joe Manchin says he'll introduce legislation to prevent U.S. imports of Russian oil Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said Wednesday he's planning to introduce legislation with Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, that would prohibit the U.S. and domestic companies from importing Russian crude oil and petroleum. The bill ""declares a national emergency with respect to Russian aggression against Ukraine and the threat to our national security, foreign policy, and economy and directs the President to the authority he has had since 1917 to prohibit imports of crude oil, petroleum, petroleum products and LNG from Russia,"" the senators wrote in a one-page draft document, obtained by NBC News. The ban would be in place ""during the national emergency and either the President or Congress would be able to terminate the emergency and the import ban,"" they wrote, adding that continuing to import Russian products ""puts our national security at risk and supports Putin's ability to stay in power."" The effort comes after a group of Republicans proposed similar legislation seeking to ban imports of Russian oil earlier this week. While the sanctions imposed by the U.S. against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine so far does not include oil and gas exports, White House press secretary Jen Psaki has said, ""We haven't ruled out that.""

U.S. has sent hundreds of Stinger missiles to Ukraine this week The U.S. has delivered hundreds of Stinger missiles to Ukraine this week, including more than 200 on Monday, two congressional officials briefed on the deliveries said. The shipments are part of the $350 million lethal and nonlethal aid package the White House announced late Friday. The package also includes Javelin anti-tank missiles and ammunition, both of which the Ukrainian government has said it needs to fight off the advancing Russian military. Stinger missiles can shoot down aircraft. During the Cold War, the U.S. government secretly supplied Afghan resistance fighters with Stingers to shoot down Russian helicopters over Afghanistan. The Defense Department and the National Security Council declined to comment. Germany announced over the weekend that it was sending 500 Stinger missiles to Ukraine, as well.

Russian woman burns passport at Scottish protest: 'I'm ashamed to be Russian' A Russian woman who set fire to her passport at a Tuesday vigil in Edinburgh, Scotland, protesting Russia's invasion of Ukraine has said she is ""ashamed to be Russian."" In a phone interview Wednesday, Anna Jakubova said she was horrified by Russia's deadly war. ""I feel ashamed of being associated with this country,"" she said. ""I feel horrible for Ukrainians. I feel so sad."" Jakubova can be seen in a video posted to Facebook lighting her passport on fire, saying: ""I hope the Russian government burns just as well."" In photos shared with NBC News after the demonstration, the front cover of the passport can be seen almost completely burned off, along with some of its key pages. Jakubova, 26, who left Russia around a decade ago because she disagreed with Moscow's treatment of marginalized groups, said giving up her passport was ""nothing in comparison"" to what Ukrainians have lost. Jakubova said that she is still an Estonian citizen but that her decision to burn her Russian passport and speak out against Moscow's invasion most likely means she may never see some loved ones still living in Russia again. ""Despite the Russian government, in some ways, Moscow will always be my home,"" she said. However, she said: ""This is a sacrifice that I think is worth it to make, because Ukrainians are sacrificing so much more than that."" She said she hoped her action would also draw attention to protesters' calls for support for Ukraine, including demands for a no-fly zone over the country. ‘I no longer want to be a citizen’: Russian woman burns passport in support of Ukraine March 2, 2022 00:30 Share this -







Russian ambassador to U.N. appears to invoke Trump's stolen election lie Russia's ambassador to the United Nations Vasily Nebenzya invoked former President Donald Trump's stolen election lie on Wednesday in remarks opposing a resolution denouncing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In a speech advancing Russia's false narrative about the invasion, Nebenzya said the ousting of a Russian-backed president in Ukraine in 2014 by protestors and the country's own parliament was a “coup” conducted with “the connivance of Germany, France, and Poland, and with the support of the United States, where the legitimately elected president of the country was overthrown,” according to a live English translation of his Russian remarks. This is false. Numerous investigations, audits, and inquiries in states across the country have concluded the 2020 presidential election was safe, secure, and its results accurate, despite false claims advanced by Trump, who lost the White House to President Joe Biden. Trump's numerous attempts to challenge the results of the election in court also failed. Share this -

""He will also thank Poland for generously welcoming hundreds of thousands of displaced persons from Ukraine and discuss how the United States can augment humanitarian assistance efforts for those fleeing Putin’s war,"" Price added. Blinken will then travel to Lithuania on Sunday, to Latvia on Monday and to Estonia on Tuesday. ""During all three stops, he will discuss joint efforts to support Ukraine, strengthen NATO’s deterrence and defense, promote democracy and human rights, and pursue deeper economic and energy cooperation with our Baltic Allies,"" Price said.

The lives of Ukraine's Black immigrants come into focus as reports of racism at Polish border emerge After having studied in India, Heidi Nguema visited Ukraine a few years ago with no plans to make it his home. But as an African from the country of Gabon, in the central part of the continent, he said, he “fell in love” with Ukraine and “decided to stay.” Part of the reason for his affection for the European country that neighbors Russia is that he never had problems with racism in Ukraine, “even if I know some who did. It can’t compare with the U.S., for sure,” said Nguema, who lives in Uman, a city in central Ukraine. So it jolted him when he heard from others that many Black people of Ukraine, most of them African, had been prevented from entering Poland and other safe countries to elude the Russian attacks that started last week. Nguema, the owner of a digital agency who also teaches English and French in Ukraine, said life had been solid before the invasion. “I have great colleagues, my brother who helped me a lot, his family and awesome friends,” he said. But the war is taking a toll. Read the full story here. Share this -

Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich to sell Chelsea Football Club Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich will sell Chelsea Football Club following mounting pressure over his ownership of the prominent team amid the invasion of Ukraine, he announced Wednesday. “I have always taken decisions with the Club’s best interest at heart. In the current situation, I have therefore taken the decision to sell the Club as I believe this is in the best interest of the Club, the fans, the employees, as well as the Club’s sponsors and partners,” he said in a statement. He said the sale of the club will not be fast-tracked, and he won’t ask for any loans to be repaid. ”This has never been about business nor money for me, but about pure passion for the game and Club,” the billionaire, who has owned the team since 2003, said. Abramovich said his team will set up a charitable foundation where all net proceeds from the sale will be donated to benefit victims of the war in Ukraine. “Please know that this has been an incredibly difficult decision to make, and it pains me to part with the Club in this manner,” he said. “It has been a privilege of a lifetime to be part of Chelsea FC and I am proud of all our joint achievements.

Almost 500 troops killed in Ukraine, Russia says in first casualty report since invasion Almost 500 Russian troops have been killed in Ukraine, Russia's defense ministry said Wednesday in its first report of military casualties since the country invaded its neighbor last week. ""Unfortunately, there are losses among our comrades participating in the special military operation,"" Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said in a statement, adding that 498 servicemen had died and 1,597 had been wounded. Two Western officials told NBC News that about 5,800 Russians have been killed, a number in line with Ukraine’s estimates. However, one U.S. official is cautioning that the estimates have been all over the map, ranging from as low as 500 to more than 5,000, and are extremely difficult to pin down. Ukraine’s state emergency services said Wednesday that since the war began, around 2,000 civilians have died. The agency later walked back that number calling it ""approximate"" as it is unknown how many people are under fire or debris. NBC News has not been able to independently verify any of these numbers. Konashenkov said that Russia continued to strike at the military infrastructure of Ukraine and had hit command posts, communication centers and other targets.

Africans report racism and hostility trying to flee Ukraine Alexander Somto Orah, 25, was among thousands of people crowding a Kyiv train station Friday, hoping to flee Ukraine amid the Russian invasion. He said he and his friends hoped to get to safety at the Polish border quickly but that officials wouldn’t allow the group of Africans to board trains out of the region. “I was like, ‘You are picking only white people!’” Orah said. He said he and his friends briefly made it onto a second train headed to Poland but were quickly kicked off, with officials telling them “Ukrainians only.” Orah is one of several African citizens living in Ukraine who have reported racist discrimination and abuse at the border. Videos on social media have shown officials appearing to threaten to shoot groups of African students, a woman shielding an infant from the cold, officials chasing groups of people and people reported to be stranded in Ukraine. Representatives from several African countries — Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya and Gabon — have condemned the reports, and the African Union said Monday that it was disturbed by the news.

China will not join sanctions on Russia, banking regulator says China will not join in sanctions on Russia that have been led by the West, the country's banking regulator said Wednesday, adding that he believed the impact of the measures on China would be limited. China, which has refused to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has repeatedly criticized what it calls illegal and unilateral sanctions. ""As far as financial sanctions are concerned, we do not approve of these, especially the unilaterally launched sanctions because they do not work well and have no legal grounds,"" Guo Shuqing, chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, told a news conference. ""We will not participate in such sanctions. We will continue to maintain normal economic and trade exchanges with relevant parties,"" he said. China and Russia have grown increasingly close in recent years, including as trading partners. Total trade between the two jumped 35.9 percent last year to a record $146.9 billion, according to Chinese customs data, with Russia serving as a major source of oil, gas, coal and agriculture commodities, running a trade surplus with China. ""The impact from the sanctions on China's economy and financial sector is so far not too significant,"" Guo added. Share this -







Nord Stream 2 says it fired employees but cannot confirm bankruptcy reports The Swiss company behind the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline said Wednesday that it could not confirm reports that it had filed for bankruptcy, but it did say it had terminated employees ""following the recent geopolitical developments."" Known as Nord Stream 2 AG, the company's website only contained a brief statement on Wednesday morning. It said it had taken down its website ""due to serious and continuous attacks from outside."" The company, which built the gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, said its mobile and network lines are also unreachable at this time and provided a single email address for contact. Reuters reported Tuesday that the company, controlled by Russian state-owned energy corporation Gazprom, had considered going bankrupt after the U.S. sanctioned it last week. Its signature project, the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, was completed in September but had not begun operations. It was awaiting certification from Germany and the European Union when the project was halted last week. The pipeline would have doubled the capacity to pump gas between the Russia and Germany.

What are vacuum bombs? Concerns grow about Russia's thermobaric weapons Accusations that Russia may be using thermobaric weapons in Ukraine have raised fears about the potential devastation that could result from attacks with the so-called vacuum bombs. Oksana Markarova, Ukraine’s ambassador to the United States, said Monday that the Russian military had used a vacuum bomb, which sucks oxygen from the air to trigger a huge explosion. Markarova did not provide additional details and NBC News has not independently verified that the weapon has been used in Ukraine, but Russian thermobaric rocket launchers have been photographed entering the country by a CNN team. The accusation adds to mounting concerns voiced by several human rights organizations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, that Russia is conducting indiscriminate attacks in densely populated civilian areas that could constitute war crimes. The potential use of vacuum bombs is of particular concern because these thermobaric munitions are designed to cause immense destruction. “It’s just a horrible, devastating weapon,” said David Johnson, a retired U.S. Army colonel and a principal researcher at the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit policy research organization headquartered in California.

The U.S. and E.U. have levied sanctions on Russia’s biggest banks and its elite, frozen the assets of the country’s Central Bank located outside the country, and excluded its financial institutions from the SWIFT bank messaging system, AP reported.

The sanctions and resulting crash of the ruble have left the Kremlin scrambling to keep the country’s economy running. For Putin, that means finding workarounds to the Western economic blockade.

11:27 a.m.: Four U.S. senators on Wednesday announced that they had written a formal letter to U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen expressing their concerns regarding the potential use of cryptocurrency to evade sanctions, according to VOA’s Katherine Gypson. “We write to inquire about the Treasury Department’s progress monitoring and enforcing sanctions compliance by the cryptocurrency industry,” the group said.

Senators Elizabeth Warren, Mark Warner, Sherrod Brown, and Jack Reed noted that the issue has “become even more urgent amid the sanctions imposed on Russia after their invasion of Ukraine.” They said, “Strong enforcement of sanctions compliance in the cryptocurrency industry is critical given that digital assets, which allow entities to bypass the traditional financial system, may increasingly be used as a tool for sanctions evasion.”

11:19 a.m.: U.N. aid agencies are ramping up humanitarian operations in Ukraine as Russia's bombing of civilian residential areas and infrastructure escalates and civilian casualties mount, VOA’s Lisa Schlein reported Wednesday.

The Ukrainian government reports Russian airstrikes have killed hundreds of people and wounded more than 1,600. U.N. human rights office estimates are more conservative, but officials say the real toll is likely to be much higher than their monitors have been able to verify.

A spokesman for the U.N. children’s fund, James Elder, is in Lviv in western Ukraine. He says the city is in utter turmoil, with thousands of people seeking to escape the fighting. Given the chaotic situation, he says it is not possible to know how many people, including children, are being killed.

Kramer', 'Aurelien Breeden', 'Christopher F. Schuetze', 'Michael Schwirtz']",2022-03-02 00:00:00,"BEIJING — On Wednesday night, the organizers of the Paralympic Winter Games were resolute that they had no option except to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete. On Thursday afternoon, they were equally resolute when they came to the opposite conclusion.

In a stunning reversal, the International Paralympic Committee bowed to heavy internal pressure and barred athletes from Russia and Belarus on the eve of the opening ceremony, extending the global sporting isolation of both countries in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine.

Citing threats by several federations to boycott the Paralympic Games, mounting discontent in the athletes’ village and fears that a “deteriorating” situation there could lead to violence, the International Paralympic Committee said the situation had changed so dramatically overnight that the viability of the Games would be in jeopardy if organizers did not expel the Russian and Belarusian delegations.

“The environment in the village is deteriorating,” said Andrew Parsons, the president of the I.P.C. He said rising anger and threats by multiple national committees, some under pressure from their governments, to withdraw from the Games had made the situation “untenable.”

Russia’s sports minister, Oleg Matytsin, told journalists in Moscow that the country was preparing an immediate appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland that would seek to overturn the exclusion of Russian athletes before the Games open.

“Today’s decision of the International Paralympic Committee to bar our team is a blatant violation of athletes’ rights and a manipulation of the Olympic Charter and human lives’ values in pursue of political goals,” Matytsin said, according to the state-run news agency TASS.

The announcement came less than a day after the committee had said it would allow athletes from both countries to compete as neutrals in Beijing, a response to the invasion that was widely criticized as inadequate. By Thursday morning, Paralympic officials met again and decided they had little choice but to throw out the two teams.

Parsons said that there had been no reports of confrontations or violence between athletes, but that tensions were rising. He said there was a “huge” concern for the safety of participants, including 71 Russians athletes.

“The village is not the place for fights,” Parsons said.

The move made the Paralympics the latest international sporting organization to bar Russian and Belarusian athletes and teams in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which was staged with Belarusian support. Sports like soccer, tennis, auto racing and figure skating already have barred Russian and Belarusian athletes since the International Olympic Committee took the extraordinary step this week of suggesting global federations and event organizers put in place a global ban on athletes from the two countries as a result of their actions in Ukraine.

The Russian and Belarusian Paralympic delegations — whose athletes initially had been cleared to compete if they agreed to do so without their national names, flags or anthems — could appeal the decision in court. But the Games are set to hold their opening ceremony on Friday, and their first events on Saturday.

Russia’s Paralympic committee criticized the reversal as “completely unfounded,” and said it unfairly portrayed the Russian committee and its Paralympic athletes “as the perpetrators of the current political conflicts.”

“In this regard, the R.P.C. considers the I.P.C.’s decision illegal and reserves the right to defend the rights and interests of Russian para athletes” in court, it said in a statement.

Athletes from both Ukraine and Russia practiced on Thursday, sometimes side by side, but Parsons said the I.P.C. now would work with the Russian and Belarusian delegations to get their teams home from China.

On Wednesday, Parsons had said the I.P.C. could not remove the athletes from Russia and Belarus because there was no specific mechanism to do so in the organization’s constitution; at the time, he said it was the I.P.C.’s “duty” to allow the Russians to participate.

On Thursday, he acknowledged that the legal situation had not changed, but that the situation on the ground had. The executive board, he argued, was equally bound to protect the viability of the Paralympic Games in the face of growing discontent. By Thursday, for example, teams in wheelchair curling and sled hockey had informed Paralympic officials that they would refuse to play against Russian opponents.

“The I.P.C. is a membership-based organization,” he said, “and we are receptive to the views of our member organizations.”

By then, Parsons said, a large number of members had reached out and urged the I.P.C. to reconsider its decision. Ukraine’s athletes released a statement voicing their disapproval, saying the claims of “political neutrality” from sports administrators were “a convenient lie used to deflect calls to stand up for human rights and peace.”

On Thursday, their team’s leader left no doubt about the country’s position. “Russia and Belarus must leave the Paralympic Games as soon as possible,” said Valerii Sushkevich, a member of Ukraine’s parliament and the president of the nation’s Paralympic committee.

Parsons, who had declared on Wednesday that the Russian and Belarussian athletes had a right to compete because they were not responsible for the invasion, expressed regret on Thursday that their dreams of competing at the Games would not be fulfilled.

“To the para athletes from the impacted countries, we are very sorry that you are affected by the decisions that your government took last week in breaching the Olympic truce,” he said. “You are victims of your government’s actions.”

The Games, though, will go ahead. The opening ceremony will take place in Beijing on Friday night, and competition begins Saturday in Alpine skiing, sled hockey, cross-country skiing and wheelchair curling.

Said Parsons: “We can at least preserve the experience for the around 600 athletes that are still competing here.”",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/03/02/world/ukraine-russia-war

Just over a week ago, the men were truck drivers and welders. They never intended to fight a war. Today they are trying to defend their country from the Russian invasion on a constantly shifting front line. They are among tens of thousands of people across the country who have mobilized to form a territorial defense unit to aid the Ukrainian army, a bid to tip the military balance even a little. Ukraine has just under 200,000 active military personnel, with another 900,000 in reserve, and has started conscripting men between 18 and 60. Russia amassed just under 200,000 troops on the borders of Ukraine, and it has deployed most of them in the week-old invasion. Russia has another 700,000 troops on active duty, 2 million reservists, and a huge advantage in tanks, artillery, and air power.

Just over a week ago, the men were truck drivers and welders. They never intended to fight a war.

Russia has another 700,000 troops on active duty, 2 million reservists, and a huge advantage in tanks, artillery, and air power.

Even so, as the Russians move south toward the capital, the Ukrainians are ready to meet them.

“They won’t be able to break our spirit,” said Olek, a man in his 50s, who declined to give his full name and age when “everything ends up on social media.” He said he’s ready to die for his country. It was his first shift on the outpost that had been established on a quiet forest-lined road under a starless sky. “We just built this post,” he said. “Every day, more checkpoints are set up.”

It was almost 2 a.m. early Wednesday, well past the 10 p.m. curfew in Zhytomyr. The eerie silence was broken only by the frequent sound of jets overhead and the distant air-raid sirens, warning of another Russian strike. Temperatures dropped below freezing, and the ersatz soldiers warmed themselves around a small fire in an empty oil barrel. Adrenaline was high, and everybody was nervous and on edge: In addition to the threat of airstrikes, a miles-long Russian convoy is approaching the capital from the north.

“We keep the lights off so we don’t attract attention,” Olek said. Last week, he was a truck driver delivering goods across Europe and the United Kingdom. He grew up and still lives in Zhytomyr with his wife and 13-year-old daughter. An avid hunter, Olek bought his rifle years ago, shooting mostly foxes and ducks; with the Russians approaching, he said, he has a new target. Between constant cups of sugary black tea, he flipped through his phone and showed off his biggest trophy to date, a 300-pound wild boar. “Maybe as heavy as a Russian,” he said.







More than 1 million Ukrainian refugees have fled westward into the European Union, but Olek’s family has stayed put. “It’s for them I’m taking up arms,” he explained.

A growing number of Ukrainians, both men and women, are joining the territorial defense units. Those who aren’t already fighting are preparing by filling sandbags, building trenches, and making Molotov cocktails.

“[Putin] thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over,” U.S. President Joe Biden said Tuesday in his State of the Union address. “Instead, he met a wall of strength he never anticipated or imagined: He met the Ukrainian people.”

Like many of the volunteers, Yaroslav (who also declined to give his last name), is just now learning how to use a weapon. He’s a 26-year-old welder who recently married. It was his first night on the checkpoint as well. Whenever a car approached, the men would position themselves, ready to shoot. “Most of the cars going north bring military equipment; most cars going south are families leaving the area,” Yaroslav said.

So far, the Russian invasion has killed and injured approximately 2,000 Ukrainian civilians, according to the country’s emergency services. “Children, women, and defense forces are losing their lives every hour,” their statement said.

“They all have orders to erase our history, erase our country, erase us,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video address on Wednesday.

The impact of those orders came to Zhytomyr in the early hours of Wednesday, while Olek and Yaroslav and the rest were still keeping watch. A Russian cruise missile destroyed an entire residential block and damaged a maternity hospital, killing at least four people and injuring dozens.

Oleksandr Korniichuk, 42, one of the owners of a house on that block, survived, along with his wife. “I don’t know how,” he said, pointing to a deep crater right next to what’s left of his home. He pulled out a memory card he found under the rubble, explaining that his security camera had recorded the explosion. Several houses and cars lay completely destroyed as people searched for their belongings. Bombings are becoming increasingly frequent in Zhytomyr, where people fear the same kind of brutal aerial assault that is hammering Kyiv, an hour to the east.

Back at the checkpoint outside the city, Olek explained that the territorial defense forces were planning to establish even more posts and checkpoints to keep the Russians from further moving south. Even with the sound of planes overhead and the war coming closer, he said he’s not afraid. His gun is loaded.

“We’ll keep watching for the Russians,” he said, staring into the night.",https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/03/03/russia-war-ukraine-civilian-defense-invasion-zhytomyr/

Amnesty International said Russia's military was conducting ""indiscriminate attacks"" in Ukraine.

And Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has described Russia's missile strikes in civilian areas as war crimes, most recently on Tuesday, when the Russian army launched airstrikes on Kharkiv's Freedom Square.

Watch video 05:27 Mounting evidence of alleged war crimes in Ukraine

On Wednesday, the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague announced that it would open an investigation into possible war crimes or crimes against humanity in Ukraine. In a statement, the prosecutor Karim A.A. Khan QC wrote that there was a ""reasonable basis"" to open an investigation and that the collection of evidence has now commenced.

'Laws of war'

There are specific international standards for war crimes, which are not to be confused with crimes against humanity.

War crimes are defined as serious violations of humanitarian laws during a conflict. The definition, established by the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, is derived from the 1949 Geneva Conventions and is based on the idea that individuals can be held liable for the actions of a state or its military.

The UN Office on Genocide Prevention and the Responsibility to Protect separates war crimes from genocide and crimes against humanity. War crimes are defined as occurring in a domestic conflict or a war between two states, while genocide and crimes against humanity can happen in peacetime or during the unilateral aggression of a military toward a group of unarmed people.

Ukrainian officials say more than 2,000 civilians have been killed during Russian attacks

There is a long list of acts that can be considered war crimes. The taking of hostages, willful killings, torture or inhuman treatment of prisoners of war, as well as forcing children to fight, are some of the more obvious examples.

But, in practice, there is significant gray area.

""The laws of war do not always protect civilians from death,"" said Mark Kersten of the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy at the University of Toronto. ""Not every civilian death is necessarily illegal.""

Raids on cities or villages, bombing residential buildings or schools, and even the killing of groups of civilians do not necessarily amount to war crimes — if their military necessity is justified. The same act can become a war crime if it results in unnecessary destruction, suffering and casualties that exceed the military gain from the attack.

Distinction, proportionality, precaution

To decide whether an individual or a military has committed a war crime, international humanitarian law lays down three principles: distinction, proportionality and precaution.

Proportionality prohibits armies from responding to an attack with excessive violence. ""If a soldier is killed, for example, you cannot bomb an entire city in retaliation,"" Kersten told DW.

It is also illegal to target objectives that are ""expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objectives, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated,"" according to the International Committee of the Red Cross.

Precaution requires parties to a conflict to avoid or minimize the harm done to the civilian population.

Finally, ""the principle of distinction says that you have to be constantly trying to distinguish between civilian and belligerent populations and objects,"" Kersten said, adding that this can be difficult.

""For example, attacking a barracks where there are people who have said they no longer participate in the conflict can be a war crime,"" he said. ""The same goes for bombing a military base where there are generators that supply hospitals with electricity.""

Russia has intensified its assault over the past days

Civilian and military populations have become increasingly hard to distinguish.

""You have saboteurs, you have plainclothes officers,"" Kersten said. ""Combatants disguise themselves in wars all the time. These are very common tactics.""

Race against time

When ICC prosecutors have reason to believe that a war crime has been committed, they start an investigation to find evidence that could point to specific individuals responsible for those crimes.

""Those are the kind of moments we're heading to now, with regards to the war crimes conducted in Ukraine,"" Kersten said.

Speed is crucial, however, as evidence can degenerate or disappear. It is very difficult for prosecutors to successfully investigate suspected war crimes after the fact, when one party to a conflict may have tampered with evidence or witnesses are no longer available.

(Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky/Facebook)

In a Facebook post early Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of intentionally firing at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, after a fire broke out at the facility following heavy shelling from Russian forces.

Ukrainian authorities say the power plant has not sustained any critical damage, and that radiation levels are currently normal, though the situation remains fluid and firefighters continue to battle the blaze.

“Russian tanks are shooting at the atomic blocks equipped with thermal imagers. They know what they are shooting at. They’ve been preparing for this (attack),” he said in the post.

Zelensky also referred to the Chernobyl tragedy and its victims in the post. ""For all Ukrainians, for all Europeans, for all people who know the word 'Chernobyl,' how many victims there were.""

The 1986 Chernobyl disaster, which took place in Soviet Ukraine, is considered the worst nuclear accident in history. It was a ""global catastrophe that affected the lives of hundreds of thousands of people,"" and had a lasting impact on the country, Zelensky said.

What's happening now: Ukrainian authorities say fighting has stopped in the area and about 40 firefighters are working to put out the blaze.

""We don’t know how it is going to end with the fire at the station, if there might be an explosion, God forbid,"" Zelensky said, adding ""our guys are keeping the atomic power station secure.""

But the very fact Russia launched an attack at the plant is itself an extremely dangerous act and could cause a potential catastrophe, he said. ""There are 15 nuclear reactors in Ukraine.
