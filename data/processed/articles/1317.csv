0,f5b73c00-b8df-4d19-a4a6-76210371055d,"['Deutsche Welle', 'Www.Dw.Com']",,"In a joint statement released on Thursday, the leaders of the Group of Seven industrialized nations (G-7) warned Russia against using biological, chemical or nuclear weapons against Ukraine.

The leaders met as part of a series of summits in response to Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

The Western alliance has become increasingly concerned that Russia may employ these weapons, potentially in response to a false-flag attack.

""We categorically denounce Russia’s malicious and completely unfounded disinformation campaign against Ukraine, a state in full compliance with international non-proliferation agreements,"" it said, countering any grounds Russia may invoke to use such weapons.

They also warned Moscow to avoid catastrophe as its invasion endangers nuclear sites in Ukraine.

Speaking via video-link to the summit in Brussels, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Moscow had already used phosphorus bombs against civilians in Ukraine.

""The threat of full-scale use by Russia of chemical weapons on the territory of Ukraine is real,"" Zelensky told the summit.

The G-7 — consisting of Germany, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the United States and the United Kingdom — called upon Russia to end its invasion of Ukraine, in line with a recent ruling from the International Court of Justice.

What G-7 leaders said about a potential chemical threat

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, whose country holds the rotating G-7 presidency, said any false-flag attack would be a war crime.

""Should Russia be preparing a false-flag operation in order to use such (chemical and biological) weapons (in Ukraine), this would be in violation of all rules, agreements and conventions,"" he told journalists.

""It is our concern not only to point this out but also to warn in the conversations we have: Don't do it,"" he added.

US President Joe Biden said later that a chemical attack by Russia ""would trigger a response in kind,"" without specifying exactly how severe that response would be.

Biden said that the most important priority of the meetings was for the West to stay united in its responses.

Investigating war crimes

The leaders said they would hold Russia accountable for any war crimes it commits and called on Russia to allow humanitarian aid into besieged cities, particularly Mariupol.

""We remain appalled by and condemn the devastating attacks on the Ukrainian population and civilian infrastructure, including hospitals and schools,"" the leaders said. ""We welcome the investigations of international mechanisms, including by the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court. We will work together to support the gathering of evidence of war crimes.""

German Chancellor Scholz said the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine is a prerequisite for a solution to the conflict.

He said Germany will use all its economic weight to help end the war.

""Russian troops must withdraw from Ukraine. This is necessary to enable a viable diplomatic solution to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine,"" the chancellor stressed.

Attempts to ensure global food security

As the invasion and its associated sanctions imperil global food supply chains, G-7 leaders pledged to combat the threat to food security through all instruments and funding mechanisms and build resilience in the agriculture sector. They pledged to increase contributions to international agencies that combat food insecurity.

They pledged to avoid export bans on food.

Afterwards, Chancellor Scholz said: ""Russia's war is having a dramatic impact on global food supplies far beyond Ukraine. And that is why we must do everything now to prevent a famine.""

""Europe is shouldering a lot here. But we really need a global effort."" He announced that Germany was boosting humanitarian aid to Ukraine and neighboring states to more than €370 million euros ($407 million). He said Germany would also offer a further €430 million to fight a potential hunger crisis.

Reducing reliance on Russian energy

The leaders pledged to reduce their dependence on Russian energy and act in solidarity in the case of supply disruptions.

They called on oil-and-gas producing countries to increase supply, saying OPEC would play a role in this.

As part of this, they agreed to accelerate the transition to renewable energy.

The G-7 summit was one of three Russia-focused summits in Brussels on Thursday, taking place alongside an EU summit and a NATO summit.

Separate to the G-7 meeting, EU leaders variously refused to capitulate to Russia's demands that they for gas in rubles.

While there's a growing picture that Russia's assault on Ukraine has not gone to plan, the country continues to use its air power to obliterate cities and target civilians to push Ukraine into submission.

So where is this war going? Here are a few things to watch out for in the coming weeks.

Russia could intensify its bombing campaign

Experts are warning that the more Russia takes a hit on the ground, the more likely it is to intensify its aerial bombing campaign and the use of other ""standoff"" weapons that put Russian soldiers in less danger.

There is little reliable information coming out of either Ukraine or Russia on death tolls, but a report in a Russian tabloid on Monday suggested that the Russian side had lost nearly 10,000 soldiers and that another 16,000 had been injured.

The Komsomolskaya Pravda website removed the numbers later in the day, claiming the numbers only appeared in the first place because it had been hacked. CNN could not verify the numbers, but the death toll is closer to what US intelligence agencies have been reporting.

And in the region of southern Mykolaiv, local authorities are mulling what do with hundreds of Russian corpses.

Such losses, if proven to be true, would explain both the stall in ground movement and the uptick in aerial bombing of key cities and other standoff attacks. A senior US defense official, for example, said Russia has begun firing on the southern city of Mariupol from ships in the Sea of Azov.

""Russia still has capabilities and reserves, and there's going to be an uptick in intensity as it makes an effort to bring in more troops,"" Jeffrey Mankoff, a distinguished research fellow at the US National Defense University's Institute for National Strategic Studies, told CNN.

Russia may try to encircle Ukrainian fighters in the east

There is a lot of talk about the Russian war effort stalling, but whether or not that's true comes down to what Moscow's objectives were in the first place. And even that's hard to know for sure, as the country's public justification for its invasion is clear propaganda, as evidenced by Russian President Vladimir Putin's call for the ""denazification of Ukraine,"" for example.

It's likely that Russia is, at the very least, trying to absorb parts of eastern Ukraine. Areas like Donetsk and Luhansk, which make up the Donbas region, have been controlled by Russian-backed separatists since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea, and while Russia's ambitions may stretch beyond Donbas, it's still likely a central focus, experts say.

While there is a lot of attention on Russia's push toward Kyiv, most of the Ukrainian army remains near Donetsk and Luhansk, where they are grouped as the Joint Forces Operation. The movement of Russian troops suggest they are trying to encircle the JFO on three axes, and this is likely to be Russia's main focus. That's clear by looking at the sophistication of the kind of troops being sent there, said Sam Cranny-Evans, a research analyst with the Royal United Services Institute.

""The Southern Military District — in Donetsk, Luhansk, Mariupol, Berdyansk, Melitopol — these are the best troops in the Russian army. And they always work. They're designed to fight NATO,"" Cranny-Evans told CNN.

“In this regard, we categorically denounce Russia’s malicious and completely unfounded disinformation campaign against Ukraine, a state in full compliance with international non-proliferation agreements,” they added.

Western officials have repeatedly warned in recent weeks that Russia may use chemical weapons, pointing to its past actions in other conflicts and Moscow’s unsupported claims that Ukraine is developing its own biological weapons.

The leaders also recognized the risk the Russian invasion poses to nuclear sites in Ukraine, especially after Moscow’s forces seized a number of facilities.

“Russia must comply with its international obligations and refrain from any activity that imperils nuclear sites, allowing unhindered control by the Ukrainian authorities, as well as full access by and cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency,” they wrote.

President Biden has warned that if Moscow uses chemical, nuclear or biological weapons, it would pay a severe price — though the administration has not specifically said what the consequence would be.

Biden on Wednesday said there is a “real threat” that Russian President Vladimir Putin could utilize chemical weapons in its offensive against Ukraine.

The G7 leaders said they will bolster efforts to gather of evidence of war crimes being committed by Russia, and condemned the seizure of Ukrainian cities and denial of humanitarian access as “unacceptable.”

“Russian forces must immediately provide for safe pathways to other parts of Ukraine, as well as humanitarian aid to be delivered to Mariupol and other besieged cities,” they added.

The leaders also denounced Belarus for the role it has played in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, calling on authorities in the country to “avoid further escalation and to refrain from using their military forces against Ukraine.”

They also addressed the Russian people, saying they were not to blame for the war.

“The people of Russia must know that we hold no grievances against them. It is President Putin, his government and supporters, including the Lukashenko regime in Belarus, who are imposing this war and its consequences on Russians and it is their decision that besmirches the history of the Russian people,” the leaders wrote.

Speaking after two extraordinary meetings of Nato and the G7, the prime minister also admitted allies were constrained in delivering tanks and jets to Ukraine, despite a direct plea by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

Johnson warned the UK is unlikely to supply jets and tanks to Ukraine, amid calls from Zelenskiy for the new heavy weaponry.

In a speech at the summit by video link, Zelenskiy did not repeat his call for a no-fly zone but said Ukraine needed jets and tanks from Nato to aid its besieged cities.

“You have at least 20,000 tanks! Ukraine asked for a per cent, 1% of all your tanks to be given or sold to us. But we do not have a clear answer yet,” he said. “The worst thing during the war is not having clear answers to requests for help.”

Johnson said that the UK was “looking at what we could do to help” with tanks but suggested it was impossible. “Logistically, the moment it looks very difficult for both the armour and with jets. We’re very conscious of what he’s asking for.

“At the moment, we’re looking at the equipment that we think is more immediately valuable … They need protection from that absolutely merciless onslaught from artillery.”

The prime minister said at his meeting with the G7, his Japanese counterpart had spoken movingly about the use of nuclear and chemical weapons. “There is a visceral horror of the use of these weapons of mass destruction,” he said.

Johnson said in an interview as he departed the summit that he feared Putin intended to level Ukrainian cities as he did in Chechnya. “Putin doesn’t take peace talks seriously – he wants to double down and Groznyfy Ukraine’s great cities,” he told BBC Newsnight. “I think that’s a tragic mistake, but that’s what he seem to be doing at the moment.”



Johnson would not commit to future Nato membership for Ukraine, something Zelenskiy has said he could be prepared to forgo as part of peace negotiations. Johnson said allies would instead be “strengthening the quills of the Ukrainian porcupine as to make it in future indigestible to the Russian invaders”.

Speaking earlier, Johnson said the US president, Joe Biden, was right to warn about the risk of a staged false flag attack. “You have to have a bit of ambiguity about your response, but I think it would be catastrophic for him if he were to do that, and I think that he understands that,” he told a press conference in Brussels.

“When the Russians start doing stuff about ‘there are factories in Ukraine producing American biological weapons’ you know that is a prelude to a false flag operation.”

Behind the scenes, officials say there is virtually zero prospect of a military intervention. “I think very few people think that Nato entering into conflict with Russia will stop the war – it will escalate the war,” one western official said.

“We are remaining deliberately ambiguous. We don’t want to say exactly how we will respond because Putin will then price that in to his calculations. We want him to remain uncertain … but we are clear there will be severe consequences.”

Nato leaders agreed Ukraine required supplies of protective equipment against chemical and biological weapons, which Biden has expressed particular concern could be in the offing.

But leaders agreed it was clear that any chemical attack spilling across the border into a Nato country would not be considered a direct attack on the alliance.

Both the US and the UK are expected to begin supplies to Ukrainian civilians, though officials acknowledged it was difficult to know where to target supplies. “There is protective equipment which we can supply to Ukrainians such as wash-up kits and protection kits and so on,” one official aid.

“That’s something we need to work through because we don’t have 44 million of these kits and clearly we don’t know where or when or how they would use such weapons.”

Overnight, the prime minister said the UK would double the number of British missiles sent to Ukraine with an additional 6,000, and send an extra £25m to Ukraine’s military. During their three-hour meeting, the 30 heads of government discussed the limits of upgrading weapons supply to Ukraine, without provoking Russia further.

Johnson also denied claims from Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov that he was “most active anti-Russian leader” – though privately No 10 has been delighted at the description.

“I think it’s very, very important for everybody to understand that there’s not a single person around the table in Nato, or the G7 who is against Russians or the Russian people. Least of all me, the only prime minister in UK history to be called Boris. I’m not remotely anti-Russian. But I think what we all agree, is that what Vladimir Putin is doing, the way he’s leading Russia at the moment is actually catastrophic.”",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/24/russia-chemical-weapons-g7-nato-boris-johnson-volodymyr-zelenskiy-tanks-jets

Speaking in the aftermath of emergency Nato and G7 summits in Brussels, the US president said that any retaliation would be proportional, though he would not confirm that he would insist on military action.

“We would respond,” Biden said, in response to a question about what Nato would do. “We would respond if he uses it. The nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use.”

The US wanted to see Russia thrown out of the G20 club of leading economic nations, although Biden complained that wasn’t immediately possible because “Indonesia and others do not agree”.

Biden and other western leaders have become fearful that a struggling Russia may try to end Ukraine’s stubborn resistance in the war that has already lasted a month and claimed thousands of lives, with a chemical – or biological or nuclear – attack.

This week it emerged that the White House had set up a special “Tiger Team” to work out how the US would respond if such an attack should take place. But on Thursday, Biden also said: “It would trigger a response in kind” – meaning it would reflect what had taken place.

Concern about a possible Russian chemical or biological attack dominated the Nato summit on Thursday. Speaking a few minutes before Biden, UK prime minister Boris Johnson warned of disastrous consequences for Russia should Putin use chemical weapons in Ukraine.

“You have to have a bit of ambiguity about your response, but I think it would be catastrophic for him if he were to do that – and I think that he understands that,” Johnson told a press conference.

All 30 Nato leaders warned Russia against using chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, arguing in a final summit statement that any such use “would be unacceptable and result in severe consequences”. However, again they did not spell out what the response would be.

One western official said on Thursday they thought it would be “highly unlikely” that there would be a direct military response even if Russia used chemical weapons in Ukraine, although any final decision would be driven by the US.

That would risk a severe escalation of the conflict, the official said. “We are remaining deliberately ambiguous. We don’t want to say exactly how we will respond because Putin will then price that in to his calculations. We want him to remain uncertain … but we are clear there will be severe consequences,” they added.

Masks, protective suits, detection and other equipment would also be supplied by Nato members to Ukraine, Nato’s secretary general Jens Stoltenberg confirmed, reflecting western fears that Russia is trying to create “some kind of pretext”.

The alarm grew after Russia began to spread unproven claims this month that Ukraine had been developing a biological weapons programme with the help of the US. This week Biden said such claims were a “clear sign” that Putin was contemplating a biological or chemical assault.

The development, production and stockpiling and use of chemical weapons is banned by an international treaty signed by 193 countries, including Russia and the US.

Chemical weapons were used on at least 17 occasions during Syria’s civil war, according to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which has accused the Russian-backed regime of Bashar al-Assad of being behind several high-profile attacks.

Nato leaders are also willing to send more powerful weapons to Ukraine after a plea at the Brussels summit from the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, for tanks, rockets and air-defence systems.

On Thursday, during a three-hour meeting, the 30 heads of government discussed how they could upgrade and increase their weapons supply – but without provoking Russia to the point where the conflict would lead to a wider war in Europe.

Stoltenberg said: “I will not go into the details of the exact type of systems we are deploying … What I can say is that allies do what they can to support Ukraine with weapons.”

At the summit, Biden, Johnson and other Nato leaders heard a characteristically passionate call from Zelenskiy for “military assistance – without restrictions”. He asked Nato members to supply more weapons because “Russia uses without restrictions its entire arsenal against us”.

Zelenskiy specifically asked for anti-missile systems, MLRS rocket artillery, anti-ship weapons, air defence equipment – plus tanks and fighter jets. “You can give us 1% of all your planes, 1% of your tanks,” he said.

Nato leaders discussed what further weapons could be supplied, given that Ukraine had held out for far longer than expected, and which countries were best placed to supply what arms, western officials said.

“There was a discussion both about more [military equipment] in terms of more numbers, and more in terms of different equipment,” one official said.

But there are limits; officials indicated they thought it unlikely any Nato country would want to provide tanks, for fear of Russian retaliation. A previous proposal by Poland to transfer 28 MiG-29 jets via the US was rejected by the White House, for similar reasons.

“We have a responsibility to prevent this conflict from becoming a full-fledged war in Europe, involving not only Ukraine and Russia, but Nato allies and Russia,” Stoltenberg said in a post-summit press conference.

Nato members have largely said they will only provide “defensive equipment”, but Russian military errors and Ukraine’s determination to fight back have left the aggressors struggling to make progress without resorting to heavy bombardment that has left the cities of Mariupol and Kharkiv in ruins.

Biden also said he would support an effort to expel Russia from the G-20 group of economies.

The president spoke after a marathon of summit meetings with the European Union, G-7 partners and NATO allies.

""We will respond if he uses it,"" Biden said, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin . ""The nature of the response depends on the nature of the use.""

President Joe Biden said Thursday that NATO would respond ""in kind"" if Russia uses weapons of mass destruction in Ukraine.

""I think that China understands that its economic futures much more closely tied to the West than it is to Russia,"" said Biden. ""And so I am hopeful that he does not get engaged,"" Biden said, referring to Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Biden said NATO leaders discussed the need for NATO and the EU to set up a system to review any sanctions violations and ""where, when and how"" Russia is able to buy banned products.

On sanctions, Biden said the reason why he asked for the NATO meeting was ""to be sure that after a month, we will sustain what we're doing, not just next month, the following month, but for the remainder of this entire year. That's what will stop (Putin).""

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, speaking to reporters from alliance headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday, said using chemical weapons would change the nature of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.

""It will be a blatant violation of international law and with far-reaching consequences,"" Stoltenberg said, adding that the use of such weapons could impact nearby NATO member countries.

The NATO alliance will be soon providing Ukraine with equipment to protect against chemical, biological, radiological as well as nuclear weapons, said Stoltenberg. He declined to elaborate on what kind of specific support the alliance would provide in order to protect operational security.

Russia has previously used chemical weapons on the battlefield, including in Syria, against Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny and against former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in London.

Frustrated with his slow progress in Ukraine, Putin has been increasingly signaling the possibility of using chemical or biological weapons to wipe out entire cities and force the country to surrender.

Biden warned earlier this week that Putin was falsely accusing the U.S. and Ukraine of using biological or chemical weapons to possibly justify Russia's own attack on Ukraine.

""Russia has a long track record of accusing others of what they are either already doing or about to do, and that is the kind of projection that we've seen in the last couple of weeks. And it's very scary,"" Biden said in an interview Tuesday.

Following the NATO meeting Biden said that U.S. allies had accomplished all three of his major goals in Brussels.

""First, to support Ukraine with military and humanitarian assistance. Second was to impose the most significant most significant economic sanctions regime ever, in order to cripple Putin's economy and punish him for his actions. Third, was to fortify the eastern flank of our NATO allies who were obviously very, very concerned and somewhat worried what would happen,"" said Biden.

Earlier in the day, the White House announced that the United States will sanction approximately 400 Russian individuals and entities, including more than 300 lawmakers from the Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, and Russian elites.

The G-7 and the EU also announced new measures to crack down on Russian efforts to evade current sanctions, including those on its central bank.

In addition to punitive measures against Russia, Biden announced several new efforts to assist Ukraine and countries dependent upon Ukraine's grain harvest, which is in jeopardy as a result of the Russian invasion.

The U.S. ""is prepared to commit more than $1 billion in humanitarian assistance to help get relief to millions of Ukrainians affected by the war in Ukraine,"" said Biden.

""Many Ukrainian refugees will wish to stay in Europe, closer to their homes, but also will welcome 100,000 Ukrainians to the United States, with a focus on reuniting families. And we will invest $320 million dollars to bolster democratic resilience and defend human rights to Ukraine and neighboring countries,"" Biden told reporters at a press conference following the meetings.

Through the U.S. government's feed the future initiative, the Biden administration will provide $11 billion over the next five years to address threats to food security and prevent malnutrition.

The lion's share of Ukraine's grain exports currently go to Africa and Asia, and the American funds will be deployed to many of the countries where the population is especially vulnerable to a rise in food prices.",https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/24/biden-says-us-would-respond-to-russia-if-putin-uses-chemical-or-biological-weapons.html
