On Sunday, Turkish leaders labeled Russian’s invasion of Ukraine a war, a rhetorical shift that sets the stage for Turkey limiting warships transiting the Turkish Straits and entering the Black Sea. Speaking on CNN Turk, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu stated that “the situation in Ukraine has transformed into a war” and Turkey “will implement all articles of Montreux transparently.” Çavuşoğlu was referencing the 1936 Montreux Convention, an international agreement that governs the transit of all vessels and airplanes through the Turkish Straits, a strategic chokepoint that links the Black Sea with the Mediterranean Sea. As the Russia-Ukraine conflict rages, the Montreux Convention has taken on increased importance as a potential regulator of warship traffic into the conflict zone. If Turkey formally invokes Montreux’s wartime provisions, Russian warships will generally be prohibited from entering the Black Sea. This would play a small but substantive role in de-escalating Russia-Ukraine tensions.

What is the Montreux Convention?

The 1936 Convention Regarding the Regime of the Straits (commonly referred to as the Montreux Convention, after the city in Switzerland where it was negotiated) is a 1936 international agreement that governs the transit of the Turkish Straits for merchant vessels, vessels of war, and aircraft. Negotiated in the shadow of an expansionist Nazi Germany, the Convention includes 29 Articles and three technical annexes that address which warships may enter the Black Sea. It has played an important role in demilitarizing the Black Sea for the past 85+ years. It does so by limiting the size of vessels that may enter the Black Sea, imposing notification requirements on warships transiting the Turkish Straits, and restricting how long non-Black Sea powers can deploy their warships in the Black Sea. Since its inception, Montreux has played an important role in enforcing a rules-based international order in the Black Sea and Turkish Straits.

The U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the “Constitution of the Oceans”, governs transit passage through international straits around the world. Article 35 clarifies that UNCLOS does not apply to “long-standing international conventions in force.” The upshot: Montreux Convention’s restrictive provisions, and not UNCLOS, govern the Turkish Straits, which enjoy a truly unique legal status in international transit governance.

Because Montreux was negotiated over 85 years ago and naval warships and technology have changed dramatically since that time, it can sometimes be difficult to apply the Convention’s highly technical transit limitations to modern warships. Montreux generally limits the passage of capital ships greater than 15,000 tons, but this can be subject to some interpretation and debate. For example, during my time on the U.S. Navy’s Sixth Fleet staff in 2008, where I served as an international law and ethics attorney, the Russia-Georgia conflict raged for several weeks. The USS Mount Whitney transited the Straits and entered the Black Sea despite questions about its tonnage and whether it fell under a Montreux exception. While Russia protested the Mount Whitney’s transit as a violation of Montreux and an unnecessary provocation, Turkey has allowed the Mount Whitney to transit the Turkish Straits since that time. U.S. destroyers routinely transit the Straits. The USS Porter, a guided missile destroyer, conducted exercises and operations in November 2021 with the Bulgarian, Romanian, Turkish, and Ukrainian navies.

During peacetime, civilian merchant vessels enjoy complete freedom of transit and navigation through the Straits, “under any flag any with any kind of cargo.” The Montreux Convention is unique in the law of the sea in that it explicitly discriminates against nations outside the Black Sea. Instead, Montreux favors six “Black Sea Powers” (Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Romania, Georgia, and Bulgaria) over “non-Black Sea Powers” (everyone else). Non-Black Sea Powers cannot remain in the Black Sea for longer than 21 days. The Convention also restricts access to the Black Sea for belligerents during war and allows Turkey to restrict access when it considers itself to be threatened with imminent danger of war. Following Russia’s annexation of Crimea, its naval power and presence in the Black Sea has increased – which is permissible under the privileges it enjoys as a Black Sea Power, and which has been a source of growing NATO concern.

What is the Significance of Montreux’s Wartime Provisions?

Of the Black Sea Powers, Turkey is, by far, the most important. Montreux empowers Turkey with the legal authority to control the passage of warships through the Straits during war. Were Turkey to restrict passage now, that would hurt Russia but not affect Ukraine, which lacks a large naval presence and is operating in a defensive posture. In fact, Ukraine has already asked Turkey to intervene by closing the Straits to Russian warships. The Black Sea has been the site of fighting between Russia and Ukrainian forces, and several Russian naval assets are already in the Black Sea.

Two Montreux provisions are of critical importance for the unfolding Russia-Ukraine conflict. First, Article 19 states that during times of war – when Turkey is not a belligerent – warships enjoy freedom of navigation and transit through the Straits. But vessels of war belonging to belligerent parties are prohibited from transiting the Straits unless they are returning to base or rendering assistance. This appears to be the situation at hand in Ukraine, as we are witnessing two sovereign nations engaged in an international armed conflict. Turkey is not actively fighting and remains a non-belligerent. The Turkish Foreign Minister pointed to this provision yesterday, stating “Article 19 of the Montreux Convention is clear. This is war.” Invoking Article 19 would restrict Russian warships operating in the Mediterranean Sea from entering the Black Sea. This is significant: as of this writing, there are 16 Russian warships – the bulk of the entire Russian Navy ­– operating off the coast of Syria. They would now be prevented from transiting the Straits and entering the conflict.

Second, Article 21 states that if Turkey “considers herself to be threatened with imminent danger of war” (emphasis added), the Turkish Government may limit the passage of warships through the Turkish Straits. The decision of what warships may enter is then left entirely to the Turkish Government’s discretion. Once again, if Turkey so elected, this could prevent Russian ships outside the conflict from transiting the Turkish Straits and entering the Black Sea. Significantly, Article 21 empowers Turkey with enormous discretion to allow warships to pass through the Straits. So Turkey could feasibly allow NATO non-Black Sea vessels to transit and exclude Russian vessels from entering the Black Sea. Still, it is hard to see how Turkey could credibly claim that it is threatened with imminent danger of war. Article 19 seems much more likely to be the wartime provision at play.

Invoking either Article would be historically significant. Turkey has not labelled earlier Russian aggression in Georgia, Crimea, or eastern Ukraine a “time of war” and restricted Black Sea access. In fact, Turkey has only invoked Montreux’s wartime provisions once before: in World War II, to prevent German and Italian combatants from entering the Black Sea.

Other Considerations: the U.S. and NATO Maritime Presence and Strategic Concerns Around Escalation

The U.S. was absent from the Montreux Convention negotiations and has not joined the treaty. Nevertheless, the U.S. abides by the Convention under customary international law. While the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier is operating in the Mediterranean Sea, the Truman’s passage through the Turkish Straits is likely a non-starter. While there is no provision in the body of the Montreux Convention addressing aircraft carriers, a nuclear aircraft carrier is a capital ship that exceeds Montreux’s tonnage limitations. But other U.S. and NATO vessels could still feasibly transit the Turkish Straits, provided they give Turkey ample notice under the Convention (15 days for all non-Black Sea Powers). The USS Porter destroyer and USS Mount Whitney (Sixth Fleet flagship) were recently in the Black Sea, although no NATO vessels are operating there now. Vessels of war belonging to non-Black Sea Powers – which includes much of NATO’s maritime force – are prohibited from remaining in the Black Sea for more than 21 days. Putin may see an increased NATO presence in the Black Sea as an escalatory measure, so it remains unclear whether this is being seriously considered.

If the conflict escalates, the rights of parties other than Ukraine and Russia will also depend on whether other states are adjudged to be co-belligerents. This could cut in one of two ways: if Turkey is not a belligerent but other states join the fight, their access would be compulsorily restricted under Article 19. But if Turkey itself were to join as a belligerent, or if the conflict escalated to the extent that Turkey did feel credibly threatened, Articles 20 and 21 would give Turkey discretion over the passage of warships – including the right to deny return passage to “vessels of war belonging to the State whose attitude has given rise to” Turkey’s belief in imminent danger of war.

Article 23 is the only provision that governs aircraft transiting the Straits. It authorizes Turkey to set up air routes through the Straits. Montreux does not expressly address military aircraft, and it remains unclear how invoking the Article 19 wartime provisions will affect air travel through the Straits. As Russia is denied access to European airspace, the Turkish Strait air route may well increase in importance.

Finally, it is important to note that Russia, as a Black Sea Power, has benefited quite a bit from the Montreux regime and is almost certain to abide by Turkish authority in the Straits. Disregarding Montreux would immediately escalate tensions between Russia and Turkey and appears to be a non-starter.

It remains to be seen if Turkey’s rhetorical use of war has already led to the legal implementation of the Montreux Convention’s wartime provisions. So far, Turkey has not taken measures to block the Straits, but Çavuşoğlu stated that Turkey always had “implemented the Montreux Agreement to the letter” and would do the same here. And even if Turkey did close the Straits to the arrival of future Russian warships, it could not force Russian vessels already engaging in conflict from leaving the Black Sea. It would also be required to allow those Russian vessels to return home when Russia so chose. Still, invoking the Montreux wartime provision would signal the seriousness with which Turkey, a key NATO ally, views the Russian-Ukraine conflict. It would also be broadly aligned with international efforts to isolate Russia by denying Russian access to airspace and global economic markets.

1,6c42bbcf-b04b-4f98-8800-8a1c82f966e7,"['Isil Sariyuce', 'Arwa Damon']",2022-02-28 00:00:00,"(CNN) Turkey has officially labeled Russia's invasion of Ukraine as a war and says it will restrict some warships from passing through key waterways, in a move that experts said could potentially hinder some of Moscow's military activities in the region.

On Thursday, Russian forces launched a land, sea and air assault on Ukraine in the biggest attack by one state against another in Europe since World War Two.

Ukraine's ambassador to Turkey Vasyl Bodnar went on local television last week and appealed for the government in Ankara to close its key straits to Russian warships under provisions of the 1936 Montreux Convention. Turkey said it could only do so if it officially recognized the conflict as a war, and on Sunday, that's what it did.

On Monday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his government would ""use the authority given to our country by the Montreux Convention on ship traffic in the straits in a way that will prevent the crisis from escalating.""

Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu later said that Turkey had warned both Black Sea and non-Black Sea countries not to pass warships through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles Straits, according to Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency.

""There has been no request for passage through the straits [since the war started],"" Cavusoglu said.

While Erdogan said he considered ""Russia's attack on Ukraine unacceptable,"" he also said Turkey would not abandon its ties with Russia or Ukraine.

Here's what you need to know.

What is the Montreux Convention?

The convention gives Turkey certain control over the passage of warships from the Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits that connect the Aegean, Marmara, and Black Sea.

In peace time, warships can pass the straits by prior diplomatic notification with certain limitations on the weight of the ships and arms they carry -- and depending on whether the ship belongs to a Black Sea nation or not. And at times of war, Turkey can bar the passage of the warships of belligerent parties from crossing.

According to the convention, if Turkey is a party to the war or considers itself threatened with imminent danger, it can shut down the straits to the passage of warships.

How does this affect Russia?

Both Russia and Ukraine lie on the Black Sea, along with Romania and NATO members Bulgaria and Georgia. Turkey can limit the transit of Russian warships from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea through its straits under the Montreux Convention, but the pact has a caveat: belligerent states' warships can cross if they are returning to their base of origin.

""If the ship of the war country will return to its port, an exception is made. We will implement all the provisions of Montreux with transparency,"" said Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, adding that the exception should not be abused.

The move would only be symbolic, said Mustafa Aydin, president of the International Relations Council of Turkey.

""Russia has enough firepower in the Black Sea that it doesn't make sense for NATO countries to [enter],"" he said. ""Russia has complete supremacy on the water.""

But if the war drags on, Moscow may feel the heat, since Russia had already completed its naval buildup in the Black Sea by shifting units from the Baltic Sea ahead of the start of hostilities, said Serhat Guvenc, professor of international relations at Istanbul's Kadir Has University.

Earlier in February, six Russian warships and a submarine transited the Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits to the Black Sea for what Moscow called naval drills near Ukrainian waters.

""They [Russia] probably have enough resources to sustain their naval power in the Black Sea for about two to three months,"" he said. ""But if conflict drags on, it'll be a different story.""

Why did Turkey declare the conflict a war?

Guvenc said he hadn't expected Turkey to take a decision so soon, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ""put Ankara on the spot"" by prematurely thanking Turkey on Twitter for its support.

I thank my friend Mr. President of 🇹🇷 @RTErdogan and the people of 🇹🇷 for their strong support. The ban on the passage of 🇷🇺 warships to the Black Sea and significant military and humanitarian support for 🇺🇦 are extremely important today. The people of 🇺🇦 will never forget that! — Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa) February 26, 2022

Turkey has said that it has historically respected the treaty and will continue to do so.

Guvenc said it's in Ankara's interest to do so because the treaty supports Turkey at times of war. Any exception made to please Russia could jeopardize the treaty's credibility in the long run.

""The United States is very interested in the idea of unrestricted freedom of navigation through the Turkish straits, as is the case with other waterways like the Suez and Panama canals,"" he said. A deviation from the convention would give the US ""a legitimate reason to question Turkey's status as the watchdog of Montreux.""

How could this affect Turkey's foreign relations?

Turkey has a maritime border with both Ukraine and Russia on the Black Sea and views both countries as friendly. Ankara relies on Russia for tourism and natural gas but also has close economic and defense ties to Ukraine and has, despite Russian objections, sold drones to the country.

The Soviet Union, the Russian state's predecessor, was one of the original signatories of the Montreux Convention.

""Russia knows the intricacies of the politics and the law and would have been prepared for such an eventuality,"" said Guvenc. Moscow, however, may not have expected Ankara to act on the treaty so soon, he added.

""Turkey can sell this move as purely observing an obligation under international law,"" he said, but the move may be an indication of where Turkey may lean if the conflict drags on. ""Turkey has decided to align more with its traditional allies in NATO and the European Union, and a bit away from Russia.""

Iran rejects deadline, 'politically motivated' claims in nuclear talks

Iran said on Sunday it will not accept any deadline set by the West to revive its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, and wants what it described as ""politically motivated"" claims by UN watchdog IAEA about Tehran's nuclear work to be dropped, Iranian state TV reported.

Background: One of the sticking points in the indirect talks between Iran and the United States to revive the deal appears to be questions about uranium traces found by the IAEA at old but undeclared sites in Iran.

Why it matters: Media reports said that the US had set a deadline for the nuclear talks in the Austrian capital Vienna. Iran's chief nuclear negotiator was due to return to Vienna on Sunday evening for the talks.

UAE not taking sides in Ukraine war, senior official says

The United Arab Emirates wants to encourage a political solution for the Ukraine war and taking sides would only encourage violence, a senior UAE official said on Sunday.

Background: The comment, posted by Anwar Gargash on Twitter, comes after the UAE abstained from a Friday vote on a draft United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. It did not pass because of Russia's veto. Read full story

Why it matters: Gulf Arab states have so far taken a neutral stance between Western allies and Russia, with which they are partners under an oil producers' alliance known as OPEC+. Saudi Arabia and the UAE also have investment and business ties with Moscow.

UN Security Council to vote on Houthi arms embargo

The Security Council is due to vote Monday on a proposal by the United Arab Emirates to impose an arms embargo on Yemen's Houthis after the group claimed several drone and missile assaults on the country this year.

Background: A year ago, the US revoked a designation of the Houthis as a terrorist organization over concerns that it would worsen Yemen's humanitarian crisis. The UAE, Saudi Arabia and some US lawmakers are pressing the White House to return the Houthi movement to the US list of foreign terrorist groups over the recent Houthi attacks on the UAE and Saudi Arabia.

Why it matters: The measure would expand a targeted UN arms embargo on several Houthi leaders to the whole group. The measure needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by any of the Security Council's permanent members -- Russia, the US, Britain, France or China.

Around the region

A view shows the ancient city of Hatra in Iraq, once destroyed by Islamic State militants years ago, during a ceremony revealing a renovation project on February 24.

Iraqi archaeological authorities reopened a site at the ancient city of Hatra last week following the partial completion of a renovation project of the site once destroyed by ISIS militants years ago, Reuters reports.

Officials say nearly 15% of the site was destroyed by ISIS militants, who took over large swathes of the country.

Images published online in 2015 allegedly showed what is described as ISIS militants destroying statues and artifacts at the site with sledgehammers and pickaxes.

The renovation project is carried out in cooperation with the Italian International Association for Mediterranean and Oriental Studies (ISMEO). Only 5% of the destruction has been renovated and the rest of the project is underway, officials added.

Hatra, a UNESCO World Heritage site, was among many sites destroyed by ISIS militants in Iraq and Syria, including the 2,700-year-old city of Khorsabad famed for its colossal statues of human-headed winged bulls.

ISIS once ruled a self-declared caliphate in parts of Iraq and Syria which contain some of the richest archaeological treasures on earth, where ancient Assyrian empires built their capitals, Greco-Roman civilization flourished and Muslim and Christian sects co-existed for centuries.

""Turkey will implement all provisions of Montreux Convention in a transparent manner,"" the minister told a live interview with broadcaster CNN Türk.

Under the 1936 Montreux Convention, NATO member Turkey has control over the Bosporus and Dardanelles straits, linking the Mediterranean and Black seas. The pact gives Ankara the power to regulate the transit of naval warships and to close the straits to foreign warships during wartime and when it is threatened.

The Turkish diplomat also held talks on Ukraine with Estonia's Foreign Minister Eva-Maria Liimets along with Dutch counterpart Wopke Hoekstra and Helga Schmid, the secretary-general of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).

In addition, he discussed the humanitarian issue and efforts to ensure a cease-fire in Ukraine during a conversation with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.

Turkey earlier called Russia's invasion of Ukraine a ""war"" on Sunday in a rhetorical shift that opened the way for the move.

While building close cooperation with Russia on defense and energy, Ankara has also sold sophisticated drones to Ukraine and signed a deal to co-produce more, angering Moscow. Turkish officials noted that the country would continue to support Ukraine's territorial integrity and unity.

Turkey opposes Russian policies in Syria and Libya, its annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its 2008 recognition of two Georgian regions.

He also said Turkey was pleased about Ukraine and Russia's decision to meet on Monday.

Ukraine agreed to launch peace talks with Russia on Sunday, even as battles raged in key cities and President Vladimir Putin raised the prospect of a nuclear escalation with the West.

Delegations from each country are set to meet at the Ukrainian-Belarusian border, the office of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.

There are no conditions to the planned talks at the border, according to the statement.

He noted that Turkey is also striving to ensure the safe evacuation of around 6,600 Turkish citizens in Ukraine.

The Turkish nationals started to arrive on Sunday morning by land after the Turkish Foreign Ministry arranged their evacuation through Romania and Bulgaria due to the closure of the Ukrainian airspace after Russia's attacks on Ukraine.

The Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Straits gives Turkey control over the water route between the Black Sea – home to a major Russian naval force – and the Mediterranean Sea and beyond.

It sets limits on the passage of civilian vessels and military warships through the Dardanelles and the Bosporus straits, which with the Sea of Marmara between them form the seagoing link between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean.

The international agreement was signed by Australia, Bulgaria, France, Greece, Japan, Romania, Yugoslavia, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and Turkey and has been in effect since November 1936.

Now the Montreux Convention is serving an important role in the Ukraine conflict. Ukraine has asked Turkey to close the straits to Russian warships, highlighting the Turkish role in keeping regional peace. The Turkish government agreed on Feb. 28, 2022. However, several Russian warships entered the Black Sea in early February. And Turkey has said it would not prevent Russian warships from entering the Black Sea if Russia claimed they were returning to their home port.

Four key elements in the Montreux Convention regulate which vessels may enter the Black Sea in wartime:

Turkey has used the convention’s powers before. During World War II, Turkey closed the straits to warships belonging to combatant nations. That prevented the Axis powers from sending their warships to attack the Soviet Union – and blocked the Soviet navy from participating in combat in the Mediterranean.

In the current situation, the Turkish government finds itself in a difficult position, as both Ukraine and Russia are important partners in critical energy and military trade agreements. Turkey, a NATO member since 1952, wants to strengthen its ties with the West while not upsetting Russia. Its control over these key straits may test its balancing act.

WASHINGTON: Turkey’s foreign minister today said his government now views the conflict between Russia and Ukraine as a “war.” It’s a declaration that has consequences beyond semantics that could lead to the country more strictly limiting Russia’s access to the Black Sea, depending on how Turkey plays a delicate geopolitical hand.

“Is this a conflict or a war? We decided on that. Article 19 of the Montreux Convention is very clear. This is a war,” the country’s foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said in a live interview to CNN Turk.

The Montreux Convention dates back to 1936 and is an international agreement that gave Turkey exclusive control over the only canals in and out of the Black Sea, a body of water to Turkey’s north with extensive coastlines in both southern Russia and southern Ukraine.

“If a war exists but Turkey is not a party to it, Article 19 of the Montreux Convention requires Turkey to close the strait to warships of all belligerent states,” Cornell Overfield, an expert at the Center for Naval Analyses told Breaking Defense earlier this week. CNA is a federally-funded research and development center that also provides advice directly to the Pentagon.

Although Ankara has publicly voiced opposition to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it had not yet signaled a willingness to assert the powers given to it under the Montreux Convention. The country also reiterated that it was unable to block a ship from returning to its homeport.

Joshua Tallis, also a naval expert at CNA, told Breaking Defense that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has put Ankara in a difficult position.

“Turkey finds itself at the center of two divergent instincts among Ukraine’s friends, which simultaneously want to help Ukraine however possible while also avoiding triggering an escalation that involves NATO,” he said. Turkey has been a member of NATO since 1952, recently with some controversy related to its own relationship with Russia.

Preserving the special powers Ankara holds under Article 19 is likely top of mind for Turkish officials, Tallis added, and they would be hesitant to do something that might cause Russia to retaliate, like by denouncing the convention.

Still, Overfield noted, it would not necessarily be in Russia’s best interest to spoil the Montreux Convention. As a country with a border on the Black Sea, Russia enjoys special privileges not granted to other countries.

“Russia is arguably the prime beneficiary of the Montreux regime: without Montreux, UNCLOS rules on transit passage would apply to the Straits and all warships would have unrestricted access to the Black Sea,” said Overfield, referring to the United Nation’s major international pact governing maritime behaviors.

As of press time, it’s not clear what practical limits Turkey may set, and the moves could be more symbolic than not. Much of Russia’s fleet has already entered the Black Sea, with the exception of several vessels operating in the Mediterranean, USNI News reported.

“Turkey has a long record of successful and effective implementation of the Montreux Convention, and we are confident Turkey will implement it will appropriately,” a State Department spokesperson told Breaking Defense on Thursday.

“We will continue to engage with Turkey and our other Allies on how best to address Russia’s efforts to undermine the rules based international order.

6,6c42bbcf-b04b-4f98-8800-8a1c82f966e7,[],,"Turkey is set to implement an international convention on naval passage through two of its strategic straits, which would allow them to limit the movement of Russian warships between the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea. Mevlut Cavusoglu, Turkey's foreign minister said on February 27 that the situation in Ukraine had become a war, a declaration that authorizes Ankara to activate the Montreux Convention and ban Russian war vessels from entering the Black Sea through the Bosporus and Dardanelles straits.

""In the beginning, it was a Russian attack,"" Cavusoglu said in an interview with broadcaster CNN Turkish."" Now it has turned into a war."" ""Turkey will implement all provisions of Montreux Convention in a transparent manner,"" he added. The decision comes three days after Kyiv had asked Ankara to close the Bosporus and Dardanelles straits to Russian ships. But what does the Montreux Convention entail and how could its implementation affect the war between Russia and Ukraine?

The only passage to the Black Sea

The Bosporus and Dardanelles straits, also known as the Turkish Straits or the Black Sea Straits, connect the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea via the Sea of Marmara. It is the only passage through which the Black Sea ports can access the Mediterranean and beyond. Over three million barrels of oil, about three percent of the daily global supply, mostly produced in Russia, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan, pass through this waterway every day. The route also ships large amounts of iron, steel, and agricultural products from the Black Sea coast to Europe and the rest of the world.

According to the 1936 Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Straits, often referred to simply as the Montreux Convention, Turkey has control over both the Bosporus and Dardanelles straits. In the event of a war, the pact gives Ankara the right to regulate the transit of naval warships and to block the straits to warships belonging to the countries involved in the conflict.

Could Turkey block Russian warships?

Russia's location on the Black Sea complicates the situation. Article 19 of the treaty contains an exception for the countries on the Black Sea that can effectively undermine Turkey’s power in blocking the Russian warships entering or exiting the Black Sea: ""Vessels of war belonging to belligerent powers, whether they are Black Sea Powers or not, which have become separated from their bases, may return thereto,"" it says. That means warships can return to their original bases through the passage and Turkey cannot prevent it.

For example, a Russian fleet registered in the Black Sea but currently located in the Mediterranean Sea, is allowed to pass through the Bosporus and Dardanelles straits and return to its base. The condition also applies to Russian fleets currently in the Black Sea that belong to a base in the Mediterranean or Baltic Sea. Russia is free to take them out of the Black Sea.

Cavusoglu raised this point in his interview with CNN. ""If this warship is to go to the base in the country that is a party to the war, then this passage cannot be prevented"", he said, adding that there should be no abuse and ""the ships returning to their bases should not be involved in a war after saying it will go back to the base.""

The official assignment of a ship to a port determines whether it has the right to pass through the Straits or not. The official assignment, according to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) falls under the authority of the state that owns the ships. Therefore, another possible way for Russia to exploit the Montreux Convention, would be to reassign some of its vessels to the Black Sea.

No immediate impact, but long term consequences

The extensive freedom that Russia enjoys due to its location on the Black Sea casts doubts on whether invoking the pact will have significant military consequences on the ongoing conflict. ""This is mainly order-reinforcing; any military relevance will be minor & long-term,"" wrote Cornell Overfield, analyst at the Center for Naval Analyses, in a thread of Tweets.

According to the treaty, vessels that Russia decides to bring into the Black Sea or take out, will have to remain there until the end of the war. In addition, ""warships, including auxiliary vessels, not currently in the Black Sea and not traditionally based there, absolutely may not enter the Black Sea,"" Overfield wrote. ""This might be irrelevant in the short term but could be big if the conflict drags on.""

Sinan Ulgen, former Turkish diplomat and researcher at the Carnegie Foundation in Europe, believes that invoking the treaty will make it more complicated for Russia to balance its military presence in the Black Sea and the East Mediterranean. ""Before Russia was able to flexibly use its Black Sea fleet naval assets including submarines,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""Now not anymore. It has to choose which asset will be in the Black Sea and which one will remain in the Mediterranean.""

""What Turkey is doing is more like what countries closing their airspace to Russia flights are doing,"" Overfield wrote. ""Closing the Straits might never have a military impact in the Russo-Ukrainian War,"" he adds. ""But it is Turkey’s unique way of punishing Russia for its crime of aggression and showing commitment to international law.""",https://frontline.thehindu.com/dispatches/explained-the-montreux-convention-and-whether-turkey-can-close-its-waterway-to-russian-navy/article38444000.ece

These developments have forced Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan — who, ahead of Friday’s NATO meeting to discuss the Russian invasion, had criticized his allies as being all talk and no action — to end his own inaction on Ukraine’s Thursday request for Ankara to close the Bosphorus and Dardanelles, and with them access to the Black Sea, to Russian warships per the 1936 Montreux Convention. The Turkish minister of foreign affairs, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, on Sunday announced that what was unfolding in Ukraine was indeed a “war,” effectively closing the straits to the warships of belligerents. Erdoğan on Monday gave his implicit blessing to the decision by declaring how Turkey intends to continue to implement the convention in a manner to prevent crisis escalation, underlining that Turkey desires peace in the region. He expressed disappointment that Turkey’s offers of mediation/arbitration did not bear fruit and that Turkey does not wish to give up good relations with both countries.

The decision was partly prompted by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s tweet on Saturday thanking Turkey for closing the straits and partly by the necessity of not being left behind. Zelenskyy deliberately put Erdoğan in the spotlight to break the Turkish president’s indecision. Nevertheless, Erdoğan’s dilemma of choosing between Ukraine and Russia in the conflict has not been resolved. Furthermore, he faces a greater and more fundamental dilemma of whether he will persist with his anti-Westernism, including cozying up to Russia, or take a bold strategic step and return Turkey to its traditional Western vocation.

What Zelenskyy sought from Erdoğan

The Montreux Convention has regulated merchant and military maritime traffic into and out of the Black Sea for 85 years. It lays down a set of provisions to regulate the passage of warships through the straits. These provisions govern the mode of entry, duration of stay, and tonnage, as well as the nature of weapons (main gun calibers, to be precise) they can carry on board. Their application varies depending on whether a passage occurs in peace or wartime or when there is a threat of war. Although the agreement generally favors Black Sea littoral states (Russia, Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria, and Georgia) over others in terms of transit of warships through the straits, certain restrictions apply universally without regard to a littoral-non-littoral distinction.

Zelenskyy’s call concerned Article 19 of the convention which requires Turkey in time of war to close the straits to the passage of warships from the belligerent states. Turkey has also the option to invoke Article 21 if Turkey considers itself to be threatened with “imminent danger of war.” Then “the passage of warships shall be left entirely to the discretion of the Turkish Government.” However, in both cases there are exceptions which would allow warships belonging to “belligerent Powers” to return to their home bases from outside the Black Sea.

Turkey could have possibly argued that what is unfolding in Ukraine is not a war especially given that Moscow has not officially declared war on Ukraine. However, given the blatant nature of Russia’s aggression, so transparently revealed through social media, such a position would have been embarrassingly lacking in credibility. It would have also opened a Pandora’s box concerning the future of the Montreux Convention. The convention’s implementation was never perfect, but the fact that, so far, there has been no attempt to revise it and the international community has continued to abide by its terms speak volumes. The credit for this primarily went to Turkey’s long-standing tradition of scrupulously overseeing the implementation of its terms. This could have changed, and triggered demands for revisions, a longtime nightmare of Turkey. Moreover, the decision to close the straits to the warships of the belligerents is unlikely to alter the military situation in the Black Sea. Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, based in Crimea, is formidable; Moscow had already completed its naval buildup, and Ukraine’s navy is very limited. The real impact of the Turkish decision will be felt if the conflict turns into a war of attrition for Russia.

Erdoğan’s reasons for caution and new dilemmas

The Turkish economy is in its worst state since a long time, marked by galloping inflation and a growing current accounts deficit. Both Russia and Ukraine are economically dear to Turkey. 78% of Turkey’s grain imports come from the two countries (64.6% from Russia and 13.4% from Ukraine). At a time when Western tourists are staying away, Russian and Ukrainian ones have constituted an important source of income for a sector that accounts for around 4% of the Turkish GDP. Both countries are important markets for Turkish exports as well as construction services. Finally, Turkey has important defense projects with both. Indeed, Turkish Bayraktar TB2 drones have been a valuable asset for Ukraine in the early days of the war.

However, in terms of dependence, the balance has favored Russia. Firstly, on energy Turkey depends heavily on Russia. It is the second largest importer of Russian natural gas after Germany and Russia has been constructing a nuclear energy station that would supply 30% of Turkey’s energy needs by 2030. Secondly, Turkey has relied on Russian acquiescence in northern Syria to deter the Assad regimes from mounting an offensive that risks displacing large numbers of displaced Syrians into Turkey at a time when public discontent against Syrian refugees is peaking (see slide 95 here). Furthermore, there is also the legacy of the pain that Russian President Vladimir Putin inflicted on Turkey after a Russian fighter plane was shot down by Turkey in November 2015 and the way Putin extracted an apology from Erdoğan himself.

Undoubtedly, these considerations would have weighed heavily in Erdoğan’s initial inaction and choice to play for time not to upset Putin. It may still be too early to predict the course of events in the immediate future, but it is increasingly looking like Putin’s strategy has failed, and Ukrainians at large have stood their ground long enough for most of the world to rally behind them. More importantly, Putin inadvertently has helped trans-Atlantic allies to unite and finally confront him with truly harsh sanctions as well as supply significant lethal weapons to Ukraine. Furthermore, this past weekend also revealed the weakness of Putin’s governance system in the face of a country led by a democratically-elected president fighting to join the Western world.

Beyond the pressure that the crisis is putting on energy prices, Western sanctions — especially the decision to restrict Russian banks’ access to SWIFT — will adversely impact the Turkish economy. The fragile Turkish currency lost 5% of its value just on the news of the Russian invasion. News of a barrage of tourism cancellations destroying expectations of a post-COVID-19 boom is going to exacerbate this fragility.

These developments leave Erdoğan facing a new dilemma: to persist with his current policies or return Turkey to its traditional Western strategic orientation. The decision to implement Article 19 of the Montreux Convention was a significant step in the right direction but more should follow. Three suggestions: cease the incessant anti-Western rhetoric, abandon justifying the construction of the massive Canal Istanbul project as allowing Turkey to circumvent the Montreux Convention, and scrap the Russian S-400 missile systems that have so badly damaged the standing of Turkey in the trans-Atlantic alliance and increased Turkey’s dependence on Russia.",https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2022/02/28/erdogans-straits-of-indecision-in-the-russia-ukraine-war/

Shortly after, Zelensky tweeted : “I thank my friend [Erdogan] and the people of [Turkey] for their strong support. The ban on the passage of [Russian] warships to the Black Sea and significant military and humanitarian support for [Ukraine] are extremely important today. The people of [Ukraine] will never forget that!”

The straits have become a strategic factor in the war between Russia and Ukraine. Before Russia’s recent invasion of Ukraine, 16 Russian warships sailed into the Black Sea to conduct military exercises. Now, those forces are in the fight. Last week, Russian forces captured Ukraine’s Snake Island in the Black Sea and attacked Odessa, the country’s largest and busiest port as well as the country’s largest oil and gas terminal.

On Monday, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu closed the Bosporus and Dardanelles Straits to Russian warships, exercising Ankara’s right under Article 19 of the 1936 Montreux Convention.

However, afterward, there appeared to be some confusion about Turkey’s legal authority to close the straits under international law (or its willingness to exercise it), as Ankara replied it cannot stop the passage of Russian warships. Later, however, Turkish officials clarified that only Russian naval vessels returning to their home port would be exempt from the straits’ closure.

It is unclear whether Turkey exceeded its legal authority in closing the straits. Turkey has discretion to close the straits to warships of all nations party to a conflict. It may also do so if it is in apprehension of an “imminent danger of war.” But closing the straits to neutral warships that are neither party to the Russia-Ukraine conflict nor pose a threat to Turkey in such a way that they would place it in “imminent danger” appears to go beyond Ankara’s authority.

If Turkey exceeds its legal authority, that constitutes a breach of an international obligation or duty, exposing Turkey to the law of state responsibility. In customary international law, states may be held legally accountable through legal processes for internationally wrongful acts. An injured neutral state, for example, might seek arbitration to vindicate its navigational rights.

The Turkish Straits, consisting of the Bosporus and the Dardanelles Straits, are divided by the Sea of Marmara and constitute Turkey’s internal waters. Internal waters are those that are landward of a maritime baseline and include small inlets and bays, rivers, canals, harbors, and the mouths of rivers. These sea areas have the same legal character of the land itself, and states generally have the right to bar the transit of foreign-flagged vessels in these waters.

In this case, however, the Turkish Straits constitute straits used for international navigation, so Turkey must balance its right of sovereignty with its corresponding duty to the international community. The Turkish Straits are governed by the Montreux Convention, a “long-standing international [convention],” indirectly referred to in Article 35(c) of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.

Straits governed by long-standing conventions include the Danish straits connecting the Baltic Sea to the North Atlantic, which are governed by a series of 19th-century treaties between Denmark and other states. The Strait of Magellan between Argentina and Chile that joins the Atlantic Ocean with the Pacific Ocean is subject to an 1881 convention that guarantees all nations’ use. Likewise, the Aland Strait between Denmark and Sweden, which connects the Bothnian Sea with the Baltic Proper, falls under a 1922 agreement that ensures the islands’ non-fortification and neutralization.

The Turkish Straits are governed by the 1936 Montreux Convention, which has the most detailed provisions of long-standing conventions. The Montreux Convention provides that merchant vessels of all states enjoy freedom of passage through the Turkish Straits and contains some restrictions on warships, such as prohibiting the passage of aircraft carriers by any state.

The convention also contains rules that apply differently to states that border the Black Sea, such as Russia and Ukraine, than to naval vessels of states outside the Black Sea. In this regard, the total number of warships and maximum aggregate tonnage of warships from Black Sea states and states outside the region that transit the straits are limited to nine vessels and 15,000 tons, respectively. (Warship tonnage is a shorthand metric for capability, albeit an imperfect one.)

Finally, only submarines belonging to a Black Sea state may transit the Turkish Straits for the purpose of rejoining their Black Sea bases for the first time after their construction or purchase or for the purpose of repairs in dockyards outside of the Black Sea.

Naval forces must notify Turkey of their intended transit through diplomatic channels, providing eight days for Black Sea states and 15 days for non-Black Sea states.

The upshot of these rules is that Russia, as a Black Sea state, has the privileged right to transit the Turkish Straits to return its warships to their bases. The treaty states that during armed conflict, belligerents’ warships “shall not” pass through the straits unless the ships belong to a state that borders the Black Sea and are returning to their home ports. Once Turkey determined that Russia was “at war,” it had no choice under the treaty but to stop Russian warships from transiting the straits. The only exception: If Russian warships are returning to their bases in the Black Sea, then they are permitted passage.

Turkey also has complete discretion under Article 20 to close the straits to warships of all nations if Ankara is a party to the conflict. In such case, Turkey can stop warships of any nation from transiting the straits. Further, Article 21 of the Montreux Convention states that even if Turkey is not at war but “considers herself to be threatened with imminent danger of war,” the straits may be closed at Turkey’s discretion. Turkey invoked this provision on Feb. 28 and announced it was closing the straits to warships of all nations.

Turkey might plausibly suggest it is closing the straits to warships of all nations because some neutral states are likely to aid one of the belligerents, such as NATO warships surreptitiously supplying Ukrainian forces with intelligence and thereby escalating the risk of conflict on Turkey’s doorstep and indirectly threatening Turkey with “imminent danger of war.”

But this argument is quite a stretch, as neutral warships generally pose no threat to Turkey and therefore cannot be excluded. The right of neutral warships to transit the straits is also guaranteed in Article 20, however.

Turkey’s action to close the straits to warships of all nations sets an uncomfortable precedent for neutral states that are not party to the Ukraine conflict. Although they are not involved in the conflict, their navigational rights protected in Article 20 may be infringed on by Turkey’s decision, which appears not narrowly tailored to de-escalate the conflict at hand.

For example, the U.S. Sixth Fleet and other NATO members operate warships in the Black Sea, and the United States is a neutral party to the conflict. Those operations are essential for the alliance’s presence and security as well as to reassure allies Bulgaria and Romania, both coastal states on the Black Sea. In 2021, around 12 U.S. Navy ships, including the Sixth Fleet flagship USS Mount Whitney, spent a total of 182 days in the Black Sea.

Although U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken reportedly “expressed his appreciation” to Cavusoglu for Turkey’s action, it remains an open question how long the United States is prepared to give up its navigational rights through two of the world’s strategic straits. Rather than resolving the issue of warship transit through the straits, Turkey’s decision to close the waterways complicates its relationship with Russia while posing new and unintended legal issues with its NATO partners.",https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/03/01/turkey-black-sea-straits-russia-ships-ukraine-war/
