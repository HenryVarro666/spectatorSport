Military analyst Rob Lee points out that, while the rest of the world is hearing about Russia’s defeat in the Battle of Kyiv, witnessing all the evidence of Russian atrocities in Bucha, and watching as the tally of destroyed equipment and casualties reaches shocking highs … that’s not what Russia is hearing.

Not only are the folks back in Moscow getting a very rosy picture of success in the war, they are still being given a narrative in which Russia is fighting back the evil Nazi hordes, liberating grateful civilians, and trouncing a weak Ukrainian military. In the words of so many Russian apologists on social media, “everything is going exactly to plan.” That plan includes approximately 15,000 dead Russian soldiers and over 2,400 lost tanks, transports, helicopters, and other vehicles. So far.

But the lies don’t stop with what has happened up to this point. Russians are also hearing a false narrative that extends into the future, where commentators on Russian television are frequently calling for Ukraine to be utterly wiped from the map, or even for Russia to carry the war beyond the borders of Ukraine. They’re being whipped into a kind of victory-or-nothing frenzy.

x Andrei Kortunov. ""Russian society is in a state of extreme excitement and even exaltation; from the pages of newspapers and from TV screens, the scream of a hawk is heard much louder than the cooing of a pigeon. But public sentiment...should be controlled"" https://t.co/ZiOK1spUEz pic.twitter.com/Q1uZ1D9JZC — Shashank Joshi (@shashj) April 4, 2022

“There appears to be a widening gap between what the Russian military can achieve at this point and the expectations of many Russians,” writes Lee. “The more Russian news presents a rosy picture of the war, the harder it will be for people to accept the likely terms of a compromise settlement.”

Russia can continue to lie about Nazis and continue to lie about Bucha, and that may work for the people who consume nothing but Fox News Moscow Edition as their own possible outlet. But it will be harder to continue to lie about the thousands of missing soldiers, the inability to catch a flight to 90% of the world, the closed stores, silent factories, and empty shelves.

Was what Moscow would like to claim was a “feint” toward Kyiv, during which they took almost none of the Donbas region and don’t seem to have achieved any significant strategic goals, really worth the costs that Russia has paid and will continue to pay? And how is Moscow going to explain the mounting losses, even as Russian TV continues to claim that the Ukrainian military is weak, the people of Ukraine love Russia, and that Russian troops are being welcomed as liberators?

There’s no guarantee that Russians will ever wake up to Vladimir Putin’s deception, or become aware of the acts being carried out in their name. Sadly, there’s also no guarantee that anything would change even if they knew everything.

Testing ways to provide meaningful graphics, this is another view of that salient that juts out from the Russian-controlled area in the Donbas, extends out to the crossroads at Volokhiv Var, and extends down the M03 highway through Izyum. The small figures represent known positions of military advance, the red buildings occupied towns or villages, and the little spots of flame are recent actions.

Another view of the Izyum salient

In this case, the blue flame just west of Izyum represents the approximate location of the action in which a Russian helicopter was shot down using a skillfully aimed anti-tank missile. The flame further to the south is the location of two Russian tanks destroyed by Ukrainian forces. The level of action here shows the importance of the location and the presence of both militaries in direct confrontation. Further to the east, Russia is shelling and bombing Ukrainian defenses, and those established trenches along the edge of the territory previously controlled by Russia. This continues to the south along the whole line of trenches, with Ukrainian forces facing heavy bombardment.",https://www.dailykos.com/story/2022/4/5/2090213/-Ukraine-update-Widening-gap-between-what-Russian-military-can-achieve-and-expectations-of-Russians

The Battle of Mariupol continues, with Russian forces continuing to pound the city using artillery and airpower. The constrained information environment in Mariupol prevents us from assessing concrete changes in control of terrain, but Ukrainian forces appear to be sustaining organized resistance in parts of the city.

Belgorod continues to emerge as the primary concentration area for Russian forces regrouping and refitting after their retreat from Kyiv and in preparation for onward movement to their home stations or to join the fighting in the east. Elements of the Central Military District pulling back from Chernihiv Oblast are reportedly on their way to Belgorod. [2] Their final destination is not yet known.

Russia has not yet committed forces withdrawn from the Battle of Kyiv back into the fighting in eastern Ukraine. Russian reinforcements continuing the drive southeast from Izyum toward Slovyansk are from elements of 1st Guards Tank Army units that had been in the Kharkiv-Sumy area. Russian units that retreated from Kyiv will not likely regain combat effectiveness for some time, and it is not clear that the Russians intend to return them to the fight soon. That said, an unconfirmed Ukrainian military intelligence report suggests that Moscow could soon send the 64th Motorized Rifle Brigade of the 35th Combined Arms Army, a unit that reportedly committed war crimes in Bucha, into the fight in eastern Ukraine in the hopes that guilty members of that brigade and witnesses of its war crimes are killed in combat with Ukrainian forces.

x A thread on claimed Russian losses, and why the Ukrainian official claims might be far more accurate than people think. — Phillips P. OBrien (@PhillipsPOBrien) April 5, 2022

Its important to be skeptical of any government claiming losses inflicted on an enemy, historically such figures can be grossly inflated. One extreme example was the Japanese government in World War II, which claimed to basically wipe out the US Pacific fleet in every battle.

Only for the pesky Pacific Fleet to keep being amazingly rebuilt in a few months and appearing closer to Japan each time. As such, Ive never used official Ukrainian claims on Russian losses during this war. Here is the most recent claims. x https://twitter.com/MFA_Ukraine/status/1511291421780754435?s=20&t=Vz44yUxrxA3HEgcaxu9jMA

These claims might seem very high--though for the first time we actually have a tool for comparison. Open source intelligence based on photographic evidence. We can thus have a baseline comparison between minimum Russian losses and Ukrainian claims.

For tanks, which the open source intelligence has excellent evidence about, the difference between Ukrainian claims (676) and proven losses (425) is actually not that large considering that the OSINT figure is a base line.

There would be a large number of Russian losses not recorded--such as those not photographed (probably the large majority which were lost in territory under Russian ain the south and east), those which have been recovered by the Russians and those which have not yet been entered.

For those behind Russian lines, we can now assume those to be a very large number. Since the Russians pulled back from Kyiv, the database has been updated with approximately 50 new entries. Yet the Kyiv front only contained approx 30% of Russian forces.

If Russian forces in the south and east have suffered similar loss rates during the war, we can say that there would be something close to 115-120 undocumented destroyed Russian tanks behind Russian lines.

As for hit Russian tanks that they would be trying to recover, those damaged, etc, I have generally been using a rate of 25% of documented losses to put this figure in perspective. This is actually a very low rate (in WW2 there would be a much higher rate of damaged to destroyed

So I am being relatively cautious in estimating that there is another 25% of Russian tanks that would have been hit compared to those documented as destroyed. As of yesterday, that would have been an additional 111.

So if we add up documented losses (425) with a reasonable expectation of undocumented losses behind Russian lines (min 115) with damaged tanks that the Russians would be trying to salvage (111), you end up with 651 lost tanks.

That is only a little below the Ukrainian total of 676. So the Ukrainian claim, in historical terms, seems pretty reasonable and they might very well have hit 676 Russian tanks during the war so far.

And here is a map of the territory (red and pink) in which there would be many undocumented Russian losses. Been asked what percentage of overall Russian tanks that would be. Its not straightforward. If all Russian BTGs had a full compliment going into the invasion, that would be 1200. However other units would have had armor components as well, and Im not expert enough to say.

I think you could estimate around 1500 as a high base rate (that would be a lot for an army of 200,000. However, its also unlikely that all the BTGs had a full compliment as well, there were stories of them coming in below strength. so 1500 could be rather high.

Here is the thread on tank losses started a little while ago that got me thinking about this. Has something about how many losses were being recorded once the area to the north of Kyiv was recovered.

Attack On Europe: Documenting Equipment Losses During The 2022 Russian Invasion Of Ukraine Most recent update has Russian tank losses up to 425, 176 of which have been captured outright by the Ukrainians and potentially reusable. The Ukrainians have captured more and more advanced tanks than they have lost so far in the war. Ukraine has lost 93 tanks from all causes the large majority of which are T-64 (Soviet era tanks based on a model first built in 1964), while most of those captured have been T-72s with some T-80s and T-90s, all more modern and capable (designed 1972, 1980, 1990). Ukraine’s Tanks Could Be Better Than Russia’s. It Might Not Matter. Actually Ukrainians have upgraded their T-64s in interesting ways that some have argued actually makes them qualitatively as good if not better than many Russian newer models. So Ukrainians have many more tanks than they’ve lost, but maybe not better. Ukraine’s Best Tank Brigade Has Won The Battle For Chernihiv An interesting story of the Ukrainians using their best tank brigade to defend Chernihiv, one of the keys to the Battle of Kyiv. Seems that the Ukrainians were able to keep Russian air power at bay allowing them to use their upgraded T-64s to great effect. If the Russians have pulled out completely from the North, this is the kind of very strong unit that has been defending Kyiv that could be transferred to the Donbas. Unroll available on Thread Reader U.K. MOD in its latest intelligence update is assuming a full withdrawal from the north. Once those forces have gone, it won’t be quick to get them (or any other Russian forces) built up for another attempt at Kyiv. These troops are shot and have lost much of their equipment. A new force would require easy to see trainloads of equipment and many weeks of prep. Ukraine should have some flexibility with some of their forces in the Kyiv region and they can get to the Donbas more quickly than the Russians. • • •",https://www.dailykos.com/story/2022/4/5/2090303/-Ukraine-Invasion-Day-42

Holy shit!



Let me summarize it but I really recommend you read the whole thing because you're going to think I'm a fucking liar if you don't:



1. We must execute everybody in the military. They are nazis and have committed genocide and not Russia! Your eyes deceive you, you credulous moron! U gonna trust those ugly-ass eyeballs or the noble and honest Putin?



2. We must execute all those civilians defending their home, home defense forces or whatever. Don't feel restricted by the Geneva convention in any way. Hint torture is fine Hint.



3. The majority of Ukrainian civilians are also nazis since they supported the nazi troops. So it's fine to execute them as well. Some of them, we'll just do to them what the chinese are doing to the Uighur: Re-education Camps. Imprisonment. Torture. Rape. Assault. Family destruction. Death. Etc.



4. Ukrainians need to live like North Koreans for several decades. Maybe 40 years or so. Until Russia completes their genocide. No freedoms for them. They can't be trusted with freedom. Why didn't they freely choose to love their abuser?



5. Any Ukrainian with a college degree needs to be shot.



6. Anyone glass-wearing nerd as well. When in doubt, execute them.



7. Any Ukrainian who has too many books about Ukraine or written in Ukrainian should also be executed.



8. Any Ukrainian who doesn't speak Russian should be shot because they speak in 'nazi'?



As far as the justifications offered, they can be summarized like this



World: ""Please explain: How is being Ukrainian is the same as being a nazi? And please don't lie.""



Putin: ""Fuck your mother! That's how. Now watch us rape children before we crush this family alive under a tank until you learn how great Russia is. Also, we have nukes.""



World: ""How can you live with yourself?""



Putin: Umm, for one, Russia saved the west 75 years ago. It crushed the Nazis, who came from the west. And where does the west come from? Also the west. Checkmate atheists. (the editor assumes no other countries fought or lost people in WW2, just Russia?)



World: Yeah Russia back then did help a lot against the nazis bu- ...



Putin: Excuse me! And then, the west rewarded Russia with the 90s (editor's note: looks like we're skipping over Stalin and soviet atrocities in multiple countries. Also, why do all the oligarchs have Russian names though?).



World: Now just wait a second, maybe we could have handled the 90s better but...



Putin: Excuse me! I was monologuing! Like I was about to say, everything Russia has done for the west, it has done at Russia's expense (The editor assumes, in their naiveté, that Russia was never paid for any oil, or gas, or food they gave to the west? No? They were paid? Hmm) . Russia is a pure virgin maiden made of generosity and heroism that the west keeps (verbally? Cuz nobody invaded Russia as far as the editor knows?) abusing and belittling.



As I have now conclusively proven, everything Russia has done for the West, it has done at its own expense, by offering the greatest sacrifices. The West eventually rejected all these sacrifices, devalued Russia's contribution to resolving the Western crisis (editor: western crisis? What western...oh wait is it WW2 again? Coulda sworn you already mentioned that), and decided to punish Russia for the help it unselfishly provided. (editor's note: the west seems to love doing things that defy logic apparently.

Як повідомляє інформаційна агенція Reuters, відповідаючи на зауваження конгресмена-республіканця Метта Гетца, що США переоцінили військову силу Росії, Остін відповів: ""Чи спадало вам на думку, що Росія не змогла швидко перемогти Україну завдяки тому, що ми зробили? Та тому, що зробили наші союзники? Чи ви колись про це задумувались?""

Остін виступив у ході слухань у Комітеті Палати представників у справах збройних сил США.

Гетц звинуватив очільників Міноборони США у низці невірних оцінок.

""Ви, люди, казали, що Росія переможе Україну за 36 днів. Ви казали, що Талібан можна буде стримувати протягом місяців. Ви виявились цілком неправими"", - говорив Гетц, закинувши, що освітні установи Міноборони США замало працюють над стратегією і забагато над питанням соціальної справедливості та ін.

Як відзначає інформаційна агенція, Остін та інші посадовці США, заявляють, що підтримка ЗСУ з боку Америки та сильний бойових дух України дозволили зірвати плани Росії щодо швидкої перемоги.

Міністр закордонних справ Росії Лавров раніше заявляв, що озброєння, які постачають Заходом Україні, ""могут розповзтись по всій Європі"".

Остін також повідомив, що Сполучені Штати навчають українських військових поводженню зі зброєю, яку передають.

«Звичайно, вони мають пройти підготовку. І ми це робимо», - сказав він.

Як повідомляє кореспондентка ""Голосу Америки"" Карла Бабб, Остін заявив, що підготовка українських військових відбувається за межами України, включно із територією США. Пентагон, заявив посадовець, не здійснює підготовку українських військових на території України чи Польщі.

And gradually, logic and the horrors of the alternative, will, as now, force the lawyers and leaders running the western response to send more significant weapons



We have now gone from Biden hiding what he was sending in black bags in civilian aircraft to the shotguns becoming Javelins, then Stingers, then medium ranged attack drones , to the mystery laser guided rockets- The ranges have gone up and we now have talk, being led by Boris Johnson, of artillery , NATO calibre ammunition for it, anti-ship missiles to defend Odessa and ex Soviet armour.



The lines between what was supposed to produce WW3 and what could be sent have kept on moving as reality won out. We now have a ridiculous situation where Germany won't send its old infantry vehicles, but is allowing the Czechs to send those they inherited from Germany. Tanks are a yes, as long as they are not western tanks. Russian aircraft can be shot down by heavier Soviet SAMs, but not western ones.



This is partly because Ukraine would need time to retrain on some new western technology - but some items now being supplied seem to not pose a problem there - if reports of artillery, radars, and anti-ship missiles are true,



And the reality is that a supply of more western equipment will have to start at some near future date, as Ukraine can't operate declining numbers of Soviet era gear forever . America has 2000 stored modern tanks, and hundreds of multiple rocket launchers , and unused armoured vehicles. Patriot missiles are being bought by , or sent to every state around the Ukraine and some could end up being provided to defend the western and northern areas. Europe , Australia and the US are all replacing much of their F18 and F16 fleets . At some point some of a next intake of conscripts and some NCOs and officers are going to have to be taken out of country, and taught how to use them.



A continuing war would be a ghastly outcome if Russia could sustain its earlier effort . But its already using people picked up off the street in occupied Donbas in the north, Kherson and Mariupol from video evidence. And its calling in mercenaries, Syrians, Chechens and Libyans to provide its manpower, And reports suggest the 60,000 reservists being called up are from the east and southern fringes of Russia - perhaps because losing western Russians would be politically more dangerous?



Ukraine's problem is if its forces containing the occupied Donbas/Luhansk come under too much pressure , and are surrounded by Russian redeployed units . But if they hold , or can fall back to defend the cities on the Dnieper even better,, it could produce stalemate. Ukraine has had losses, but its far from clear Russia can reconstitute its forces. including battered elite units, to take more territory. Which means that as the missiles run out , the Russians army may end up being sniped at increasingly by special forces, partisans, and more effective artillery and drones.",https://www.avforums.com/threads/russian-invasion-of-ukraine.2386753/page-534

Pas le moins du monde. «Nous avons été impressionnés par les pilotes ukrainiens dès le départ, expliquait-il mi-mars au site américain. Ils n'ont pas beaucoup d'heures de vol, mais ils sont extrêmement doués.»

«À l'été 2011, juste avant que je ne joigne la California Guard, le 144th Fighter Wing volait toujours sur des F-16 et il y a eu une première rencontre à la base de Mirgorod, nommée “Safe Skies 2011”.» Les F-16 américains se sont alors entraînés avec les Su-27 et MiG-29 ukrainiens, mais ce n'était que le début de rencontres et exercices plus intenses.

Top Guns

En 2018, les États-Unis et l'Ukraine joignaient à nouveau leurs forces pour un exercice nommé «Clear Sky 2018», les pilotes de l'ouest venant avec leurs F-15C. «Nous avons simulé beaucoup de Basic Fighter Maneuvers [des dogfights, combats de proximité] entre nos F-15C et leurs MiG-29 ou Su-27, et très honnêtement, on a tout de suite compris que leurs pilotes étaient excellents», se remémore l'Américain.

«Ils sont tactiquement très inventifs, ils connaissent leurs avions, ils savent aussi ce qui leur manque. Je veux dire, ils volent sur de vieux appareils. Nos F-15 ne sont plus tous jeunes, mais ils ont constamment été mis à jour. La manière dont ils pilotaient et manœuvraient leurs avions, en particulier en dogfights, était incroyable.»

Ces premiers contacts, également destinés à familiariser les armées de l'est aux processus de l'OTAN, n'ont rien d'innocent. Jonathan «Jersey» Burd explique qu'il milite depuis le début de la guerre pour que la Pologne transmette à l'Ukraine ses vieux MiG-29 –une idée sur la table depuis le début du conflit, qui pourrait être d'une importance capitale pour les combats à venir mais qui n'a pas encore pu être mise en application.

Surtout, Burd suggère que les États-Unis pourraient commencer dès aujourd'hui à entraîner les pilotes ukrainiens sur des F-16, ainsi qu'à organiser l'ensemble de la chaîne technique et humaine nécessaire pour les faire voler dans une armée de l'air devant profondément s'adapter à ces nouveaux matériels.

Le plan est ambitieux mais pas totalement irréaliste au niveau matériel, et beaucoup militent à la fois pour la solution d'urgence (la transmission des MiG-29 et Su-27 polonais ou slovaques notamment) et pour préparer la suite, sur des avions venus cette fois de l'ouest.
