Echoing concern for the people of Ukraine voiced earlier in the afternoon by McDonald's, Atlanta-based Coca-Cola on Tuesday announced it was curtailing operations in Russia. ""Our hearts are with the people who are enduring unconscionable effects from these tragic events in Ukraine,"" the multinational stated.

""We will continue to monitor and assess the situation as circumstances evolve,"" the statement added.

PepsiCo cited ""the horrific events occurring in Ukraine"" in suspending sales of Pepsi-Cola, 7 Up and other brands in Russia, along with capital investments and advertising in that country, where it's operated for more than 60 years. The company will continue to sell dairy products including milk, as well as baby food and formula, it said.

Starbucks followed suit, saying it was suspending all business activity in Russia, including shipment of its products. ""Our license partner has agreed to immediately pause store operations and will provide support to the nearly 2,000 partners in Russia who depend on Starbucks for their livelihood.""

""We condemn the horrific attacks on Ukraine by Russia,"" stated the coffee chain's CEO, Kevin Johnson.

The companies made their announcements shortly after McDonald's said it would temporarily close its 850 restaurants in Russia. Like Coca-Cola's briefer statement, McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski's open letter to employees stopped short of condemning Russia for its attack.

More than 2 million people have fled Ukraine since Russia's invasion of the country, according to the United Nations.

While a broad range of companies have shut down in Russia as the Ukraine crisis escalates, McDonald's and Coca-Cola were among those continuing to do business there.

Both companies faced boycott campaigns on social media, while McDonald's was among those getting called out by the New York state pension fund, one of the largest investors in the U.S.

On Tuesday, New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli applauded the move by McDonald's and other companies to withdraw from Ukraine.

""Companies doing business in Russia need to seriously consider whether it's worth the risk. As investors, we want assurances that our holdings are not in harm's way. I commend the companies that are taking the right steps and suspending their operations in Russia,"" DiNapoli said in a statement.

More than 200 U.S. and foreign companies have curtailed operations in Russia so far, according to a running tally by Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a management professor at Yale University. He previously had listed McDonald's and Coca-Cola as among the companies remaining in Russia with significant exposure.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coca-cola-pepsico-russia-business-ukraine/

Pepsi has sold it products in Russia for more than six decades, even when the company had to trade its soda concentrate for Stolichnaya vodka and warships. McDonald's opened its first location in the Soviet Union in 1990, just months before it collapsed.

In recent days, Pepsi, Coke, McDonald's and Starbucks have drawn criticism for continuing to operate in Russia while other U.S. companies announced suspensions and paused sales.

Yale Professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld compiled and made public a list of U.S. companies that have withdrawn from Russia following President Vladimir Putin's invasion — and those that hadn't. Until Tuesday afternoon, Coke was among the most recognizable names on the spreadsheet.

""Our hearts are with the people who are enduring unconscionable effects from these tragic events in Ukraine,"" Coke said in a brief statement Tuesday afternoon. ""We will continue to monitor and assess the situation as circumstances evolve.""

Russia represents one of the few regions worldwide where Coke's rival PepsiCo has a larger presence. In a regulatory filing, Coke said its business in Ukraine and Russia contributed about 1% to 2% of its consolidated net operating revenue and operating income in 2021.

Pepsi, on the other hand, generates roughly 4% of its annual revenue in Russia, though it is not halting all business in the country. The company said it will keep selling some essential products, like baby formula, milk and baby food.

It said it will suspend Russian sales of its Pepsi-Cola, 7UP and Mirinda brands, along with capital investments and all advertising and promotional activities.

""As a food and beverage company, now more than ever we must stay true to the humanitarian aspect of our business,"" Pepsi CEO Ramon Laguarta wrote in a memo to employees viewed by CNBC.

The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on Tuesday that Pepsi was weighing different options for its Russian business, including writing off its value. Economic sanctions have greatly complicated the process of offloading Russian assets.",https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/08/coca-cola-follows-mcdonalds-starbucks-in-suspending-business-in-russia.html

McDonald's, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Starbucks are the latest American corporate titans to join the corporate exodus from Russia in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine.

In a letter to its partners on Tuesday, Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson announced that the coffee giant would suspend all business in Russia. Johnson said the store's licensed partner has agreed to pause operations at its 130 stores there.

And Coca-Cola announced that it is suspending its business in Russia. ""Our hearts are with the people who are enduring unconscionable effects from these tragic events in Ukraine,"" the soft drink giant said in a brief statement.

PepsiCo, which has been operating in Russia for more than 60 years, said that, ""given the horrific events occurring in Ukraine,"" it was suspending sales of Pepsi-Cola and its other global beverage brands there. It will also suspend capital investments and advertising in Russia. The company said it will continue to sell milk, baby formula and baby food in the country.

Meanwhile, McDonald's is temporarily closing its 850 locations in Russia, in one of the most symbolic exits by a global corporation from the country in protest over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

In an email to employees and franchisees on Tuesday, McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski said the fast-food chain will pause all operations in Russia. He said the company will continue paying salaries to 62,000 people it employs there.

""Our values mean we cannot ignore the needless human suffering unfolding in Ukraine,"" Kempczinski said. ""At this juncture, it's impossible to predict when we might be able to reopen our restaurants in Russia.""

Hundreds of companies have announced their exits from Russia in recent days. Among the most recent additions to the list are cosmetics company L'Oreal and car maker Ferrari. Russian users are also losing access to Netflix, Ikea stores and Apple products. Visa and Mastercard have restricted use by Russian holders.

Earlier Tuesday, Yum Brands, which runs KFC and Pizza Hut locations in Russia, paused investment in the country. Universal Music group, the world's largest record label, announced the closure of its Russian office and suspension of operations in the country. And on Monday, giant conglomerate Procter & Gamble cut back on its products and advertising in Russia.

A Yale professor tracks which companies are still doing business in Russia

As many companies continue to pull out of Russia, a Yale professor is tracking which companies have not curtailed operations in the country. Among them was McDonald's, which opened its first location in the Soviet Union in 1990 as a harbinger of the arrival of Western consumer culture.

Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies, tells NPR that the list — which contains more than 200 companies — is a way to encourage corporations ""to do the right thing"" and to hold them accountable for continuing to engage with Russia.

Publishing the list allows companies to see that others are taking action amid the conflict; it's affirming, he said, and something that can make other companies feel better about the decision. That's what Sonnenfeld called the ""carrot.""

""The stick side is the public shaming of being on a category where they don't want to be,"" he said.

Sonnenfeld and his team have been tracking company withdrawals since the outbreak of war, he said. Companies such as Dell, Apple, Nike, General Motors, IBM and H&M were among the first to curtail operations in Russia, he said.

Some companies released ambiguous statements, which drove Sonnenfeld and his team to catalog the companies.

""We're shocked about what a catalytic effect an objective list has had in terms of either catalyzing some to move or clarifying positions,"" Sonnenfeld said. ""We're very close to 300 now that have curtailed operations.""",https://www.npr.org/2022/03/08/1085179372/mcdonalds-russia-companies-ukraine

DETROIT (AP) — McDonald’s, Starbucks, Coca-Cola and General Electric – ubiquitous global brands and symbols of U.S. corporate might – all announced Tuesday they were temporarily suspending their business in Russia in response to the country’s invasion of Ukraine.

“Our values mean we cannot ignore the needless human suffering unfolding in Ukraine,” McDonald’s President and CEO Chris Kempczinski said in an open letter to employees.

The Chicago-based burger giant said it will temporarily close 850 stores but continue paying its 62,000 employees in Russia “who have poured their heart and soul into our McDonald’s brand.”

Kempczinski said it’s impossible to know when the company will be able to reopen its stores.

“The situation is extraordinarily challenging for a global brand like ours, and there are many considerations,” Kempczinski wrote in the letter. McDonald’s works with hundreds of Russian suppliers, for example, and serves millions of customers each day.

Last Friday, Starbucks had said that it was donating profits from its 130 Russian stores – owned and operated by Kuwait-based franchisee Alshaya Group – to humanitarian relief efforts in Ukraine.

But on Tuesday, the company changed course and said it would temporarily close those stores. Alshaya Group will continue to pay Starbucks’ 2,000 Russian employees, Starbucks President and CEO Kevin Johnson said in an open letter to employees.

“Through this dynamic situation, we will continue to make decisions that are true to our mission and values and communicate with transparency,” Johnson wrote.

Coca-Cola Co. announced it was suspending its business in Russia, but it offered few details. Coke’s partner, Switzerland-based Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Co., owns 10 bottling plants in Russia, which is its largest market. Coke has a 21% stake in Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Co.

General Electric also said in a Twitter post that it was suspending its operations in Russia. GE said two exceptions would be essential medical equipment and support for existing power services in Russia.

McDonald’s is likely to take the biggest financial hit. Unlike Starbucks and other fast food companies, like KFC and Pizza Hut, whose Russian locations are owned by franchisees, McDonald’s owns 84% of its Russian stores. McDonald’s has also temporarily closed 108 restaurants that it owns in Ukraine and continues to pay those employees.

In a recent regulatory filing, McDonald’s said its restaurants in Russia and Ukraine contribute 9% of its annual revenue, or around $2 billion last year.

Yum Brands, the parent company of KFC and Pizza Hut, said Monday that it is donating all of the profits from its 1,050 restaurants in Russia to humanitarian efforts. It has also suspended new restaurant development in the country. Burger King said it is redirecting the profits from its 800 Russian stores to relief efforts and donating $2 million in food vouchers to Ukrainian refugees.

McDonald’s said Tuesday it has donated more than $5 million to its employee assistance fund and to relief efforts. It has also parked a Ronald McDonald House Charities mobile medical care unit at the Polish border with Ukraine; another mobile care unit is en route to the border in Latvia, the company said.

When McDonald’s opened its first store in Moscow, in Jan. 31, 1990, it was hailed as a sign of the thawing Cold War. Thousands of Russians lined up before dawn to try hamburgers – many for the first time. By the end of the day, 30,000 meals had been rung up on 27 cash registers, an opening-day record for the company.

But since the Ukraine invasion last month, many corporations have ceased operations in Russia in protest. Among them is consumer goods conglomerate Unilever, which on Tuesday said it has suspended all imports and exports of its products into and out of Russia, and that it will not invest any further capital into the country. In a more limited move, Amazon said Tuesday the company’s cloud computing network, Amazon Web Services, will stop allowing new sign-ups in Russia and Belarus.

Pressure had been mounting on companies that remained in the country. Hashtags to boycott companies like McDonald’s, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo quickly emerged on social media.

Last week, New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli – a trustee of the state’s pension fund, which is a McDonald’s investor – sent a letter to McDonald’s and nine other companies urging them to consider pausing their operations in Russia.

In a statement Tuesday, DiNapoli commended McDonald’s for its action.

“As one of the largest domestic corporations doing business in Russia, McDonald’s suspension of operations there should send a strong message to other companies,” DiNapoli said. “Russia’s attack on Ukraine, its violent imperialism, threatens the global economy and makes doing business there extraordinarily risky if not untenable.”

In his letter, Kempczinski cited influential former McDonald’s Chairman and CEO Fred Turner, whose mantra was, “Do the right thing.”

“There are countless examples over the years of McDonald’s Corp. living up to Fred’s simple ideal. Today is one of those days,” Kempczinski said.",https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2022/03/08/mcdonalds-restaurants-russia-closings-ukraine-war/9426914002/

Companies from Apple to Visa have already announced curtailed or suspended operations in Russia since the attack began last month.

Several major American food and beverage companies announced Tuesday that they would suspend their operations in Russia, a step that comes after days of mounting public pressure on the corporate world to sever ties with the country over the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The group included McDonald’s, Starbucks, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, some of which had operated in Russia for decades and had faced heightened scrutiny in recent days as other companies elected to halt their business dealings there. A veritable naughty-or-nice list, compiled by a Yale University professor, generated headlines by highlighting the companies maintaining normal operations.

McDonald’s chief executive Chris Kempczinski said the global fast food chain would temporarily close its 850 restaurants in the country.

“Our values mean we cannot ignore the needless human suffering unfolding in Ukraine,” he said.

The company said it will continue paying its 62,000 Russian employees while stores are closed.

The decision is a notable shift for a company that has usually shied away from inserting itself into polarizing topics, industry experts say, signifying changes in global culture where corporations are no longer choosing to be neutral on social issues but responsive and declarative about their stances.

Shortly after the McDonald’s announcement, Starbucks, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo announced they would pause services in Russia.

Starbucks’s licensed partner, the Kuwait-based Alshaya Group, which owns and operates 130 stores in Russia, will temporarily shutter locations and “provide support” to its roughly 2,000 local employees, Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson said in an open letter. The company will also halt all shipments of Starbucks products to the country.

“The invasion and humanitarian impact of this war are devastating and create a ripple effect that is felt throughout the world,” Johnson wrote in a letter last week, as more people demanded that companies take a stance.

Coca-Cola, in a brief statement Tuesday, made a similar announcement and suspended its business in Russia.

And PepsiCo, which has operated in Russia for more than six decades, halted its soda sales, including its eponymous cola and 7UP. But the company said it would continue to manufacture milk, baby formula and baby food, allowing it to keep tens of thousands of workers employed.

“Pepsi-Cola entered the market at the height of the Cold War and helped create common ground between the United States and the Soviet Union,” the company’s chief executive, Ramon Laguarta, wrote in an email to employees.

But after days of remaining in full operation, the company decided to partially pull out “given the horrific events occurring in Ukraine,” Laguarta said.

McDonald’s is in a unique category among businesses that have announced halts and freezes in service or products in Russia. Fast-food brands have largely continued operating because many of their restaurants are owned by franchisees, and corporate brands have limited abilities to control operations at local facilities.

McDonald’s owns more than 80 percent of its Russian locations compared with roughly 5 percent of restaurants that are owned in the United States.

The stores that are company-owned are mainly for testing products and other corporate goals, according to John A. Gordon, an independent restaurant chain expert and founder of Pacific Management Consulting Group.

Gordon said the company owns a lot more stores in Europe because the sales and profits are higher. The closing down of its stores in Russia combined with the decision to continue paying employees will come with a significant financial hit but not one that will bankrupt the company or cause markets to react in a volatile manner.

“We don’t know how long ‘temporarily’ means in terms of closures, but McDonald’s will report an operating loss,” he said. “What will happen now is the Wall Street security analysts will actually lower their earning forecast because of the Russia and Ukraine effect. McDonald’s stock price won’t be arbitrarily affected.”

McDonald’s announcement is also a sign that companies are moving away from antiquated business mentalities that center shareholder interests above all others, Gordon said.

“It’s really about the stakeholders, which is greater world of nations and people,” he said.

Other companies, such as Yum Brands, which owns Pizza Hut and KFC, might find it more difficult to replicate McDonald’s stance as many of the locations are owned by franchisees, who are likely Russians themselves, making it a bit more challenging to just close shop, Gordon said, who counts Yum Brands among his clients.

Yum Brands announced on Tuesday that it is suspending operations of KFC company-owned restaurants in Russia and finalizing an agreement to suspend all Pizza Hut restaurant operations in the country, in partnership with its master franchisee.

“This action builds on our decision to suspend all investment and restaurant development in Russia and redirect all profits from operations in Russia to humanitarian efforts,” the company said in a statement.

Yet McDonald’s expressing global solidarity with Ukraine is among the most bold and decisive moves taken by a restaurant chain of its magnitude, said Aaron Allen, a restaurant analyst and founder of Aaron Allen & Associates.

“This will absolutely be a watershed moment and will reflect a precedent, not just for war but for other causes or means of showing solidarity,” he said. “You’re pretty much closing off your revenue to make a statement. Agreeing to put purpose over profits is an indication that world’s largest restaurant chain taking a leadership stand.”
