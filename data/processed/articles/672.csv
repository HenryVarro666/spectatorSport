Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke to the United States Congress on Wednesday, thanking its members for the support the US has offered his country and asking for more.

The Ukrainian leader called on US President Joe Biden to be a leader for peace. He repeated calls for a no-fly zone over Ukraine, but failing that asked for more defence systems. He also called for continued and widening sanctions to include any Russian politician supporting the invasion of Ukraine, for the US to close ports to Russian goods, and US businesses to leave Russia.

Here is what Zelenskyy said, via a translator:

“Good morning. Good morning, Mr President. Good morning, Madam Ambassador, who was with us this morning, Madam Ambassador.

Glory to heroes. Thank you very much, Madam Speaker, members of Congress, ladies and gentlemen. Americans, friends, I’m proud to greet you from Ukraine, from our capital city of Kyiv – a city that is under missiles and air strikes from Russian troops, every day. But it doesn’t give up and we have not even thought about it for a second, just like many other cities and communities in our beautiful country, which found themselves in the worst war since World War II.

I have the honour to greet you on behalf of the Ukrainian people, great and freedom-loving people who for eight years have been resisting the Russian aggression, those who give their best sons and daughters to stop this full-scale Russian invasion.

Right now, the destiny of our country is being decided, the destiny of our people, whether Ukrainians will be free, whether they will be able to preserve their democracy.

Russia has attacked not just us, not just our land, not just our cities. It went on a brutal offensive against our values, basic human values. It threw tanks and planes against our freedom, against our right to live freely in our own country, choosing our own future. Against our desire for happiness, against our national dreams, just like the same dreams you have, you Americans – just like anyone else in the United States.

I remember your national memorial in [Mount] Rushmore, the faces of your prominent presidents, those who laid the foundation of the United States of America as it is today: democracy independence, freedom, and care for everyone, for every person, for everyone who works diligently, who lives honestly, who respects the law. We in Ukraine want the same for our people, all that is [a] normal part of your own life.

Ladies and gentlemen, friends, Americans, in your great history, you have pages that allow you to understand the Ukrainians. Understand us now, when we need it. We need you right now.

Remember Pearl Harbor – the terrible morning December 7, 1941 when your sky was black from the planes attacking you. Just remember it. Remember September the 11th, a terrible day in 2001 when evil tried to turn your cities, independent territories, into battlefields. When innocent people were attacked. Attacked from the air. Yes. Just like nobody else expected it, you could not stop it. Our country experienced the same every day. Right now, at this moment, every night for three weeks now.

There is Ukrainian cities Odesa and Kharkiv … and Kyiv, Mariupol … Russia has turned the Ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people.

Russian troops have already fired nearly one thousand missiles at Ukraine. Countless bombs. They use drones to kill us with precision.

This is a terror that Europe has not seen, has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for a reply, for an answer to this terror from the whole world. Is this a lot to ask for? To create a no-fly zone over Ukraine to save people? Is this too much to ask?

Humanitarian no-fly zone is something that … Russia would not be able to terrorise our cities.

If this is too much to ask, we offer an alternative. You know what kind of defence systems we need; S-300 and other similar systems. You know how much depends on the battlefield on the ability to use aircraft, powerful, strong aviation to protect our people, our freedom, our land. Aircraft that can help Ukraine, help Europe. And you know that they exist and you have them, but they are on Earth, not in the Ukrainian sky. They do not defend our people.

‘I have a dream’. These words are known to each of you today. I can say I have a need, a need to protect our sky. I need your decision, your help, which means exactly the same, the same you feel when you hear the words, ‘I have a dream’.

Ladies and gentlemen, friends, Ukraine is grateful to the United States for its overwhelming support, for everything that your government and your people have done for us, for weapons and ammunition, for training, for finances, for leadership in the free world which helps us to pressure the aggressor economically.

I’m grateful to President Biden for his personal involvement, for his sincere commitment to the defence of Ukraine and democracy all over the world. I am grateful to you for the resolution which recognises all those who commit crimes against Ukraine, against the Ukrainian people as war criminals.

However, now, it is true, in the darkest time for our country, for the whole of Europe, I call on you to do more.

New packages of sanctions are needed, constant, every week, until the Russian military machine stops. Restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based.

We propose that the United States sanction all politicians in the Russian Federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for their aggression against Ukraine. From state Duma members, to the last official who has a lack of morale to break this state terror.

All Americans’ companies must leave Russia from their market, leave their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood.

Ladies and gentlemen, members of Congress, please take the lead if you have companies in your district who finance [the] Russian military machine, leaving business in Russia. You should put pressure.

I am asking to make sure that the Russians do not receive a single penny, that they use to destroy our people in Ukraine, the destruction of our country, the destruction of Europe. All American ports should be closed for Russian goods. Peace is more important than income. And we have to defend this principle in the whole world.

We already became part of the anti-war coalition, the big anti-war coalition that unites many countries, dozens of countries, those who reacted to, in principle to President Putin’s decision to invade our country. But we need to move on and do more.

We need to create new tools to respond quickly and stop the war, the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, which began on February 24. And it would be fair if it ended in a day, in 24 hours, that evil would be punished immediately.

Today, the world does not have such tools. That war of the past has prompted our predecessors to create institutions that should protect us from war. But they unfortunately don’t work. We see it. You see it. So, we need new ones, new institutions, new alliances, and we offer them.

We propose to create an association, U24, united for peace, a union of responsible countries that have the strength and consciousness to stop conflict immediately, to provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours. If necessary, even weapons. If necessary, sanctions, humanitarian support, political support, finances – everything you need to keep the peace and quickly save the world, to save lives.

In addition, such an association, such a union could provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters, man-made disasters, who fell victims to humanitarian crisis or epidemic. Remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things? Just a few vaccines, vaccines against COVID to save lives, to prevent new strains. The world spent months, years doing things like that much faster, to make sure there are no human losses, no victims.

Ladies and gentlemen, Americans, if such an alliance would exist today … we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country, in many countries around the world, those who need peace, those who suffer inhumane destruction.

I ask you to watch one video, video what of the Russian troops did in our country, in our land. We have to stop it. We must prevent it. Preventively destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations. Please watch the video.

[Plays graphic video showing bombed buildings and bodies of civilians.]

Zelenskyy speaking in English:

“And in the end, to sum it up: Today, today, it is not enough to be the leader [of] the nation. Today [it] takes to be the leader of the world. Being the leader of the world means being the leader of peace.

Peace in your country doesn’t depend anymore only on you and your people. It depends on those next to you, on those who are strong. Strong doesn’t mean big. Strong is brave and ready to fight for the life of his citizens, and citizens of the world, for human rights, for freedom, for the right to live peacefully and to die when your time comes, and not when it’s wanted by someone else, by your neighbour.

Today, the Ukrainian people are defending not only Ukraine, we are fighting for the values of Europe, and the world, sacrificing our lives in the name of the future. That’s why today, the American people are helping not just Ukraine, but Europe, and the world to keep the planet alive. To keep justice in history.

Now, I’m almost 45 years old. Today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating. I see no sense in life, if it cannot stop the deaths. And this is my main issue as the leader of my people, brave Ukrainians. And as the leader of my nation, I’m addressing to President Biden: You are the leader of the nation, of your great nation. I wish you to be the leader of the world. Being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace. Thank you. Glory to Ukraine.”

[Applause by US members of Congress]",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/16/what-zelenskyy-said-to-the-us-congress
2,9786415f-0987-49da-ad24-334a5df4160c,[],,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy Addresses US Congress

By Sammi Bradley, Digital Communications Coordinator, Optica

On 16 March, 2022, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy virtually addressed the United States Congress from Kyiv.

Zelenskyy initiated the address by citing 8 years of aggression against the modern state of Ukraine by the Government of the Russian Federation: Referring to the Russian Annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the related violent conflict between Ukraine and Russia preluding the full invasion on 24 February, 2022.

Zelenskyy called for the U.S. to impose a no-fly zone above Ukraine, invoking details of the 07 December, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor and the 11 September, 2001 attack on New York as instances of violence against the U.S. committed via the sky; He stated that these past attacks against the U.S. now transpire daily in Ukraine.

Furthermore, he requested, without a no-fly zone, for the U.S. to deliver lethal aid through aircraft and anti-aircraft weapons.

Should a no-fly zone fail to be established, Zelenskyy then called for new packages of regularly-updated sanctions against Russia until the invasion ends. Sanctions include:

Closing American ports to Russian goods

Cutting ties with Russian politicians that do not condemn the war

Requiring American companies to leave the Russian market

He specified the Russian market as “flooded with [Ukrainian] blood,” and that “Peace is more important than income,” with regards to commerce related to Russia.

Zelenskyy followed his speech with a video displaying the graphic violence occurring in Ukrainian cities, showing air strikes, detonations, injured and deceased elderly and children and various other scenes of atrocities committed against Ukraine’s civilians that violate international law.

Finally, Zelenskyy ended the address-transitioning his language from Ukrainian to English-with a call for the Biden Administration and American people to follow the value of peace as the U.S. moves forward with its response to the conflict. Zelenskyy implored Congress and those watching to consider the invasion not as a matter of alliances and politics but as a moral crisis.

Optica, in response to the ongoing crisis, has updated and expanded upon its original statement condemning the violence committed against the people of Ukraine.

The full address has been transcribed and annotated by CNN, and can be found here.

Ukraine’s military says it hit Kherson airport LVIV, Ukraine — Ukrainian military forces have dealt a punishing blow to the airport in Kherson, which Russian troops had seized early in the war, the General Staff said late Wednesday. It said the Russians were trying to remove any surviving military equipment. Ukraine’s military said it hit the airport on Tuesday. Satellite photos taken afterward by Planet Labs PBC and analyzed by The Associated Press show helicopters and vehicles on fire at the air base. Russia seized the southern port city without a fight in the first days of the war. Control over Kherson allows Russia to restore fresh water supplies to Crimea; Ukraine cut off the water after Russia annexed the peninsula in 2014. The General Staff said Russia’s ground offensive on major Ukrainian cities has largely stalled. Share this -

On Wednesday, the Ukrainian president said Russian forces attempted to coerce Fedorov to cooperate but ""our guy is our guy, so he withstood, did not give up."" Zelenskyy added in his video address that 6,000 Mariupol residents were evacuated Wednesday, more than 2,000 of them children. He reiterated that a death toll remains unknown after a theater where hundreds of civilians had sought refuge was bombed during a Russian airstrike. Share this -







UNICEF: 55 children flee Ukraine every minute Every minute, an average of 55 children flee Ukraine, UNICEF spokesperson James Elder said Wednesday in Geneva. Put another way, a Ukrainian child has become a refugee almost every second since Russian forces invaded on Feb. 24. ""Like all children driven from their homes by war and conflict, Ukrainian children arriving in neighboring countries are at significant risk of family separation, violence, sexual exploitation and trafficking,"" Elder said. ""They are in desperate need of safety, stability and child protection services, especially those who are unaccompanied or have been separated from their families."" 1.5 million children flee war in Ukraine as refugees arrive in more of Europe March 15, 2022 01:43 More than 1.5 million children have evacuated Ukraine in the three weeks since the war began, roughly half of all refugees scattered through the region. UNICEF said it has mobilized additional teams to help with protective and mental health services for children who remain in the embattled country. ""The safest and fastest way out of this catastrophe — indeed, the only way out of this catastrophe — is for this war to end, and to end now,"" Elder said. ""We must be clear: Despite tireless efforts from volunteer grandmothers to governments, scouts to U.N. agencies, so long as this war continues, the situation for Ukraine’s children will only get worse.""

U.S. seeing increased Russian naval activity near Odesa, defense official says The U.S. is seeing increased Russian naval activity in the area around the Ukrainian port city of Odesa, a senior U.S. defense official said Wednesday. The naval force in the northern Black Sea around Odesa includes Russian LSTs — landing ships and surface combatant ships, the official said, adding that Russian ships have been shelling some cities outside Odesa. It’s not clear if the movements are a precursor to a larger amphibious assault, the official continued, characterizing the activity as ""a change to maritime environment."" Citizens in the city, one of the largest in Ukraine, have been girding for an assault by Russian forces, including by filling and moving over 400,000 sandbags, sometimes while breaking out in song. Odesa is home to the country's National Academic Opera and Ballet Theater, and despite the threat of a Russian attack, its orchestra performed an open-air concert on Saturday to support Zelenskyy's call for a no-fly zone over Ukraine.

Kremlin calls Biden's comments 'unacceptable and unforgivable' President Joe Biden's characterization of Russian President Vladimir Putin as a ""war criminal"" was ""unacceptable and unforgivable,"" a spokesman for the Kremlin said Wednesday. ""We consider unacceptable and unforgivable such rhetoric of the head of the state, whose bombs killed hundreds of thousands of people around the world,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. In a brief exchange with reporters earlier Wednesday, Biden was asked whether he believes Putin is a war criminal. He answered no and then asked the reporter to repeat the question.

Biden on Putin: 'I think he is a war criminal' President Joe Biden on Wednesday called Russian President Vladimir Putin a ""war criminal"" for the first time. In a brief exchange with reporters, Biden was asked whether he believes Putin is a war criminal amid the crisis in Ukraine. Biden initially said no and then asked the reporter to repeat the question. ""I think he is a war criminal,"" Biden said in response. The Biden administration has been deliberating the potential ramifications of war crimes investigations of Russia and what role the U.S. should play in those international efforts, NBC News has reported. Among the questions is whether indicting Putin could close the door on diplomacy or prompt him to resort to more drastic measures.

New Zelenskyy video suggests kidnapped Melitopol mayor has been rescued In a video uploaded to Telegram on Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appears to speak with Ivan Fyodorov, the Melitopol mayor who was kidnapped by Russian soldiers nearly a week ago — suggesting the mayor has been released. In the video, Zelenskyy appears to congratulate Fyodorov on his rescue and reassures him that Ukraine does not leave its people behind. In what seemed to be a tongue-in-cheek exchange, the mayor then says he needs a day or two before he returns to work. In response, Zelenskyy says he cannot promise two days but encourages the mayor to rest. The video was posted by the deputy head of Zelenskyy's office. The deputy head of the president's office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, said in a separate post that the rescue was a special operation. Share this -







Biden announces $800M in new defense assistance for Ukraine, including anti-aircraft systems President Joe Biden announced Wednesday that he is authorizing $800 million in U.S. assistance to Ukraine, bringing the total of announced new security aid for the country to $1 billion just this week. ""These are direct transfers of equipment from our Department of Defense to the Ukrainian military, to help them as they fight against this invasion,"" Biden said in remarks from the White House, flanked by top officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley. Biden said the new package includes: 800 anti-aircraft systems

Additional longer-range anti-aircraft systems and their munitions

9,000 anti-armor systems, which he said are ""portable high-accuracy shoulder mounted missiles""

7,000 small arms, including machine guns, shotguns and grenade launchers

20 million rounds of ammunition, artillery and mortars for small arms

Drones ""The United States and our allies and partners are fully committed to surge the weapons of assistance to the Ukrainians, and more will be coming as we source additional stocks of equipment,"" Biden said, adding bluntly: ""Now, I want to be honest. This could be a long and difficult battle. But the American people will be steadfast in our support of the people of Ukraine in the face of Putin's immoral, unethical attacks on civilian populations."" Biden said the U.S. has provided $300 million in humanitarian assistance in the last few weeks to people in Ukraine and in neighboring countries where Ukrainians are finding refuge. This assistance has included food, medicine and basic supplies, he said. When the invasion began in late February, Biden said, the U.S. rushed $350 million in additional aid, including anti-tank weapons, transport helicopters, armed patrol boats, unmanned drones, secure communications equipment, tactical gear, other high-mobility vehicles and radar systems that help track incoming artillery. He also said the administration started sending assistance to Ukraine a year ago. ""We took the threat of Putin invading very seriously. We acted on it. We sent Ukraine more security systems last year — $650 million in weapons, including anti-air and anti-armor equipment — before the invasion, more than we had ever provided before.""

GOP senators praise Zelenskyy, demand that Biden step up U.S. response A group of Republican senators Wednesday praised Zelenskyy's address to Congress and demanded that the Biden administration send more weapons to Ukraine like the Soviet-era MiG fighter jets.

Portman said the U.S. needs to be more creative in helping Ukraine — and quickly — such as by providing anti-aircraft systems, drones and everything else it can to protect the country as it faces constant bombardment by Russia. ""If it shoots, we should ship it,"" Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., said, including drones and Javelin and Stinger missiles. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said she will be leading a congressional delegation trip of nine colleagues to Poland. She didn't say when the trip will take place.

International Court of Justice: Russia must suspend military operations in Ukraine immediately The International Court of Justice, the world's highest court, ordered Russia on Wednesday to immediately halt military operations in Ukraine, a preliminary decision in response to allegations of genocide brought by Ukraine. ""The Russian Federation shall immediately suspend the military operations that it commenced on Feb 24, 2022 on the territory of Ukraine,"" the 13-2 ruling read. A second order, which also received a 13-2 vote, said Russia ""shall ensure that any military or irregular armed units which may be directed or supported by it, as well as any organizations and persons which may be subject to its control or direction, take no steps in furtherance of the military operations."" The two votes against the measures were those of the court's vice president, Kirill Gevorgian of Russia, and Chinese jurist Xue Hanqin. The U.N. body also unanimously voted that both parties should ""refrain from any action which might aggravate or extend the dispute before the court or make it more difficult to resolve.""

Ukrainians fleeing Russian invasion mourn what was left behind MEDYKA, Poland — Parents, spouses, children, grandchildren, sweethearts, friends, careers and homes: That’s just a short list of all that was left behind by so many fleeing war in their homeland. The immensity of what remains in Ukraine contrasts starkly with the meager possessions these sudden refugees were able to bring with them. All that they own now is crammed into shopping bags and wheeled suitcases that squeak and rattle as they cross into this small red-brick village surrounded by fields. With shock, grief and relief hanging in the bright, cold air, Alexander Federov greets the new arrivals in Poland with a broad smile and some hearty Ukrainian warmth: “Vse bude dobre” — “Everything will be fine.” About 3 million Ukrainians have fled since Russia invaded their country — the majority to neighboring Poland — in the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II. Thousands of them have crossed through Medyka. Read the full story here. Share this -







Ukraine news website hacked, used to post Zelenskyy deepfake The website of a Ukrainian news outlet was hacked Wednesday and used to push a fake video in which someone who appears to be Zelenskyy tells citizens to surrender to Russia, one of the most high-profile uses of ""deepfake"" technology to date. The live TV broadcast from the media outlet, Ukraine 24, also showed a chyron that repeated what the fake Zelenskyy video said. Disinformation experts have long warned that deepfakes, computer-generated videos of a real person saying or doing things they didn't actually say or do, could be used for malicious political purposes, and Ukrainian government officials have warned for weeks that Russia may try to convince people of false news of surrender. The simulation was of low quality, with the fake Zelenskyy's mouth moving unnaturally, his head appearing somewhat detached from his body. Last week, Ukraine provincial government websites were hacked to make similar claims, leading national government officials to rush to debunk it. Channel 24's website was down as of midday Wednesday, but its Telegram channel warned about the hack and said that the message of surrender was fake. Share this -







Putin claims, without evidence, Ukraine has nuclear weapons and biological weapons programs Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed without evidence Wednesday that Ukraine has its own nuclear weapons and biological weapons programs. ""Kyiv government announced their own nuclear weapons and the means to transport it. It was a real threat.

""And Russia would, of course, be the target."" Putin also claimed that Ukraine has laboratories where it conducts experiments with ""coronavirus, anthrax, cholera, African swine fever and other lethal diseases,"" adding: ""They are trying to cover the traces of these programs. In essence, they were creating biological weapons in close proximity to Russian borders."" He also accused Ukraine of planning to attack Donbas and Crimea in an ""ethnic cleansing."" Putin suggested he was forced to authorize the invasion because Russia was ""left with no choice for peaceful resolution of problems that we are not to blame for."" U.S. officials have been warning that Russia could implement a false flag operation in which its military would launch a chemical or biological weapons attack in Ukraine. Share this -

Biden to commit new military aid to Ukraine following Zelenskyy speech Biden is expected to detail an additional $800 million in military support Wednesday after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pleaded with Congress to do more to help Ukraine defend itself against the military onslaught from Russia. Biden is expected to outline in more detail the types of security assistance the U.S. is providing, including anti-armor and air defense systems, a White House official said ahead of the remarks. The added assistance brings the total authorized by Biden to $2 billion since the start of his presidency. But Biden wasn't expected to announce any of the actions that Zelenskyy asked for in his remarks to Congress earlier Wednesday, including a no-fly zone over Ukraine to deter Russian bombers that have hit hospitals, schools and residential buildings, as well as fighter jets — two measures the U.S. has repeatedly rejected.

Ukraine says it has joined its energy networks to the European Union Ukraine has unified its energy network with that of the European Union, Zelenskyy said in a tweet Wednesday, in a move designed to show its independence and autonomy from Russia. Moldova, which neighbors Ukraine and has raised fears about Putin's aggression, also made the switch, he said.

Spam campaigns look to capitalize on Ukraine donations Online scammers are trying to capitalize on the Ukraine crisis by sending a massive amount of email spam, researchers say. Many appear to try to take advantage of the fact that the Ukrainian government has taken the novel and successful step of soliciting cryptocurrency donations from the public. That's led to scammers flooding email addresses with their own crypto addresses, falsely claiming to be the Ukrainian government or working for Ukrainian refugees, according to Andrew Brandt, principal researcher at the cybersecurity company Sophos. Despite the dramatic spike in such emails, they may not be working. None of the scammers' cryptocurrency addresses that Sophos has monitored have received any funds, Brandt said. Share this -

Council of Europe expels Russia from human rights body BRUSSELS — The Council of Europe on Wednesday expelled Russia from the continent’s foremost human rights body in an unprecedented move over its invasion and war in Ukraine. The 47-nation organization’s committee of ministers said in statement that “the Russian Federation ceases to be a member of the Council of Europe as from today, after 26 years of membership.” The decision comes on the heels of weeks of condemnation of Russia’s actions in Ukraine. Early in the week, the group’s parliamentary assembly already initiated the process of expulsion and unanimously backed that Russia would be kicked out. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov insisted Wednesday that it would have left the body regardless. In an interview with Russian broadcaster RBK, he accused NATO and EU countries of “abusing their majority in the council, eventually transforming it into a tool for anti-Russian policy.

War could contribute to biggest oil supply crisis in decades, International Energy Agency warns The International Energy Agency has cut its 2022 forecast for global oil demand amid the disruption to Russian oil production which threatens a “global oil supply shock.” “The implications of a potential loss of Russian oil exports to global markets cannot be understated,” it said in a monthly report released Wednesday. “Faced with what could turn into the biggest supply crisis in decades, global energy markets are at a crossroads,” it said. As the world’s largest oil exporter, Russia continues to send oil due to deals made before the invasion, but new business has “all but dried up,” it said. According to the report, after the exports are shunned, only the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia hold the spare capacity to offset the Russian shortfall. “Indeed, today’s alignment of energy security and economic factors could well accelerate the transition away from oil,” the agency said.

Ukrainian presidential adviser rejects Russia's 'compromise' of NATO neutrality An adviser to Ukraine's president has rejected the idea of taking a neutral stance similar to Sweden or Austria — after Russia said this was a possible compromise that could lead to an end to hostilities. ""The Russian Federation believes that the Swedish version of a neutral state in Ukraine can be seen as a compromise,"" Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov said during a regular press briefing Wednesday. Both Austria and Sweden are outside the NATO alliance but act as partner nations. The adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said on Telegram on Wednesday he understood why the neutrality point was being raised, but added: ""Ukraine is now in a state of direct war with the Russian Federation. Therefore, the model can only be Ukrainian and only about legally verified security guarantees. And no other models or options."" He said Ukraine needed a security deal that would ensure foreign support in the event of an attack, without the need for any ""bureaucratic procedures"" to enforce a no-fly zone. Share this -







9 in 10 Ukrainians could face poverty as a result of war, U.N. agency says Almost 90 percent of Ukraine’s population could face poverty and extreme economic vulnerability if the war drags on for a year, wiping out two decades of development, according to a projection from the United Nations Development Program. “An alarming economic decline, and the suffering and hardship it will bring to an already traumatized population must now come into sharper focus,” UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner said Wednesday. Half of Ukraine's businesses are shut completely while the remaining operate below capacity, he said. The UNDP estimates that emergency cash of approximately $250 million per month would cover “partial income losses” for the 2.6 million people expected to fall below poverty. Share this -

Zelensky's virtual address came a day after he made a plea to Canada's parliament for more Western sanctions on Russia and the imposition of a no-fly zone over Ukraine amid a conflict that began with Russia's Feb. 24 invasion.

Biden on Tuesday signed into law $13.6 billion in emergency aid to Ukraine to help it obtain more weaponry and for humanitarian assistance.

Biden was expected to announce an additional $800 million in security assistance to Ukraine later on Wednesday in remarks on U.S. aid to the country, a White House official said

""Americans, friends, we need you right now. Our country, right now at this moment every night for three weeks now various Ukrainian cities. Russia has turned the Ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people.""

""Russian troops have already nearly 1,000 missiles at Ukraine, countless bombs, they use drones to kill us with precision, this is a terror that Europe has not seen for years. We're asking for an answer to this from the whole world, is this a lot to ask for to create a no-fly zone over Ukraine? Is this too much to ask? If this is too much to ask, we offer an alternative.""

""You know what kind of defence systems we need, you know how much depends on the battlefield, on the ability to use aircraft that can protect our people, aircraft that can help Ukraine, help Europe and you know that you have them but they're not in the Ukrainian sky.""

Mr Zelensky quoted Martin Luther King's iconic speech and said he too has a dream.

""I have a dream, these words are known to each of you today, I have a need. I need to protect our sky, I need you decision, your help, which means exactly the same, the same you feel when you hear the words 'I have a dream',"" he said.

""Ukraine is grateful to the United States for it's overwhelming support, for everything that your people have done for us to pressure the aggressor economically. I am grateful to President Biden for his personal involvement, however, it is true in the darkest time for our country I call on you to do more.""

""New packages of sanctions are needed constantly every week until the Russian military machine stops. We propose that the US sanctions all politicians in the Russian Federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression of Ukraine.""

""Please take the lead, I'm asking to make sure that the Russian's do not receive a single penny that they use to destroy people in Ukraine. All American ports should be closed for Russian goods. Peace is more important than income.""

It comes as more than three million people have now fled Ukraine since Vladimir Putin’s war began, according to the United Nations.

Figures from the UN refugee agency (UNHCR), mainly comprised of border agency data, showed that at least 3,000,381 people had left the country in the 20 days since Russia’s invasion of its sovereign neighbour began.

In the first days of the war, refugee agencies warned they were bracing for as many as 4 million people to leave Ukraine. But this figure is likely to be revised upwards – with western officials warning last week that this grim forecast could be realised within days.

The exodus seen in Ukraine is the largest in Europe since the Second World War, UN refugee agency chief Filippo Grandi said on Saturday.

But western officials have warned that “these are unprecedented movements of people in Europe, or indeed probably anywhere else in the world”.

Peace talks

Russia and Ukraine both emphasised new-found scope for compromise on Wednesday as peace talks were set to resume three weeks into a Russian assault that has so far failed to topple the Ukrainian government by force.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the talks were becoming ""more realistic"", while Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said there was ""some hope for compromise"", with neutral status for Ukraine - a major Russian demand - now on the table.

Three weeks into the invasion, Russian troops have been halted at the gates of Kyiv, having taken heavy losses and failed to seize any of Ukraine's biggest cities in a war Western officials say Moscow thought it would win within days.

Ukrainian officials have expressed hope this week that Moscow was coming to terms with its failure to topple the Kyiv government and its lack of fresh troops to keep fighting.

Talks were due to resume on Wednesday by video link for what would be a third straight day, the first time they have lasted more than a single day, which both sides have suggested means they have entered a more serious phase.

""The meetings continue, and, I am informed, the positions during the negotiations already sound more realistic. But time is still needed for the decisions to be in the interests of Ukraine,"" Zelenskiy said in a video address overnight.

On Tuesday, Zelenskiy had hinted at a possible route for compromise, suggesting Ukraine would be willing to accept international security guarantees that stopped short of its longstanding hope for full admission to the NATO alliance.

Keeping Ukraine out of NATO was long one of Russia's main demands in the months before it launched what it calls a ""special operation"" to disarm and ""denazify"" Ukraine.

""The negotiations are not easy for obvious reasons,"" Lavrov told media outlet RBC news. ""But nevertheless, there is some hope of reaching a compromise.""

""Neutral status is now being seriously discussed along, of course, with security guarantees,"" Lavrov said. ""Now this very thing is being discussed in negotiations - there are absolutely specific formulations which in my view are close to agreement.""

The head of Ukraine's negotiating team, Zelenskiy's aide Mykhailo Podlolyak, tweeted ahead of Wednesday's resumption of talks that Ukrainian military counteroffensives had ""radically changed the parties' dispositions"".

In an intelligence assessment released on Wednesday, Britain said Russian forces were trapped on roads, struggling to cope with Ukrainian terrain and suffering from a failure to gain control of the air.

""The tactics of the Ukrainian Armed Forces have adeptly exploited Russia's lack of manoeuvre, frustrating the Russian advance and inflicting heavy losses on the invading forces,"" said the report.

Europe's biggest invasion since World War Two has reduced some Ukrainian cities to rubble and sent more than 3 million refugees fleeing abroad.

Still, Ukrainian forces have withstood an assault by a much larger army. Zelenskiy said Ukrainian troops had killed a fourth Russian major general in the latest fighting.

""The occupiers were not successful today, although they threw thousands of their people into battle, in the north, in the east, in the south of our state. The enemy lost equipment, hundreds more soldiers. A lot of dead Russian conscripts, dozens of officers.""

Meanwhile, civilians remain trapped under bombardment in cities where Russia has lain siege. Ukraine said on Wednesday about 20,000 people had managed to escape the besieged port of Mariupol in private cars, but hundreds of thousands remain trapped by Russian shelling, many without heating, power or running water.

Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said it was not clear whether the humanitarian corridor to the city would be opened on Wednesday. In a video address, she said Russian forces were in control of a hospital they had captured on Tuesday in Mariupol, and 400 staff and patients there were being held hostage.

The prime ministers of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia were due home on Wednesday after an overnight journey out of Kyiv by train.

They met Zelenskiy in the Ukrainian capital on Tuesday in the first visit of its kind since the war began, a symbol of the Ukrainian administration's success so far in withstanding the Russian assault.

Zelenskiy was due to address the U.S. Congress later on Wednesday by video link, having made similar appearances in parliaments across Europe. The White House said U.S. President Joe Biden would make his first visit to Europe since the invasion next week to discuss the crisis with NATO allies.

The conflict has brought economic isolation upon Russia and the economic cost was fully exposed on Wednesday, as its sanctions-ravaged government teetered on the brink of its first international debt default since the Bolshevik revolution.

Moscow was due to pay $117 million in interest on two dollar-denominated sovereign bonds it had sold back in 2013, but it faces limits on making payments and has talked of paying in roubles, which would trigger a default.

Trapped

Russian troops have taken more than 400 hostages in a major hospital in besieged Mariupol, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said.

Locals were trapped in the hospital which fell to the Russians yesterday amid heavy artillery fire, she said.

Mariupol, a key port city on the Black Sea coast, has been encircled by Russian forces for more than a fortnight and residents have had access to food, water and power cut off.

Meanwhile, Russia suggested it could allow a revival of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal in a shift from its previous demand that Western sanctions imposed over the invasion of Ukraine would block efforts to bring the deal back.

Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia had written guarantees that it can carry out its work as a party to the deal.

Under the deal, Iran agreed to limit its nuclear program to make it harder to develop a nuclear bomb – an ambition it denies – in return for relief from global economic sanctions.

The Russian offensive on Ukraine intensified on Wednesday as explosions were reported amid continuous air sirens in the suburbs of Kyiv as the war entered its 21st day.

Around midnight, Russian warships fired missiles and a “huge amount of ammunition” at the Ukrainian sea coast “from a great distance” to the south of Odesa, Ukraine’s interior ministry adviser said.

This came hours before Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky is set to address the US Congress to bolster support against Russia’s military invasion, which has left thousands of people dead and displaced millions.

Earlier in a video address, Mr Zelensky hinted that the peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine were yielding results as Moscow’s “demands were becoming more realistic”.

“However, time is still needed for the decisions to be in Ukraine’s interests. Our heroes, our defenders give us this time,” he said.

Mr Zelensky also warned that the war will end in shame and poverty for Russia.

A plume of smoke was seen rising up over western Kyiv on Wednesday morning after shrapnel from an artillery shell slammed into a 12-story apartment building in central Kyiv, obliterating the top floor and igniting a fire, according to a statement and images released by the Kyiv emergencies agency.

The neighboring building was also damaged. The agency reported two victims, without elaborating.

Russian forces have intensified fighting in Kyiv suburbs, notably around the town of Bucha in the northwest and the highway leading west toward Zhytomyr, the head of the Kyiv region Oleksiy Kuleba said Wednesday.

He said Russian troops are trying to cut off the capital from transport arteries and destroy logistical capabilities even as they plan a wide-ranging attack to seize Kyiv.

Twelve towns around Kyiv are without water and six without heat.

Russia has occupied the city of Ivankiv, 80km north of Kyiv, and controls the surrounding region on the border with Belarus, Kuleba said.

Across the Kyiv region, he said, “Kindergartens, museums, churches, residential blocks and engineering infrastructure are suffering from the endless firing.”

Earlier, Mr Zelensky has said Ukraine should accept it will not become a member of Nato, hinting at a potential key concession to Russia, which demanded such a guarantee before launching its deadly invasion three weeks ago.

Speaking to military officials of the UK-led Joint Expeditionary Force in a video message yesterday, the Ukraine president said it was a “truth” that it would not join the alliance.

“Ukraine is not a member of Nato. We understand that. We have heard for years that the doors were open, but we also heard that we could not join. It’s a truth and it must be recognised,” Mr Zelensky said.

On the eve of war, Russian president Vladimir Putin demanded assurances that Ukraine would never become a Nato member.

Moscow has repeated the demand since its troops entered Ukraine and also called on Kyiv to sign a neutrality agreement and recognise the independence of pro-Russian republics in the east of the country.

Ukraine has consistently asked for Nato protection during the war, notably in the form of a no-fly zone, but this was the first time Mr Zelensky has conceded that Kyiv will not join the alliance.

President Biden announced yesterday that he would meet Nato leaders in Brussels next week, while Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg made another warning that Russia could use chemical weapons in the conflict.

Responding to the Ukrainian president’s comments, Boris Johnson’s official spokesperson said: “What’s important that is it is for the Ukrainian government to decide what they think is suitable. They should have no decisions imposed upon them.”

The developments came as peace talks between Ukraine and Russia continued, and the leaders of three European Union countries – Poland, the Czech Republic, both Nato members, and Slovenia – surprisingly visited Kyiv.

Despite the diplomatic efforts, Russia’s pummelling of Ukraine continued yesterday the 20th day of the war.

The bombardment of Kyiv was stepped up with apartment buildings and a subway station targeted. Mr Zelensky said the strikes killed dozens of people.

Fighting has intensified on the city’s outskirts in recent days and Mayor Vitali Klitschko announced a 35-hour curfew through to tomorrow morning.

Almost 100 children have now been killed in the war, said Ukrainian officials.

In the city of Mariupol, another 2,000 cars fled hellish conditions along a humanitarian corridor in the biggest evacuation yet from the desperately besieged seaport.

One official claimed that up to 20,000 people have been killed by the continual Russian bombardment of the seaport city and that bodies were lying in the streets unattended and unable to be buried.

There were also reports last night that Russian soldiers had taken some 400 staff and patients hostage at an intensive care hospital in the city.

Here’s what we’ve seen so far:

Turkey has been testing its ties with Moscow by sending armed drones to Kyiv and invoking a 1936 treaty to limit Russian warships’ access to the Black Sea. But Ankara is also competing for the role of mediator, having hosted the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers in Antalya last week.

The US has barred imports of Russian oil and natural gas after failing to convince Saudi Arabia to increase oil production to offset global price increases that benefit Moscow.

Egypt and the United Arab Emirates have tread cautiously to avoid harming their ties with Moscow, while Israel has led with humanitarian aid and offered to mediate the conflict directly.

There's 18-month-old Kirill, whose shrapnel wound to the head proved too much for his little toddler's body. There's 16-year-old Iliya, whose legs were blown up in an explosion during a soccer game at a school field. There's the girl no older than 6 who wore the pajamas with cartoon unicorns, among the first of Mariupol's children to die from a Russian shell.

They are stacked together with dozens of others in this mass grave on the outskirts of the city. A man covered in a bright blue tarp, weighed down by stones at the crumbling curb. A woman wrapped in a red and gold bedsheet, her legs neatly bound at the ankles with a scrap of white fabric. Workers toss the bodies in as fast as they can, because the less time they spend in the open, the better their own chances of survival.

“The only thing (I want) is for this to be finished,” raged worker Volodymyr Bykovskyi, pulling crinkling black body bags from a truck. “Damn them all, those people who started this!”

More bodies will come, from streets where they are everywhere and from the hospital basement where adults and children are laid out awaiting someone to pick them up. The youngest still has an umbilical stump attached.

Each airstrike and shell that relentlessly pounds Mariupol — about one a minute at times — drives home the curse of a geography that has put the city squarely in the path of Russia's domination of Ukraine. This southern seaport of 430,000 has become a symbol of Russian President Vladimir Putin's drive to crush democratic Ukraine — but also of a fierce resistance on the ground.

In the nearly three weeks since Russia's war began, two Associated Press journalists have been the only international media present in Mariupol, chronicling its fall into chaos and despair. The city is now encircled by Russian soldiers, who are slowly squeezing the life out of it, one blast at a time.

Several appeals for humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians went unheeded, until Ukrainian officials said Tuesday that about 4,000 passenger cars carrying civilians had fled Mariupol in a convoy. Airstrikes and shells have hit the maternity hospital, the fire department, homes, a church, a field outside a school. For the estimated hundreds of thousands who remain, there is quite simply nowhere to go.

The surrounding roads are mined and the port blocked. Food is running out, and the Russians have stopped humanitarian attempts to bring it in. Electricity is mostly gone and water is sparse, with residents melting snow to drink. Some parents have even left their newborns at the hospital, perhaps hoping to give them a chance at life in the one place with decent electricity and water.

People burn scraps of furniture in makeshift grills to warm their hands in the freezing cold and cook what little food there still is. The grills themselves are built with the one thing in plentiful supply: bricks and shards of metal scattered in the streets from destroyed buildings.

Death is everywhere. Local officials have tallied more than 2,500 deaths in the siege, but many bodies can't be counted because of the endless shelling. They have told families to leave their dead outside in the streets because it's too dangerous to hold funerals.

Many of the deaths documented by the AP were of children and mothers, despite Russia's claims that civilians haven't been attacked. Doctors say they are treating 10 civilians for every injured Ukrainian soldier.

“They have a clear order to hold Mariupol hostage, to mock it, to constantly bomb and shell it,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on March 10.

Just weeks ago, Mariupol's future seemed much brighter.

If geography drives a city's destiny, Mariupol was on the path to success, with its thriving iron and steel plants, a deep-water port and high global demand for both. Even the dark weeks of 2014, when the city nearly fell to Russia-backed separatists in vicious street battles, were fading into memory.

And so the first few days of the invasion had a perverse familiarity for many residents. About 100,000 people left at that time while they still could, according to Serhiy Orlov, the deputy mayor. But most stayed put, figuring they could wait out whatever came next or eventually make their way west like so many others.

“I felt more fear in 2014, I don't feel the same panic now,” Anna Efimova said as she shopped for supplies at a market on Feb. 24. “There is no panic. There's nowhere to run, where can we run?”

That same day, a Ukrainian military radar and airfield were among the first targets of Russian artillery. Shelling and airstrikes could and did come at any moment, and people spent most of their time in shelters.?Life was hardly normal, but it was livable.

By Feb. 27, that started to change, as an ambulance raced into a city hospital carrying a small motionless girl. Her brown hair was pulled back off her pale face with a rubber band, and her pajama pants were bloodied by Russian shelling. She was no older than 6.

Her wounded father came with her, his head bandaged. Her mother stood outside the ambulance, weeping.

As the doctors and nurses huddled around her, one gave her an injection. Another shocked her with a defibrillator. A doctor in blue scrubs, pumping oxygen into her, looked straight into the camera of an AP journalist allowed inside and cursed.

“Show this to Putin,” he stormed with expletive-laced fury. “The eyes of this child and crying doctors.”

They couldn't save her. Doctors covered the tiny body with her pink striped jacket and gently closed her eyes. She now rests in the mass grave.",https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/world/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-day-21-volodymyr-zelensky-putin-peace-talks-us-congress-nato-eu-economic-sanctions-16th-march-2022-2022-03-16-764526

Europeans are stocking up on survival gear like sleeping bags and camping cookers, as well as canned and dried food, in part to donate to refugees arriving from Ukraine and also due to fears of supplies being disrupted and conflict spreading. Sales of products such as plastic cans, camping gear, batteries, flashlights and cell phone solar chargers jumped as much as sixfold in the past two weeks at Swedish hardware store chain Clas Ohlsson, a spokesperson said.

""It's clear that people want to be prepared for crises. The biggest increase is for products recommended to have at home during a crisis, for example, radios,"" he said. Sales of milk powder, pasta, grains, and canned foods rose by up to 20% in the past four weeks, according to Swedish grocery retailer Ica Gruppen. Consumers are stocking up for themselves while humanitarian organizations are also buying products to send to Ukraine, according to Ica Sweden purchasing director Andreas Sbrodigliga.

In the Netherlands, Jimmy Bakker at outdoor supplier Dumpstore Amsterdam has seen brisk trade since the war started. ""When the war broke out people were buying emergency blankets, emergency food rations, radios and stoves. Last week, people rented vehicles and they were going to drive to Ukraine to hand out there,"" he said.

""He is a war criminal,"" Mr Biden told reporters at the White House.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the President was ""speaking from his heart"" after seeing images on television of ""barbaric actions by a brutal dictator through his invasion of a foreign country"".

The White House had previously been hesitant to declare Putin's actions those of a war criminal, saying it was a legal term that required research.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Mr Biden's comments were ""unacceptable and unforgivable rhetoric"".

The US President also announced $800 million of new assistance for Ukraine including 800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems, 100 grenade launchers and an unspecified number of drones.
