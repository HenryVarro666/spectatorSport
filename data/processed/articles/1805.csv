0,1606237a-6013-4a81-938a-e8d3d3d79e69,"[""Rfe Rl'S Russian Service""]",,"Russia's Defense Ministry warned on April 15 that it will intensify attacks on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, after accusing Ukraine of targeting Russian border towns.

The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making “the most important decision of their life -- to fight.”

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.”

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the major developments on Russia's invasion, how Kyiv is fighting back, the plight of civilians, and Western reaction. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.

Zelenskiy noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.”

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

Humanitarian aspect

The aftermath of the Russian occupation of the Kyiv region The New York Times published satellite photos of Bucha. They show that bodies appeared on the city streets when Bucha was still under the occupation of the Russian troops; some bodies had been lying on the streets for weeks since mid-March.

Видео дня

On the International Investigation of the Bucha Massacre, President Zelensky stated, ""We are interested in the most complete, transparent investigation, the results of which will be known and explained to the entire international community. We have provided maximum access for journalists to Bucha and other liberated cities in Ukraine for hundreds of journalists from around the world. And we are interested in having thousands of journalists there, as many journalists as possible, so that the world can see what Russia has done.""

Meanwhile, the town of Bucha is being cleared and demined by Ukrainian forces and first responders.

3700 residents currently remain in Bucha. Those who have left their homes are not allowed to return yet. First, rescuers public utility workers, doctors, and social workers will return to the town on April 7. According to the UN, 4.2 million people had left Ukraine as of April 4.

However, according to a survey by the Razumkov Center, 79% of refugees want to return to Ukraine after the war. Another 10% do not plan to return, and 11% found it difficult to answer.

The current humanitarian crisis in Ukraine has already become one of the biggest in the world in the last 30 years.

Ombudswoman for Human Rights Lyudmila Denisova reports that Russia has grossly violated the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Ukrainian captives.

She reports that captured Ukrainian female soldiers were subjected to ill-treatment and torture/abuse in Russia.

А total of 3,846 people has been evacuated via humanitarian corridors today. 2,216 people (1,496 Mariupol residents and 720 residents of Berdyansk, Melitopol, Pology, Vasylivka) reached Zaporizhzhya via humanitarian corridors.

A convoy of 7 buses to evacuate people from Mariupol, accompanied by the International Committee of the Red Cross, blocked in Mangush by Russian forces, was forced to return. Also, 17 minibusses returned to Zaporizhzhia from Berdyansk, evacuating 150 people who fled from Lysychansk, Severodonetsk, Rubizhne, and Kreminna.

1,080 people were evacuated from the Luhansk region. Ukrainian intelligence reported that the Russian command does not plan to rotate personnel who committed atrocities in Bucha. As of April 4, this brigade was withdrawn to Belarus.

After two days of rest, they would be returned to Ukraine's hottest spots, probably in the Kharkiv direction. On the night of April 4-5, the invaders launched an airstrike on Kramatorsk, Donetsk region. In Rubizhne, Luhansk region, the invaders blew up a nitrogen tank; locals were asked to close their windows and not go outside.

Nitric acid is dangerous if inhaled, swallowed, and contact with skin and mucous membranes. On the night of April 5, the occupiers attacked the Ternopil region. The wreckage of the downed rocket damaged mineral fertilizer tanks, and ammonia levels were found in the soil and the Ikva River. Due to the fighting in the Zaporizhzhia region, more than 60,000 families in 52 towns and villages are left without gas. Further repair of the power grid is impossible due to the Russian occupiers not admitting repair crews.

In Tokmak, Russian troops are forcing local health care medical personnel to sign so-called ""contracts""' with the Russian Federation Ministry of Health. Russian invaders continue shelling civilian infrastructure. Nine private houses were damaged due to the shelling in Preobrazhenka, Polohivsky district. Residential buildings in Orikhiv and surrounding villages were damaged.

In Melitopol, the occupiers are beginning to connect residents to the Russian Internet. The Ukrainian mobile providers are blocked. City residents may end up in complete information isolation. During two days of attacks in Mykolaiv, at least three medical institutions, five schools, ten kindergartens, an orphanage, and residential quarters were damaged.

As a result of Russian MLRS strikes on Mykolaiv, ten people are dead, and 61 are wounded. In the Kharkiv region for the last few days, Russians made 17 attacks in the areas of Saltovka, Pyatihatok, and Dergachev. As a result of the shelling of Kharkiv's Slobidsky district, seven people were killed, and 34 were injured, including three children who remain in serious condition.

As of the morning of April 5, the Russian army continued to shell residential areas of Kharkiv. In Derhachi, three people were killed, and seven were injured. ATMs and banks do not work in Kherson. There is very little food, no sugar, salt, butter, canned food, and household cleaning products. Farmers help with vegetables, fruits, and meat. Bread is homemade. Many shops are closed.

Almost no pharmacies are working because there is nothing left. The Russian troops left many roads mined, communications destroyed, and bridges blown up in Chernihiv and the Chernihiv and Chernihiv region. The Highways Service, the military, and the administration are involved in providing and organizing routes throughout the region to restore logistics shortly.

According to the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), Russia is preparing a large-scale provocation in Mariupol and planning to blame it on Ukraine. According to available data, the invaders are preparing large-scale falsification: they plan to gather in one place the bodies of Mariupol residents killed by the Russians and present them as mass victims of Ukrainian troops, spreading false information that ""Ukrainians use civilians as human shields.""

Operational situation

The strategic air-ground offensive operation of the Russian Armed Forces against Ukraine continues. Since April, Russians have changed its title to the 'Donbas Defense Operation.' During 41 days of fighting, the enemy has partially fulfilled the task of establishing the land corridor from Russia's territory through the Ukrainian Donbas to the temporarily occupied Crimea and attempts to occupy the entire Donetsk and Luhansk regions within their administrative borders.

The enemy is regrouping troops withdrawn from Polissya and Sivershchyna and is concentrating on preparing an offensive in the east of Ukraine. Units of the 6th and 20th combined arms armies, the 1st Tank Army, and the Coastal Forces of the Baltic and Northern Fleets are completing preparations to resume the offensive, likely in an attempt to encircle the Ukrainian Joint Forces. The redeployment of Russian Central Military District troops from Ukraine has been completed. Stocks of food, fuel, and ammunition are being replenished.

After restoring combat readiness, the designated units will be moved to the area of the Valuyki and included in the offensive troop groups. Columns of military equipment in Belarus have been observed moving toward railway stations in Gomel, Yelsk, and Mozyr for loading on railway echelons. A significant part of Russian Air Force aircraft and helicopters were relocated from Belarus airfields to Russia.

At the same time, the enemy is trying to improve the position of its units in the Tavriya and Pivdennobuzhsky operational areas. The enemy continues to suffer battle losses in Ukraine. During the entire Russian-Ukrainian war, Russian Armed Forces military command representatives only twice declared the loss of Russian troops.

According to available information, the 20th Motorized Rifle Division (Kamyshin, Volgograd region) of the 8th Army of the Southern Military District, including the 33rd, 255th, and 294th motorized rifle regiments, returned to the permanent deployment base after fighting in Ukraine, had lost 40% of personnel, weapons, and military equipment. Many servicemen who were lucky enough to return alive are trying to retire from the military. The existing military medical facilities in Russia and Belarus do not have the capacity for treating the current number of wounded servicemen.

Thus, the medical staff of the central district hospital in Glushkovo, Kursk region, was put on an intensified schedule due to the arrival of about 100 wounded Russian soldiers on March 29-April 2 from the Sumy region. In the temporarily occupied city of Pologi, Zaporizhzhya region, Russian Armed Forces servicemen seized and mined the central district hospital.

Local medical staff and patients were warned not to return to the hospital; only the wounded Russian occupiers remained on the premises. The Russian military leadership is trying to make up for the loss of officers at the expense of officers of higher military educational institutions.

According to available information, the Military Academy of Communications (St. Petersburg) urgently trains officers to replace positions in military units involved in the aggression against Ukraine. The Russian Air Force continues to make about 300 combat missions per day, mostly at night. There are about 600 Russian prisoners of war in Ukraine.

The morale of the Russian invasion force personnel remains low and tends to deteriorate. The enemy personnel is demoralized, resulting in increased desertions and refusals to take part in the war in Ukraine.

Volyn operational area: The situation is unchanged. Polissya operational area: The situation is unchanged. Kyiv operational area: The situation is unchanged.

Siversky operational area: Ukrainian 1st separate tank brigade, in cooperation with territorial defense units of the Chernihiv region, continued liberating villages south and southwest of Chernihiv and further advanced in the northwest, which led units of the Russian 41st Army to hastily retreat to Belarus practically without resisting.

The retreat of the 2nd Army from the M-02 highway to the east of the Konotop district allowed the Ukrainian Armed Forces to restore the road connection between Chernihiv and Kyiv. Ukrainian forces returned the territories north and east of Chernihiv to the city of Shostka in the Sumy region under Ukrainian control.

Elimination of the consequences of the Russian occupation forces continues. Slobozhansky operational area: Russian invaders continue to launch air and missile strikes on Kharkiv but do not risk storming the city. Ukrainian 92nd separate mechanized brigade is advancing from the Mala Rohan-Chuhuiv district towards the state border, liberating the area from the invaders and, at the same time, threatening the right flank of the Russian 6th Army and the Russian grouping near Izyum from the rear. In Izym, the enemy carries out filtration measures and forcibly takes locals to the Russian Federation.

To ensure troop maneuvers and crossing of the Seversky Donets River, the enemy is working to restore the bridge in the city of Izyum. Due to significant personnel losses of the 237th tank and 752nd motorized rifle regiments of the 3rd motorized infantry division, the Russian occupiers were forced to equip a field hospital at a local school.

Units of the Russian 6th Army and 36th Infantry Division, using TOS-1 fire strikes, pushed back units of the Ukrainian 81st Airmobile and 95th Assault Brigade from Topolsky and Kamyanka. In recent days, the Russian aggressor's units have carried out four attacks on Mala Komyshuvakha and Tykhotske. They captured these villages and launched an offensive in the direction of Brazhkivka, thus completing favorable conditions for strikes in the direction of Barvinkove and/or Slovyansk. The Russian 1st Tank Regiment's battalion offensive in the direction of Sulyhivka was unsuccessful.

Donetsk operational area: Over the past two days, the aggressor has concentrated all units, withdrawn from the northwest of Kyiv region via Belarus and the Kursk region to eastern Ukraine, east of Kharkiv. Thus, the 8th and 20th armies significantly increased their efforts to capture Rubizhne, Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, and Popasna, while attacking from the northwest, north, and east. In the areas of Borivske, Novoluhanske, Solodke, Maryinka, and Zolota Niva, the enemy continued artillery shelling on the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and civilian infrastructure.

Near Novotoshkivske, Nyzhne, Popasna, Kalynove, Stepne, Rubizhne, Troitske, and Novoselivka-2, the enemy carried out assault operations but failed. Units of the 8th Army penetrated the defense of the Ukrainian Joint Forces west of Horlivka by storming Novobakhmutivka.

The enemy is preparing to launch an offensive near the village of Zolota Niva.

Mariupol: Fierce resistance from the city's defenders is holding back the advance of the Russian 8th Army west of Donetsk. According to the 8th Army commander's decision, General Mezentsev, the city is being fired on with the heavy flamethrower systems TOS-1, which violates international humanitarian law and threatens civilian safety.

Russian invaders inflict massive artillery and airstrikes on the city. The Azov Special Purpose Unit of Ukraine continues to control most of the Azovstal plant and seaport. The Russian National Guard reports heavy losses.

Tavriya operational area: The Armed Forces of Ukraine liberated Oleksandrivka north of Kherson and posed a threat to Russian troops southwest of the city in the area of Bilozerka. Units of the Russian 58th Army continue to restore combat capability.

Only 71 motorized rifle regiments and 42 motorized rifle divisions remained active but were stopped by Ukrainian Forces on the outskirts of Vuhledar.

Around Nova Kakhovka, the enemy tightened the access control at checkpoints. The Russian invaders resort to detaining civilians and forcing them into engineering fortifications of the enemy positions. Cases of illegally seizing vehicles from the population have become more frequent.

Considering the deployment by Russia of poorly trained units angry and frustrated during the war (especially such as the Russian National Guard, PMC Wagner, and the FSB), special punitive measures might occur in Kherson, Melitopol, and others to identify and detain Ukrainian politicians, journalists, and activists. Pivdennobuzksky operational area: In the area of Lyubyne, Myrne, and Kopany, the invaders fired artillery at the Ukrainian Armed Forces. In response to their inability to counter in the Oleksandrivka area, Russian invaders fired on Mykolaiv with Tornado MLRS, using cluster munitions and damaging four hospitals and a city orphanage.

Azov-Black Sea maritime operational area: Russian troops continue attempts to seize Ukrainian cities and ports in the Black and Azov Seas. Ukrainian Black Sea ports are blocked by Russian ships. Civil navigation is not possible. The Turkish Navy has announced its readiness to provide a safe corridor for up to 90 foreign ships stranded in Ukrainian ports since the start of the war. No results yet.

At approximately 10:40 p.m. on April 4, Russian troops fired at the civilian cargo ship Azburg (flag Dominica, shipowner Malta) at the Mariupol Seaport. One crew member was injured in a fire in the engine room. The sea siege of Odesa continues. Russian troops continue to launch missile strikes from the sea. Missiles are coming from Russian surface ships and submarines. Mykolaiv and Ochakiv were also hit by missiles from the Black Sea. There are casualties due to the attacks. The defense of Mykolaiv continues.

Ukrainian defense forces hold the enemy in the Kherson region, conduct counterattacks, and shell clusters of enemy equipment. The enemy transferred additional heavy forces from occupied Crimea to the Kherson region and constantly fired at Mykolaiv with artillery and MLRS.

The total combat losses of the enemy from February 24 to April 5 were approximately: Personnel - almost 18,500 people (+200) Tanks - 676 (+29) Armored combat vehicles (BBM) - 1858 (+14) Operational tactical missile systems - 4 (0) Artillery systems - 332 (+2) Multiple rocket launchers (MLRS) - 107 (+2) Means of air defense - 55 (+1) Aircraft - 150 (+3) Helicopters - 134 (0) Automotive equipment - 1322 (+29) Boats / ships - 7 (0) UAV - 94 (+2)

Ukraine in general Russia's war against Ukraine has led to a drop in Ukrainian grain exports, but even shifting supplies from other countries will not be able to compensate for the loss of supplies from Ukraine (Bloomberg.)

Boryspil International Airport in Kyiv lost UAH 3.5 billion during the war. Communications. The level of mobile coverage in Ukraine has not changed significantly. Last night, new local damages were recorded on the Ukrtelecom telecommunication network in Mykolaiv, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia regions. Repair crews are already working to fix them and restore services. In general, the company's critical infrastructure and national network are stable. Services are provided in all regions except Luhansk.

During the past 24 hours, Ukrainian internet service providers have recorded 146 cases of network damage or equipment unavailability. Ukrainians in most parts of the country have access to digital terrestrial television through the work of the Concern of Radio Broadcasting and Television, which is under the management of the State Special Communications.

Satellite broadcasting works stably. Cyberattacks have been noted trying to gain access to Telegram accounts, reported by the Government Team for Response to Computer Emergencies of Ukraine CERT-UA and the Cyber Police of Ukraine.

Criminals circulated messages among Ukrainian citizens with malicious links to an alleged Telegram site to gain unauthorized access to accounts, including the possibility of intercepting a one-time SMS code. Energy security Over the past 24 hours, the electricity supply to more than 123,700 consumers has been restored. The gas supply was restored to 832 consumers.

Ukrainian energy companies are making every effort to restore the energy supply quickly. However, emergency recovery work is difficult or impossible in some areas due to the intensification of hostilities and the emergence of new damage.

As of April 5, more than 1,245 towns and villages in Ukraine remain without electricity (more than 759,300 consumers). In addition, more than 334,000 residences remain without a gas supply. Electricity. Ukraine's energy system is balanced and stable. Frequency in the network at the standard level of 50 Hz. All power plants operate stably in the network, providing electricity to all Ukrainian consumers.

Nuclear power. Ukraine's nuclear power plants generate electricity steadily. Their total current capacity provides the necessary amounts of electricity for the country's needs. Radiation, fire, and environmental conditions at the industrial sites of nuclear power plants and adjacent territories have not changed and are within current standards. The National Guard of Ukraine units arrived at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and took the facility under their protection.

Gas transmission system. The company maintains operational and technological control over the Ukrainian GTS, fulfilling its obligations to transport gas to consumers. Hydropower. All HPPs and PSPs within Ukrhydroenergo operate according to the dispatch schedule and fulfill their obligations to regulate the frequency and capacity of the country's energy system.

The stations are ready for the spring floods. International diplomatic aspect Lithuania expelled the Russian ambassador and declared a decline in diplomatic relations ""In response to Russia's military aggression against sovereign Ukraine and the atrocities committed by the Russian armed forces in various occupied Ukrainian cities, including the horrific massacre in Bucha.""

149 Russian diplomats have been expelled from European countries in the last two days. Some countries directly link this decision to the crimes of Russian troops, others to the espionage activities of ""diplomats."" This is the third wave of mass expulsions of Russian diplomats over the last few years. The first two waves were related to the interference of Russian special services in the U.S. presidential election in 2016 and the attempted chemical poisoning of Sergei Skripal in the United Kingdom in 2018.

This reinforces Russia's diplomatic isolation and reduces its ability to conduct espionage and subversive activities in the West. The EU is working on the fifth package of restrictive measures against Russia in connection with crimes committed by the Russian military.

The measures, in particular, provide for a ban on imports of Russian coal (a quarter of EU imports are from Russia, 4 billion euros annually); a ban on transactions by four banks (23% of the Russian banking market), including the second largest in Russia, VTB; a ban on Russian ships entering EU ports (with some exemptions) and on Russian and Belarusian road transport operators; bans on EU exports in advanced semiconductors and machinery (worth 10 billion euros). The issue of Russian oil imports is also being considered.

In Germany, a complete ban on energy imports is being debated. However, drastic steps are unlikely given the impact on households, the inevitable recession, and rising unemployment. ""If it would stop the war, then we would do it immediately,"" said the foreign minister. On Monday, the United States banned Russia from using more than $600 million from reserves held in American banks to repay sovereign debt. Russia has 30 days to repay the debt. On the same day, VTB paid its domestic foreign currency debt obligations in rubles ($3.1 million).

Thus, given the impossibility of using part of the frozen foreign exchange resources and experiencing a shortage of foreign exchange earnings, Russia will be forced to spend available gold and foreign exchange savings to cover foreign debt and provide critical imports. This will mean fewer resources available to wage war in Ukraine and keep the situation under control inside Russia. German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier has ruled out normalizing relations with Russia as long as Putin remains president.

He also acknowledged mistakes in the approaches to Russia, in particular, promoting the ""creation of a pan-European home with the participation of Russia"" and the construction of the Nord Stream-2 gas pipeline. However, Steinmeier has come under criticism from Ukraine's ambassador to Germany, who considers it more important to ""act on these statements now, and there are no such actions.""

The German political elite is very reluctant and slow to acknowledge the strategic miscalculations about Moscow and continues to take a very cautious stance, particularly on arms supplies to Ukraine. Berlin's indecision provokes criticism, especially from Central and Eastern Europe. Suppose Germany behaves so ""moderately"" when deciding the fate of Europe's largest country and unprecedented crimes by Russia. What can happen if Putin tries to break the Suwałki Corridor to Kaliningrad?

And such a scenario should not be ruled out, given the Baltic states' plans to ban (regardless of the EU) access to their ports and roads, making land access to the Kaliningrad enclave impossible. In addition, Putin has repeatedly escalated in a new direction to cover up for his crimes or problems elsewhere. Former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown is an activist in the Justice for Ukraine campaign, which aims to establish a ""Special Tribunal for the Punishment of the Crime of Aggression"" in addition to the Ukrainian-initiated investigation of war crimes and crimes against humanity within the International Criminal Court. The e-petition has already garnered more than 1.5 million signatures, including 50 heads of states and governments. Legal condemnation will be of paramount political and historical significance despite the small chances of truly punishing Russia's top war criminals.

Roskomnadzor demands Wikipedia remove materials on Russian aggression against Ukraine and crimes committed by the Russian Armed Forces, threatening a fine of up to 4 million rubles. By restricting access to some Western social networks and information portals, Russia is trying to keep Russian society in an information bubble.

This helps maintain a high level of support for the Putin regime (according to the Levada Center, 83% approve of Putin's activities) and his aggressive foreign policy (81% support the war against Ukraine). However, the closure of Russian propaganda channels in the West and the constant blocking of disinformation and bots on social networks exacerbates Moscow's urgency to fight against objective information about the war in Wikipedia, the most popular Internet resource. Relevant Russian news Russia lost about 300 billion rubles in oil and gas revenues in March. The Russian Ministry of Finance planned to receive 790 billion rubles in the federal budget but received only 302 billion rubles. Russian oil continues to fall in price. T

rafigura is offering Russian Urals oil at a discount of $34.80 per barrel - another record discount at the price of Brent for someone to take. The potential buyer is mainly China, which is already negotiating to purchase spot lots of Russian liquid national gas (LNG) at a discount of more than 10%. Most LNG importers worldwide are refusing to buy Russian cargo for fear of future sanctions or reputational damage as the war in Ukraine continues and the EU increases pressure on Moscow.

Chinese business is one of the few willing to take this risk. Some importers are considering using intermediaries to bid on Russian LNG on their behalf to hide their plans from Western governments. The United States has suspended exchanging information with Russian tax authorities to complicate Russia's tax collection. This was reported to Reuters by the U.S. Treasury Department. According to a study by Tiburon research, 66% of Russians have lower family incomes and employment problems. Tours to Turkey and Egypt for Russians rose by about 35%. The tourist industry saw a drop in demand; according to opinion polls, 51% of Russians have begun to economize, and 56% plan to cut travel costs.

The latest: The weeks-long resistance in besieged Mariupol appeared to be cracking as Russian forces moved closer to capturing the seaside port city in southeastern Ukraine, with a Russian-imposed deadline for Ukrainian forces in the city to surrender passing early Sunday local time. Meanwhile, officials in the capital Kyiv and the western city of Lviv reported explosions Saturday. Moscow has withdrawn its forces from those regions to focus on eastern Ukraine, but airstrikes have continued.

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

The advance of Vladimir Putin's war machine continues to be halted by a heroic Ukrainian resistance that has seen Moscow completely withdraw from the outskirts of Kyiv after Russian troops failed to gain ground despite relentless shelling and swathes of heavy fighting.

Putin was last week forced into a withering face-saving climbdown over the failed march on the capital - that his forces, which have been devastated with more than 20 battalions wiped out since the start of the war, would focus on 'liberating' the eastern Donbas region instead of trying to take the capital.

Russian forces have also withdrawn from Chernihiv, Konotop, Chernobyl, Sloboda and Lukashivka in recent days after facing a staunch fightback from Kyiv's troops and volunteers.

Moscow's men are though to be regrouping on Ukraine's eastern border ahead of a heavy onslaught on the Donbas region and residents in Donetsk and Luhansk have been told to evacuate now ahead of the impending manoeuvre.

The besieged southern port city Mariupol, where residents have been trapped without food, water, electricity or heat for more than a month, has continued to hold firm against Moscow's attacks despite facing continued Russian bombardment and heavy street-to-street fighting.

Mykolaiv, Severodonetsk and Kharkiv have continued to come under Russian shelling though Moscow has failed to take control of any of the three cities. Meanwhile Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said today that 'those who choose war always lose'.

His comments come after drone footage emerged showing an obliterated Russian convoy lying along a highway west of Kyiv following an ambush by Zelensky's troops - a tactic Ukraine has employed to great success across the country to repel Putin's vast numbers of slow-moving military hardware.

As Putin's invasion enters its 42nd day today, MailOnline takes a look at how Russian forces have gained territory and then been repelled by Ukrainian forces in a heroic fightback.

February 24, day one: Putin announces 'special military operation' in Ukraine

Vladimir Putin announces that Russia has launched a 'special military operation' in Ukraine, claiming that he only intends to demilitarise rather than occupy the country.

Missiles and bombs subsequently rained from the sky, tanks rolled across the border, troops parachuted down on eastern regions and explosions were seen across the country after Putin gave the order for his troops to move in from the north, east and south.

Luhansk, Sumy and Chernihiv in the east of Ukraine all came under attack, while tanks battled on the outskirts of Kharkiv after paratroopers dropped in.

Blasts were also reported in the west - in Zhytomyr and Lviv, close to the border with Poland. In Kherson, in the south, Ukrainian units had reportedly been routed by Russian tanks rolling out of Crimea, which had arrived at the Dnieper River by mid-morning.

Russian forces seized control of Chernobyl nuclear power plant after a 'fierce' battle, with the condition of nuclear storage facilities 'unknown' - sparking fears of a radiation leak that could cause fallout in Europe.

Following the first day of conflict, President Volodymyr Zelensky described Russia as 'evil' and said Putin had attacked 'like a suicidal scoundrel... just as Fascist Germany did in World War II'.

February 25, day two: Kyiv bombarded as Russian forces take control of Chernobyl

Kyiv came under bombardment in the early hours of day two of the invasion, with the skies ablaze as Putin's tanks moved to within 20 miles of the capital.

Bridges leading to Kyiv and to Kharkiv, in the east, were destroyed by Ukrainian forces to try and slow the Russian advance. Footage also revealed Russian tanks and armoured vehicles standing in front of the destroyed reactor at Chernobyl.

A squad of Chechen special forces 'hunters' were said to have been unleashed in Ukraine to detain or kill a set of specific Ukrainian officials.

Each soldier was understood to have been given a special 'deck of cards' with Ukrainian officials' photos and descriptions on them, a Moscow Telegram channel with links to the security establishment reported.

Ukraine's government claimed to have retaken an airport on the outskirts of Kyiv that Russian airborne troops had earlier seized, as President Zelensky ordered compulsory enlistment and banned all men aged 18-60 from leaving the country.

February 26, day three: Missile hits block of flats in Kyiv but Russia makes limited progress

The civilian death toll reached 198 after a devastating missile struck a high-rise apartment block as fighting continued to rage around Kyiv following a barrage of airstrikes on cities and military bases around the country.

Russia said it was not willing to negotiate with the Ukrainian government until its military operation is over, despite President Zelensky calling for sit-down talks with Putin.

Russia's military said it seized a strategic airport outside Kyiv, allowing it to quickly build up forces to take the capital. Intense gunfire broke out on a bridge across the Dnieper River dividing eastern and western Kyiv, while another key bridge to the capital was blown away.

The Ministry of Defence said Russia's invasion had so far made limited progress and Ukraine retained control of key cities, including the capital.

February 27, day four: Russia nuclear forces on alert as troops encounter strong opposition

Putin says he has placed Moscow's nuclear forces on a 'special regime of combat duty' in response to 'aggressive statements' from members of the NATO defence alliance.

Russian forces took Berdyansk, a Ukrainian city of 100,000 on the Azov Sea coast, while also making advances toward Kherson, another city in the south of Ukraine. Ukrainian officials claimed to have repelled attacks on the country's second city Kharkiv.

Mariupol in southern Ukraine was 'hanging on' as Russian forces encountered strong opposition from Ukraine defenders across the country - most notably in Kyiv.

Moscow had also so far failed to win full control of airspace, despite advances across the country, with US officials saying they believe the invasion had been more difficult than the Kremlin envisioned.

February 28, day five: Russia denies shelling residential areas as blasts heard in several cities

Day five saw an escalation in fighting as supposed peace talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials took place.

Blasts were heard in the early hours of day five in several of Ukraine cities including the capital Kyiv, Kharkiv, the country's second biggest city and Chernihiv, north of the capital, but overall, it was a quiet night on the streets of the capital with an almost two-day curfew lifted .

Satellite imagery released by Maxar Technologies depicted a three-mile long convoy of Russian military vehicles lined up on roads leading to Kyiv, thought to be less than 40 miles away.

And a 400-strong squad of bloodthirsty mercenaries were reportedly flown in from Africa with orders to kill Zelensky - a notorious private militia linked to a string of rapes, robberies, murders, and alleged war crimes.

March 1, day six: Zelensky declares Putin a 'terrorist' after 18 killed in Kharkiv rocket strikes

The war entered a new phase, with Russia's aim seemingly to surround and besiege cities such as Kharkiv, Kyiv, Mariupol, Sumy and Kherson which have so-far put up fierce resistance - and bomb them into submission.

Russian forces strike the square in front of a civilian public administration building in Kharkiv, destroying the road outside and blowing the windows out on day six. Missile strikes in the city killed at least 18 civilians and injured dozens more.

Explosions erupted around Kyiv's 1,300ft television tower, just hours after Russia told civilians to evacuate because it was about to begin bombarding 'strategic' targets. Ukraine claimed it destroyed an elite group of Chechen fighters that were plotting to assassinate Zelensky.

A huge Russian column of military vehicles, stretching for around 40 miles, was pictured around 17 miles from Kyiv. US officials said it appeared to have stalled due to the brave fighting of Ukrainian forces.

March 2, day seven: Russia claims to have taken first city as war machine steps up efforts

Ukraine denied Russian claims that its troops had seized the southern city of Kherson, on the Black Sea, in what would have been the first major city to fall.

Heavy shelling of Ukraine's major cities continued, though, as Russian paratroopers landed in Kharkiv in the early hours following several days of bombardment. Kyiv also came under further bombing as Russian forces stepped up attempts to try and take the capital.

The port city of Mariupol, another key strategic target, was encircled by Russian troops as Ukrainian forces continue to put up fierce resistance leaving 'hundreds' dead. Mayor says they cannot get remove dead bodies from the streets as 'the shelling does not stop'.

Ukrainian emergency services say more than 350 civilians have been killed, though officials also say thousands of Russians have died in the conflict.

March 3, day eight: Mariupol bombarded with shelling as huge Russian convoy is halted

Russian forces claim to be in control of government buildings on Kherson, while Mariupol is also understood to be encircled and under constant shelling.

Odessa also prepares for an amphibious assault with strategists believing it is being targeted to cut off Ukraine from the sea and to create a land corridor.

About 80 per cent of Russia's invasion force are now said to be in Ukraine, with as many as 15,000 troops - an entire Russian army division - bearing down on Kyiv. But the huge convoy outside the capital continues to remain stagnant as it becomes plagues with breakdown issues and Ukrainian attacks.

March 4, day nine: Russia seizes Europe's largest nuclear plant as heavy shelling intensifies

Russian troops seize Europe's largest nuclear plant in Zaporizhzhia after heavy shelling caused a large fire. A projectile hit one of its six reactors overnight, causing a fire that was later extinguished.

Putin's forces also intensified their bombing of Mariupol after already taking Kherson, while Russian troops were also said to have entered Mykolayiv and Kharkiv following shelling.

Mykolaiv, another port city, also comes under attack from Russian forces as Putin looks to seize control of the Black Sea.

March 5, day ten: Ceasefire to allow refugees to flee is broken by shelling after 45 minutes

A ceasefire is agreed between Russia and Ukraine in Mariupol to allow hundreds of thousands of residents to flee the city for safety. However, shells rain down on the port city just 45 minutes into the ceasefire, leaving residents trapped without electricity or water.

Russia's defence ministry accused Ukrainian 'nationalists' of preventing civilians from leaving, RIA news agency reported. But Mariupol's city council said Russia was not observing the ceasefire.

The Kremlin also threatened Britain with 'tough retaliatory measures' as Putin said devastating Western sanctions against Russia are verging on a declaration of war, and warned that any country imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine would be considered to have entered the ongoing conflict.

Thousands of Ukrainian residents marched through the streets of Kherson in defiance of Russian troops. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba claimed Russia has lost more than 10,000 troops since the invasion began.

March 6, day 11: Mariupol ceasefire interrupted by bombing as Vinnytsia airport is destroyed

The Kremlin is understood to be recruiting Syrians to fight in Ukraine, US officials say, as Russian advances stall in the continued face of strong resistance. Zelensky also warned that Russian forces are preparing to shell Odessa, much like Mariupol, as the relentless bombing continued.

A second agreed ceasefire to allow residents to leave Mariupol safely is also again interrupted by Russian shelling after just minutes.

Heartbreaking footage, taken in Irpin, located on the outskirts of the besieged capital city Kyiv, also confirmed that Russian forces are attacking heavily populated civilian areas where men, women and children are leaving the country.

US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken says there is 'very credible reports' that Russia has committed war crimes during its invasion of Ukraine - particularly in attacking civilians.

Russia is said to have deployed around 95 per cent of its combat forces it had prepared on the Ukrainian border, with Vinnytsia airport totally destroyed by a reported eight Russian missiles on day 11 of the war.

March 7, day 12: Russia pummels Ukrainian cities with shelling as Russian war ship struck

Russia announced yet another ceasefire and a handful of humanitarian corridors to allow civilians to flee Ukraine today ahead of a third round of planned talks.

The Russian Defence Ministry said a ceasefire would start in the morning, and safe passages would open for civilians from Kyiv, Mariupol, Kharkiv and Sumy. But some of the evacuation routes would funnel civilians toward Russia or its ally Belarus – and hopes were dim that the latest talks would yield breakthroughs.

Russian forces continued to pummel some Ukrainian cities with rockets even after the new announcement of corridors and fierce fighting continued in some areas, indicating there would be no wider cessation of hostilities.

Well into the second week of war, Russia's plan to quickly overrun the country has been stymied by fierce resistance. Its troops have made significant advances in southern Ukraine and along the coast, but many of its efforts have become stalled.

A Russian war ship was struck by Ukrainian forces as they continued to defend the port of Odessa from invading troops, according to Ukraine 's navy. Video footage appeared to show Ukrainian defence forces, based in Odessa, cheering as they exchanged fire with ships in the Black Sea.

March 8, day 13: Russia launches 'psychological combat units' to influence local population

Russia masses troops on the north, west and east of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv in preparation for an assault on the city. Ukrainian forces fightback starts in earnest as Kyiv's troops recapture the city of Chuhuiv and repel an attack by Moscow's men on Mykolaiv's airfield.

Strikes on civilian areas also continued, with the city of Sumy - in the east - struck by bombs which the local mayor said killed 21 people including two children and left others wounded. Ukraine's parliament published a photo of a bloodied infant they said was hurt in the attack.

Russia again offered to open up 'humanitarian corridors' today to allow civilians to flee bombarded cities - but the move was swiftly dismissed by Kyiv, with President Volodymyr Zelensky accusing Moscow of 'cynicism'.

March 9, day 14: 'New low' rocket attack destroys maternity hospital in Mariupol

A maternity hospital in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol is decimated in a 'direct hit' by Russian rockets leaving children buried in the rubble. Footage emerges of badly wounded patients and nurses being evacuated from decimated buildings, while pregnant women were carried out on stretchers into a courtyard covered in rubble and littered with huge craters.

At least 17 people, including women in labour, were injured in the attack. Days later, an injured pregnant woman and her unborn baby - whose image being stretchered from her Putin-bombed maternity ward became one of the war's most shocking images - died.

Russian forces accused of rounding up 400 activists and taking them hostage after they were caught protesting Moscow's invasion in Kherson. But Ukrainian counter attacks see Chuhuiv retaken and Moscow's men repelled from Mykolaiv's airfield.

Fighting continues on the outskirts of the capital Kyiv as Russia continues to mass forces in the north, east and west flanks of the city. Moscow's men also advance on Sumy in north eastern Ukraine as they try to surround the country's second biggest city Kharkiv and cut it off.

Nuclear safety watchdogs warn of a potential unfolding disaster at Chernobyl after the International Atomic Energy Agency says it has lost touch with the power plant's systems that monitor nuclear material. The IAEA also say they have lost contact with the captured Zaporizhzhia power plant.

March 10, day 15: Civilians in Mariupol 'fight over food' and bury bodies in trenches in siege

Imprecise Russian missiles fired from a Grad launcher strikes a Physics institute in Kharkiv which houses the Neutron Source nuclear research facility and contains 37 nuclear fuel cells in its core, raising fears of a radiation leak that could spread across Europe.

Airstrikes strike the cities of Dnipro, in central Ukraine, Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk, in the west, which have largely been spared attacks. The strike on Dnipro hit civilian areas including a shoe factory, killing at least one person. The bombings in Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk are thought to have targeted military airports - mirroring attacks in the early days of the war. Two soldiers were killed.

Civilians in Mariupol are reported to be fighting over food and burying bodies in trenches before they pile high in the streets amid 'apocalyptic' humanitarian conditions after Russian forces laid siege to the southern port city leaving inhabitants without food, water, electricity or heat.

March 11, day 16: Russian 'death convoy' disperses around Kyiv as battle for capital begins

Russia's 40-mile 'death convoy' - which had been stuck for two weeks due to fuel and logistical issues - starts to disperse and encircle the city. Moscow's men take up firing positions and start concealing themselves in civilian areas and forests to prevent attacks.

Ukraine's territorial defence units, charged with protecting the city, were pictured digging trenches and setting up barricades, as mayor Vitali Kitschko says the capital has been turned into a 'fortress'. A psychiatric hospital and 50 schools were destroyed in shelling in the eastern city of Kharkiv but early warning systems repel an early morning attack in Dnipro.

Russian rocket attack hits mosque in Mariupol harbouring more than 85 people, mostly Turkish nationals and including 34 children. In nearby Melitopol, Moscow's men kidnap the mayor after he refused to cooperate with them.

March 13, day 18: Russia accuses Ukraine of killing civilians in attack Kyiv says is a 'false flag'

Russia accuses Ukraine of killing 23 civilians, including children, in an attack involving cluster munitions in the rebel-held Donetsk oblast in eastern Ukraine on March 14.

Kyiv hits back, denying the attack had come from them and claiming the missile was Russian - suggesting Moscow carried out the attack itself as a bloody 'false flag' attack intended to justify an attack in retaliation.

A television tower in the Rivne region in the northwest is destroyed. Explosions rang out overnight around the Russian-occupied Black Sea port of Kherson as the bombardment intensifies in Ukraine's second largest city Kharkiv hitting hospitals and civilian infrastructure.

Airstrikes in Kyiv target residential buildings and a plan factory while residents in Chernihiv lose heating in shelling. Meanwhile the death toll in Mariupol rises to 2,500 as the strategic port city remains encircled by Russian forces.

March 14, day 19: Heavy artillery fired at Odesa as Moscow's men fail to penetrate capital

Ukraine's interior minister warns that a 'huge amount' of Russian artillery was fired at Odesa on Ukraine's south coast overnight. It comes as Russian forces advance northwards from Kherson towards Kryvyi Rih in preparation for an attack on the city.

Moscow's men advance on Kyiv but fails to penetrate the capital's outskirts while their artillery carries out a sustained bombardment of the city. Putin's troops attempt to march on Kyiv from Sumy on the eastern border but are met with heavy resistance.

March 17, day 22: Lightly-armed Ukrainians fend off Russian battalion, inflicting heavy losses

Russian airstrikes pound the city of Lviv in the west of Ukraine in the early hours on March 18, as Vladimir Putin increasingly strikes close to NATO-member Poland in his bloody-minded invasion of his ex-Soviet neighbour.

Andriy Sadovyi, mayor of Lviv, said two Russian missiles launched from the Black Sea - likely by warships - had destroyed an aircraft repair facility and a bus garage close to the airport. Kyiv was also struck in the early hours.

Russian forces take control of half of Izium but fail to capture key river crossings as Ukraine's valiant fightback continues with lightly armed soldiers fending off one of Moscow's battalions and inflicting heavy losses on the invading force.

March 18, day 23: Russia claims first use of 'unstoppable' Kinzhal hypersonic missile

Russian forces continue to make steady territorial gains around Mariupol as they start targeting residential areas of the city in attacks. Meanwhile the Kremlin claims its forces have recorded the first successful use of its 'unstoppable' Kinzhal hypersonic missiles on a weapons depot in Deliatyn on March 19.

Moscow claims the nuclear capable 'Kinzhal'- or Dagger - with a range of 1,250 miles is 'unstoppable' by current Western weapons. Russia has never before admitted using the high-precision weapon in combat, and state news agency RIA Novosti said it was the first use of the Kinzhal hypersonic weapons during the conflict in Ukraine.

Ukrainian forces repel Russian operations around Kharkiv, reportedly killing a regimental commander, as Kyiv's forces launched a string of local counterattacks in the suburbs of the capital, inflicting heavy damage on Moscow's men hiding the outskirts.

Fears of a Russian amphibious assault on Odesa are relieved amid reports Moscow is parceling out elements of its reserve force that would take part in any attack from the sea to help support stalled efforts else in Ukraine.

March 20, day 25: Mariupol rejects Russian offer for surrender to allow civilians to escape

Russia has also kept up its bombardment of other Ukrainian cities today, hitting the sprawling 'Retroville' mall in Kyiv and several apartments in the capital in the early hours - reducing the former to rubble in a blast powerful it pulverised vehicles in its car park and left a massive crater, as well as bodies scattered in the carnage.

Kyiv department of the state emergency service said four people had been killed but there were reports as many as six were dead with dozens more missing in the debris. In Sumy, emergency officials said they had contained an ammonia leak at a chemical plant that contaminated wide area on the city's eastern outskirts forcing everyone within a three mile radius to evacuate.

Officials in the Black Sea port Mariupol rejected Russian demands that troops lay down their weapons and surrender in return for letting tens of thousands of civilians trapped in the heavily besieged city leave safely - saying promises of amnesty cannot be trusted and they are determined to fight 'to the last soldier'.

Meanwhile Russian troops open fire on civilian protesters in Kherson and cause multiple injuries. Moscow claims to have used its second Kinzhal hypersonic missile on a fuel depot in Kostyantynivka, central Ukraine.

March 21, day 26: Mykolaiv residents refuse to abandon their homes to stop Russian advance

Residents in Mykolaiv refuse to abandon their homes on March 25 in order to prevent the Russian advance on Odesa, where houses on the outskirts are shelled by Moscow's warships stationed in the Black Sea - though naval personnel have not yet come onshore as part of a larger assault.

Ukrainian forces repel Russian efforts to capture the besieged port city of Mariupol while Kyiv claims Moscow's men are retreating after failing to advance in the strategic suburb of Makariv, in a move which could stop Vladimir Putin's forces from surrounding the capital.

Ukrainian think tank The Centre for Defence Strategies claimed that Russian troops in the Okhtyrka region of Sumy 'left the area of operations' in order to 'choose desertion to avoid death' and in Havronshchyna, in the Makariv district, that Russians had stolen cars to drive towards the border with Belarus.

March 23, day 28: Volunteers destroy Russian tanks as Moscow warship hit in Black Sea

Ukraine destroys a huge Russian ship Orsk, a 370ft Russian Alligator-class tank carrier, as it was sitting at anchor in the captured port of Berdyansk on March 26, just days after state media filmed it unloading reinforcements in the south of the country.

A Russian tank column is destroyed by Ukrainian troops and volunteers at Voznesensk - pushing Moscow's forces back 60 miles from the strategically-important town that spans the Bug River. Attacks are also launched on the captured city of Kherson, where Russian troops are 'repositioning'.

Russian troops are also forced to reposition around Mykolaiv after coming under attack by Ukrainian forces, the Pentagon says, while heavy fighting rages in Izyum - hundreds of miles away to the northeast - as Ukraine tries to thwart attempts to surround its armies near the Donbass.

March 24, day 29: Mariupol city council evacuated as Malynivkia recaptured by Ukraine

Mariupol city council workers are evacuated and are working from outside the city as Russian forces continue to advance on the centre weeks after laying siege to the strategic southern port town. It comes as Ukrainian forces recapture Malynivka as Kyiv's soldiers focus on preventing its troops being surrounded in Donbas.

Heavy fighting is underway in Izium, where Russian troops are advancing but are yet to take full control of the eastern Ukrainian city by March 27.

Ukrainian counterattacks in Mykolaiv defeat the Russian advance on the city and push Moscow's force back towards Kherson. Similar fighting underway in Kyiv sees Ukrainians forces prevent Russian troops from surrounded the capital and repel Moscow's advances in the city's east.

March 27, day 32: 'Significant' fires break out in Chernobyl nuclear exclusion zone

Ukraine's deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk warns Russian forces are 'militarising' the exclusion zone around Chernobyl - the site of the world's worst civil nuclear accident in 1986 - saying that it is 'completely impossible' to put out 'significant fires' started in the exclusion zone on March 28.

A fire at a major oil depot started when two missiles reported within 15 minutes of each other hit Lutsk, Volyn oblast, around 10:30pm on March 27 is brought under control, local authorities confirm. Renewed shelling targets Kharkiv and Kyiv, as Russia withdraws troops from the Ukrainian capital after suffering heavy losses.

More than 160,000 civilians remains trapped in the encircled Ukrainian port city of Mariupol as heavy fighting rages in the area. Authorities scramble to organise 26 buses of civilians in an attempted evacuation.

March 28, day 33: Russian military slow activity around Chernihiv as troops retreat from Kyiv

Authorities warn that 'time is running out' for residents in Mariupol who have no food or water as heavy fighting continues in the besieged port city's streets.

The Russian military says it will reduce its activity around Chernihiv as troops are seen withdrawing from the capital, Kyiv, after sustaining heavy losses in the suburbs and failing to capture the heart of the city - but Moscow's men continue to shell Ukraine's second city Kharkiv.

Three Ukrainians are killed and 22 are wounded in Mykolaiv after a Russian missile strike hits a government building as officials streamed into the office.

March 29, day 34: Russia continues bombardment of cities despite promise to stop assault

Ukraine warns of the danger that Russian ammunition could explode at the Chernobyl nuclear plant while frequent explosions are heard 60km in Irpin, a western suburb on the outskirts of Kyiv.

Heavy street fighting in the encircled southern port city Mariupol sees Russian forces take half of the city. In Mykolaiv, a strike kills 12 people and injures 33 more, while in Khmelnitsky industrial facilities are hit with Russian rocket attacks overnight.

Rights groups claim Russia has used banned antipersonnel landmine in Ukraine's second city, Kharkiv, after Moscow's pounds nearby Chernihiv 'all night long' with air strikes, despite promising to stop the bombardment.

March 30, day 35: Red Cross hospital in Mariupol hit as Ukrainian forces regain parts of Kyiv

Russians continue to hold positions in the east and west of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, after Moscow announces a limited withdrawal from the suburbs including Irpin, which though recaptured remains disconnected from electricity and water.

Moscow's men continue to bombard Chernihiv in northern Ukraine and Mariupol in the south with strikes hitting a Red Cross warehouse in the port city, stalling efforts to evacuate civilians launched after Russia promised to scale back the offensive.

Making the promise, Russia hinted that its forces would instead focus on 'liberating' the eastern Donbas region in a potential face-saving climbdown amid Western claims that Putin's military has been devastated and 20 battalions have been wiped out.

March 31, day 36: Ukraine regains Chernobyl and attacks Sloboda, Lukashivka and Kyiv

Russian troops, who have been subjected to 'significant doses' of radiation from digging trenches in the forest of the exclusion zone, leave the heavily contaminated Chernobyl nuclear site and state energy company Energoatom regains control.

Ukrainian forces also retake villages Sloboda and Lukashivka, which are primary sites for supply routes, and start counter attacks in the suburbs of Kyiv, despite ongoing Russian missile strikes.

Moscow's men continue to pound Kharkiv, in eastern Ukraine, and Chernihiv, in the north, despite promises from the Kremlin that Russian forces would slow the bombardment. It comes as the Mayor of Mariupol Vadym Boichenko accused Russian forces of blocking vital humanitarian aid and evacuation routes.

April 2, day 38: Fighting reaches Lviv as Ukraine helicopters 'hit fuel depot in Russia'

Kyiv's Mayor Vitali Klitschko said a Russian bombardment of satellite towns near the Ukrainian capital was ongoing early on April 3 as President Zelensky warned that Moscow's men had moved towards Kharkiv in the country's east.

A Red Cross convoy was on route to the besieged port city Mariupol in another bid to evacuate civilians trapped in the city. Fighting reached Lviv after at least three Russian ballistic missiles struck the western Ukrainian city, resulting in multiple casualties.

Meanwhile Moscow hit back at Ukrainian claims, saying that two of Kyiv's helicopters had struck a fuel depot over the border in Belgorod, causing a huge fire. Ukraine denies responsibility for the attack raising fears the alleged strike could have been a false flag operation by Putin's men.

April 3, day 39: Russian forces withdraw from Kyiv's suburbs revealing war crimes in Bucha

Russian forces completely withdraw from the northern suburbs of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv on April 4, leaving evidence of war crimes in Bucha. Pictures show dead civilians shot at close range, many with their hands tied behind their backs.

Russian airstrikes hit Odessa early in the morning sending up at least three columns of black smoke with flames visible apparently in an industrial area but there were no reported casualties. Rocket strikes also hit Mykolaiv and were blamed on Moscow's men by the city's mayor.

Heavy fighting was reported in Mariupol in southern Ukraine as Russian forces keep trying to take the besieged port city where thousands of civilians have been trapped since the early days of Putin's war.

April 5, day 41: Ukrainian forces retake 'key terrain' around Kyiv as Russian forces retreat

Ukrainian forces retake 'key terrain' around the capital Kyiv on April 5, a day after Russian troops completely retreated from the area and headed north. Putin's men also continue to retreat in Chernihiv as 'low level fighting' continues in the northern region.

US intelligence claims Russian forces are withdrawing to refocus the invasion's attention on Donetsk, a separatist region of eastern Ukraine, which sees increased attacks. Nearby in Rubizhne a nitric acid tank is hit by Russian shelling and locals are warned to stay indoors.

Russian forces maintain their stranglehold on Ukraine's second city Kharkiv with a sustained shelling campaign overnight and sink a civilian ship in the besieged port city of Mariupol after hitting it in a rocket strike.

Moscow allegedly uses banned cluster munitions on civilian buildings in the encircled southern city Mykolaiv, killing at least 10 people and wounding 46 in the city centre.

April 6th, day 42: Russia 'shoots down two helicopters carrying military leaders in Mariupol'

Shells and rockets are landing regularly in the industrial city of Severodonetsk, the easternmost city held by Ukrainian forces on the eastern frontline, as Putin refocuses his brutal campaign in the Donbas after suffering major losses further west.

Russia says it has shot down two Ukrainian helicopters that were trying to evacuate leaders of the controversial nationalist Azov battalion from besieged Mariupol, adding that Kyiv's soldiers have refused an offer from Moscow to lay down their arms and leave the city 'via an agreed route'.

Mariupol city council have accused Russians of setting up mobile crematoriums to remove any evidence of potential war crimes. Officials estimate the death toll in the port city is as high as tens of thousands, and the Kremlin is now trying to 'cover their tracks' after the international condemnation to the horrific scenes of Bucha where civilian bodies were piled high and buried in mass graves, they said.

Meanwhile in Luhansk, residents have been ordered to evacuate today as a strike on a humanitarian aid distribution centre killed two and injured five. In Mykolaiv a fuel depot and factory were hit overnight in Russian shelling while Ukrainian forces retook 'key terrain' in the northern suburbs of Kyiv.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10691287/The-Ukrainian-war-maps-Graphics-Russian-forces-fared-42-day-conflict.html
