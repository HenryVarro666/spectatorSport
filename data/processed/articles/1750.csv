CNN cannot independently verify that there was any kind of chemical strike, or how many casualties were caused by any such incident.

Here's what we know:

Who reported the alleged attack? The reports emerged in a Telegram statement on Monday night from the Azov battalion, a Ukrainian unit defending Mariupol. They said Russian forces dropped ""a poisonous substance of unknown origin"" from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) onto Ukrainian military and civilians in the city.

Victims showed signs of ""respiratory failure,"" and the consequences ""were being clarified,"" the statement added.

Andriy Biletsky, Azov's first commander, said on Telegram that three individuals suffered from the effect of the unknown substance.

What did Mariupol officials say? A chemical attack has not been confirmed, Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to the mayor of Mariupol, posted on Telegram. He said city officials were awaiting additional information from military forces, and speculated that in one possible scenario, the ""discharge of an unknown chemical"" could be ""a test for the reaction in general.""

How about the Ukrainian government? President Volodymyr Zelensky did not confirm a chemical attack but warned the possibility of one should be taken seriously. In his nightly address Monday, Zelensky said Russia could be preparing a new stage of terror.

""Today, the occupiers issued a new statement, which indicates that they are preparing a new stage of terror against Ukraine and our defenders. One of the occupiers' spokesmen said that they could use chemical weapons against the defenders of Mariupol. We take this as seriously as possible,"" Zelensky said.

What was he talking about? Zelensky may have been referring to an earlier statement by a spokesperson for the militia of the pro-Russian separatists in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DNR) in eastern Ukraine.

In a Russian state television talk show, DNR spokesperson Eduard Basurin alluded to using chemical weapons to attack a Mariupol steel plant that is a stronghold for Ukrainian forces.

""Azovstal is a factory that was built during Soviet Union times,"" Basurin said. ""It is made of lot of concrete and iron. There are multilevel underground floors there, so it makes no sense to take this target by storm. Because you can lose a lot of your soldiers, and the enemy will not suffer the same losses.

""So at the moment we need to deal with blockade of this plant, find all exits and entrances — it is possible to get this done. And then turn to, I think, the chemical troops who will find a way to smoke moles out of their burrows.""

What have other countries said? The US has not confirmed the use of chemical weapons in Mariupol, but had previously warned the Ukrainians that Russia could use chemical agents in the city, State Department spokesperson Ned Price told CNN Monday.

In a statement Monday, press secretary John Kirby said The Pentagon cannot confirm the reports but US officials remain concerned about the potential Russian use of riot control agents.

Meanwhile, UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss tweeted about working ""urgently with partners"" to verify the unconfirmed reports.",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-04-12-22/h_90b112509e49989c66a0e86942f3a0f1

Kramatorsk (Ukraine) (AFP) – Russian troops were aiming to take control of the city of Mariupol on Tuesday, part of an anticipated massive onslaught across eastern Ukraine, as defending forces tried desperately to hold them back.

Russia is believed to be trying to connect occupied Crimea with Moscow-backed separatist territories Donetsk and Lugansk in Donbas, and has laid siege to the strategically located city, once home to more than 400,000 people.

Ukrainian forces were ""surrounded and blocked"", tweeted Myhaylo Podolyak, an official from President Volodymyr Zelensky's office.

But on Monday the Ukrainian army insisted that ""the defence of Mariupol continues"".

""The connection with the units of the defence forces that heroically hold the city is stable and maintained,"" the Land Forces of Ukraine wrote on Telegram.

In his nightly address, Zelensky made another plea to his allies for more weapons to boost the defence of the city.

""We are not getting as much as we need to end this war sooner. To completely destroy the enemy on our land... in particular, to unblock Mariupol,"" he said.

He made a similar appeal for military assistance to South Korea's National Assembly earlier in the day, telling lawmakers Russia had ""completely destroyed Mariupol and burned it to ashes"".

""At least tens of thousands of Mariupol citizens must have been killed,"" he added.

Chemical weapons allegations

Late Monday, Britain said it was trying to verify reports that Russia had also used chemical weapons in the city.

Western officials have previously expressed concerns that as the conflict drags into its seventh week, Russia could resort to such extreme measures.

Ukrainian lawmaker Ivanna Klympush said Russia had used an ""unknown substance"" and that people were suffering from respiratory failure.

But on messaging app Telegram, Petro Andryushchenko, an aide to the city's mayor, wrote that a chemical attack was not confirmed and that they were ""waiting for official information from the military"".

Elsewhere in the east, heavy bombardment continued as civilians were urged to flee ahead of an expected Russian troop surge in the region.

Eight people were killed by shelling in the northeastern city of Kharkiv, the head of the regional state administration Oleg Synegubov said.

""Our Armed Forces firmly hold the defensive positions of Kharkiv and the region,"" he wrote on his Telegram channel.

""That is why the Russian enemy continues to 'fight' with the civilian population due to its powerlessness.""

Russian forces are reinforcing around the Donbas region, notably near the town of Izyum, but have not yet launched a full offensive, Pentagon officials said Monday.

They reported a Russian convoy had been observed heading for Izyum, an hour's drive north of Kramatorsk, saying it appeared to be a mix of personnel-carriers, armored vehicles and possible artillery.

Ukraine's defence ministry said it believed a major assault would happen soon.

""We don't know precisely when, but the preparation is almost over,"" spokesman Oleksandr Motuzyanyk told a briefing on Monday.

- 'Logic of war' -

Such signs of a build-up in Donbas suggest hopes of an imminent diplomatic solution remain slim.

After a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday, Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said he was ""rather pessimistic"" of such efforts succeeding as Putin had ""massively entered into a logic of war"".

Ukraine's allies are trying instead to increase economic and diplomatic pressure on Moscow -- but EU foreign ministers' discussions on a sixth round of sanctions on Monday ended without a consensus.

""Nothing is off the table, including sanctions on oil and gas,"" Josep Borrell, the European Union's top diplomat, told reporters after the meeting. ""But today, no decision was taken.""

The European police agency Europol, meanwhile, said Monday it had launched an operation targeting the assets of Russian individuals and companies sanctioned over the war.

In an effort to shore up wider international support for Kyiv, US President Joe Biden held virtual talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi just weeks after saying New Delhi had been ""shaky"" in its response to the invasion.

""There were conversations about how to mitigate the destabilising impacts of Putin's war, including on food supply, where India is in a position to assist,"" a US official said.

And the UN Security Council -- which on Monday held a session on the plight of women and children in Ukraine -- will hold another meeting next week on the humanitarian situation there, in a bid to keep pressure on Russia despite its veto power over the body, diplomats said.

'Rape and sexual violence'

At Monday's UNSC meeting, officials called for an investigation into violence against women during the conflict.

""This war must stop. Now,"" Sima Bahous, director of the UN women's agency, told the meeting.

""We are increasingly hearing of rape and sexual violence. These allegations must be independently investigated to ensure justice and accountability.""

More than 4.5 million Ukrainian refugees have now fled their country, the United Nations refugee agency said -- 90 percent of them women and children.

Russian troops have been accused of widespread atrocities across the country, particularly in areas around Kyiv from which they have now withdrawn, allegations Moscow categorically denies.

Ukraine says more than 1,200 bodies have been found around the capital, with authorities pursuing ""500 suspects"" including Putin and other top Russian officials.

Seven bodies were found Monday under the rubble of two multi-storey buildings in the town of Borodianka, the state emergency service said, bringing the total to 19.

Lithuania's prime minister, who was touring the town, said she had ""no words"" to describe the devastation and accused Russia of war crimes.

""The images of the ruined Ukrainian towns and cities, and the testimonies of the survivors, reveal the real face of Russia,"" Ingrida Simonyte said.

French investigators have arrived in Ukraine to help probe suspected war crimes, and the European Union has earmarked 2.5 million euros ($2.7 million) to the International Criminal Court for future Ukraine cases.

The global consequences of the war were evident Monday as the World Trade Organization projected world trade growth could almost halve this year.

Russia was also blamed for an escalating global food crisis by the EU's Borrell, because of its bombing of wheat stocks and preventing ships from carrying grain abroad.

2,3b3ac223-c49b-421d-987e-3f9d7d4b0c1c,['Rfe Rl'],,"Russia's Defense Ministry warned on April 15 that it will intensify attacks on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, after accusing Ukraine of targeting Russian border towns.

The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making “the most important decision of their life -- to fight.”

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.”

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the major developments on Russia's invasion, how Kyiv is fighting back, the plight of civilians, and Western reaction. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.

Zelenskiy noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.”

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

The head of Ukraine’s military intelligence service said a report that Russia had used chemical weapons, while unverified, was an expected development now that Russia’s conventional offensive had stalled.

The first claimed use of an unspecified chemical agent emerged Monday from the besieged port city of Mariupol, where a unit of Ukrainian fighters said three people had suffered breathing problems after a mysterious substance was dispersed from a Russian drone. Though the symptoms were not described as severe, and no proof of the incident was offered, any use of prohibited chemical weapons would mark a significant escalation of Russia’s seven-week-old war against Ukraine.

Major-General Kyrylo Budanov said in an interview with The Globe and Mail that Russia had suffered a major “strategic failure” and that it was forced to withdraw from the territory it had captured around Kyiv and in the north of Ukraine. But he said Russian President Vladimir Putin had not abandoned his goal of trying to capture all of the country – and that Russia had already shown in Syria’s civil war, where it supports the regime of Bashar al-Assad, that it condones the use of chemical weapons.

Russia’s security services have also been accused of using banned chemical agents to poison Kremlin critics in the past, including opposition leader Alexey Navalny and former KGB agent Sergey Skripal.

Maj.-Gen. Budanov, who heads Ukraine’s GUR intelligence service, said it was impossible to confirm what had happened in Mariupol since they couldn’t access the scene of the alleged incident. But he said the world should understand that chemical weapons could become a feature of the conflict. “The question ‘has Russia or hasn’t Russia used chemical weapons?’ is still open, but if the question is ‘can it use them?’ I would reply yes because the scale of the stupidity of the Russian authorities has no limits,” Maj.-Gen. Budanov said in an interview in Kyiv. “Why is everyone debating ‘is it possible or not?’ We’ve seen several years ago that it’s possible.”

Mariupol has been surrounded since the first days of Russia’s invasion, which began on Feb. 24. Large swathes of the city have been utterly destroyed. On Tuesday, Mayor Vadym Boychenko said the latest estimate was that 21,000 residents had been killed.

Despite the prolonged siege, pockets of the city remain under Ukrainian control. On Monday, hours before the alleged chemical attack in Mariupol, Eduard Basurin, a senior official with the “Donetsk People’s Republic” – a breakaway region of Ukraine that only the Kremlin recognizes as independent – called for “chemical troops” to “smoke out” Ukrainian fighters in Mariupol’s sprawling Azovstal steel mill, part of which is below ground level.

On Tuesday, the Azov Battalion – a far-right formation that has led the defence of Mariupol – said on its official Telegram social-media channel that the three victims are in “relatively satisfactory condition” despite suffering from shortness of breath, high blood pressure and other symptoms.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States was not able to confirm whether chemical weapons had been used in Mariupol. “We’re in direct conversation with partners to try to determine what actually has happened. So this is a real concern,” he said in Washington. The global agency Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said in a statement that it was “monitoring closely the situation in Ukraine.”

Ukraine’s Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Malyar said in televised remarks that there was a “theory” that phosphorous munitions had been used in Mariupol. Phosphorus weapons are not banned outright under international law – though their use against civilian targets is prohibited.

The theatre in Mariupol is still in ruins after a March 16 airstrike in the Russian military's weeks-long effort to take the strategic city.

Maj.-Gen. Budanov said that after its withdrawal from the Kyiv region, he expects the Russian military to focus on trying to subdue Mariupol and capture Kharkiv, the largest city in eastern Ukraine – but that didn’t mean Mr. Putin had abandoned his aim of capturing the Ukrainian capital.

“They will concentrate their forces on the southeast and northeast directions, focusing their efforts on the city of Kharkiv. Is there still a threat to Kyiv and other northern regions of Ukraine? Unfortunately, this question remains,” he said.

“Russia’s aims have not changed. They were aiming to destroy the existence of this state and to conquer Ukraine – and this goal remains.”

Russia’s expectation that Ukraine would quickly capitulate appears to have been based on faulty intelligence about the strength of the Ukrainian military, as well as badly outdated ideas about the amount of support for Mr. Putin and Russia among the Ukrainian population. There have been widespread reports of a recent purge among Russia’s intelligence community that resulted in several senior officers being imprisoned.

Meanwhile, Maj.-Gen. Budanov and the GUR have bolstered their reputation by appearing prepared for every major move the Russian military has made so far in the conflict.

“Ukraine has destroyed the myth of the second strongest army in the world. Russia won’t recover from that for the next four years, from a military perspective,” said the short-haired 36-year-old, whom President Volodymyr Zelensky appointed two years ago as the GUR’s youngest intelligence chief.

Ukrainian forces have taken advantage of the situation to recapture lost territory and to stage counterattacks. On Tuesday, it appeared that Ukrainian forces may have staged a rare attack – or sabotage operation – inside Russian territory, as a rail line in the city of Belgorod was damaged by an apparent explosion.

Belgorod is a key rail hub being used by Russian troops who have been withdrawn from the Kyiv region and are being redeployed toward the front line in eastern Ukraine. Maj.-Gen. Budanov said he could “neither confirm nor deny” that the GUR had been involved in the apparent attack.

“I would like to underline that it is Russia that is carrying out acts of aggression towards Ukraine. I don’t understand why some people are surprised that some things are happening on the territory of the country that delivers that aggression.”

Russia’s pullback from the Kyiv region has allowed residents, and the world, to see the horrors inflicted by Russian forces during their month-long occupation of northern suburbs such as Bucha. Anatoliy Fedoruk, the mayor of Bucha, said Tuesday that authorities had so far found the bodies of 403 residents believed to have died as the result of Russian military actions. There have also been widespread reports of organized rape, torture and looting by Russian troops.

Speaking on Tuesday after a meeting with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, Mr. Putin said reports of atrocities committed in Bucha and other parts of Ukraine were “fake.” He described Russia’s 48-day-old war against Ukraine – which the Kremlin calls a “special military operation” – as “noble,” despite the escalating death toll and the mounting damage to the Russian economy caused by Western sanctions.

Maj.-Gen. Budanov said it was unclear whether the behaviour of Russian troops in Bucha and elsewhere had been ordered by their commanders or was the result of poor discipline. He said that while Mr. Putin was unlikely to have ordered the specific acts, the President was definitely aware of them by now. “After all, the world has been shown these things. He definitely knows. And what has he done? Has he stopped it? No, he didn’t. This proves that he is a war criminal and all his troops who are doing these things are war criminals.”

5,3b3ac223-c49b-421d-987e-3f9d7d4b0c1c,['Associated Press'],,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The mayor of the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol said Monday that more than 10,000 civilians have died in the Russian siege of his city, and that the death toll could surpass 20,000, with corpses that were “carpeted through the streets.”

Speaking by phone Monday to the Associated Press, Mayor Vadym Boychenko also said Russian forces brought mobile cremation equipment to Mariupol to dispose of the bodies, and he accused Russian forces of refusing to allow humanitarian convoys into the city in an attempt to conceal the carnage.

Russian forces have taken many bodies to a huge shopping center where there are storage facilities and refrigerators, Boychenko said. “Mobile crematoriums have arrived in the form of trucks: You open it, and there is a pipe inside and these bodies are burned,” he said.

The mayor’s comments emerged as Russia claimed that it destroyed several Ukrainian air-defense systems in what appeared to be a renewed push to gain air superiority and take out weapons Kyiv has described as crucial ahead of an expected broad new offensive in the east.

Also emerging Monday were reports that Russian forces had begun to deploy chemical weapons against Ukrainian military personnel, causing, according to social-media posts, breathing difficulty and significant headache pain in victims.

The Pentagon said it was not in a position to confirm the reports of chemical-weapons use.

In one strike to which Moscow staked a claim, Russian forces were said to have hit four S-300 launchers near the central city of Dnipro that had been provided by a European country it did not name. Slovakia gave Ukraine such a system last week but denied it had been destroyed. Russia previously claimed two strikes on similar systems in other places.

The failure to win full control of Ukraine’s skies has hampered Moscow’s ability to provide air cover for troops on the ground, limiting their advances and likely exposing them to greater losses.

With their offensive in many parts of the country thwarted, Russian forces have relied increasingly on bombarding cities — a strategy that has left many urban areas flattened and killed thousands of people.

Ukrainian authorities accuse Russian forces of committing atrocities, including a massacre in the town of Bucha, outside Kyiv, airstrikes on hospitals and a missile attack that killed at least 57 people last week at a train station.

In Bucha on Monday, the work of exhuming bodies from a mass grave in a churchyard resumed.

Galyna Feoktistova waited for hours in the cold and rain in hopes of identifying her 50-year-old son, who was shot and killed more than a month ago, but eventually she went home for some warmth. “He’s still there,” her surviving son, Andriy, said.

In Mariupol, about 120,000 civilians are in dire need of food, water, warmth and communications, the mayor said.

Only those residents who have passed the Russian “filtration camps” are released from the city, Boychenko said. He said improvised prisons were organized for those who did not pass the “filtering,” while at least 33,000 were taken to Russia or to separatist territory in Ukraine.

Meanwhile, the U.N. children’s agency said that nearly two-thirds of all Ukrainian children have fled their homes in the six weeks since Russia’s invasion began. The United Nations has verified that 142 children have been killed and 229 injured, though the actual numbers are likely much higher.

Elsewhere, Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said he met Monday with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow for talks that were “very direct, open and tough.”

In a statement released by his office, Nehammer said his primary message to Putin was “that this war needs to end, because in war both sides can only lose.”

Nehammer said he also raised the issue of war crimes committed by the Russian military and said those responsible “will be held to account.”

Austria is a member of the European Union and has backed the 27-nation bloc’s sanctions against Russia, though it so far has opposed cutting off deliveries of Russian gas. The country is militarily neutral and is not a member of NATO.

In other developments, the head of the separatist rebel government in Donetsk said Ukrainian forces have lost control of the port area of Mariupol.

“Regarding the port of Mariupol, it is now under our control,” Denis Pushilin, president of the Donetsk People’s Republic, told Russian state television, according to Russian news agencies. The claim could not immediately be confirmed.

The mayor said fighting continues. “It is difficult, but our heroic military holds on,” Boychenko said. “There are fights in the port. Yesterday, our heroic warriors knocked out several positions of equipment and, accordingly, rebuffed the infantry.

Russia has appointed a seasoned general to lead its renewed push in the eastern Donbas region, where Moscow-backed separatists have been battling Ukrainian forces since 2014 and have declared independent states.

The Pentagon’s latest assessment is that Russia is gearing up for an intensified offensive there as more troops and materiel move toward the area.

A senior U.S. defense official said a lengthy convoy is headed toward the eastern city of Izyum with artillery, aviation and infantry support.

More artillery is being deployed near the city of Donetsk, while ground combat units that withdrew from around the Kyiv and Chernihiv areas appear destined for refitting and resupplying before they position in Donbas, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal U.S. military assessments.

Both sides are digging in for what could be a devastating war of attrition.

Russian forces will likely try to encircle the Donbas region from the north and the south as well as the east, said retired British Gen. Richard Barrons, co-chair of the U.K.-based strategic consulting firm Universal Defence & Security Solutions.

The ground in that part of Ukraine is flatter, more open and less wooded — so the Ukrainian ambush tactics used around Kiev may be less successful, Barrons said.

“As to the outcome, it’s finely balanced right now,” Barrons said. If the Russians learned from their previous failures, concentrated more force, connected their air force to ground forces better and improved their logistics, “then they might start to overwhelm the Ukrainian positions eventually, although I still think it would be a battle of enormous attrition.”

In a video address to South Korean lawmakers on Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky specifically requested equipment that can shoot down Russian missiles.

But those armaments could increasingly come under attack as Russia looks to shift the balance in the 6-week-old war.

Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said the military used cruise missiles to destroy the four launchers Sunday on the southern outskirts of Dnipro. He said the military also hit such systems in the Mykolaiv and Kharkiv regions.

The Russian claims could not be independently verified.

The Pentagon said it had seen no evidence to support Russia’s claims. And Lubica Janikova, spokeswoman for Slovakia’s prime minister, denied Monday that the S-300 system it sent Ukraine had been destroyed. She said any other claim is not true.

Questions remain about the ability of depleted and demoralized Russian forces to conquer much ground after their advance on Kyiv was repelled by determined Ukrainian defenders.

Britain’s Defense Ministry said Monday that Ukraine has already beaten back several assaults by Russian forces in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions — which make up the Donbas — resulting in the destruction of Russian tanks, vehicles and artillery.

Western military analysts say Russia’s assault increasingly is focusing on an arc of territory stretching from Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, in the north, to Kherson in the south.

A residential area in Kharkiv was struck by incoming fire on Monday afternoon. Associated Press journalists saw firefighters putting out the fire and checking for victims following the attack, and saw that at least five people were killed, including a child.

The world’s chemical weapons watchdog has said it was “concerned” about reports of the use of chemical weapons in the besieged Ukrainian port of Mariupol.

Reports first emerged late on Monday from Ukraine’s Azov battalion that a Russian drone had dropped a “poisonous substance” on troops and civilians in Mariupol.

“The Technical Secretariat of the OPCW is monitoring closely the situation in Ukraine. The Secretariat is concerned by the recent unconfirmed report of chemical weapons use in Mariupol, which has been carried in the media over the past 24 hours,” the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said in a statement.

“All 193 OPCW Member States, including the Russian Federation and Ukraine, are parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention, an international treaty of major importance in the field of disarmament that has been in force since 1997.”

The statement added that use of chemical weapons anywhere under any circumstances was “reprehensible and wholly contrary to the legal norms established by the international community against such use”.

Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Malyar said the government was checking unverified information that Russia may have used chemical weapons while besieging Mariupol.

In Washington, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken also addressed the reports coming from Mariupol.

“We’re not in a position to confirm anything, I don’t think Ukrainians are either,” Blinken told reporters.

“But let me say that we had credible information that Russian forces may use a variety of riot control agents, including tear gas mixed with chemical agents, that would cause stronger symptoms to weaken, incapacitate … Ukrainian fighters and civilians, as part of the aggressive campaign [in Mariupol].”

“We share that information with … Ukraine and other partners,” Blinken said. “And we’re in direct conversation with partners to try to determine what actually is happening.”

US President Joe Biden warned last month of a “real threat” Russia may use chemical weapons in Ukraine, repeating earlier allegations from the White House.

The UK’s armed forces minister James Heappey told British broadcaster Sky News that if evidence of chemical weapons use emerges, “all options are on the table” as a response.

“There are some things that are beyond the pale, and the use of chemical weapons will get a response,” he says.

The last time chemical weapons were unleashed during a conflict was in Syria where a civil war erupted in 2011 as rebels sought to depose President Bashar al-Assad.

Syria only publicly admitted in 2012 that it possessed chemical weapons after pressure from Russia.

Taking over Mariupol

The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said in a post on Facebook that it was “likely” that Russian troops would soon move to try and seize full control of Mariupol.

It added that Ukrainian forces had repelled six “enemy attacks” in the country’s eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, known collectively as Donbas, where Moscow is expected to launch a new offensive soon.

Four Russian tanks, a plane, two helicopters and several other vehicles were reportedly destroyed during the fighting.

The mayor of Bucha reveals authorities in the Ukrainian town have found 403 bodies of people they believe were killed by Russian forces.

Ukraine says Russia is likely to try and capture the besieged port city of Mariupol as fears rise over an expected offensive on the eastern Donbas region.

We know that there are so-called ‘concentration places’ where they hide bodies and they then plan to destroy the evidence of tortures they committed in the city of Mariupol. We call it ‘genocide’, we call it ‘war crime’.”

What did Putin say?

Putin has spoken extensively on the conflict in Ukraine at a joint news conference with Lukashenko. Here are some of his claims:

Western sanctions imposed on Moscow in a bid to make it change course have failed, the Russian president said, adding the “blitzkrieg on which our foes were counting on did not work”.

He blamed Ukraine’s “inconsistency” for derailing talks between the two sides, suggesting the discussions had reached “a dead end”.

Putin also said Ukrainian allegations that Russian servicemen killed civilians in Bucha were false.

In a bleak comparison, he said the Bucha allegations evoked what he called staged chemical weapons attacks in Syria aimed at incriminating the country’s leader, Bashar al-Assad.

Ukraine says it thwarted Russian cyberattack on power grid

Ukrainian officials have accused Russian hackers of attempting to launch a destructive cyberattack on the country’s electricity grid.

The group, dubbed “Sandworm” by security researchers and previously tied to destructive cyberattacks attributed to Russia, deployed destructive and data-wiping malware on computers controlling high voltage substations in Ukraine, the Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) said in a statement on its website.

“The victim organisation suffered two waves of attacks. The initial compromise took place no later than February 2022. The disconnection of electrical substations and the decommissioning of the company’s infrastructure was scheduled for Friday evening, April 8, 2022,” the CERT-UA statement said.

Officials managed to prevent the attack from taking place, it added. The statement did not say which Ukrainian energy provider was targeted. Russia has consistently denied accusations it has launched cyberattacks on Ukraine.

“We want to prosecute these war criminals in our Ukrainian courts, named by Ukraine,” Venediktova told CNN.

Pentagon ‘concerned’ about reports Russia used chemical weapons in Mariupol

The Pentagon says reports of Russia’s use of chemical weapons in Mariupol are “if true, deeply concerning” and reflect the concerns it has had about Russia’s potential to use “riot control agents, including tear gas mixed chemical agents in Ukraine”.

The statement, posted by a senior Pentagon reporter on Twitter, says the defence department cannot confirm these allegations but will continue to closely monitor the situation.

Zelenskyy meets Dutch PM Rutte

Ukraine’s president says he spoke to the prime minister of the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, on Monday about punishing those guilty of war crimes and discussed “cooperation in the energy sphere” with the Prime Minister of Norway.

But Zelenskyy added that his main objective is “a concrete increase in our ability to repel any attacks by Russian troops”.

“Unfortunately, we are not getting as much as we need to end this war sooner,” he said in a speech to the nation. “If we got jets and enough heavy armoured vehicles, the necessary artillery, we would be able to do it.”

Biden tells Modi more Russian oil imports not in India’s interest

US President Joe Biden has held a “constructive, direct conversation” with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the White House said. The US is seeking more help from India to apply economic pressure on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.

In a news briefing on Monday afternoon, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Biden told Modi his administration could help India diversify its oil imports – but that it was not in New Delhi’s interests to increase energy imports from Moscow.

The Biden administration already made it clear it does not want to see a significant uptick in Russian energy imports by India, which has purchased at least 13 million barrels of discounted Russian crude since the country invaded Ukraine in late February.

‘Our area is one of the most contaminated by mines in the world’: Zelenskyy

Zelenskyy has said “Russian troops left behind tens if not hundreds of thousands of dangerous objects”.

“These are shells that did not explode, mines, tripwire mines. At least several thousand such items are disposed of daily,” Zelenskyy said in his nighttime address.

“In the houses they seized, just on the streets, in the fields, they mined people’s property, mined cars, doors. They consciously did everything to make the return to these areas after de-occupation as dangerous as possible. Due to the actions of the Russian army, our territory is currently one of the most contaminated by mines in the world.”

Rape and sexual violence are rising concerns, UN Women chief says

Sima Bahous, the executive director of UN Women, has said her agency is increasingly hearing reports of rape and sexual violence in Ukraine. She said the risk of human trafficking, especially of young women and unaccompanied teenagers, is also a rising concern.

“The combination of mass displacement with the large presence of conscripts and mercenaries, and the brutality displayed against Ukrainian civilians, has raised all red flags,” Bahous told the UN Security Council.

Russia’s deputy UN ambassador denied the allegations and accused Ukraine and allies of “a clear intention to present Russian soldiers as sadists and rapists.”

No confirmation of chemical attack in Mariupol

Petro Andryushchenko, an aide to the mayor of Mariupol, wrote on Telegram that reports of a chemical attack in the city had not been confirmed. He added that he expected to provide details and clarifications later.

Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby earlier said the US was aware of the reports but could not confirm them.

“These reports, if true, are deeply concerning and reflective of concerns that we have had about Russia’s potential to use a variety of riot control agents, including tear gas mixed with chemical agents, in Ukraine,” Kirby told reporters.

IMF sets up administered account to allow donors to fund Ukraine

Ukraine’s finance ministry has welcomed the creation of a special new account set up by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to give bilateral donors and international organisations a secure way to send financial resources to Ukraine.

The IMF’s executive board approved the creation of the new account after the Canadian government proposed disbursing up to 1 billion Canadian dollars ($790,000) through the vehicle, which is to be administered by the IMF.

“Donors will benefit from the IMF’s tested infrastructure to quickly deliver authenticated payments,” the IMF said.

Experts on missing people heading to Ukraine next week

International experts will travel to Ukraine next week to help authorities investigate reports of people who have gone missing during the war, the head of the International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP) has said.

“It’s not going to be easy,” Kathryne Bomberger, the group’s director-general, told Al Jazeera, explaining that the ICMP team was invited by Ukraine’s government. Among other tasks, Bomberger said the experts would try to see whether it is possible to identify remains and would work with families that have reported missing loved ones.

“Evidence will be collected. Hopefully, that evidence can be provided to the [International Criminal Court] or other courts that will be conducting investigations into what’s happened and be used for criminal trial purposes,” she said.

Ukrainian authorities in Kharkiv begin clearing landmines

Ukrainian authorities in the northeastern city of Kharkiv have warned people not to go near what they said were landmines being dropped on the city.

Lieutenant Colonel Nikolay Ovcharuk, head of the demining unit of the state emergency service, said the devices were plastic PTM-1M mines, which detonate using timers and were widely used by Soviet forces in Afghanistan.

“They have self-destructing timers,” he said as loudspeakers warned people not to approach the cordoned-off area where mine disposal teams were working.

Ukrainian children in need of protection: UNICEF chief

The UN children’s agency says nearly two-thirds of all Ukrainian children have fled their homes in the six weeks since Russia’s invasion began.

Manuel Fontaine, UNICEF’s emergency programmes director, who visited Ukraine last week, said that of the 3.2 million children estimated to have remained in their homes, “nearly half may be at risk of not having enough food”.

He said the situation is worse in cities like Mariupol and Kherson in the south, which have been besieged by Russian forces and where children and their families have spent weeks without running water, sanitation or a regular supply of food.

Rape being used as a weapon of war: Ukraine rights group

Kateryna Cherepakha, president of Ukrainian rights group La Strada-Ukraine, has accused Russian troops of using rape as a weapon of war.

“This is just the tip of the iceberg,” she told the UN’s Security Council via video. “We know and see – and we want you to hear our voices – that violence and rape is used now as a weapon of war by Russian invaders in Ukraine.”

She said her organisation’s emergency hotlines had received calls accusing Russian soldiers of nine cases of rape involving 12 women and girls. Russia has repeatedly denied attacking civilians.

US official says vaccinations in Ukraine have come to a ‘sudden halt’

COVID-19 vaccinations in Ukraine have come to a “sudden halt” amid the Russian assault, US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield said.

“Russia’s unprovoked, brutal invasion has meant that COVID-19 vaccine distribution and routine immunisations have come to a sudden halt,” Thomas-Greenfield told the UN Security Council.

“Since the start of the war, COVID-19 vaccinations have plummeted from more than 52,000 a day to less than a thousand a day,” she said.

Kyiv accuses Moscow of holding civilians in prisons on Russian territory

Ukraine’s deputy prime minister has accused Russia of holding civilians, including journalists, activists and elected officials, in prisons on Russian territory.

“We have many priests, journalists, activists, mayors, and in general civilians who are in prisons, not, for example, even on the territory of Ukraine, but in [the] Kursk, Bryansk, Rostov [regions of Russia],” Vereshchuk said in televised comments. “They are forcibly held.”

Russia has repeatedly denied targeting civilians.

Mariupol mayor: More than 10,000 civilians have died in besieged city

The mayor of Mariupol says more than 10,000 civilians have died in the besieged Ukrainian port city since the start of the Russian invasion.

Boychenko told The Associated Press that corpses were “carpeted through the streets of our city” and that the death toll could be more than 20,000.

Nearly seven weeks into the war, Russian forces, whose campaign has been marked by strategic stumbles, appeared poised to achieve a major objective: capturing the port city of Mariupol. A Ukrainian marine brigade that described itself as among the last holdouts posted on Facebook that the unit had suffered a “mountain of wounded” and was running out of ammunition.

“For some, death, and for some, captivity,” said the post, which criticized Ukrainian military higher-ups for not providing more weaponry and resources for the fight.

Hours earlier, Zelensky said the city, the scene of one of the war’s most sustained and savage Russian offensives, had been “destroyed” and that tens of thousands of its residents were dead.

Later, Zelensky said in a virtual address to the Ukrainian people that he took seriously concerns that Russians could deploy chemical weapons in Mariupol. He urged Western leaders to impose a tougher package of sanctions, one that included an oil embargo against Russia.

“It is time,” he said, “to make this package such that even a word about weapons of mass destruction is no longer heard from the Russian side.”

Amid the carnage and rising atrocities in Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin held his first face-to-face talks since the Feb. 24 invasion with a European leader, Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer. Nehammer was criticized in some quarters for handing the Kremlin a potential propaganda opportunity, but said afterward he had delivered a tough message to Putin that the war must end and Russian troops responsible for war crimes “would be held to account.”

In a news conference after his meeting with Putin, Nehammer said he was not optimistic. It was clear, he said, that Russian forces were preparing for a major offensive in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region.

“The battle being threatened cannot be underestimated in its violence,” he said.

Austria is a member of the 27-nation European Union, which has imposed stringent sanctions against Russia, but is militarily neutral and not a member of NATO — a status that in the past has allowed it to maintain closer links with Moscow. Nehammer, who met over the weekend with Zelensky, has demanded a war-crimes investigation against Russia, which denies its troops have committed atrocities against civilians.

European leaders, meanwhile, signaled that more sanctions against Moscow may be in the works. But the bloc is running out of ways to try to force Putin to break off the biggest ground war in Europe in decades, which has triggered the continent’s largest refugee crisis since World War II.

More than 4.5 million Ukrainians have fled the country, according to the latest United Nations figures, and about another 7 million are internally displaced. Nearly two-thirds of all Ukrainian children have fled their homes, the United Nations Children’s Fund said Monday.

“In my 31 years as a humanitarian, I have rarely seen so much damage caused in so little time,” Manuel Fontaine, director of UNICEF’s office of emergency programs, told the U.N. Security Council.

Sanctions “are always on the table,” the European Union’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, told reporters as he headed into a meeting Monday with the bloc’s foreign ministers in Luxembourg.

The United States, for its part, was stepping up diplomatic efforts to bring more countries into the anti-Russia coalition. President Biden held a virtual meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. India is a U.S. ally, but has not imposed any sanctions against Russia. Among a four-nation group of allies known colloquially as the Quad — the U.S., Japan, Australia and India — Biden has previously described India as the only “somewhat shaky” country regarding Ukraine.

A senior Pentagon official said Monday that a long convoy of Russian military vehicles rolling toward the eastern city of Izyum with artillery, aviation and infantry support would reinforce and resupply their forces in the Donbas region. But the Russian effort to reinforce their capabilities, the official said, did not necessarily represent the beginning of a new Russian offensive in the region. Further south, the Russians were beginning to reinforce some of their positions southwest of Donetsk with artillery units.

With a new phase of the war considered all but certain, Ukrainian civilians continued to try to escape from what is expected to become the next main battleground, the country’s eastern industrial heartland and its southern seacoasts.

Even with nearly another 3,000 people fleeing those areas on Sunday, according to Ukrainian officials, the pace of the exodus has been slowed by fear of more attacks like the one on a railway station last week in the eastern city of Kramatorsk, which killed at least 57 people, including five children.

After the rocket strike on the railway station, the evacuation of the Donetsk region will be carried out from the neighboring towns of Sloviansk and Povrovsk, said Oleksandr Honcharenko, the mayor of Kramatorsk. About 160,000 residents had already fled his city, he said, and about 45,000 remain, most of whom had endured the hostilities in 2014 and would probably remain if there is no heavy shelling.

Honcharenko emphasized that any resident who wanted to get out of the city could leave.

“The experience of other cities, such as Mariupol and Chernihiv, shows that the occupants are trying to use residents as hostages for their hostilities,” he said. “Therefore, the task of the city authorities, every mayor, is to keep the number of people, especially women and children, in the cities as small as possible.”

Zelensky’s account of death and destruction in Mariupol came in a video-link speech to South Korea’s parliament — the latest in a series of virtual addresses to lawmakers around the world to drum up support and plead for more weaponry for his beleaguered country.

Since the start of the war, Moscow’s forces have sought to capture Mariupol to establish a land corridor between Russian-controlled areas of the east and the Crimean peninsula, which Russia seized eight years ago.

On Monday, the head of the separatist rebel government in Donetsk said Ukrainian forces had suffered significant defeats in Mariupol.

“The port of Mariupol, it is already under our control,” Denis Pushilin, president of the Donetsk People’s Republic, told Russian state television, according to Russian news outlets. His claim could not immediately be verified.

Mariupol’s mayor, Vadym Boychenko, said in an interview with the Associated Press that more than 10,000 civilians had died in his city and the death toll could exceed 20,000. Russian forces, he said, were attempting to conceal war crimes by bringing in mobile cremation equipment to dispose of the bodies.

“Mobile crematoriums have arrived in the form of trucks: You open it, and there is a pipe inside and these bodies are burned,” he said.

Analysts at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War noted in a report Sunday that Russian forces had made significant territorial gains in Mariupol, bisecting the besieged city from the city center to the coast and isolating the remaining Ukrainian troops in the Azovstal steel plant in the east and the main port of Mariupol in the southwest.

A British military intelligence assessment on Monday warned that Russia might resort to the use of phosphorus weapons in its bid to finally secure control of the city, and said civilians in many areas were imperiled by the invaders’ use of indiscriminate firepower.

“Russia’s continued reliance on unguided bombs decreases their ability to discriminate when targeting and conducting strikes, while greatly increasing the risk of further civilian casualties,” the assessment said.

Claims on social media and elsewhere that chemical weapons or an unknown substance had been deployed by Russian troops could not be independently verified and were not referenced by Zelensky in his speech Monday.

John F. Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman, said the U.S. was aware of the social media reports involving potential chemical munitions in Mariupol but could not confirm them. The U.S. would “continue to monitor the situation closely,” Kirby said.

Artillery strikes rocked several eastern cities early Monday. Air-raid sirens also wailed in the southern city of Mykolaiv, near the Black Sea, where a massive blast reverberated late Sunday. The regional governor, Vitaliy Kim, said in a video posted Monday that it was a missile strike that caused no deaths.

In his overnight video address, Zelensky said Russia was trying to evade responsibility for war crimes such as the reign of terror visited on areas outside Kyiv during a monthlong occupation before abandoning the bid to swiftly seize the capital city and topple the Ukrainian government.

Investigators and Ukrainian forces have been in satellite towns outside Kyiv, recovering bodies of civilians, many killed execution-style and thrown into mass graves. Forensic specialists from France arrived Monday to help with the preservation of evidence. Ukrainian officials say the count of fatalities in those outlying areas has surpassed 1,200.

“We are doing everything we can to bring to justice every bastard who came to our land under the Russian flag and killed our people, who tortured our people, destroyed our cities, looted and tormented,” Zelensky said.

He added that the coming week will be as “tense” as any in the course of the war, as Russian forces prepare to stage “even larger operations in the east of our state.”

In laying groundwork for that offensive, Russian missiles strikes destroyed the central city of Dnipro’s airport in a missile strike Sunday, Ukrainian officials acknowledged. But Ukrainian forces have also repulsed several assaults in eastern regions, “resulting in the destruction of Russian tanks, vehicles and artillery equipment,” the British military assessment said.

Col. Oleksandr Motuzyanyk, spokesman for Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense, said at a Monday briefing that Ukrainian troops had repulsed seven Russian attacks in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions in the last 24 hours.

“The enemy is finalizing the restoring of its units and redeploying them to the territory of Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts,” Motuzyanyk said. “We predict that active combat operations will begin anytime soon. The Ukrainian army is ready for it.”

Russian forces also kept up unrelenting strikes near the seaport of Mariupol and the northeastern city of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest. Kharkiv’s regional governor, Oleh Sinegubov, wrote on Facebook that eight people, including a 13-year-old child, died in bombardment on Monday and 19 people were injured.

“These are military crimes against peaceful Ukrainians who will never forgive Russians!” Sinegubov wrote.

Fears over the fate of Ukrainian civilians were heightened with word over the weekend that Russia has appointed a military chief known for atrocities in Syria to oversee the Kremlin’s war effort. The appointment of Gen. Alexander Dvornikov, Western officials say, suggests that the deliberate targeting of civilians, a hallmark of Russia’s war strategy, is likely to continue.

Adding to the sense of menace, the notorious Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, who has been leading fighters in Ukraine from his Russian republic, declared Monday that he was a loyal “foot soldier” to Putin and suggested that Ukrainian cities faced devastation if resistance to the Russian assault continues.

“Don’t let Kyiv be destroyed, Kharkiv and other cities,” Kadyrov, who has been sanctioned for human rights abuses, wrote in a Telegram post that also mentioned Mariupol, Luhansk and Donetsk.

Russia’s military setbacks since the start of the invasion have been plainly visible, but more details are emerging about the nature of its losses. The British Broadcasting Corp. reported more than 20% of the military personnel confirmed dead and identified by name were officers, including specialists like fighter pilots and veteran commanders.

The latest: The weeks-long resistance in besieged Mariupol appeared to be cracking as Russian forces moved closer to capturing the seaside port city in southeastern Ukraine, with a Russian-imposed deadline for Ukrainian forces in the city to surrender passing early Sunday local time. Meanwhile, officials in the capital Kyiv and the western city of Lviv reported explosions Saturday. Moscow has withdrawn its forces from those regions to focus on eastern Ukraine, but airstrikes have continued.

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.
