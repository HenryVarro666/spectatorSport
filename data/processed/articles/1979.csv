EU support to people fleeing the war

EU leaders stated that the EU and its member states will continue to provide coordinated political, financial, material and humanitarian support to Ukraine and its people.

The European Council pays tribute to all the citizens, organisations and governments across Europe who have shown solidarity to those fleeing this atrocious war. European Council

EU leaders recognised all the efforts already made to welcome refugees fleeing the war against Ukraine, and called on all member states to intensify their efforts in a continued spirit of unity and solidarity.

The European Council stated that this crisis represents a significant challenge for the infrastructure and public services of the EU countries hosting refugees, particularly for the member states bordering Ukraine.

In this regard, EU leaders called for:

an intensification of member states’ efforts in a continued spirit of unity and solidarity

a rapid mobilisation of the EU funding for refugees and their hosts

for refugees and their hosts the development by member states of contingency plans

EU leaders further stated that particular attention should be paid to the needs of the most vulnerable and measures to prevent and detect human trafficking.

They also reaffirmed the commitment to stand by the Republic of Moldova and its people.

Energy and nuclear facilities

EU leaders welcomed the recent synchronisation of the Ukrainian and Moldovan electricity grids with the EU grid.

They also stated that the safety of Ukrainian nuclear facilities must be ensured, including with the support of the International Atomic Energy Agency.​

Reconstruction of a democratic Ukraine

The European Council stressed that the EU is committed to providing support to the Ukrainian government for its immediate needs and for the reconstruction of a democratic Ukraine, once the Russian onslaught has ceased.

To that end, EU leaders agreed to set up a Ukraine Solidarity Trust Fund and also called for:

preparations to start without delay

an international conference to raise funding

The European Council called on the Commission to continue to provide technical assistance to help Ukraine implement the necessary reforms.

EU leaders also acknowledged the European aspirations and the European choice of Ukraine, as stated in the Association Agreement. The European Council reiterated its invitation to the Commission to submit its opinion in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Treaties.

Security and defence

The European Council held a strategic debate on security and defence, building on the Versailles declaration and taking into account the new security situation in Europe.

Strategic Compass

The European Council endorsed the Strategic Compass, which provides guidance for the next decade and defines a coherent set of actions that will help secure EU interests and protect European citizens by:

enabling the EU to act more quickly and decisively when facing crises

strengthening capacity to anticipate and mitigate threats

stimulating investments and innovation for developing capabilities and technologies

deepening cooperation with partners to achieve common goals

EU leaders invited the Council to start implementing the Strategic Compass in accordance with the timetable therein.

Funding and investments

The European Council stated that it is awaiting an analysis of defence investment gaps and proposals on further initiatives needed to strengthen the European defence industrial and technological base.

This analysis, to be developed by the European Commission in coordination with the European Defence Agency, will feed into efforts to strengthen EU resilience and increase its security and defence capacity through more and better investments.

EU leaders also called for harnessing the full potential of existing EU funding instruments and initiatives, in particular the:

European Defence Fund

Permanent Structured Cooperation

Capability Development Plan

Coordinated Annual Review on Defence

In addition, the European Council stated that measures should be taken by the end of 2022 to promote and facilitate access to private funding for the defence industry, including through possibilities offered by the European Investment Bank.

Energy

The European Council addressed the impact of increased energy prices and discussed possible options to mitigate it, based on the proposals presented by the Commission on 23 March.

As set out in the Versailles Declaration of 10-11 March, EU leaders agreed to phase out dependency on Russian gas, oil and coal imports as soon as possible. EU leaders look forward to the comprehensive and ambitious plan, elaborated in close coordination with member states, which the Commission will submit by the end of May 2022, and which will take into account national circumstances and member states' energy mixes.

Sustained high energy prices are having an increasingly negative impact on citizens and businesses, which is further compounded by the Russian military aggression against Ukraine.

Measures

To provide further relief to the most vulnerable consumers and support European businesses in the short term, the European Council invited member states and the Commission to continue to make best use of the energy prices toolbox and the state aid temporary crisis framework, as a time-limited departure from the status quo. As proposed by the Commission, temporary taxation of windfall profits can be a useful source of national financing.

Leaders tasked the Council and the Commission, as a matter of urgency, to reach out to the energy stakeholders, and to discuss, if and how, the concrete short-term options presented by the Commission would contribute to reducing the gas price and address its contagion effect on electricity markets.

They also called on the Commission to submit proposals to effectively address excessive electricity prices, while:

preserving the integrity of the single market

maintaining incentives for the green transition

preserving the security of supply

avoiding disproportionate budgetary costs

Gas storage

The European Council reviewed the EU’s immediate term preparedness and tasked the Council with taking forward the proposal by the Commission on EU gas storage policy considering the refilling of gas storage across the Union as soon as possible. With a view to next winter, member states and the Commission will urgently:

work on ensuring the security of supplies for all member states

establish the necessary solidarity and compensation mechanisms

work together on voluntary common purchase of gas, LNG and hydrogen

complete and improve interconnections in the EU

The leaders also stated that the common purchases platform will also be open to Western Balkan countries and the three associated Eastern Partners.

Energy security

Energy security and climate neutrality can only be achieved if the EU relies on a robust and fully interconnected internal electricity market and a well-functioning carbon market.

The European Council discussed how to take forward work on monitoring and optimising their functioning. It invited the Commission to take any necessary initiatives by May 2022, also taking into account the upcoming final reports from the EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).

The European Union will continue to coordinate with international partners in order to mitigate the increase of energy prices.

Economic issues

Reducing strategic dependencies

EU leaders called for work to be taken forward on building a more robust economic base, notably by pursuing a robust trade policy, fostering investment, and reducing strategic dependencies in key sectors such as critical raw materials, semi-conductors, health, digital and food.

EU leaders also reaffirmed the importance of realising the full potential of the single market. To that end, they called for measures such as:

strictly implementing and enforcing the single market rules

implementing the industrial strategy and the SME strategy

and the closely monitoring and preventing bottlenecks

preventing administrative burdens

sustaining the EU's capacity as an international standard setter

Annual Sustainable Growth Survey

EU leaders endorsed the policy priorities of the Annual Sustainable Growth Survey and invited member states to reflect them in their National Reform Programmes and Stability and Convergence Programmes.

Leaders also endorsed the draft Council Recommendation on the economic policy of the euro area.

Global food security

EU leaders invited the Commission, in coordination with international partners, to prioritise work on global food security and affordability, particularly by supporting food security and agriculture in Ukraine and vulnerable third countries.

COVID-19

The European Council reviewed coordination efforts in response to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as progress on international cooperation on global health governance and solidarity. In this respect, EU leaders discussed improved roll-out of vaccines and a future pandemic instrument to strengthen pandemic prevention, preparedness and response.

They also welcomed the progress made concerning the issue of intellectual property rights in the World Trade Organization.

External relations

China

The European Council prepared the EU-China summit that will take place on 1 April 2022. It exchanged views on relations with China in the new global context, in particular the Russian military aggression against Ukraine.

Bosnia and Herzegovina

The European Council discussed the prolonged political crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina and reiterated its commitment to the European perspective of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Western Balkans.
