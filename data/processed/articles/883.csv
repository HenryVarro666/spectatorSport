The Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs, Jose Manuel Albares, said that the country has decided to make such a decision and expel the Russian diplomats and staff members as they represent a threat to the country’s interests, SchengenVisaInfo.com reports.

The Minister revealed that currently, they are planning to expel a group of around 25 persons. However, it has been noted that the list is still being completed, meaning that new additions can be made.

Spain’s announcement regarding the expulsion of these individuals follows similar moves made by other European countries.

Germany, France, and Lithuania are three of the countries that have already decided to take measures against the Russian diplomats.

Germany has expelled 40 Russian embassy staff until now. The news was confirmed by the German Minister of Foreign Affairs, Annalena Baerbock. She said that the German government decided to “declare undesirable a significant number of members of the Russian embassy who have worked here in Germany every day against our freedom, against the cohesion of our society.”

According to her, such a decision has been taken as the Russian diplomats in the country present a threat to more than 300,000 Ukrainian nationals who are seeking international protection in Germany.

In addition, Baerbock emphasised that Germany would enhance the existing sanctions against Russia and would increase the support for Ukrainian armed forces.

Moscow called the decision of Germany ‘unfriendly’ while at the same time warned that such actions would worsen the relations between the two countries.

The French authorities have also announced the expulsion of several Russian diplomatic personnel. A spokesperson of the French Foreign Ministry said that the government decided to take such a decision as the activities of the now expelled Russian personnel do not align with the security interests of France.

“France decided this evening to expel a number of Russian personnel with diplomatic status stationed in France whose activities are against our security interests,” the French Ministry of Interior said.

Following the example of the other countries, Lithuania also decided to take similar measures. The Lithuanian government announced that it had dismissed the Russian ambassador and warned that the country would also soon close the Russian embassy.

The Russian representatives have denied the accusations. They said that the mass killings in Bucha could have been staged.",https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/news/spain-to-declare-non-grata-25-russian-diplomats-after-massacre-in-ukrainian-town/

“The unbearable images we have seen of the massacre of civilians in the town of Bucha after the withdrawal of the Russian army deeply outrage us,” Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said in a reference to a town outside Kyiv.



The Russian diplomats and staff “represent a threat to the interest of the country” and they will be expelled “immediately,” he told a news conference following a weekly cabinet meeting.

“We are talking about a group of around 25 people, we are completing the list,” he said.



Horrific images of corpses lying in the streets in the town of Bucha, some with their hands bound behind them, following the Russian withdrawal have drawn international condemnation of Russia, and the EU is considering additional sanctions.



Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused Russian troops of being behind the killings but the Kremlin has denied any responsibility and suggested images of corpses were “fakes.”



On Monday, France expelled 35 Russian diplomats, and Germany announced it had expelled a “significant number” of Russian envoys.



Denmark said Tuesday it is expelling 15 Russian “intelligence officers” registered as diplomats in the country.

The diplomats and staff are believed to pose a security risk to Spain

The Spanish government has granted a period of one week to the 25 diplomats and staff of the Russian embassy in Madrid to leave the country after the slaughter of innocent civilians in Bucha, Ukraine.

The Minister of Foreign Affairs, José Manuel Albares, announced the expulsion of the Russian citizens on Wednesday April 6, claiming that they “represent a threat to the security” of Spain.

However, the list of the expelled is still being finalised and so the Minister has advised that “perhaps a few more” will be added in the coming days.

On Tuesday, Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares announced the decision to expel Russian diplomats, citing 'a threat to the interests and security of the country'. The move comes in response to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, which has now escalated for 41 days with no peace agreement still in reach.

Jose Manuel Albares, after the weekly cabinet meeting, said, ""We have decided to expel Russian diplomats and staff from the Russian embassy in Spain who represent a threat to the interests and security of our country."" He added that the expulsions were in response to ""the terrible actions carried out in the past days in Ukraine, especially in Bucha and the ones reported today from Mariupol.""

The Spanish Foreign Minister referred to the Bucha genocide recently when the Ukrainian government discovered the mass graves and civilian killings in Bucha. Jose Manuel added, ""The crimes cannot remain unpunished.""

Spain has joined other European Union countries like Germany and France and several Western countries who have earlier in the day announced similar directives. Several other governments have probed investigation into the war crimes, while other nations are trying to impose strict sanctions on Russia.

Bucha genocide

On Sunday, April 3, the Ukrainian Defence Ministry said that they have found 410 bodies of slain Ukrainians in Bucha, Irpin and other towns and villages during the first two days since Russia initiated attacks in these regions. The Defence Ministry added that the exact number of victims of Russian armed forces ""will be much higher"".

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, on Sunday, April 3, released the images of horrors caused by retreating Russian armed forces in Bucha city. In a tweet, the Ukrainian FM said, ""Bucha massacre proves that Russian hatred towards Ukrainians is beyond anything Europe has seen since WWII.""

Several leaders from Europe have condemned the Vladimir Putin-led country's action and called for an investigation. On Monday, April 4, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for an independent inquiry into the civilian killings in the Ukrainian city of Bucha. Taking to Twitter, the UN chief said that he was ""deeply shocked"" by the visuals of civilian deaths in Bucha. Guterres also called for ""effective accountability"" for those involved in the atrocity.
