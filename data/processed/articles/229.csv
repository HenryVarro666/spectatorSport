It is Russia that has active chemical and biological weapons programs and is in violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention and Biological Weapons Convention.

Finally, Russia has a track record of accusing the West of the very crimes that Russia itself is perpetrating.

Western allies have accused President Vladimir Putin and his forces of planning a ""false flag"" operation, which would use a false claim that Ukraine has such weapons as an excuse for Russia to deploy its own.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson described the strategy as ""straight out of their playbook"", as it is the same one Russian-backed Bashar al-Assad used for carrying out chemical attacks during the civil war in Syria.

Here Sky News takes a closer look at Russia's history of using chemical weapons - and what it could be planning to use now.

Why does the West think Russia will use chemical weapons in Ukraine?

Although it is signed up to the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention, which bans it from developing, using or stockpiling them, Russia is still known to have used them.

Pentagon and Ministry of Defence intelligence chiefs have repeatedly warned the Kremlin is fabricating claims Ukraine and its Western allies have chemical or bioweapons.

They say Mr Putin wants to use that as justification for using similar weapons on the Ukrainian people. Russia first started making these accusations last year - before the invasion.

On 21 December, Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu said there were 120 US mercenaries in the occupied Donbas region of east Ukraine that had been given ""tanks of chemicals to commit provocations"".

One week into the conflict on 3 March, his colleague foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said US intelligence officials were worried fighting could result in its chemical and biological facilities there being damaged.

The US has no chemical or biological facilities inside Ukraine - it just helps it safeguard its non-military biological laboratories.

On 9 March, a spokesperson for Mr Lavrov's department said it had discovered a military biological weapons programme inside Ukraine, with labs in Kyiv, Kharkiv and Odesa investigating how to use bats and birds to spread deadly pathogens such as anthrax.

But Dr Brett Edwards, senior lecturer in public policy and security at Bath University, told Sky News: ""There are labs in Ukraine, which have been there since before the Cold War, but they are registered, legitimate laboratories, there's nothing shady about them.""

The US dismissed the claims as ""absurd propaganda"", for which there is zero evidence.

In his latest daily address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy added: ""No chemical or any other weapons of mass destructions were developed on my land. The whole world knows that.""

What are chemical and biological weapons? Chemical weapons use chemicals with toxic properties to intentionally cause death or harm. They are categorised by the effect they have on the human body. Nerve agents stop people’s nerves sending messages to their muscles and result in paralysis and loss of bodily function. Types of nerve agents include sarin, used in Syria, Novichok, used in the Salisbury and Navalny poisonings, soman and tabun. Blistering agents come in gas, aerosol or liquid form and cause the skin to blister on contact. Examples include sulphur mustard, used in the First World War and nitrogen mustard. Choking agents cause respiratory failure if they are inhaled or digested. The main one used in the past has been chlorine. Blood agents affect the body’s ability to send oxygen through the blood stream, with examples including hydrogen chloride and cyanogen chloride. Biological weapons – or bioweapons – are ones that deliberately spread viruses, bacteria, fungi or toxins in order to cause death or harm. Examples include: Anthrax, a serious bacterial disease previously used as a means of bioterrorism. It can be deadly and results in skin sores and vomiting. Botulinum toxin, a bacteria that produces a toxin which blocks people’s nerves and can result in respiratory and muscular paralysis. Plague, caused by bacteria, has been used by countries in the past as a bioweapon.

When has Russia used them before?

During the Second Chechen War, in October 2002 Russian troops used a gas containing the opioid carfentanil after Chechen rebels stormed a Moscow theatre and took people hostage.

The substance - 10,000 more powerful than morphine - killed 120 of the hostages.

Two years later in 2004 toxicologists found that Ukraine's pro-Western president Viktor Yushchenko had been poisoned by the chemical TCDD.

Image: A member of the Ukrainian military sits on a tank near Kyiv

Mr Yushchenko, who had beaten Mr Putin's preferred candidate Viktor Yanukovych in the elections that year, claims the attack was carried out by Russia.

The widest-scale example of Russia using chemical weapons was in Syria, where it fought alongside Bashar al-Assad's government forces in the country's civil war.

Studies estimate there were 85 chemical weapon attacks during the war.

Syria forms a key part of Russia's so-called ""playbook"", as each time an attack was carried out, President Assad would say terror groups ISIS and Al-Qaeda had the weapons first.

Dr Edwards, an expert in the history of chemical and biological weapons, said: ""It all comes back to Syria. Russia lied repeatedly about there being chemical weapons in Syria, while working hand in hand with a Syrian regime that was using chemical weapons. In that context, we know Russia lies on these issues.""

The worst attack in Syria was in the Damascus suburb of Ghouta in August 2013 when up to 1,700 people died as a result of the nerve agent sarin.

People tried to escape from their homes only to collapse, foaming from their mouths and noses, and suffocate to death.

Image: Members of the Ukrainian forces sit on a military vehicle near Demydiv, Ukraine

After the atrocities in Ghouta, the Russians agreed to negotiate with the US on behalf of President Assad and eventually struck a deal to allow them to destroy Syria's illegal stockpile of chemical weapons.

During the operation, US officials found about 1,300 tons of mustard gas and the nerve agents sarin and VX.

But despite Syria joining the Chemical Weapons Convention that year, chlorine and other chemical weapons were still used numerous times by Russian-backed Assad forces.

Russia has also repeatedly used chemicals to poison wanted individuals abroad.

In November 2006, former KGB officer-turned British spy Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned by Russian agents in a London hotel.

They contaminated his tea with the highly radioactive chemical polonium 210.

He died of acute radiation poisoning three weeks later.

Image: A destroyed armoured vehicle is seen in the separatist-controlled village of Anadol in the Donetsk region, Ukraine

In March 2018 former Russian military officer Sergei Skripal, who had also turned spy for the British, was poisoned with the nerve agent Novichok alongside his daughter Yulia in Salisbury.

Both survived the attack, but two others - Dawn Sturgess and Charley Rowley - came into contact with the same nerve agent via a contaminated perfume bottle months later seven miles away in Amesbury. Ms Sturgess died almost instantly, but Mr Rowley survived.

The dose found on the perfume bottle is thought to have been strong enough to harm 10,000 people.

Most recently in August 2020, Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny fell ill on a flight home to Moscow after being poisoned with Novichok.

After receiving treatment in Berlin five certified laboratories confirmed the use of the nerve agent.

What weapons does Russia have - and what could they use in Ukraine?

Asked about the prime minister's ""playbook"" warning of a potential chemical weapons attack in Ukraine, former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele told Sky News he ""wouldn't rule it out at all"".

He said: ""I think as the Russian army becomes bogged down and clearly not realising its objectives militarily, you are likely to see more indiscriminate killing and bombardment and possibly the use of chemical weapons.""

But Dr Edwards says that Russia being a signatory of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) means it does not have the capacity to launch chemical attacks like the ones seen in Syria.

""The CWC is the most intrusive and successful disarmament convention we have,"" he tells Sky News.

""Because of its collaboration with the CWC, Russia is subject to on-site inspections and investigations.

""So we know they don't have major stocks, because they've either been destroyed or are in the process of being destroyed.""

Image: A local resident walks past a destroyed Javelin missile system in the separatist-controlled village of Anadol in the Donetsk region, Ukraine

Dr Edwards also claims there would be more widely-available intelligence if such weapons were being mobilised in Ukraine.

""We'd see it in the intelligence, it's a whole infrastructure, so we'd see specialist units moving it all - which we haven't.""

But he says Russia could be producing chemical weapons on a smaller scale.

""The smaller use of weapons - akin to terrorism - is more likely,"" he explains.

""The CWC can't capture smaller, clandestine production. And we have good reason to assume there is small-scale production of nerve agents in Russia - but that doesn't have any relationship with the tonnes needed for chemical warfare.

""It's nowhere near on the scale the West has been talking about.""

On bioweapons, he said there is ""little reason to believe"" Russia has the capability or intent to use them. But he fears incapacitants - such as tear gas and opiate-based substances - could be used to cause harm on a wide scale.

""Russia is very likely to use tear gas in a way that violates people's human rights - and there are also concerns other incapacitants could be used in the same way,"" he says.

""We should be as worried about that as we are chemical weapons.""",https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-what-chemical-and-biological-weapons-could-russia-have-and-what-has-it-used-before-12563036

Although several theories prevail over China’s supposedly notorious role in manufacturing COVID-19 in its Wuhan Lab, scientists do not have proof that it is a bioweapon.

Using a bioweapon is an act of war. Biological warfare is a big threat and the international rulebook is quite clear on bioweapons, they are banned.

In 1972, world leaders of over 180 countries had set up the biological weapons convention which banned the development, production, and stockpiling of an entire category of weapons of mass destruction.

But the convention hasn't been able to contain the bioweapons threat.

In 2001, American lawmakers and media outlets received letters containing military-grade anthrax, a deadly bacterium. Five people lost their lives while 17 got infected in this bioterrorism.

It is believed that at least six countries could have an ongoing bioweapons program. These include: Iraq, Iran, Libya, China, Russia and North Korea.

Although the world knows little about these programs, an American assessment says China has an advanced bioweapons program. It also has an advanced chemical warfare program, that includes development, production and weaponisation capabilities.

Another report, says China is also focusing its attention on gene editing technologies.

So far, the world has guarded itself against biological agents that are of natural origin. But with the help of technology adversaries can hack diseases, and make them deadlier.

Two years ago, the US Military had raised an alarm as per which re-created viruses and toxic bacteria are the new age threats.

In 2016, the US Intelligence community put gene editing on its list of potential weapons of mass destruction. The world is not ready for these modern bioweapons.

Scientific breakthroughs are exposing the gaps in the biological weapons convention. There is no formal verification regime as compliance is difficult to monitor.

Five days after the Korean War started, a committee charged with studying unconventional weapons issued a set of emphatic recommendations, known as the Stevenson Report. The United States “must not arbitrarily deny itself” the use of biological weapons or use them only in retaliation, the report stated. It should prepare “to wage biological warfare offensively.” This view was championed by General Jimmy Doolittle, famed for having bombed Tokyo in 1942. “In my estimation, we have just one moral obligation,” he told his fellow officers at an interservice symposium. “And that moral obligation is for us to develop at the earliest possible moment that agent which will kill enemy personnel most quickly and most cheaply.”

Not everyone agreed with him, but the Pentagon nevertheless backed a crash program, spending nearly $350 million on biological warfare development during the Korean War. Scientists were put to work weaponizing diseases, from familiar scourges like plague to epidemiological deep cuts like coccidioidomycosis, a fungal infection of the lungs. At no point while fighting in Korea did the military acquire the ability to wage all-out germ war with dedicated units of trained biological weapons handlers and mass-produced stockpiles of tested weapons. It could make small, experimental attacks, though.

Within a year of the Korean War’s start in June 1950, China and North Korea announced that the United States had used its biological weapons. There were ultimately two charges: that retreating U.S. forces had purposefully spread disease in their wake in late 1950, and that U.S. planes had dropped infected feathers, insects, rodents, and bacteria bombs on villages in Korea and China in early 1952. Such accusations possessed an obvious propaganda value, and the North Korean and Chinese governments worked with the Soviet Union to plant evidence—including, it seems, injecting condemned prisoners with cholera and plague and then burying their infected corpses at sites of alleged U.S. attacks. As the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union summarized the situation in a note to Mao Zedong: “The accusations against the Americans were fictitious.”",https://newrepublic.com/article/158008/germ-warfare-book-nicholson-baker-baseless-review

8:39 a.m. : Japan announced Tuesday a new round of sanctions on Russia since its invasion of Ukraine, signaling a shift from its gentler and more ambiguous response to Moscow’s seizure of Crimea in 2014. VOA’s Olivia Liao reports.

8:32 a.m.: Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba warned Wednesday that the only electrical grid supplying the Chernobyl nuclear power facility, now controlled by Russia, is damaged and there is currently no power available.



“The reserve generators have a 48-hour capacity to power the Chernobyl (facility),” Kuleba said on Twitter, adding that without electricity the cooling systems in the storage facility for spent nuclear fuel will stop. He expressed concern that radiation leaks could occur. Kuleba called on the international community to demand Russia agree to a cease-fire to allow repair teams to restore power at the Chernobyl facility.

The IAEA responded on Twitter Wednesday saying, “Ukraine has informed IAEA of power loss at Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant” and that “in this case IAEA sees no critical impact on safety.” It added that the volume of cooling water at Chernobyl’s nuclear facility was sufficient for effective heat removal without the need for the electrical supply, and referenced an earlier report from March 3. The IAEA director general did note that this development violates a key safety pillar in ensuring uninterrupted power supply to nuclear facilities.

7:31 a.m.: Russia announced plans for new cease-fires Wednesday to allow civilians to leave several parts of Ukraine. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Russia confirmed evacuation routes would lead out of Sumy, Mariupol, Enerhodar, Volnovakha, Izyum and several towns near the capital, Kyiv.

Civilians from besieged towns northwest of Kyiv worked their way toward the capital Wednesday, crossing over a small river via a damaged bridge, The Associated Press reports. One resident of the town of Irpin described four days without heat, electricity, water or cell phone connections. Others came from neighboring Bucha. The route from Irpin and Bucha to Kyiv is part of a humanitarian corridor announced by Ukrainian authorities Wednesday. Thousands have been entering Kyiv via this route in recent days, with many then taken to the railway station for onward evacuation by train to Ukraine’s west.

“We have a short window of time at the moment (for evacuations). Even if there is a ceasefire right now, there is a high risk of shells falling at any moment,” said Yeyhen Nyshchuk, actor and former culture minister, now a member of Ukraine’s territorial defense forces.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says efforts are underway to evacuate some 18,000 people from the capital Kyiv and embattled towns near it. He said Wednesday the efforts are part of broader evacuation attempts by multiple humanitarian corridors within Ukraine, and warned Russian forces against violating cease-fire promises.

6:47 a.m.: Is Putin the new Hitler? VOA’s Steve Herman reports that even before Russia's military began its invasion of Ukraine, the comparisons between the contemporary Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and the Nazi-era fuehrer, Adolf Hitler, began propagating.



As Ukrainian cities are hit by missiles, resulting in civilian mass casualties and refugees fleeing across the border to Poland, Putin faces accusations of following in the footsteps of the reviled former leader of Germany.

The city had been attacked by Russian forces until a cease-fire Tuesday allowed civilians to flee. The regional governor of Sumy, Dmytro Zhyvytskyy, said prior to the cease-fire, bombs hit residential areas in the city and one blast killed 22 civilians, Reuters reported.

“This defensive deployment is being conducted proactively to counter any potential threat to U.S. and Allied forces and NATO territory,” EUCOM spokesman Capt. Adam Miller said in a statement.

Miller said the systems are purely defensive and designed for protection. “Every step we take is intended to deter aggression and reassure our allies,” Miller said.

Patriot missile defense systems can destroy incoming short-range ballistic missiles, advanced aircraft and cruise missiles.
