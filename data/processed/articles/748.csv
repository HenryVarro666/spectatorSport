Quote: ""Just near Svitlodarsk, the Russians cut off a high-pressure gas pipeline.You can see that the damaged gas pipeline is burning from far off. Gas service workers will soon find out how, and how quickly it will be possible to restore it.""

Details: Kyrylenko said that not long before the damaging of the pipeline, Russian troops launched an airstrike on the village of Rubtsi in the Lyman community. Several houses, as well as the boiler room at the local school, were destroyed. Windows in the kindergarten were blown out.

On Thursday afternoon, as a result of shelling, the fence of a house and a window in the utility room of the outpatient clinic were damaged in Oleksandropol.

Despite the constant shelling, repair crews are working in the region. Electricity supply to Svitlodarsk, Novoselivka and Oleksandropol has been completely restored. With the exception of three streets on the outskirts, electricity was returned to all of Novoluhansk.

Work is underway in Luhanske.

On February 24, Russian president Vladimir Putin announced the start of the invasion of Ukraine. Russian troops simultaneously crossed Ukrainian borders from the north, east, and Crimea. They are ruining cities, killing civilians, shelling and destroying key infrastructure. Missiles hit Ukrainians' homes. Martial law was imposed in Ukraine and general mobilization was announced.

In last night's televised address to the nation, Zelensky sarcastically addressed Russian troops and asked where they planned to deploy chemical weapons.

'Where will you strike with chemical weapons?' he asked. 'At the maternity hospital in Mariupol? At the church in Kharkiv? Okhmadit children's hospital? Or at our laboratories, which have been around since Soviet times and work on regular technology, not military technology?'

The embattled president also announced civilians were evacuated from the cities of Sumy, Trostyanets, Krasnopillya, Irpin, Bucha, Hostomel and Izyum despite constant shelling, but Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said not a single civilian was able to leave Mariupol on Thursday as Russian forces failed to respect yet another temporary ceasefire.

The constant bombardment of the southern port city, which has been without water and electricity for close to a fortnight due to Russia's refusal to respect ceasefires, was described by Zelensky as 'outright terror, from experienced terrorists'.

'The invaders launched a tank attack exactly where this 'corridor of life' was supposed to be. They have a clear order to hold the city of Mariupol hostage, to torture it,' he said.

There was also widespread destruction elsewhere in Ukraine as the invaders continued their indiscriminate bombardment of civilian targets.

The Institute of Physics and Technology in Kharkiv (KIPT) and a high-pressure gas pipeline near Svitlodarsk are two of the latest locations to be decimated in the attacks as the Russian invasion of Ukraine entered its third week.

KIPT was first attacked by Russian bombing campaigns on Monday, but footage has emerged of a new blaze at the complex's dormitories today after the institute's neutron source was destroyed in what Ukraine's Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate called 'an act of nuclear terrorism'.

The newly built neutron source, which is used to initiate nuclear chain reactions among other applications, was set to play a key role in nuclear physics and radiological materials research.

According to the Inspectorate, the device had been loaded with 'fresh nuclear fuel' just prior to the Russian bombardment, and there were fears the shelling of the research facility could pose a threat of nuclear disaster. The Inspectorate said it had not yet ascertained the extent of the damage done to the facility, nor the number of casualties.

But the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said no radiation had been released and that staff had placed the assembly into a 'subcritical state' prior to the attacks, while Harvard nuclear proliferation researcher Matthew Bunn told Physics Today that the facility generates 'virtually zero fission products' with no highly enriched uranium onsite.

Nikolsky mall, a large shopping and entertainment complex in Kharkiv's city centre, was also reduced to rubble in shelling on Thursday morning.

Meanwhile, a video taken on the outskirts of the eastern city of Svitlodarsk in the Donetsk region purported to show Russian troops destroying a high-pressure gas pipeline, sending huge jets of flame into the sky.

Pavlo Kyrylenko, the regional governor of Donetsk, published the video on his Telegram channel, confirming the Russian attack which took place at 4pm GMT.

'The Russians have just broken a high-pressure gas pipeline near Svitlodarsk,' Kyrylenko said.

'How the damaged gas pipeline is burning can be seen from afar. Gas workers will soon find out how quickly they can restore it.'

Russia's defence ministry said late Thursday that it would declare a ceasefire on Friday and open humanitarian corridors from Mariupol as well as Kyiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, Mariupol and Chernihiv, but has gone on to break all previous ceasefire agreements and resume shelling of fleeing refugees.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has so far failed to reach its stated objectives, but has caused thousands of deaths and forced more than 2 million people to flee Ukraine in just three weeks.

Large groups of civilians were evacuated from the cities of Sumy, Trostyanets, Krasnopillya, Irpin, Bucha, Hostomel and Izyum despite constant shelling, but not a single civilian was able to leave Mariupol on Thursday as Russian forces failed to respect yet another temporary ceasefire. Zelensky described the move as 'outright terror, from experienced terrorists'. 'The invaders launched a tank attack exactly where this 'corridor of life' was supposed to be. They have a clear order to hold the city of Mariupol hostage, to torture it,' he said.

Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Thursday that 1,300 civilians had been killed in Mariupol and that Russian forces start shelling the city each time a humanitarian convoy tries to head there to evacuate its residents, though she didn't say whether Thursday's evacuation attempts from the city had failed

KIPT is Ukraine's foremost physical science research centre and has long been a hub of scientific and nuclear advancement, contributing greatly to the development of nuclear technology in the Soviet Union.

The Inspectorate released a statement today detailing the fallout of the attack: 'According to preliminary information, the neutron source is completely de-energised. Information on the consequences of the damage is currently being gathered by facility staff.

'The neutron source was already bombed on March 6, as a result of which the following losses were inflicted. Completely destroyed substation; damaged cables of air conditioner cooling systems of the linear electron accelerator; damage to the main building of the installation; damaged heating main to the complex of buildings.'

In Svitlodarsk, it was not immediately clear what regions of Ukraine are supplied by the gas pipeline, but a similar pipeline in the Donetsk region was attacked by Russian forces on Sunday, which cut off supply to a 70-mile stretch of towns in southeastern Ukraine, Kyrylenko said.

Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and former head of MI6's Russian operations Christopher Steele echoed Zelensky's concerns that Russia could soon deploy chemical weapons amid slow progress on the ground.

The Prime Minister said Putin is in charge of a 'cynical, barbaric government', and believes Russia is preparing a 'fake story' which it could use to deny using the weapons and to blame the West.

The Prime Minister told Sky News’ Beth Rigby Interviews show: ‘The stuff that you are hearing about chemical weapons, this is straight out of their playbook.

‘They start saying that there are chemical weapons that have been stored by their opponents or by the Americans and so when they themselves deploy chemical weapons, as I fear they may, they have a sort of maskirovka, a fake story, ready to go. And you have seen it in Syria. You saw it even in the UK.’

Boris Johnson today said he fears Vladimir Putin will use chemical weapons in Ukraine because it would be 'straight out of Russia's playbook'. He made the comments to Sky News’ Beth Rigby Interviews show

Steele said that although Putin had 'grossly miscalculated' the invasion and that his regime would not survive over the long term as oligarchs and regular citizens alike begin to feel the pinch of sanctions, the Russian leader would likely step up the violence in the short term.

'As the Russian army becomes bogged down, more desperate, and clearly not realising its objectives militarily, you're likely to see more indiscriminate killing and bombardment and possibly the use of a [chemical] weapon,' Steele said.



Elsewhere, Russia continued its utterly brutal bombardment of southern port city Mariupol, one day after an airstrike landed a direct hit on a maternity hospital which resulted in three deaths and at least 17 other casualties.



There has been no relief for the people of Mariupol, which has now been under bombardment for close to a fortnight and is largely cut off from water, electricity and humanitarian aid.

Mortuary workers were pictured yesterday putting corpses in body bags or carpets, taking them to the outskirts of the besieged port city, and then dumping them in mass graves.

The Mariupol city council posted a video Thursday showing buses driving down a highway, saying a convoy bringing food and medicine was trying to reach the city and would evacuate civilians during the return leg.

Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said yesterday that 1,300 civilians had been killed in Mariupol and that Russian forces start shelling the city each time a humanitarian convoy tries to head there to evacuate its residents.

'They want to destroy the people of Mariupol, they want to make them starve,' she said. 'It's a war crime.'

Four previous attempts to bring relief to the city have failed, after Ukraine said Russia shelled the route it was intending to use.

Bombs also fell on two hospitals in Zhytomyr west of the capital on Thursday morning, the mayor said, as Russian forces intensified their siege of Ukrainian cities.

A video appeared to show a Russian plane screaming over the northwestern city and letting loose more bombs on the Berdichevsky bridge.

Meanwhile, Russia yesterday admitted its forces had deployed a thermobaric 'vacuum bomb' in the city of Chernihiv, confirming widespread reports that the devastating weapon had been used on civilian targets.

Britain's Ministry of Defense said on Tuesday that Moscow had announced the use of the 'lung-busting' weapons, but the report was validated yesterday morning when Ukrainian newspaper Ukrayinska Pravda said that a Russian artilleryman, Sgt. Sergei Gubarev, had told a state-owned TV station he had used the weapon.

Their information came from a report broadcast on Zvezda - a Russian state-owned nationwide television network run by the Russian Ministry of Defense.

Chernihiv, 80 miles north of Kyiv, is one of many cities that has been under heavy bombardment.

The Soviet-era weapon launches rockets from atop a tank body that suck in surrounding oxygen, creating higher temperatures and more damaging explosions that last longer than conventional blasts.

Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said yesterday that Ukraine's capital city has been 'turned into a fortress' ahead of the Russian assault, with about 2 million people - half the residents of the metro area of the capital - having fled as Putin's troops draw ever closer.

'Every street, every house is being fortified, the territorial defence is joining,' Klitschko said in a televised interview today.

'Even people who in their lives never intended to change their clothes, now they are in uniform with machine guns in their hands.'

The battle for Kyiv is now underway as Russian tanks pushed to within just a few miles of the city outskirts yesterday morning, though initial assaults to the west and east were repelled as Putin's forces face a long and bloody campaign to try and take the capital.

Kremlin troops launched two attacks on Kyiv late Wednesday and early Thursday - one via the besieged western city of Irpin and another through the eastern district of Brovary, with video showing the moment Russian tanks and armoured vehicles were bombarded with artillery in a devastating ambush and forced to turn back.

Colonel Andrei Zakharov, commander of the tank regiment, was also killed in the ambush according to the Ukrainian defence ministry and radio chatter intercepted from Russians on the battlefield. The same transmissions suggested the column suffered heavy losses, with one tank and an armoured vehicle destroyed.

It marks just the latest Russian commander to be killed in Ukraine, after two generals were slain by Kyiv's troops. Colonel Zakharov had been awarded the Order of Courage by Vladimir Putin in 2016.

Satellite imagery released earlier today appeared to show that the 40-mile-long convoy of Russian armour, which has been backed up outside of Kyiv for over a week, has now dispersed and redeployed in what look to be firing positions, suggesting that a larger assault on the capital is imminent.

Tanks, artillery and other armoured units were seen in towns near the Antonov Airport north of the city, while other vehicles have moved into forests on the capital's outskirts, according to satellite operator Maxar Technologies.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10600151/Zelensky-warns-threat-Russia-deploying-chemical-weapons-real.html

Kyiv, Ukraine CNN —

A 40-mile-long (64km) Russian military convoy, composed of tanks, armored vehicles and towed artillery, has sparked dread among defending Ukrainians as it lumbered towards their capital, Kyiv.

The column has been stalled for a week, but now the forces appear to be regrouping, according to Maxar Technologies satellite imagery taken on Thursday, which showed parts of the convoy had “largely dispersed and redeployed.”

Russia is regrouping for a possible attack on Kyiv, say UK defense officials, after initially making limited progress in its advancement towards the capital.

An intelligence update published by the UK’s Ministry of Defence on Friday said Russia “is likely seeking to reset and re-posture its forces for renewed offensive activity in the coming days” and it would likely “include operations against the capital Kyiv.”

With the clouds temporarily clearing around the Ukrainian capital, Maxar said the satellite images show some elements of the convoy have “repositioned” into forests and treelined areas near Lubyanka, Ukraine. The images were taken at 11:37 a.m. local time (4.37 a.m. ET) on Thursday.

According to the satellite imagery, Russian military vehicles are seen sitting on roadways in residential areas in the town of Ozera – 17 miles northwest of Kyiv and just north of the Russian-controlled Antonov Airbase in Hostomel.

Towed artillery and other vehicles are seen taking cover in sparse patches of trees near Lubyanka – about 3 miles (northwest of the Antonov Airbase.

In Berestyanka – 10 miles west of the airbase – a number of fuel trucks and what Maxar says appear to be multiple rocket launchers are seen positioned in a field near trees.

The satellite images taken on Thursday appear to also show fuel storage tanks on fire at the airbase, with a thick black plume of smoke seen rising from the tanks, located at the southern end of the airbase.

Hostomel’s airbase has been the site of intense clashes with Ukrainian forces since the start of Russia’s invasion. It was reportedly captured by the Russian military on February 24.

At the end of what was the convoy, a number of trucks and equipment are still seen on the roadway southeast of Ivankiv.

Satellite images from Maxar also show significant damage to parts of the northern city of Chernihiv and the northwest suburbs of Kyiv.

In Borodyanka, a series of apartment buildings is seen demolished. CNN has previously reported that these apartment buildings were damaged by Russian military strikes.

Just outside of Kyiv’s city limits in Stoyanka, a warehouse is seen in a satellite image completely gutted by fire.

In the city of Chernihiv, roughly 80 miles northeast of Kyiv, the Epicenter K supermarket is also destroyed by fire. The charred remains of the building is seen; there is no more roof.

A fire is also seen burning in one of Chernihiv’s industrial districts, located on its south side.

Russia reorientates

An overnight airstrike in the Brovary district, just east of the capital, caused no casualties, according to Kyiv authorities.

Ukrainian authorities report a missile strike in the town of Baryshivka overnight some 45 miles east of the capital.

“According to preliminary information, the Iskander missile caused significant damage to infrastructure and housing. 60 apartment houses were completely damaged, 4 apartment buildings and 10 private houses were partially damaged,” they said.

Thomas Bullock, an analyst at Janes, a UK-based intelligence service, told CNN that “Ukraine’s tactic of targeting supply lines has worked well especially during the first five-10 days of the war. This was partially down to Ukrainian tactics and partially down to how Russia was operating.”

The Russian forces “prioritized rushing forward to secure objectives quickly” in the first couple days of the invasion. This meant “they weren’t advancing as a coherent frontline securing territory as they go. This effectively allowed Ukrainian forces to slip behind Russia’s advanced mechanized units and attack logistics columns traveling on unsecured roads in the rear.”

But as “Russia begins to reorient its forces for a longer war following their failure to secure a quick victory” it is “unclear how effective this tactic will be,” Bullock added.

The British Ministry of Defense update added that logistical issues continue to hamper the Russian advance “as does strong Ukrainian resistance.”

French armed forces spokesperson Pascal Ianni reiterated the UK assessment on Friday, saying the Russian army was poorly prepared for its invasion of Ukraine and is now facing many difficulties on the ground, “particularly in the logistical field and in the field of intelligence,” he told French TV station France2.

“It is possible that an attack on Kyiv will be carried out in the next few days, but actually taking control of Kyiv is a whole other matter and will take a long, long time,” he said.

The convoy is believed to have entered Ukraine via Belarus, a key ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and where Russia moved huge numbers of troops to in recent weeks to carry out what they called joint exercises. When the exercises ended, the troops didn’t leave and satellite images actually showed that Russia increased their military presence in the country.

The convoy’s dispersal comes after major cities in Ukraine – including Dnipro in the center and Lutsk in the far west of the country – were attacked by Russian forces Friday.

As Ukrainian officials attempt to open evacuation routes on Friday around Kyiv, the United Nations said 2.5 million people had fled the country and 2 million people are displaced within Ukraine.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/11/europe/kyiv-russian-convoy-intl/index.html
7,8b2fe2c5-908c-4019-896d-341e246d50b2,"['Fri', 'Mar']",2022-03-11 14:21:00+00:00,"Before, my wife and I hardly ever ate bread.

In the Ukrainian countryside, there is a long tradition of having plenty of bread on the table and of eating it with butter and salt or dipping it in milk. Bread dipped in fresh cow’s milk was also given to little kids, and they loved it.

Since arriving in western Ukraine where, like hundreds of thousands of my fellow countrymen, my family has sought relative safety, we find ourselves eating much more bread than before.

Our boys have always loved fresh bread. They enjoy making and eating sandwiches. In our village shop, we would buy our favourite Makariv loaf, a soft, white, brick-shaped loaf. It was baked at the well-known Makariv bakery, which is 20km from our village.

I have been thinking about that Makariv bread for several days now, remembering the taste. Only now, as I remember, I sense the taste of blood on my lips, like when I was a child if someone split my lip in a fight.

The Makariv bakery was bombed a few days ago by Russian troops. The bakers were at work. I can imagine the fragrant smell that surrounded them the moment before the attack.

In an instant, 13 bakery staff were killed and nine were injured. And the bakery is no more. Makariv bread is a thing of the past.

I have long since run out of words to describe the horror brought by Vladimir Putin to Ukrainian soil.

Ukraine is the land of bread and wheat.

It’s the time of year to prepare the fields for sowing, but this work is not being done.

The soil of the wheat fields is full of metal — fragments of shells, pieces of blown-up tanks and cars, the remains of downed planes and helicopters.

And it’s all covered in blood. Every day the list of crimes grows longer as more and more of Putin’s actions are added to it: the shooting of young volunteers who were carrying food to the dog shelter in Hostomel; the murder of postmen who were delivering pensions to elderly residents in Sumy region; the killing of five people in an attack on the Kyiv television tower.

The list goes on and on.

We certainly don’t yet know about all the crimes that have been committed, but we will definitely find out about them all, and the list will be presented at a new Nuremberg trial. It doesn’t matter where it takes place. The main thing is that we know who will be judged.

International lawyers have already begun to collect evidence of crimes. Ukrainians are looking forward to the verdict on the murderers and war criminals. But for now, they must survive under the shelling of the Russian army.

They spend their nights in basements, in bomb shelters, in bathrooms. The latest advice circulating on the internet tells us that, in the event of a bombing raid, the safest places to be are inside your cast-iron bath or in interior corridors where there are no windows.

The people of Kyiv have grown suddenly much more attached to their metro, one of the most beautiful and deepest in the world.

The metro is no longer a form of transport. It is a haven, like something from an apocalyptic movie.

The station platforms are being turned into cinemas where films are shown for free: Children’s films in the morning and films for a wider audience later in the day. Large screens have already been hung or are being hung right now at 14 Kyiv metro stations.

There is a constant supply of tea, the internet is already there, but the connection is poor. There are not enough toilets, but people don’t complain about queuing for 40 minutes or more.

Everyone waits patiently. They are waiting for the end of the war and the beginning of the trial, a trial that the whole world will have to follow, as the whole world followed at Nuremberg.

And, in Russia, what do they think about the future court proceedings? I am afraid they don’t think about it at all.

They are now busy buying dollars and euro. Sanctions on the banking sector have caused the value of the rouble to fall dramatically, provoking panic.

Panic is also observed on the Russian-Finnish border, via which many Russians are now trying to leave their homeland. They are those who are ashamed to stay in Russia, and those who could be drafted into the army, those who do not want to die or do not want to kill or do not want to be cannon fodder for the Kremlin.

Some captured Russian soldiers have asked for permission to remain in Ukraine for good.

“Jail awaits us if we return!” they say.

On the borders of Ukraine with Moldova, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, and Poland, there are still queues of refugees. It is said that some Ukrainians are trying to leave the country using fake Russian passports.

I won’t judge them. Let time and history judge everyone. I am glad that at this most difficult of times, most Ukrainians have maintained their humanity and try to help each other.

In the last couple of days, I’ve started to dread opening Facebook. More and more often in the newsfeed, I see posts by young Ukrainian women declaring their love for their recently killed husbands. I know some of these women and have met their husbands. I cannot read these cries of despair thrown into the bottomless well of the internet without tears.

But I can’t not read them either. I want to see and hear everything that is happening now in my country.

Why are they bombing children’s hospitals and schools? Why destroy residential areas of Chernihiv, Borodianka, Kharkiv, and Mariupol? Why, after all, are they bombing bakeries and bread shops? I don’t have answers to these questions.

“You can’t understand Russia with your mind!” wrote the 19th-century Russian poet Fyodor Tyutchev.

I agree with him, but I still have a question: how can one understand Russia at all, if the mind does not help?
