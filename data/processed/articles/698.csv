Andrey Paliy, 51, a Black Sea fleet commander, was shot dead by Ukrainian forces near the embattled city of Mariupol, making him the first Russian naval boss and sixth high-up military leader to die since the Kremlin invasion of Ukraine started last month.

Konstantin Tsarenko, who used to work with Paliy at the Russian Naval School in Sevastopol, announced the sea commander’s death on V Kontakte, a Russian social-media site, the Telegraph reported.

Tsarenko has since deleted the post, but Igor Savostin, a former naval officer, also posted about Paliy’s death, according to the paper.

Paliy died “like a true commissar by leading the marines into battle,” Savostin wrote.

The naval chief was born in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, but pledged his allegiance to the Kremlin after the fall of the Soviet Union, moving to Russia and joining its navy, the Telegraph said. He was likely involved in Russia’s 2014 invasion of Crimea and was stationed on the Black Sea.

His death has not been confirmed by Russian authorities, and the exact day he died is unknown.

Ukrainian officials said Saturday that Russian Lieutenant-General Andrey Mordvichev, commander of the 8th army of the southern military district, was killed when armed forces destroyed a command post at an airfield in Kherson, a port city in southern Ukraine. He was the fifth general killed in battle, according to Ukraine.","https://nypost.com/2022/03/20/top-russian-naval-chief-born-in-kyiv-killed-in-battle-report/#:~:text=Andrey%20Paliy%2C%2051%2C%20a%20Black,of%20Ukraine%20started%20last%20month."

The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making “the most important decision of their life -- to fight.”

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.”

Zelenskiy noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.”

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

A deputy commander of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet has been shot dead, Ukrainian officials say.

First rank captain Andrey Paliy, 51, is the only senior naval officer allegedly killed in the war in Ukraine, although Kyiv claims to have slain five army generals.

This came as Russia claimed to have hit a training facility for foreign fighters killing more than 100 special forces personnel and non-Ukrainian mercenaries.

His death appeared to be confirmed by a Russian friend, Konstantin Tsarenko, secretary of the public council of the Sevastopol Nakhimov Naval School, although it has not been officially acknowledged by Moscow.

One account said that he had been involved with Russian marines attacks near Mariupol.

However, the exact circumstances of his reported death are not known.

Paliy was born in Kyiv and in 1993 refused to take the Ukrainian military oath, instead serving in the Russian Northern Fleet.

He had earlier served on the Russian nuclear missile cruiser ""Peter the Great”.

He also served as deputy head of the Russian naval academy in Sevastopol, in annexed Crimea.

Ukrainian official Anton Gerashchenko claimed Palsy’s death early today without giving further details.

Russia again today used hypersonic Kinzhal missiles on “military targets” in Ukraine, according to the defence ministry in Moscow.

“A Kinzhal attack on a fuel and lubricants base from which fuel for Ukrainian armoured vehicles was supplied was launched from the airspace over Crimea,” said a statement.

High-precision airborne missiles also struck a training centre for “foreign mercenaries” near the village of Ovruch, in Zhytomyr Region, claimed then Russians.

The type of missile strike was not specified.

The deputy commander of Russia's Black Sea fleet was killed in combat near the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol, Russian officials said.

Captain 1st rank Andrei Paly is the latest senior Russian officer to be killed in the war with Ukraine.

His death was announced Sunday by Mikhail Razvozhayev, the pro-Russian governor of the Ukrainian city of Sevastopol, on Telegram.

""Andrei Nikolaevich chose as the mission of his life to defend the Motherland and died for our peaceful future,"" Razvozhayev wrote, according to the Russian news outlet MKRU.

Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula city of Sevastopol from Ukraine in 2014, and bases its Black Sea fleet there.

Ekaterina Altabaeva, a senator in Sevastopol, also announced Paly's death on Russia's VK social-media network.

""Sevastopol has suffered a heavy, irreparable loss ... Paly died in the battles for the liberation of Mariupol from the Nazis,"" wrote Altabaeva, referring to Russian propaganda's attempt to portray its invasion as a mission to ""denazify"" Ukraine.

Paly's death was also confirmed by the secretary of the Nakhimov naval college, Konstantin Tsarenko, on VK, BBC Monitoring reported.

The Russian defense ministry has not confirmed Paly's death, however.

An unusually high number of senior Russian officials have been killed in Ukraine.

US officials told The New York Times last week that four Russian generals had been killed in stalled invasion so far, with military setbacks leading them to take unusually advanced positions to personally direct operations, leaving them vulnerable to attack.

Over the weekend, Ukraine said its forces had killed a fifth Russian general, Lieutenant-General Andrei Mordvichev, near Kyiv.

Russian forces have for weeks been besieging Mariupol, where around 30,000 civilians remain trapped with no electricity or running water, and limited food supplies. Ukrainian forces rejected a Russian offer to relinquish control of the city on Sunday.

According to Russian media outlet Kommersant, Paly, 51, was born in Kyiv and defected to the Russian navy in 1993. He was appointed deputy commander of the Black Sea fleet in 2019, the report said.",https://www.businessinsider.com/top-russia-naval-commander-andrei-paly-killed-mariupol-officials-2022-3

“Andrei Nikolayevich Palii died in the fighting to liberate Mariupol from the Ukrainian Nazis,” Mikhail Razvojaev, governor of Sevastopol, wrote in Telegram.

This city on the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014, is the base port of the Russian Black Sea fleet.

According to Razvojaev, Andrei Palii, an “open and honest man”, a “true officer of a military dynasty” who had “great authority over the fleet”, died on Saturday in the clashes to take Mariupol, a strategic port city in southeastern Ukraine that has been under siege by the Russian army for several weeks.

According to Russian media, Andrei Palii was deputy commander of Russian forces in Syria in 2020, where Russia intervened militarily since September 2015 in support of the forces of the Bashar al-Assad regime.

First rank captain Andrey Paliy, 51, is the only senior naval officer allegedly killed in the war in Ukraine, although Kyiv have also claimed to have killed five army generals.

Colonel Sergeie Sukharev, from the 331st Guards Parachute Assault Regiment, was killed on March 18, while Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky was shot and killed by a sniper at the end of February.

Sukhovetsky was the deputy commander of the 41st Combined Arms Army.

On March 7, the death of Major General Vitaly Gerasimov was announced by Ukrainian military intelligence based on an intercepted radio call.

He was the first deputy commander of the 41st Army, and was killed outside of Kharkiv, according to a conversation between two FSB officers.

Paliy’s death appeared to be confirmed by a Russian friend, Konstantin Tsarenko, secretary of the public council of the Sevastopol Nakhimov Naval School.

However his death has not been officially acknowledged by Moscow.

He also served as deputy head of the Russian naval academy in Sevastopol in annexed Crimea.

Russia used hypersonic Kinzhal missiles on “military targets” in Ukraine again on Sunday, according to the defence ministry in Moscow.

Russian defence ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said that the Kinzhal (Dagger) hypersonic missile hit a Ukrainian fuel depot in Kostiantynivka near the Black Sea port of Mykolaiv.

He added: “Kalibr cruise missiles were launched from the waters of the Black Sea against the Nizhyn plant that repairs Ukrainian armoured vehicles damaged in fighting.”

On Saturday, the Russian military said the Kinzhal had been used for the first time in combat to destroy an ammunition depot in Diliatyn in the Carpathian Mountains in western Ukraine.

Konashenkov added that another attack by air-launched missiles hit a facility in Ovruch in the northern Zhytomyr region where foreign fighters and Ukrainian special forces were based.

The type of missile strike was not specified.

Ukraine’s general staff said that Captain Andrey Paliy was killed by its forces, though the circumstances around his death are unclear and Moscow has not commented on reports.

Security analysts say Paliy was the deputy commander for military-political work of the Black Sea Fleet. He is believed to be the first Russia naval officer killed in the invasion.

To date, Ukraine has claimed to have killed five Russian major generals. Analysts believe that around 20 major generals are leading Russian operations in Ukraine, meaning that if all the reported deaths are confirmed, about a quarter of Russia’s generals have been killed in action.

Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior adviser to President Volodymr Zelensky, said that the “high mortality” of senior officers showed that the Russian army was “fully unprepared” and “fights only with numbers and cruise missiles”.

The Ukranian army is understood to be targeting senior Russian officers, with the use of unencrypted communications giving the location of some officers away.

Western defence sources believe that high-ranking Russian officers have been putting themselves in danger by getting close to the battlefield in order to regain control of operations which have in some areas badly stalled.

On Sunday, a former UK head of defence intelligence said the Russian invasion of Ukraine was “pretty demoralised, pretty stuck and pretty stalled”.

Air Marshal Philip Osborn told Sophy Ridge on Sky News that Russian forces were “demoralised because they were poorly prepared and proven to be inadequate” and were now stalled because they had “lost momentum”.

He said: “We are seeing them pull resources and manpower from across Russia, even from Syria, and that is not a good indication for a supposed superpower”.

“They are stalled because they are running out of options,” he added. “What is left to them now is to double down on brute force to put pressure on the Ukrainian government.”",https://inews.co.uk/news/ukraine-russia-black-sea-fleet-captain-andrey-paliy-russian-army-generals-1528620
