LONDON, March 17 (Reuters) - British defence minister Ben Wallace ordered an inquiry on Thursday after an impostor claiming to be the Ukrainian prime minister was able to contact him, an incident he blamed on Russia.

The video call was set up after an email was sent to a government department, purportedly from an aide at the Ukrainian embassy, which was then passed on to the Ministry of Defence.

""Today an attempt was made by an imposter claiming to be Ukrainian PM to speak with me. He posed several misleading questions and after becoming suspicious I terminated the call,"" Wallace said on Twitter.

A defence source said Wallace had ordered an immediate inquiry into how the call, which lasted about 10 minutes, was allowed to happen.

Home Secretary (interior minister) Priti Patel said she had also been targeted.

""This also happened to me earlier this week,"" she wrote on Twitter. ""Pathetic attempt at such difficult times to divide us. We stand with Ukraine.""

It is not the first time British ministers have been the victims of a hoax call.

In May 2018 Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was foreign minister at the time, talked about international relations and rude poetry with a hoax caller who pretended to be the Armenian prime minister.

After Wallace revealed news of the call on Thursday, Priti Patel said something similar had happened to her earlier in the week. Both government ministers expressed solidarity with Ukraine.

A defence source told the Reuters news agency Wallace had ordered an immediate inquiry to find out how the apparent impostor was able to speak to him. The incident raises security questions, particularly as Wallace suggested that Russia was behind the effort.

The shadow Home Office minister, Holly Lynch, said: “For individuals to be able to fraudulently gain access to two of the most senior government ministers with responsibilities for our national defence is worrying.

“There are questions that need answering as to why the basics in due diligence appear not to have happened, especially at a time of heightened security concerns around disinformation and cyberattacks.

“An urgent investigation must look into how this happened so the necessary steps can be taken to avoid anymore such incidents.”

Wallace is not the first British minister to fall foul of a hoax call. In May 2018, Boris Johnson – then the foreign secretary – talked about international relations and rude poetry with a hoax caller who pretended to be the Armenian prime minister.

And, in 2015, it emerged that the authorities had been the target of two hoax calls. In one, an impostor claiming to be the head of GCHQ Robert Hannigan managed to get through to the then prime minister David Cameron on his mobile. In the other, a caller rang GCHQ and managed to obtain Hannigan’s mobile phone number.

A government spokesperson said at the time that departments had been told to be more careful and that such incidents were taken seriously. Cameron, however, seemed less disturbed, recounting the story in lighthearted fashion during a pre-election visit to the Liberal Democrat-held marginal seat of Eastleigh in Hampshire.

Explaining how he had rumbled the hoax caller, he said: “My BlackBerry went in my pocket, I answered it and it claimed to be a conference call established, which I do very frequently, between the head of GCHQ and some of the staff in my office. A voice came through, a voice I didn’t recognise. The voice said that he was sorry to wake me up which I thought was strange as it was 11am.”",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/17/hoax-caller-ukrainian-pm-denys-shmyhal-uk-ben-wallace-priti-patel

Ben Wallace ordered an immediate inquiry into the security breach on Thursday.

During the hoax call Mr Wallace engaged for about 10 minutes with the man, who appeared to have gone through a lot of trouble to look like the real Ukrainian premier, Denys Shmyhal, a defence source said.

A Ukrainian flag had been placed behind the imposter as part of the ruse, and the man had used faked details from the Ukrainian embassy to appear authentic.

The imposter asked questions related to Ukraine's foreign policy, but Mr Wallace - who was on a visit to Poland when he took the call - soon became suspicious when the queries became more ""wild"", the source added.

At one point he asked the defence secretary: ""Did you get the substance we have sent?""

Mr Wallace responded by saying he did not know what the man was talking about.

The fraudster also started mentioning various names the defence secretary had not heard of, according to the source.

The call was promptly terminated.

The Ministry of Defence decided to make the existence of the bogus call public to expose the tactic.

Posting on Twitter on Thursday afternoon, Mr Wallace wrote: ""Today an attempt was made by an imposter claiming to be Ukrainian PM to speak with me.

""He posed several misleading questions and after becoming suspicious I terminated the call.

Home Secretary Priti Patel later revealed she had also recently been targeted by a hoax caller.

The MoD also publicised the call to Mr Wallace to raise awareness, in case the imposter attempts to exploit any of the video footage in a ""deep fake"" aimed at undermining international unity against Russia over its war in Ukraine, a second source said.

Russia has a track record of using information as a weapon - distorting audio or video footage to give a twisted or distorted narrative aimed at undermining or attacking an opponent.

The call was set up via Teams or some other form of video conference. The MoD had arranged the call after being forwarded details of the approach from another government department.

It is not clear how the imposter managed to trick MoD officials that he was the real Ukrainian prime minister.

Mr Wallace was in Poland on Thursday, where he announced the deployment of the Sky Sabre missile system, along with 100 troops.

He called it ""desperate"" but did not provide further information about the incident.

Two Russian pranksters have since claimed credit for tricking Britain’s defence secretary into a hoax call

A video of the ""prank"" circulated on YouTube on Tuesday after the UK accused Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government of being behind the imposter call.

British authorities had alleged that the Kremlin had tried to access sensitive or embarrassing information from the defence minister.

Vladimir ""Vovan"" Kuznetsov and Alexei ""Lexus"" Stolyarov -- a pair of hoaxers who had previously targeted Prince Harry -- have claimed responsibility and denied any links to Russia’s security services.

Their video shows Wallace speaking from Poland to a caller who says Ukraine supposedly wants to advance its “nuclear programme” to protect itself from Moscow.

The UK Ministry of Defense said the video had been “doctored.”

""Things must be going so badly for the Kremlin that they are now resorting to pranks and video fakes,"" Wallace added in a later tweet.",https://www.euronews.com/2022/03/17/british-defence-secretary-contacted-by-imposter-of-ukrainian-pm

In a series of tweets, the Right Honorable Ben Wallace disclosed that the man asked “several misleading questions” and he eventually ended the call after becoming suspicious. The official described the hoax as a “desperate attempt”, and pinned the blame on Russia.

“No amount of Russian disinformation, distortion and dirty tricks can distract from Russia’s human rights abuses and illegal invasion of Ukriane. A desperate attempt,” wrote the Conservative politician in the tweet. Wallace did not reveal any evidence backing his claim that Russia was responsible for the fake call, nor name any individuals involved.

Deborah Haynes of Sky News noted that the perpetrators went to “great lengths” to stage the video call, including placing a Ukrainian flag behind the so-called “Ukrainian prime minister” and using fake details from the Ukraine embassy. At one point, the culprit asked Wallace if he received “the substance” they sent. A few more minutes of similarly absurd questioning finally raised enough alarm bells for Wallace to abort the call.

A pair of Russian comedians known as Lexus and Vovan are infamous for regularly pranking world leaders. As Irish Times notes, the pair once called former Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko, posing as the president of Kyrgyzstan. The same pair also pretended — in a call to the actual Poroshenko— to be Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. They also duped British Prime Minister Boris Johnson into taking an 18-minute video call with an actor who was impersonating the prime minister of Armenia. During the call, Johnson talked about the UK’s plans for Russian President Vladimir Putin and the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal. While the Kremlin denies employing the pair, Russian state media often congratulates their actions.
