The U.S. government is prepared to help Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky leave Kyiv to avoid being captured or killed by advancing Russian forces, according to U.S. and Ukrainian officials. But so far, the president has refused to go. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight As the Russian military ratcheted up its attacks on Friday, a defiant Zelensky pledged to remain in charge of his government despite grave personal risk. “According to the information we have, the enemy has marked me as target No. 1, my family as target No. 2,” he told Ukrainians in an early-morning address. “They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state.”

For weeks, Zelensky has heard those warnings from U.S. officials.

When CIA Director William J. Burns flew to Ukraine in January to meet with Zelensky about the growing Russian threat to his country, the Ukrainian president asked whether he or his family were personally in danger, according to a Zelensky aide, who said that the leader was skeptical the Russians would try to kill him.

Burns didn’t share specific information but made clear that Zelensky needed to take his personal security seriously, the aide said.

The CIA declined to comment.

At the time, intelligence suggested that Russian hit teams might already be in Kyiv, well before the first forces ever crossed the border, according to officials familiar with the information who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive material.

U.S. officials in recent days have spoken to Zelensky about a variety of security issues, including the safest places for the president to situate himself to ensure continuity of the Ukrainian government, said a senior U.S. official.

“We have been making him aware not only of the threat of Russian invasion, now a reality, but also the threat to him personally,” Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said. “We stand ready to assist him in any way.”

Removing Zelensky might offer Russian President Vladimir Putin the swiftest way to end the war in Ukraine or avoid a protracted, costly occupation, several current and former national security officials said this week.

With the Ukrainian leader out of the picture, Putin could try to install a puppet replacement.

In January, the British government accused the Kremlin of scheming to replace Zelensky with a pro-Russian politician and former member of Ukraine’s parliament.

Schiff said he worried that if the Russians captured Zelensky, they could hold him incommunicado or force him to make concessions.

“I’m deeply concerned with the threat to his life and well being,” Schiff said.

As the Biden administration and Western allies warned an invasion was coming, Zelensky publicly downplayed the threat. He and his aides acknowledged that Putin might order the forces massing in huge numbers on Ukraine’s borders to strike, but they said U.S. and other European leaders also risked igniting a public panic and economic catastrophe with their constant warnings of an imminent attack.

Now that Russia has struck, U.S. officials warned again this week that Putin’s goal was to decapitate the Ukrainian government. White House press secretary Jen Psaki indicated to reporters on Thursday that the United States had plans to assist Zelensky if he were personally threatened.

“We’re not going to get into security — security questions, but we are in touch with President Zelensky, and we are working to provide him a range of support,” Psaki said.

According to a Ukrainian official, Zelensky has not directed his own security services to remove him to a safe city, such as Lviv, although they stand ready to do so.

Fending off rumors that he had fled, Zelensky posted a video on Telegram on Friday surrounded by his top advisers and the prime minister in front of Bankova, Ukraine’s equivalent to the White House.

“We are all here. Defending our independence. Our country. And so it will continue,” Zelensky said.

Zelensky noted in his earlier remarks that his family remained in Ukraine, as well, but he declined to say where.

He also said that “sabotage groups” had infiltrated Kyiv, without saying whether they were targeting him personally.

Later, Zelensky’s administration said in a public statement that “enemy reconnaissance and sabotage groups operate insidiously, disguising themselves in civilian clothes and infiltrating cities to destabilize the situation by carrying out sabotage operations.”

Some officials praised the Ukrainian leader for staying in place despite the risk to himself and his government and the warnings he has received.

“The U.S. has been very forward-leaning both in sharing threat information with the government of Ukraine, including President Zelensky, as well as declassifying a significant amount of intelligence to ensure that the world knew about Russia’s plans for this unprovoked aggression,” said Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee. “President Zelensky has courageously decided to stay and lead from Kyiv.”

The big picture: It's a role few could imagine Zelensky playing when he won the presidency in 2019, his closest qualification being playing a president on television.

Here's what to know about the actor-turned-leader:

Zelensky, 44, was a comedian and actor before soundly defeating former President Petro Poroshenko with more than 70% of the vote in 2019.

Zelensky had no prior political experience before becoming president and named his political party after the television sitcom on which he played a president, ""Servant of the People.""

""Throughout my entire life, I’ve tried to do everything so Ukrainians smiled,"" Zelensky said during his inauguration speech, per Politico. ""In the next five years, I will do everything so that you, Ukrainians, don’t cry.""

Three months after entering office, Zelensky, then 41, was thrust into the center of former President Trump's first impeachment inquiry after the U.S. withheld military aid to Ukraine to pressure Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden's son, Hunter.

Zelensky's approval ratings dropped in the months leading up to Russia's invasion amid economic consequences from the pandemic and the war in Donbas persisted, Politico notes.

State of play: Now, the political neophyte is rallying his country as Russian military forces continue to press forward, outnumbering Ukraine in personnel and supplies.

Zelensky has turned down an American offer to evacuate, saying ""the fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride.""

""I'm here. We are not putting down any arms. We will protect our country, because our weapons are our truth,"" he said on Saturday, despite believing that he is Russia's ""number one"" target for capture or assassination.

The bottom line: ""He has some shortcomings,"" a woman who would give only her first name, Ekaterina, told Politico of Zelensky.

""[But] we must unite. I support him very much at this moment. Because he is the nation’s leader. In difficult times, we must support our country.""

Zelensky said Ukrainians could not afford to lose their capital of Kyiv to Russian forces.

Earlier in the day, Zelensky called for Vladimir Putin ""to sit down at the negotiating table.""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Friday night that the future of his country ""is being decided right now,"" a dire forecast that came amid reports that Russian troops were approaching Kyiv from multiple directions.

""Tonight, the enemy will use all the resources they have to break our resistance in a mean, cruel, and inhuman way,"" Zelensky said in a message to his nation, according to a translation of his remarks. ""Tonight, they will assault us.""

He added that many Ukrainian cities remained under attack and once again called on his fellow citizens to use whatever means necessary to repel Russian forces. Earlier in the day, a video posted by a reporter with The Kyiv Independent appeared to show Ukrainian men helping themselves to guns a day after citizens were urged to take up arms.

""Burn down the enemy's military vehicles using anything — anything — you can. If even the kindergartens are an admissible target for the invaders, you must not leave them any chance,"" he said.

The United Kingdom's Defense Ministry said earlier Friday: ""Russian armored forces are progressing toward Kyiv from multiple directions in an attempt to encircle the city."" Insider could not immediately verify these claims.

Zelensky thanked President Joe Biden as he ticked through the list of Western leaders he'd spoken with in the past 24 hours. Zelensky has elected to remain in Kyiv, even though he previously said Russia wanted to kill him and his family.

Zelensky previously called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to ""sit down at the negotiating table."" The New York Times reported that Ukrainian officials asked Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett to mediate talks between Ukraine and Russia. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin's spokesperson, told reporters on Friday that Putin was ready to send officials to Minsk, Belarus, a country from which Putin invaded Ukraine.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba compared the previous night's strikes to World War II, saying his country had not faced a moment like this since the Nazis attacked.

""Last time our capital experienced anything like this was in 1941 when it was attacked by Nazi Germany,"" he tweeted. ""Ukraine defeated that evil and will defeat this one. Stop Putin. Isolate Russia. Severe all ties. Kick Russia out.""

The West has responded by further ramping up sanctions. NATO, which Ukraine is not a member of, also made the historic decision to activate the alliance's response force. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said it would send troops to bolster eastern-flank members. The exact numbers and troop destinations were unclear, but that was a sign of just how serious NATO was taking the situation given that the response force had never before been activated.

Both the European Union and the US have pledged to sanction Putin personally, a rare step in the realm of foreign diplomacy. The White House's decision to target Putin puts him on a short list with the likes of Kim Jong Un, Bashar Assad, and Robert Mugabe.",https://www.businessinsider.com/volodymyr-zelensky-ukraine-kyiv-russia-latest-2022-2

I’ve usually told Ukrainian interlocutors that Washington wasn’t born a great man; he became one because of the trials of the Revolutionary War, when he demonstrated his ability to lead and to symbolize the American struggle. A Ukrainian Washington might emerge in a similar manner, and now perhaps he has.

Ukrainians’ question may have been answered by an unlikely candidate for the hero role: Volodymyr Zelensky, a comedian-turned-president, who many analysts — including me — considered would be disastrous for the country. He was elected in a landslide in 2019, and, like most Ukrainian presidents, proceeded to introduce some important reforms before getting bogged down by red tape, internecine power struggles, his own lack of experience — which many Ukrainians called incompetence — and the COVID-19 crisis.

Then, to make things worse, in mid-2021 Zelensky was confronted with a massive Russian military buildup on Ukraine’s borders. He downplayed it for months — thereby provoking even more criticism of his administration — until it became clear a few weeks ago that Russia’s strongman president, Vladimir Putin, had set his sights on invading Ukraine.

Since then, and especially since Putin officially announced his aggressive intentions and the invasion began, Zelensky has discovered his backbone and acted admirably, even heroically, rallying the nation around the flag, organizing the homeland defense, lobbying foreign countries for support, calming the population with well-delivered patriotic speeches, appealing to Russians to end the madness, and demonstrating that he has no intention of fleeing.

VIDEO | 00:38 Zelensky tells Ukrainians he will remain in Kyiv Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday said he will remain in Kyiv, even as Russia pounded the capital and other cities with airstrikes for a second day.

Zelensky’s defiant speeches and selfie videos, shot on the streets of Kyiv, have gone viral. “We are here,” he said calmly into a cellphone camera on Friday, standing with his top advisors. “We are in Kyiv. We are protecting Ukraine.”

The message was clear: He would defend Ukrainian sovereignty and statehood to the very end. Even his most severe critics have been silenced, impressed by Zelensky’s bravery and commitment.

A few days after Putin’s invasion, the Warsaw-based Jan Karski Society (named after the heroic Polish underground courier who informed the West of the atrocities being perpetrated against Jews in the Warsaw ghetto) honored Zelensky with the Jan Karski Eagle Award for his “heroic defense of Ukraine and the moral values of Western civilization.” As one member of the awards committee, Rabbi Abraham Skórka, said: “Let us take heed that the sin of omission toward Ukraine and the brave nation does not come to persecute us, like the sin of omission in the face of the Holocaust.”

By implicitly comparing Putin’s invasion of Ukraine to the Holocaust, Skórka was suggesting that the Russian dictator was following in Hitler’s footsteps, that his aggression was tantamount to genocide, and that Zelensky — who himself is of Jewish background — was acting in the manner of those heroic individuals who resisted the Nazis.

The fact that Zelensky is a Russian-speaking Ukrainian Jew is of immense symbolic as well as political importance. In his past life, he was not particularly political. His comedy poked fun at patriotic Ukrainians, and he did not appear to pay much attention to the way he personifies three identities. But all that has changed in the last few days and weeks.

Politics U.S. announces $350 million in additional military aid to Ukraine The U.S. says it is providing an additional $350 million in military aid to the Ukrainian government as the country’s forces try to fend off Russia.

Zelensky identifies fully with Ukraine, but this Ukraine is expansive, diverse, tolerant and committed to freedom and democracy. No less important: This Ukraine — which Putin obscenely claims has to be de-Nazified — has also been embraced by the vast majority of Ukraine’s inhabitants, regardless of their language preference, religion or ethnic background. Indeed, some of the most striking dispatches from the ongoing war feature Russian-speaking Ukrainians defending their freedoms and cursing Putin.

The war for Ukraine is far from over, and Zelensky may yet stumble and lose his aura. In any case, he will go down in history as a new type of Ukrainian patriot who fought for his homeland’s freedom. And in the end, he may deserve to be considered Ukraine’s George Washington.

Italy’s prime minister even told his own parliament, in a tremulous voice, that Mr. Zelensky had missed a planned call with him.

Later as Russian forces announced they had cut the city off from the western part of the country and captured strategic locations to Kyiv’s north, the Ukrainian leader emerged with one message:

With growing signs that Russia aims to overthrow him, Zelensky told European Union leaders in a video link-up from his bunker late Thursday that it might be the last time they saw him alive.

On Friday Zelensky released a video of himself and his senior aides outside the presidential office in Kyiv to reassure Ukrainians that he and other top officials would stay in the capital, even as Russian forces closed in.

He reiterated his belief that the Russians would try and kill him, saying: Russia “has marked me down as the number one target.”

“My family is the number two target. They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state,” he said.

“Obviously going after a head of state would be a significant, horrific act by the Russian leadership,” Psaki said, noting that the US remains in contact with Zelensky.

“He is still in Ukraine, proudly and courageously facing up the Russian attack,” she said.

US President Joe Biden spoke Friday with Zelensky to convey his support and “commended the brave actions of the Ukrainian people who were fighting to defend their country,” the White House said.

Zelensky tweeted that he and Biden discussed “strengthening sanctions, concrete defense assistance and an antiwar coalition,” adding that he was grateful for Washington’s support.

His whereabouts were kept secret.

“All of us are here protecting our independence of our country,” Zelensky said Friday. “And it will continue to be this way. Glory to our defenders, glory to Ukraine, glory to heroes.”

Putin has not disclosed his ultimate plans for Ukraine. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov gave a hint, saying “We want to allow the Ukrainian people to determine its own fate.”

Speaking with barely constrained fury, Putin urged the Ukrainian soldiers his forces are trying to kill to seize power from their civilian leaders — a democratically elected government Putin derided as “a gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis who’ve holed up in Kyiv and taken the entire Ukrainian nation hostage.”

Putin’s dark rhetoric about a government led by a Jewish president, Volodymyr Zelensky, who was elected in a landslide in 2019, is plainly delusional, but it was echoed that night on the state television channels that give him a stranglehold over Russia’s airwaves.

Pure war propaganda on Russian state TV news tonight:

Zelensky, a former comedian who played an unlikely president in a hit television series before becoming one in real life, responded to Putin’s address, and to Russian disinformation that he had fled the country, in a defiant video selfie posted on Telegram — a messaging app that is popular in Russia, even though its Russian creator was forced to move his operations abroad after conflicts with Putin’s government. The brief message was quickly viewed more than 4 million times on Telegram and went viral on Twitter, where it racked up more than 15 million views. Standing in an instantly recognizable location, outside the president’s office on Bankova Street in central Kyiv, flanked by his closest advisers, Zelensky spoke calmly into his phone.

“Good evening everyone. The leader of the party is here,” Zelensky said, showing Davyd Arakhamia, who leads the president’s political party, Servant of the People. “The head of the presidential office is here,” he said, of Andriy Yermak, an adviser who tried to fend off demands from Rudy Giuliani for Zelensky to open sham investigations into Joe Biden in 2019, as then-President Donald Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine. After noting that his prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, and another adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, were also there, Zelensky brought the phone back to himself and said, “The president is here.” “We are all here. Our soldiers are here. The citizens of our country are here,” Zelensky said. “We are all here protecting our independence, our country, and it will continue to be this way. Glory to our defenders. Glory to our heroes. Glory to Ukraine.”

Given that he had revealed earlier this week an intelligence estimate that he was the main target of the Russian forces, Zelensky’s decision to broadcast his location was remarkable. The Telegram riposte to Putin was at least the third time this week that Zelensky has turned to social media in an attempt to speak directly to the Russian people, with the full knowledge that his calm, determined statements denouncing Putin’s war will never be shown in full on Russian state television. On the eve of the invasion, Zelensky recorded a moving, nine-minute address to the Russian people, in Russian, to debunk the lies that he was leading a neo-Nazi regime intent on attacking Russian speakers in regions of eastern Ukraine held by Russian-backed separatists.

“The Ukraine on your news and Ukraine in real life are two completely different countries — and the main difference between them is: Ours is real,” Zelensky said in the video posted on the presidency’s YouTube channel and other social media accounts on Wednesday. “You are told we are Nazis. But could a people who lost more than 8 million lives in the battle against Nazism support Nazism?” “How could I be a Nazi?” Zelensky asked, knowing that his Jewishness is no secret in a part of the world where antisemitism is still rife. “Explain it to my grandfather, who went through the entire war in the infantry of the Soviet army, and died a colonel in an independent Ukraine.” “You’ve been told I’m going to bomb Donbass,” Zelensky said, of Russian propaganda calling him the aggressor in eastern Ukraine. “Bomb what? The stadium where me and the local guys cheered for our team at Euro 2012? The bar where we drank when they lost? Luhansk, where my best friend’s mom lives?” On Thursday, more than a thousand Russians were arrested for attending banned street protests against the war, despite potentially serious legal consequences.

In remarks that night posted online by Ukrainian diplomats, Zelensky thanked them for their courage. “To all the citizens of the Russian Federation who come out to protest, I want to say: We see you. This means that you heard us. This means that you begin to trust us. Fight for us. Fight against war.”

“It’s remarkable how Zelensky has finally grown into the role,” Max Seddon, the Moscow bureau chief of the Financial Times, observed on Twitter. “When the US warned of Russia’s plans to invade, he was slammed by Ukrainians for not taking it seriously. But when the war became inevitable, Zelensky started playing the president on TV again — he’s a natural.” Late Friday, the Ukrainian president delivered sobering news about the extent of the growing attacks on the country from Russian forces and predicted that a “cruel, vicious, inhumane” assault on Kyiv could be imminent. “The night will be tough, very tough. But the morning will come,” he told the nation. Video of his remarks in Ukrainian was released with Russian subtitles.
