The UN Refugee Agency's chief Filippo Grandi blamed the mass displacement on what he called a ""senseless war"" that began on February 24.

""The number of refugees from Ukraine, tragically, has reached today 2.5 million,"" Grandi tweeted.

""We also estimate that about two million people are displaced inside Ukraine. Millions forced to leave their homes by this senseless war.""

Paul Dillon, spokesman for the UN's International Organization for Migration, said the 2.5 million people who had fled Ukraine included 116,000 nationals from other countries.

The UNHCR had been working on the estimate that four million people may eventually seek to leave Ukraine as the war continues.

But the agency said that given the scale of the exodus in less than three weeks, it would be no surprise if that figure was exceeded.

""It is quite possible that that planning figure of four million might be revised up,"" UNHCR spokesman Matthew Saltmarsh told reporters in Geneva, speaking via videolink from Poland, close to the Ukrainian border.

He said the numbers of refugees was ""certainly unprecedented since World War II"".

Before Russia invaded, more than 37 million people lived in Ukrainian territory under the control of the central government in Kyiv.

More than half of those who have fled have gone to Poland.

Poland's border guards announced Friday that 1.52 million people fleeing Ukraine had crossed the frontier, with a further 87,000 people doing so on Thursday.

Poland has championed the cause of Ukrainian refugees. The government has set up reception centres and charities have mobilised in a massive aid effort, helped by the estimated 1.5 million Ukrainians already living in the EU member state.

Polish border guards said Thursday that 140,000 people had crossed from Poland into Ukraine since the invasion.

They largely fall into three categories: Ukrainian men working in Poland who returned to join the army, migrant workers returning to take care of relatives still in Ukraine, and recently-arrived refugees who have gone back for family reasons.

Several thousand refugees, once they have crossed Ukraine's western borders, have headed on to other countries.

Russian strikes hit civilian targets in central Ukraine's Dnipro city on Friday, as Moscow's troops edged closer to the capital Kyiv that, according to its Mayor Vitali Klitschko, has lost half of its estimated 3.5 million population since the war began.

""UNHCR repeats its call for the protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure,"" Saltmarsh said.

""We are committed to stay and deliver assistance when and where access and security allow.""

NATO chief hails Poland for thousands of Ukrainian refugees

Meanwhile, North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO's) Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg also stated that the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine has paved the way for the worst refugee crisis since World War II. He also extended his gratitude to Poland for its support and for generously hosting hundreds and thousands of refugees who fled Ukraine and providing humanitarian and military assistance. ""Poland joined NATO 23 years ago. Since then, it has been a devoted and valued ally. It has contributed to our collective security in a variety of ways,"" the NATO chief remarked while addressing the Polish assembly.

Russia-Ukraine war

It is pertinent to mention here that the war between Russia and Ukraine continues to intensify and reached its seventeenth day on Saturday. The two countries have also held three rounds of peace negotiations so far, but they have failed to yield desired results. Ukraine's armed forces stated on Saturday that the Russian army has lost over 12,000 personnel and 362 tanks and other targets have also been destroyed. Meanwhile, Russia claimed to have destroyed at least 3,491 targets of Ukraine's military infrastructure.

UNHCR said the number of internally displaced people in Ukraine was at least 1.85 million, while an additional 12.65 million people are thought to have been directly affected by the conflict.

'Unprecedented' Flow

The UNHCR had been working on the estimate that four million people may eventually seek to leave Ukraine as the war continues.

But spokesman Matthew Saltmarsh said: ""It is quite possible that that planning figure of four million will be revised up.

""We've just touched 2.5 million and that's in just over two weeks, so that really wouldn't be a surprise,"" he told reporters in Geneva, via video link from Poland, close to the Ukrainian border.

Paul Dillon, the spokesman for the UN's International Organization for Migration, said 116,000 of those who had fled Ukraine were third-country nationals.

Before Russia invaded, more than 37 million people lived in Ukrainian territory under the control of the Kyiv government.

More than 280,000 of those who have fled Ukraine have already made their way to other European countries, the UN said.

Russian strikes hit civilian targets in central Ukraine's Dnipro city on Friday, as Moscow's troops edged closer to the capital.

Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said Thursday that half the city's 3.5 million population had fled and the capital ""has been transformed into a fortress"".

Freezing Wait To Cross

""UNHCR repeats its urgent call for the protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure, respect for international humanitarian law, and again thanks neighbouring countries for keeping their borders open to those fleeing,"" Saltmarsh said.

He said the agency was working with the local authorities in border nations to improve the reception conditions at the frontier, where people wait in line for hours to cross, often in freezing temperatures.

The agency is working to provide heating points where especially vulnerable people, such as pregnant women, the elderly and the disabled, can sit and keep warm while they wait.

UNHCR is also rolling out an emergency cash programme to tide refugees over.

And within Ukraine, Saltmarsh said the agency was ramping up its plans to help the millions of people forced to leave their homes.

""Core relief items for around 1.5 million people mobilised from UNHCR global stockpiles are in the pipeline,"" he said.

Steve Morgan, who set up Redrow in 1974 and is now one of Britain’s richest men, said there was no time for delays and urged the government to speed up the process of offering visas to Ukrainians.

“Watching the humanitarian crisis unfold in front of our eyes is absolutely devastating,” said Morgan, a former chairman and owner of Wolverhampton Wanderers. “We have to stop the suffering and Boris Johnson and Priti Patel have to stop the delays.”

The UK has issued about 1,000 visas while Poland has taken more than 1.2 million refugees, Hungary has accepted 190,000, Germany more than 50,000 and Italy almost 20,000.

“Offering to sponsor 1,000 Ukrainian refugees to come to the UK through the Steve Morgan Foundation is one way we can help but we need to do more,” he said. “I felt so helpless watching the images of desperate families fleeing Ukraine that I knew I had to do something. This is not the time for delays. I hope other people will do the same.”

The 69-year-old said he will meet the cost of bringing the refugees to the UK and paying for their accommodation for up to six months.

On Friday, Filippo Grandi, the UN high commissioner for refugees, said the number of Ukrainian refugees had exceeded 2.5 million since the invasion began on 24 February.

Earlier this week, ministers began considering a climbdown to allow Ukrainians with temporary visas to bring relatives to the UK after Ukraine’s ambassador called for an easing of restrictions.

While Morgan’s initiative is being paid for through his foundation, which was set up in 2001, he said it does not have the facilities to handle the logistics of the relocation programme. Staff at the foundation, which distributed almost £26m to charities struggling with the pandemic last year, have contacted a number of MPs to ask for clarity on the sponsorship process.

Morgan, whose fortune is estimated at close to £1bn, retired as chairman of Redrow, which has a stock market value of nearly £2bn, in 2019.
