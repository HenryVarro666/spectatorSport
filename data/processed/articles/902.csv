Spurred by reports of Russian atrocities outside Ukraine’s capital, and alarmed at signs that Russia’s invasion force is about to escalate assaults in eastern Ukraine, many civilians in that region are fleeing while they can, officials said Wednesday.

“The cities of the Luhansk region are in ruins,” warned one eastern governor. “Thousands of residents have not yet left. Get out of the way!”

The exodus accelerated as Western nations moved to provide more weapons to Ukraine’s military and further ostracize Russia economically with new sanctions, including restrictions on its leading banks and on the assets of President Vladimir V. Putin’s children.

The new sanctions are a response to outrage and revulsion over the atrocities, including executions and torture, that appear to have been carried out by Russian forces before they retreated from areas outside Kyiv in the past few weeks. Russia has denied responsibility, saying the atrocities were fabricated or were committed by the Ukrainians themselves.

The European Union also was weighing a ban on coal from Russia, the leading provider of fossil-fuel energy to Europe, and Russia appeared to move closer to default on its foreign debt because of U.S. currency restrictions.

“Together with our allies and our partners, we’re going to keep raising the economic costs and ratchet up the pain for Putin, and further increase Russia’s economic isolation,” said President Biden, who has described Mr. Putin as a war criminal and suggested he should not remain in power.

More than 11 million Ukrainians — roughly one in four — have fled their homes since the Feb. 24 invasion, according to the United Nations, including more than four million who have fled the country. It is the biggest refugee crisis in Europe since World War II.

The Russian military announced last week that it would focus its campaign on eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting for eight years. The redeployment came as the Russians, hampered by botched planning and fierce Ukrainian military resistance, retreated from the Kyiv area and apparently abandoned — at least for now — any effort to capture the capital in their war to subjugate the former Soviet republic.

Western military analysts have said the Russians vastly underestimated the challenges in Ukraine and that their initial invasion force of more than 150,000 has been weakened by losses, exhaustion and low morale. But that does not mean Russia’s military cannot undertake a powerful new assault in eastern Ukraine.

The shift has accelerated civilian displacement in the east. Thousands of people have been leaving, according to Ukrainian officials, and photos and videos posted online. Ukrainian officials say Russian troops have been massing in the Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv regions.

In Kramatorsk, a city in the north of the Donetsk region, photos showed crowds of people huddled at a platform in a central train station.

At least two people were killed and five injured when Russian forces launched a strike on a humanitarian aid site in the town of Vugledar in the Donetsk region, according to Pavlo Kyrylenko, the Donetsk governor.

Russian forces now control 60 percent of the town of Rubizhne, in the Luhansk region, according to the governor there, Serhiy Haidai, who said the attackers had scaled up their offensive this week.

“Evacuations are taking place under the roar of enemy guns,” Mr. Haidai wrote in a Facebook post on Wednesday, saying that approximately 30,000 people had left the region since Russia invaded. He urged remaining residents to flee before Russia scaled up attacks.

Oleg Synegubov, the state administrator for the Kharkiv military region, said Wednesday in a post on Telegram that the army would evacuate two towns in the eastern part of the country because fighting was escalating there.

The towns, Lozova and Barvinkove, are southwest of Izium, a city Russian forces seized as part of an apparent drive toward Sloviansk, which military analysts say is strategically critical to Russia’s plan to gain full control of eastern Ukraine.

Earlier this week, Oleksiy Danilov, the head of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, speaking on national television, said “large groupings of Russian troops” had been massing in the region.

“They are not going to stop,” he said. “They have a great desire to create big problems for our armed forces in this direction, and we also expect that fierce battles will be fought there for our territory in the near future.”

The Pentagon’s assessment of Russian deployments appeared to corroborate what Ukrainian officials were saying. Pentagon officials said Russia had withdrawn all of its troops arrayed against Kyiv and another city in the north, Chernihiv, and sent them back to Russia or to its ally Belarus to rearm, resupply and possibly redeploy in eastern Ukraine.

The Pentagon officials said those forces included as many as 40,000 troops that, in many cases, had departed under fierce attack from the Ukrainian military units that retook the territory.

“We believe they are all out,” one senior Pentagon official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential operational issues.

Russia now has about 30 battalion tactical groups — as many as 30,000 troops — in the east, the senior Pentagon official said. Earlier this week, Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden’s national security adviser, said Russia would most likely send “tens of thousands of soldiers to the front line in Ukraine’s east” in the coming weeks.

Largely in anticipation of this next major phase of the war, the Pentagon announced late Tuesday that it was sending $100 million worth of Javelin anti-tank missiles — roughly several hundred missiles — to Ukraine, where the weapon has been used with high success in destroying Russian tanks and other armored vehicles.

NATO foreign ministers, meeting this week, have been discussing how to further help Ukraine prosecute the war without entangling the alliance in direct combat with Russian forces.

The war, they said, is far from over, noting that however badly Russia’s forces have performed, and their retreat from areas around Kyiv notwithstanding, they are making slow and brutal progress in the east.

“Moscow is not giving up its ambitions in Ukraine,” said Jens Stoltenberg, NATO’s secretary general.

Ukrainian officials in a number of areas, including Mykolayiv in the south and the Luhansk and Donetsk regions in the east, have been sharing schedules of planned evacuations or links to online portals for people to sign up to join buses and trains that are transporting residents to safer places.

But in some besieged cities in the south, like Mariupol, it is already nearly impossible to leave, making evacuations sporadic and risky.

Attempts by the Red Cross to enter Mariupol to supervise civilian departures have repeatedly been scrubbed, leaving fearful residents to fend for themselves. On Wednesday, 500 people who had escaped Mariupol to join a Red Cross convoy in the nearby city of Berdyansk arrived in Zaporizhzhia, about 100 miles away.

The climate of fear gripping Mariupol has spread to the region of Kherson, near the Black Sea, where people have lived under occupation by Russian forces since they encircled and entered the city and its suburbs on March 2.

“Anyone who did not leave early is now stuck here,” said Evgeniya Selivantseva, a doctor from Velyka Lepetyka, a village on the Dnipro River, in the Kherson region.

Dr. Selivantseva, 38, described a deepening humanitarian crisis in the village: Gasoline stations have run out of fuel, and food and medical supplies are running low. Food is so scarce that local leaders have started a makeshift flour mill.

“We feel helpless and totally defenseless,” she said. “People are afraid to leave their homes.”

The proposed European Union ban on Russian coal, part of the bloc’s effort to further penalize Russia over atrocities in Ukraine, reflected a choice of an imported energy source that would be the easiest to replace.

Deliberations over the ban and other sanctions were set to continue into Thursday, and European Union officials and diplomats anticipated that the measures would be approved. The process reflected the challenges of reaching agreement among all 27 member nations on the penalties, which would also include banning Russian ships from E.U. ports.

If approved, the sanctions would be the harshest enforced by the bloc since the invasion.

Though the European Union depends on Russian coal, the bloc could find substitute imports more easily than for natural gas and oil.

But banning coal from Russia could send energy prices soaring for European consumers, given the existing shortages in the bloc, according to Rystad Energy, a consulting firm. Carlos Torres Diaz, a senior vice president at Rystad, called the potential sanctions “a double-edged sword.”

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has entered its second month, with casualties mounting on both sides.

Ukraine's forces continue to resist, while its President Volodymyr Zelenskyy regularly calls on the world to do more to help. Governments around the globe have imposed heavy sanctions against Moscow but have stopped short of direct intervention for fear of sparking a wider conflict.

Meanwhile, rising geopolitical risk and volatile energy and financial markets are rocking Asia.

4:00 p.m. All options would be on the table in response to any use of chemical weapons in Ukraine by Russia, British armed forces minister James Heappey said. British foreign minister Liz Truss on Monday said the country was working with its partners to verify the details of reports Russian forces may have used chemical agents in an attack on Mariupol. ""There are some things that are beyond the pale, and the use of chemical weapons will get a response and all options are on the table for what that response could be,"" Heappey told Sky News on Tuesday.

2:20 p.m. Fighting in eastern Ukraine will intensify over the next two to three weeks as Russia continues to refocus its efforts there, the U.K.'s Ministry of Defense tweeted in a regular bulletin. Russian attacks remain focused on Ukrainian positions near Donetsk and Luhansk, with further fighting around Kherson and Mykolaiv and a renewed push toward Kramatorsk, British military intelligence said. The report also said Russian forces continue to withdraw from Belarus in order to redeploy in support of operations in eastern Ukraine.

11:14 a.m. The mayor of the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol told the Associated Press that more than 10,000 civilians have died in the Russian siege of his city and that the death toll could surpass 20,000, with weeks of attacks and privation leaving bodies ""carpeted through the streets."" Mayor Vadym Boychenko also accused Russian forces of having blocked humanitarian convoys from entering the city for weeks in an attempt to conceal the carnage there from the outside world.

11:00 a.m. Japan's Cabinet has approved additional sanctions against Russia, freezing assets of 398 Russian individuals, including President Vladimir Putin's daughters and the wife of Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

10:05 a.m. Japan's wholesale inflation remained near record-high levels in March as the Ukraine crisis and a weak yen pushed up the costs of fuel and raw materials, government data shows. The corporate goods price index, which measures the prices that companies charge each other for goods and services, rose 9.5% in March from a year earlier. That followed a revised 9.7% spike in February, which was the fastest pace on record. The March index, at 112.0, was the highest level since December 1982.

6:24 a.m. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his daily video address late on Monday that Russia forces could use chemical weapons in Ukraine, but he did not say that chemical weapons have already been used. Unconfirmed reports earlier in the day had suggested that chemical weapons were used in the besieged southern port of Mariupol.

5:00 a.m. European Union officials discussing additional sanctions on Russia have failed to agree on a Russian oil embargo despite support from some countries.

Many of the ministers meeting in Luxembourg showed support for sanctions on Russian oil imports, top EU diplomat Josep Borrell says. But for others, such a ban would constitute an ""asymmetric shock,"" he says. The bloc did agree to step up the delivery of weapons to Ukraine.

1:38 a.m. Axel Springer says it has hired the former Russian state TV worker who made international headlines last month by bursting onto her then-employer's live newscast to protest the war.

Marina Ovsyannikova will report for the German company's Welt brand as a freelance correspondent, including from Ukraine and Russia. She will write for the newspaper and regularly contribute to Welt news channel coverage, according to Axel Springer.

Ovsyannikova was fined 30,000 rubles ($373 at current rates) in mid-March and could still face further prosecution in Russia.

1:30 a.m. ""This is not a friendly visit,"" Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer says in a statement issued by his office about talks just outside Moscow with Vladimir Putin.

This marked the first meeting with the Russian president by a European Union leader since the invasion of Ukraine started more than six weeks ago.

Nehammer has expressed solidarity with Ukraine and denounced apparent Russian war crimes. His government last week ordered the expulsion of a total of four Russian Embassy and Russian Consulate personnel over conduct that has ""not been in accordance with their diplomatic status"" -- generally a euphemism for spying.

Monday, April 11

10:30 p.m. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called on South Korea to send weapons to his country to defend its people against a Russian invasion.

In his 17-minute speech to South Korean lawmakers, Zelenskyy showed images of the ravages of war in Mariupol and other cities.

Seoul's defense ministry on Monday said it had rejected a request by the Ukrainian defense minister for anti-aircraft weapons, Reuters reports.

6:00 p.m. Witnessing Russia's struggles in Ukraine, China is likely reassessing any plans it had to make a move on Taiwan, a prominent Japanese scholar on China says in Tokyo.

""If China does possess a scenario of invading Taiwan, it will rethink, push back or at least make sure that all preparations are made before proceeding. It is unthinkable that they will decide to bring forward an invasion,"" Shin Kawashima, a professor at the University of Tokyo, says at the Japan National Press Club. Read more.

5:44 p.m. Tens of thousands of people have likely been killed in Russia's assault on the southeastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. ""Mariupol has been destroyed, there are tens of thousands of dead, but even despite this, the Russians are not stopping their offensive,"" Zelenskyy said in a video address to South Korean lawmakers.

5:14 p.m. Russia has destroyed S-300 anti-aircraft missile systems which had been supplied to Ukraine by a European country, Russia's defense ministry said. The ministry said that Russian sea-launched Kalibr missiles on Sunday destroyed four S-300 launchers which were concealed in a hangar on the outskirts of the Ukrainian city of Dnipro. Russia said 25 Ukrainian troops were hit in the attack. Russia did not say which European country had supplied the S-300 systems.

10:50 a.m. A senior U.S. official in Washington said Russia has appointed Gen. Alexander Dvornikov, one of its most-seasoned military chiefs, to oversee the invasion, The Associated Press reports. Dvornikov gained prominence as head of Russian forces deployed to Syria in 2015 to shore up President Bashar Assad's government during the country's devastating civil war. U.S. officials say he has a record of brutality against civilians in Syria and other war theaters.

9:41 a.m. Ramzan Kadyrov, head of Russia's republic of Chechnya, says there will be an offensive by Russian forces on the besieged port of Mariupol, Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities. ""There will be an offensive ... not only on Mariupol, but also on other places, cities and villages,"" Kadyrov said in a video posted on his Telegram channel. ""Luhansk and Donetsk -- we will fully liberate in the first place ... and then take Kyiv and all other cities."" He said, ""I assure you: Not one step will be taken back.""

5:00 a.m. Ukraine's economic output will likely contract by a staggering 45.1% this year as Russia's invasion has shuttered businesses, slashed exports and destroyed productive capacity, the World Bank said in a new assessment of the war's economic impacts. The World Bank also forecast Russia's 2022 GDP output to fall 11.2% due to punishing financial sanctions imposed by the United States and its Western allies on Russia's banks, state-owned enterprises and other institutions.

3:30 a.m. Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Monday, he said, adding he hoped to help build bridges between Russia and Ukraine and stop the ""war of aggression."" Nehammer's meeting would be the first face-to-face encounter between Putin and a European Union leader since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, triggering a broad Western effort to isolate Moscow.

""I'm going to meet Vladimir #Putin in Moscow tomorrow,"" Nehammer wrote on Twitter. ""We are militarily neutral, but (have) a clear position on the Russian war of aggression against #Ukraine,"" he wrote, referring to Austria's position. ""It must stop! It needs humanitarian corridors, ceasefire & full investigation of war crimes.""

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed to RIA news agency that Putin would be holding talks with Nehammer on Monday.

2:50 a.m. The death toll from a missile strike on the train station in Ukraine's Kramatorsk has risen to 57 people, Donetsk region governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said. Kyrylenko said 109 people were wounded in the attack, which Ukraine has blamed on Russia. Moscow has denied responsibility, saying the missile was Ukrainian.

1:38 p.m. A new grave with dozens of civilian Ukrainians was found on Saturday in Buzova, a liberated village near the capital Kyiv that for weeks was occupied by Russian forces, a local official says. Taras Didych, head of the Dmytrivka community that includes Buzova and several other nearby villages, told Ukrainian television that the bodies were found in a ditch near a petrol station. The number of dead is yet to be confirmed. ""Now, we are returning to life, but during the occupation we had our 'hotspots', many civilians died,"" Didych said.

10:41 a.m. Ukraine has banned all imports from Russia, one of its key trading partners before the war with annual imports valued at about $6 billion, and called on other countries to follow and impose harsher economic sanctions on Moscow. ""Today we officially announced a complete termination of trade in goods with the aggressor state,"" Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko wrote on her Facebook page. ""From now on, no Russian Federation's products will be able to be imported into the territory of our state.""

6:11 a.m. The British Ministry of Defense says Russian forces are continuing to use improvised explosive devices to inflict casualties, lower morale and restrict Ukrainian freedom of movement, Reuters reports. ""Russian forces also continue to attack infrastructure targets with a high risk of collateral harm to civilians,"" the ministry says in a statement, citing intelligence reports. Russia's departure from northern Ukraine leaves evidence of the disproportionate targeting of non-combatants, the statement adds.

Saturday, April 9

11:40 p.m. The European Commission pledges 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) to support Ukraine and countries receiving refugees fleeing the war following Russia's invasion, Reuters reports. ""Six hundred million of those will go to Ukraine, to the Ukrainian authorities and partially to the United Nations,"" the president of the EU's executive branch, Ursula von der Leyen, says at a fundraising event for Ukraine in Warsaw, Poland. ""And 400 million euros will go to the frontline states that are doing such an outstanding job and helping the refugees that are coming.""

11:22 p.m. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson makes a surprise trip to Kyiv to meet Zelenskyy. ""Right now a visit of Boris Johnson in Kyiv started from one-on-one meeting with President Zelenskyy,"" Andriy Sybiha, deputy head of Ukraine's president office, said on Facebook.

Officials in the U.K. confirm the meeting, saying the two are discussing long-term support for Ukraine as well as further financial and military aid. Johnson's trip is ""in a show of solidarity with the Ukrainian people,"" a Downing Street spokesperson says.

""The U.K. will send more defensive weapons to Ukraine and will work with G-7 partners to target every pillar of the Russian economy to ensure Putin fails,"" Johnson tweeted earlier on Saturday.

11:10 p.m. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala says the country should cut its dependence on Russian energy resources within five years, calling the current situation one of the Czech Republic's ""greatest security risks."" The EU member meets its gas needs almost entirely through shipments directly or indirectly from Russia, and gets roughly half its crude imports from the same source. Fiala adds the country's energy sector has to change ""completely.""

9:59 p.m. European Union countries sharing borders with Russia and Belarus bar some cargo vehicles registered in the two countries from entering due to sanctions, the Russian customs service says, according to Reuters. Vehicles used as international transport that have Russian and Belarusian number plates will not be able to move goods on EU territory, the Russian customs service says. This comes after the EU on Friday formally adopted new sanctions against Russia, including bans on the import of coal, wood, chemicals and other products, while also preventing many Russian vessels and trucks from accessing the bloc.

3:31 p.m. S&P lowers Russia's foreign currency ratings to ""selective default"" on increased risks that Moscow will not be able and willing to honor its commitments to foreign debtholders. Facing waves of sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine, Russia could face its first sovereign external default in over a century after it made arrangements to make an international bond repayment in rubles this week, even though the payment was due in dollars.

11:50 a.m. Russia's justice ministry says it has revoked the registration of 15 foreign organizations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. The Russian units of the 15 organizations, which include the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, ""were excluded due to the discovery of violations of the current legislation of the Russian Federation,"" the ministry said in a statement on Friday.

The decision, which did not give details of any violations, was announced days after New York-based HRW said it had found ""several cases of Russian military forces committing laws-of-war violations"" in Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly denied war crimes allegations by Ukraine and Western countries during its six-week-long invasion of Ukraine and denies targeting civilians.

4:10 a.m. Germany is working to end imports of Russian oil and believes it may do so this year, Chancellor Olaf Scholz says in London during a news conference with U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

The European Union is studying ways to phase out its imports of Russian oil, according to EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. But ending German dependence on Russian natural gas poses a higher hurdle. No timeline has been set for such a transition.

The U.K. has announced plans to phase out imports of Russian coal and crude oil by the end of 2022, followed by gas imports at an early date.

3:17 a.m. The U.S. believes Russia used a short-range ballistic missile to strike a railway station in east Ukraine on Friday, a senior U.S. defense official says. Ukraine said at least 50 people were killed and many more wounded in the strike.

2:15 a.m. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen pledges to offer a speedier start to Ukraine's bid to become a member of the European Union. ""It will not as usual be a matter of years to form this opinion but I think a matter of weeks,"" she says.

1:45 a.m. Slovakia has donated its S-300 air defense system to Ukraine, Prime Minister Eduard Heger says.

12:30 a.m. The Czech Republic has delivered tanks, multiple rocket launchers, howitzers and infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine among military shipments that have reached hundreds of millions of dollars and will continue, reports Reuters, citing two Czech defense sources.

Friday, April 8

10:30 p.m. The ruble rallied after Russia's central bank cut its main interest rate in a surprise move. The cut, which follows new sanctions on Russia including a U.S. ban on crude oil imports, partly reverses an emergency rate hike in late February after the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

""Today's decision reflects a change in the balance of risks of accelerated consumer price growth, decline in economic activity and financial stability risks,"" the Central Bank of Russia says in a statement reported by Interfax.

8:50 p.m. Russian citizens are spending on average 40% of their disposable income on food, about double the amount from before Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, the director of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization's Russia liaison office tells Reuters. Russian government data shows annual food inflation hit 18.75% on April 1 as the economy reels from Western sanctions. The average European Union household spends about 12% of its income on food, the director says.

Meanwhile, global food prices have hit record levels in the wake of the Ukraine war, the latest FAO data shows.

6:00 p.m. More than 30 people were killed and over 100 were wounded in a Russian rocket strike on a railway station in eastern Ukraine on Friday as civilians tried to evacuate to safer parts of the country, the state railway company says. It said two Russian rockets struck a station in the city of Kramatorsk, which is used to evacuate civilians from areas under bombardment by Russian forces.

4:50 p.m. Japan's Foreign Ministry says it will expel a number of Russian diplomats stationed in the country in Tokyo's latest response to the civilian killings reported during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Eight Russians, including diplomats, will be expelled, it announced Friday. Japan has been cautious about expelling Russian diplomats up to now, but changed course as the U.S. and European countries have moved to punish Russia diplomatically. Tokyo's decision is likely to prompt Moscow to make tit-for-tat expulsions of Japanese diplomats from Russia.

3:30 p.m. India's central bank cuts its economic growth forecast for the fiscal year that started April 1 to 7.2%, from the 7.8% projected in February, citing the Russia-Ukraine war.

""Although India's direct trade exposure to countries at the epicenter of the conflict is limited, the war could potentially impede the economic recovery through elevated commodity prices and global spillover channels,"" Reserve Bank of India Gov. Shaktikanta Das says.

There are several other factors at work, he adds. ""Financial market volatility induced by monetary policy normalization in advanced economies, renewed COVID-19 infections in some major countries with augmented supply-side disruptions and protracted shortages of critical inputs, such as semiconductors and chips, pose downside risks to the outlook.""

3:18 p.m. Ukraine says it aims to establish up to 10 humanitarian corridors to evacuate trapped civilians on Friday, but civilians trying to flee the besieged southern city of Mariupol will have to use private vehicles. The 10 planned safe corridors announced by Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk were all in southern and eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian officials say Moscow plans to seize as much territory as it can in the eastern part of Ukraine known as Donbas bordering Russia.

11:00 a.m. The chairman of Russian aluminum giant Rusal calls for an impartial investigation into the killing of civilians in the Ukrainian town of Bucha, which he described as a crime, and urged an end to the ""fratricidal"" conflict. While the statement from Chairman Bernard Zonneveld, a Dutch national, did not touch on who was to blame for the deaths of civilians in the town, it is unusual for a large Russian company to comment publicly on the conflict. ""We support an objective and impartial investigation of this crime and call for severe punishment for the perpetrators,"" he said.

10:18 a.m. Japan will phase out Russian coal imports as part of its sanctions against Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine, Japan's industry minister says, joining other Group of Seven industrialized nations. Koichi Hagiuda told a regular news conference that Japan will gradually reduce the amount imported from Russia, and eventually break Japan's dependence on its coal, saying, ""We seek to stop importing in the end."" The move comes a day after G-7 foreign ministers vowed to ""expedite"" plans to end their energy dependence on Russia by phasing out and banning Russian coal imports to punish Moscow.

9:05 a.m. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says work has begun to dig through the rubble in Borodianka, a city northwest of Kyiv that was occupied by Russian military forces. He also said ""it is much scarier"" there, with even more victims of Russian troops. In his daily nighttime video address to the nation Thursday, Zelenskyy said the Russians were preparing to shock the world in the same way by showing corpses in Mariupol and falsely claiming they were killed by the Ukrainian defenders.

4:30 a.m. Pink Floyd is releasing its first new music in almost three decades to raise money for the people of Ukraine, the band announces. ""Hey Hey Rise Up"" features Pink Floyd members David Gilmour and Nick Mason, with vocals from Ukrainian singer Andriy Khlyvnyuk of the band BoomBox. Roger Waters, who left the band in the 1980s, is not involved. The track features Khlyvnyuk singing a patriotic Ukrainian song from a clip he recorded in front of Kyiv's St. Sophia Cathedral and posted on social media.

2:51 a.m. Russia has sustained ""significant"" troop losses in Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov tells British television channel Sky News.

""We have significant losses of troops, and ... it's a huge tragedy for us,"" he says when responding to interviewer Mark Austin's question: ""You've lost thousands of troops. How many troops have you lost?""

Peskov expresses hope that the operation will achieve its goals, or end via negotiations, in the coming days but also calls verified imagery of dead civilians in Bucha a ""bold fake.""

Russia's Defense Ministry reported March 25 that 1,351 service members had been killed, and 3,825 wounded, since the start of the operation, state news agency Tass says in a brief story about the interview.

2:00 a.m. The United Nations suspends Russia from the Human Rights Council in a vote. Ninety-three member states voted for the resolution. Twenty-four voted against, including Russia and China. India was among the 58 member states that abstained. The Western-led draft resolution expressed ""grave concern regarding reports of 'gross and systematic violations and abuses of human rights' and 'violations of international humanitarian law'"" by Russia in the Ukraine war.

Thursday, April 7

11:55 p.m. The U.S. Senate overwhelmingly backs legislation to remove ""most favored nation"" trade status for Russia and its close ally Belarus over the invasion of Ukraine, allowing for higher tariffs on imports from the two countries. As voting continues, the tally in the 100-member Senate was 65-0 in favor of removing Permanent Normal Trade Relations status.

6:30 p.m. Russia's communications watchdog said on Thursday it was taking punitive measures against Google, including a ban on advertising the platform and its information resources, for violating Russian law. Roskomnadzor accused Google's YouTube video-sharing platform, which has shut out Russian state-funded media globally, of becoming ""one of the key platforms spreading fakes (fake images) about the course of (Russia's) special military operation on the territory of Ukraine, discrediting the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.""

General Assembly will vote on Thursday on a U.S. push to suspend Russia from its Human Rights Council over reports of ""gross and systematic violations and abuses of human rights"" by Russian troops in Ukraine.

5:00 a.m. The U.S. believes Russian forces have completely withdrawn from the area around Kyiv, a senior American official says.

The troops were pulling back to Belarus and Russia to regroup, the official says. They may join the fighting in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donbas, which Russia has designated the new focus of its ""special military operation"" -- what Moscow calls its invasion.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also says a small number of Ukrainians are receiving training in the U.S. to use tank-killing Switchblade drones. These Ukrainians are supposed to return to their country soon, the official says.

4:00 a.m. Chinese President Xi Jinping's personal alliance with Russian President Vladimir Putin is hampering China's diplomacy. That is becoming clearer as the war in Ukraine rages on.

Both men have laid the groundwork to stay in power until the middle of the 2030s. Both have territorial ambitions: reestablishing the former Soviet Union's sphere of influence for Putin, Taiwan for Xi. But the association comes with significant risk. Read more in this week's China Up Close.

The Hungarian prime minister, whose right-wing ruling party won by a landslide in a parliamentary election Sunday, tells a news conference he has called on Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine immediately and says he is reconsidering his country's close ties with Moscow. Yet Orban says ""if the Russians request it, we will pay in rubles,"" the Financial Times reports.

Germany and other countries have rejected Putin's demand for payment in rubles, which Russia has yet to enforce.

2:10 a.m. New U.S. sanctions on Russia add the country's top bank, Sberbank, to the list of targets, as well as family members of Russia President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. These and other international responses to Russia's invasion of Ukraine are not lost on China, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman says.

""The strong and coordinated response from the international community, including nations in the Indo-Pacific, to Russia's flagrant violations on international law and principles like sovereignty and territorial integrity sends a strong signal that such actions will not go ignored,"" Sherman tells the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

The range of sanctions and ""unprecedented"" coordination between the U.S. and its partners give Chinese President Xi Jinping a ""good understanding of what might come his way should he in fact support Putin in any material fashion,"" Sherman says.

On support for U.S. partners, Republican Congressman Michael McCaul of Texas says: ""Putin's invasion of Russia shows us how critical it is to give our allies the weapons they need before an invasion and not after."" McCaul is preparing to introduce a bill that would create ""a security assistance program for Taiwan.""

Wednesday, April 6

8:00 p.m. Mere months ago Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was on the ropes. The lira had crashed and his unorthodox monetary policy was being ridiculed in financial markets.

But the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and its subsequent struggles on the battlefield, have led to a dramatic diplomatic turnaround for Turkey, which finds itself at the center of efforts to establish a cease-fire.

It stands in contrast to China and India, who have been criticized by the global community for sitting on the fence. Read more.

6:00 p.m. Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar says in parliament that New Delhi is ""deeply disturbed"" by the reports of civilians killed in Bucha.

India, which has extensive defense dealings with Russia, has been reluctant to speak out against the invasion.

""If India has chosen a side, it is the side of peace and it is for an immediate end to violence,"" Jaishankar says.

5:37 p.m. Pope Francis condemns the ""massacre of Bucha,"" while holding up a Ukrainian flag sent to him from the town where hundreds of civilians were executed and mass graves have been found.

""Recent news from the war in Ukraine, instead of bringing relief and hope, brought new atrocities, such as the massacre of Bucha,"" he said during his weekly address. ""Cruelty that is increasingly horrendous, even against civilians, defenseless women and children. They are victims whose innocent blood cries out up to heaven and implores: 'Stop this war! Let the weapons fall silent! Stop sowing death and destruction.'""

The Kremlin said on Tuesday allegations that Russian forces committed war crimes by executing civilians in Bucha were a ""monstrous forgery"" aimed at denigrating its army.

The company, which last month suspended shipments to customers in Russia and Belarus, said it has implemented business continuity measures to minimize disruption to its global operations.

IBM, too, has suspended shipments, as Ukraine urged U.S. cloud-computing and software companies to cut off business with Russia. Servers from IBM, Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard top the market in Russia, where companies and government agencies have relied on technology developed by the West as the basis for their IT systems.

4:20 a.m. The U.S. and its Group of Seven and European Union allies on Wednesday will impose new sanctions against Russian banks and government officials and ban investment in Russia, a source familiar with the announcement tells Reuters.

3:00 a.m. NATO foreign ministers will meet with their counterparts from the Asia-Pacific this week, seeking to gain their cooperation in deepening the economic and diplomatic isolation of Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.

2:45 a.m. Asked whether the U.S. was providing military training to Ukrainians outside of Ukraine, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin says: ""To use some of the gear, certainly they have to have training, and we're doing that.""

Austin's comments come at a House Armed Services Committee hearing with Joint Chiefs of Staff Chair Gen. Mark Milley.

2:30 a.m. The United Nations has failed to function in the face of the worst war crimes since World War II, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has told the U.N. Security Council.

10:00 p.m. The 30 NATO allies would welcome Finland and Sweden into the alliance if they decided to join, but any such move is up to the two nations, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg says.

5:52 p.m. Italy has expelled 30 Russian diplomats because of security concerns, according to Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio.

5:30 p.m. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Ukraine has no option but to negotiate with Russia to end the fighting but that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin may not personally hold talks. ""All of us, including myself, will perceive even the possibility of negotiations as a challenge,"" Zelenskyy says in an interview with Ukrainian journalists broadcast on national television.

2:50 p.m. Ukrainian forces have retaken key northern terrain, forcing Russian forces to retreat from areas around the city of Chernihiv and north of the capital, Kyiv, British military intelligence says. Low-level fighting is likely to continue in some of the recaptured areas but reduce this week as the remainder of the Russian forces withdraw, the defense ministry said in a regular bulletin on Twitter. Many of the withdrawing Russian units are likely to require significant reequipping and refurbishment before they redeploy for operations in the country's east, the ministry added.

12:10 p.m. The U.S. has stopped the Russian government from paying holders of its sovereign debt totaling more than $600 million from reserves held at American banks. Under sanctions put in place after Russia invaded Ukraine, foreign currency reserves held by the Russian central bank at U.S. financial institutions were frozen. But the Treasury Department had been allowing Moscow to use those funds to make coupon payments on dollar-denominated sovereign debt on a case-by-case basis.

11:54 a.m. Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi returns home from Poland, bringing 20 evacuees from Ukraine in a show of Tokyo's latest support for the war-torn nation and neighboring countries.

9:56 a.m. Russia will respond proportionately to the expulsion of its diplomats from a number of Western countries, says Dmitry Medvedev, former Russian president and current deputy secretary of the country's Security Council.

8:00 a.m. Hungary's nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban scored a fourth consecutive landslide win in Sunday's election, as voters endorsed his ambition for a conservative, ""illiberal"" state and shrugged off concerns over Budapest's close ties with Moscow. Russia's invasion of Ukraine had appeared to upend Orban's campaign, forcing him into awkward maneuvering to explain decade-old cozy business relations with President Vladimir Putin. But he mounted a successful campaign to persuade his Fidesz party's core electorate that the six-party opposition alliance of Peter Marki-Zay promising to mend ties with the European Union could lead the country into war, an accusation the opposition denied.

Sunday, April 3

Blinken would not confirm reports that the U.S. is facilitating the transfers of Soviet-era tanks to Ukrainian forces from eastern European allies, but says that there ""are or will soon be in Ukraine more than 10 anti-tank systems for every Russian tank.""

9:44 p.m. Bucha Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk shows journalists dead bodies in an area he says Chechen fighters controlled during the month that Russian forces occupied the Ukrainian city on the northern outskirts of Kyiv.

Reuters, which was taken to the scene by Ukrainian authorities, was not immediately able to verify the mayor's allegations.

2:15 p.m. Russian naval forces continue to blockade the Ukrainian coast on the Black Sea and Sea of Azov, preventing resupply by sea, British military intelligence says.

1:00 p.m. Missiles struck Ukraine's southern port city of Odessa in the early hours of Sunday, the city council says in an online post. One of the city's ""critical infrastructure facilities"" was hit, regional administration spokesperson Sergey Bratchuk tells Ukraine's public broadcaster.

We had thought that invasions of other countries, savage street fighting and atomic threats were grim memories of a distant past,"" the pope says in an address to Maltese officials after arriving on the Mediterranean island nation for a two-day visit.

""However, the icy winds of war, which bring only death, destruction and hatred in their wake, have swept down powerfully upon the lives of many people and affected us all.""

The UK deputy representative to the UN, James Kariuki, has said reports of the massacre in the Malian town of Moura underline the extent of “Russia’s malign activity around the world, beyond Ukraine”.

“We know that, as of early 2022, around 1,000 Russian mercenary personnel have been stationed across Mali. Just as the presence of Russian mercenaries drove an increase in human rights violations and abuses in the Central African Republic last year, we fear we are now seeing the same in Mali,” Kariuki told the UN’s Security Council.

A Human Rights Watch (HRW) investigation revealed about 300 civilians and suspected members of armed groups were allegedly executed in Moura during an operation by Malian forces and foreign fighters. HRW says several sources identified the foreign fighters as Russians.

Russian mercenaries have reportedly been deployed to Africa as part of the Wagner Group, a paramilitary unit that was also allegedly aiding Russian separatists in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region. Russia has consistently denied the group’s connection to the state.

Russia’s suspension from UN rights body sends strong signal: Rights groups

The vote to suspend Russia from the UN Human Rights Council has strengthened the forum and sent a powerful message that violators cannot be members, rights organisations say.

“This sends a powerful message that the Human Rights Council is no place for states that are perpetrating massive human rights violations, including acts that amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity,” said Phil Lynch, executive director of the International Service for Human Rights.

That was echoed by Human Rights Watch, which said in a statement that the UNGA “sent a crystal-clear message to Russia’s leadership that a government whose military is routinely committing horrific rights violations has no business” on the council.

US plans to starve Russia’s ‘war machine’: Official

The US is ramping up sanctions against Russia to deprive its “war machine” of money, US Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo has said, but added that curbing Moscow’s main source of funding – exports – will take time.

“What this means is that Russia will be deprived of the capital it needs to build up its economy, but also to invest in its war machine,” Adeyemo said in an interview with the Reuters news agency.

“Because of our ability to produce energy at home, we were able to ban the Russian import of oil to America rather quickly,” he said. “It’s going to take them more time but what they’re doing is they’re reducing their dependence over time.”

Blinken says US supporting Ukraine to increase pressure on Moscow

“The problem is it may take time, and in the meantime, tremendous death and destruction. But what is so powerful here is that the Ukrainians have made it very clear that they will not subjugate themselves to Vladimir Putin’s will.”

Mariupol mayor accuses Russia of ‘burning’ corpses to try and cover up civilian killings

Mariupol’s mayor has accused Russia of attempting to cover up what he said was the killing of possibly “tens of thousands of civilians” in the city by using mobile crematoriums to burn corpses.

“One week ago, cautious estimates put the death toll at 5,000. But given the size of the city, catastrophic destruction, the duration of the blockade and fierce resistance, tens of thousands of civilians from Mariupol could have fallen victim to the occupiers,” Vadym Boychenko said in a post on Telegram.

“The world has not seen the scale of the tragedy in Mariupol since the Nazi concentration camps,” Boychenko said, accusing Russia of turning the city into a “death camp”.

The sight of civilians shot dead in the town’s streets, some with their hands tied, have triggered a global outcry and pledges of further sanctions against Russia.

Extent of Russian ‘destruction becoming more apparent’: AJE correspondent

Al Jazeera’s Resul Serdar, reporting from Kyiv, says as Russian forces leave the region around the Ukrainian capital “the scale of their destruction is becoming more apparent”.

He noted Ukraine’s prosecutor general had warned there would be more “horrors” discovered in Borodyanka, 25km (15 miles) northwest of Bucha.

“Based on that we went to Borodyanka and the scale of destruction [there] was beyond imagination,” Serdar said.

4:32 am: Pentagon says Putin has given up on taking Kyiv but ‘significant battle’ still ahead for southeastern Ukraine

US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Thursday that Russian President Vladimir Putin has given up on conquering Kyiv after his forces were soundly beaten back by the Ukrainian military.

“Putin thought that he could very rapidly take over the country of Ukraine, very rapidly capture this capital city. He was wrong,” Austin told a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee in Congress.

“I think Putin has given up on his efforts to capture the capital city and is now focused on the south and east of the country,” said Austin.

But the path of the overall war, six weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine, remains uncertain, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, told the same hearing.

For Ukraine to “win” the fight, it needs to remain a free and independent nation, with its recognised territory intact, he said.

“That’s going to be very difficult. That’s going to be a long slog,” Milley said.

“The first part of it has probably been successfully waged,” he said of the war that began on February 24.

“But there is a significant battle yet ahead down in the southeast, down around the Donbas region where the Russians intend to mass forces and continue their assault,” he said.

“So I think it’s an open question right now, how this ends.”

1:58 am: EU approves Russia coal embargo, proposes more arms to Ukraine

The European Union on Thursday said it had approved an embargo on Russian coal and the closing of the bloc’s ports to Russian vessels over the Ukraine war.

An official from the French presidency of the European Council said the moves spearhead a “very substantial” fifth round of sanctions against Moscow.

That package also includes a 10 billion euro ($10.9 billion) ban on exports to Russia, including high-tech goods, and the freezing of several Russian banks’ assets.

In addition to the sanctions, the EU also backed a proposal to boost its funding of arms supplies to Ukraine by 500 million euros, taking it to a total of 1.5 billion euros.

European Council President Charles Michel said on Twitter the package would be “swiftly approved”.

Thanks and support to @JosepBorrellF for your proposal to top up the #EuropeanPeaceFacility with a further €500M. Once swiftly approved this will bring to 1.5 billion the EU support already provided for military equipment for #Ukraine. @ZelenskyyUa — Charles Michel (@eucopresident) April 7, 2022

The new financial measures were proposed by the European Commission after the bodies of dozens of civilians were found last weekend in Bucha, near Kyiv.

It is the first time the Europeans have targeted the Russian energy sector, on which they are heavily dependent.

The EU nations import 45 percent of their coal from Russia, worth 4 billion euros a year.

The embargo will come into force at the beginning of August, 120 days after the publication of the new package in the EU’s official journal, expected on Friday.

1:28 am: WHO confirms over 100 attacks on health facilities in Ukraine

The World Health Organization (WHO) on Thursday said it had confirmed over 100 attacks on health services in Ukraine, as it called for humanitarian access to the besieged city of Mariupol.

“As of now, WHO has verified 103 incidents of attacks on health care, with 73 people killed and 51 injured, including health workers and patients,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a press conference, calling it a “grim milestone.”

Of the confirmed attacks, 89 had impacted health facilities and most of the rest hit transport services, including ambulances.

“We are outraged that attacks on health care are continuing,” the WHO chief said, adding they constituted “a violation of international humanitarian law.”

Speaking at an earlier press conference in Lviv, WHO regional director for Europe Hans Kluge lamented that while health assistance had reached many “affected areas”, some were still out of reach.

“It’s true some remain very difficult. I think a priority definitely, I think we all agree, would be Mariupol,” Kluge told reporters.

12:38 am: Support for Ukraine wanes in General Assembly as UN votes to suspends Russia from Human Rights Council

The vote was 93-24 with 58 abstentions, significantly lower than the vote on two resolutions the assembly adopted last month demanding an immediate cease-fire in Ukraine, withdrawal of all Russian troops and protection for civilians. Still the vote was “humiliating” for Moscow, FRANCE 24’s Jessica Le Masurier reports from New York:

Canada will offer Ukraine up to C$1 billion ($794 million) in new loan resources via the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and provide an additional C$500 million in military aid, the Liberal government said on Thursday.

“This support has helped respond to the humanitarian crisis, and ensure that the Ukrainian government can continue to provide essential services,” the budget said.

Canada will offer up to C$1 billion in new loan resources to Kyiv through a new Administered Account for Ukraine at the IMF.

Since 2015, Canadian troops have been training Ukrainian forces in the west of the country. In January, Ottawa said the mission would be expanded.

Canada, which has announced more than C$90 million in lethal and non-lethal weaponry to Ukraine so far, said on Thursday it proposed to provide an additional $500 million in the 2022-23 fiscal year to provide further military aid.

US President Joe Biden on Thursday called the images emerging as Russian troops withdraw from parts of Ukraine an “outrage” to humanity, as he hailed Moscow’s expulsion from the UN Human Rights Council.

“The signs of people being raped, tortured, executed – in some cases having their bodies desecrated – are an outrage to our common humanity.”

“An unknown assailant attacked the chief editor of Novaya Gazeta and Nobel prize winner in a train coach,” the independent publication said via Telegram.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that if Finland and Sweden joined NATO then Russia would have to ""rebalance the situation"" with its own measures.

Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, which it says aims among other things to degrade Ukraine's military potential and prevent it becoming a bridgehead for a NATO attack, has prompted the two Nordic countries to consider joining the US-led alliance.

If the two countries join, ""we'll have to make our western flank more sophisticated in terms of ensuring our security"", Peskov told Britain's Sky News.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Thursday it is likely that Russian forces are carrying out more ""atrocities"" in parts of Ukraine after bodies were found in the town of Bucha.

""For every Bucha there are many more towns Russia has occupied and more towns that it is still occupying, places where we must assume Russian soldiers are committing more atrocities right now,"" Blinken told journalists after meeting foreign ministers from NATO and Ukraine in Brussels. He said the US had warned ahead of Russia's invasion that part of the Kremlin's ""campaign plan was to inflict atrocities, was to target individuals, was to commit the kinds of crimes that we're now seeing to terrorise civilian populations"".

""And so this, as we saw it, was part of the game plan all along,"" he said.

""We'll get more details about what exactly that assistance is going to look like,"" Keating continued. When Ukraine's foreign minister entered this summit this morning, he said Ukraine needs three things: weapons, weapons, and weapons. So are they getting all the weapons that they want?

Ukraine is effectively using landmines in the conflict with Russia, forcing Russian armored vehicles into engagement areas where they are vulnerable to US-supplied anti-tank weaponry, the top US general told a Senate hearing on Thursday.

Novaya Gazeta, whose editor-in-chief Dmitry Muratov was co-winner of last year's Nobel Peace Prize, was among the liberal Russian media facing increased pressure in the wake of Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine.

Last month, the paper said it could no longer operate in Russia after receiving warnings from communications watchdog Roskomnadzor for failing to properly identify an organisation deemed a ""foreign agent"" by the authorities in its publications.

""The road to Chuhuiv is deserted; the debris from recent fighting litters the wayside,"" FRANCE 24's Catherine Norris-Trent reports. ""This small town southeast of Kharkiv has been caught in the crossfire for weeks. Hiding from the bombs, thousands here are still living underground.

3:28 pm: Turkey says Bucha killings 'overshadow' Russia-Ukraine talks

Images of bodies found in the Ukrainian town of Bucha and other areas near Kyiv in the wake of a Russian pullback have scuppered the positive atmosphere that followed recent talks between Russia and Ukraine, Turkey said Thursday.

Russia on Thursday accused Ukrainian negotiators of changing demands since last month's talks in Istanbul, claiming that Kyiv was not interested in ending fighting.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that on Wednesday the Ukrainian side had presented its draft agreement. ""It shows a departure from the most important provisions spelled out at the meeting in Istanbul on March 29,"" he said.

2:03 pm: Hungary breaks ranks with the EU on the issue of arming Ukraine

NATO countries are debating over whether or not they should provide hard weapons to Ukraine.

9:38 am: Ukraine urges Hungary to 'get on the right side of history' over Russia

Ukraine said on Thursday that Hungary's position that it is prepared to pay in roubles for Russian gas was an ""unfriendly"" stance that was destroying the unity of the European Union over Russia's invasion.

""If Hungary really wants to help end the war, here's how to do it: stop destroying unity in the EU, support new anti-Russian sanctions, provide military assistance to Ukraine, and not create additional sources of funding for Russia's military machine. It is never too late to get on the right side of history,"" Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko said.

6:05 am: Ukraine girds for renewed Russian offensive on eastern front

Ukraine braced for a climactic battle for control of the besieged country's industrial east, as Russian forces withdrew from the shattered outskirts of Kyiv to regroup and intensify their offensive across the Donbas region, where authorities urged people to evacuate before time runs out.

The mayor of the southern port city of Mariupol said Wednesday that more than 5,000 civilians had been killed there. Meanwhile, in areas north of the capital, Ukrainian officials gathered evidence of Russian atrocities amid telltale signs that Moscow’s troops killed people indiscriminately before retreating over the past several days.

In his nightly address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that the Russian military continued to build up its forces in preparation for a new offensive in the east, where the Kremlin has said its goal is to “liberate” the Donbas, Ukraine’s mostly Russian-speaking industrial heartland. But he said Ukraine, too, was preparing for battle.

“We will fight and we will not retreat,” he said. “We will seek all possible options to defend ourselves until Russia begins to seriously seek peace. This is our land. This is our future. And we won’t give them up.”

5:30 am: US Senate to vote on revoking Russia's trade status, oil ban

The US Senate will take up legislation Thursday to end normal trade relations with Russia and to ban the importation of its oil. Both bills have been bogged down in the Senate, frustrating lawmakers who want to ratchet up the US response to Russia’s war with Ukraine.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Russian President Vladimir Putin needs to be held accountable for what Schumer said were war crimes against Ukraine.

The trade suspension measure paves the way for US President Joe Biden to enact higher tariffs on certain Russian imports. The bill banning Russian oil would codify restrictions Biden has already put in place through executive action.

Author of the mural Sasha Korban

Today is April 6. Russia's military attack on Ukraine has been going on for six weeks. We're reporting on all the current news.

What about today?

Key points

The Air Force Command notes that the territory of the russian horde has changed the tactics of combat operations in the air; the russians are trying not to enter the zone of the defeat of our air defense and don't come into direct contact with the fighter jets. Instead, the enemy strikes missiles from the air, in particular from the airspace of Belarus.

Given this, our air defense is working non-stop; on Tuesday, April 5, the Air Force shot down eight cruise missiles of the russian occupiers.

Already 18,600 russian occupiers have died on Ukrainian land. The other day the jubilee 150th enemy plane was shot down!

The Security Service of Ukraine has obtained secret maps and lists of russian occupiers who were destroyed by the Ukrainian army in the Donetsk region. ""The maps were registered on February 22 and contain the occupiers' plans to seize the entire territory of Donetsk region,"" the SBU said in a statement. All documents will be included in the materials of criminal proceedings as evidence of the crimes of russians and putin personally for international courts.

""We are aware that the occupiers outnumber us. That they have more equipment. But we have no other choice, the fate of our people is being decided. We know what we are fighting for. And we are doing everything to win,"" Zelenskyy said in a new video message.

The UN confirms 1,500 victims since the start of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine. In fact, there are many more who have been killed and maimed by the occupiers.

The only way to prevent the expansion of the russian war outside Ukraine is to give us the fullest support, said Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. ""Maximum sanctions. All weapons. The policy of 'not provoking putin' has failed in recent years. Help us curb this evil now or risk putin checking Article 5 (NATO article that an attack on one member of the bloc is an attack on the whole bloc) later,"" Kuleba wrote.

Deputy Head of the Office of the President, Oleh Tatarov, allowed viktor medvedchuk, andrii portnov, and portnov's son to escape. This was stated by the Center for Combating Corruption. In addition, according to the CCC, tatarov is trying to unlock the accounts of the company of putin's oligarch Deripaska frozen in Ukraine (Mykolaiv Alumina Plant). How many more traitors will we learn about?

The Verkhovna Rada registered a draft resolution recognizing russia's actions in Ukraine as genocide.

The commander of the Georgian Legion fighting for Ukraine, Mamuk Mamulashvili, has stated that his unit will not take russian soldiers captive.

Humanitarian corridors

Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said she intended to evacuate Mariupol residents by a water corridor on a Turkish ship: ""There's a preliminary agreement between Erdogan and putin about opening a sea corridor for the Turkish ship to enter the Berdiansk port and take away about 100 wounded civilians, women, children, and Turkish citizens. Turkey wants to save its citizens and help us agree on a humanitarian corridor,"" Vereshchuk explained. According to her, negotiations on this corridor continue. She added that all routes and logistics are ready, but russia is pulling back.

As of April 6, 2022, 11 humanitarian corridors have been agreed upon:

From Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia by personal transport.

From Berdyansk to Zaporizhzhia by personal transport and buses.

From Tokmak to Zaporizhzhia by personal transport and buses.

From the city of Energodar to Zaporizhzhia by personal transport.

From the city of Gulyaypole to Zaporizhzhia by personal transport. Buses from the city of Zaporizhzhia with humanitarian aid will also be sent.

From the city of Melitopol to Zaporizhzhia by personal transport. Buses from the city of Zaporizhzhia with humanitarian aid will also be sent.

From Severodonetsk to Bakhmut. Meeting place: 28 Khimikiv Avenue.

From Lysychansk to Bakhmut. Meeting place: RTI, 40 Rokiv Peremohy, 324 Sosiury Street

From Popasna to Bakhmut. Meeting place: 42 Pervomaiska Street.

From the village of Hirske to the town of Bakhmut. Meeting place: 13 Haharina Street.

From Rubizhne to Bakhmut.

Residents of the Luhansk region are asked to evacuate from the region as much as possible. There will be five ""humanitarian corridors"" for evacuation today. Meeting places:

Severodonetsk: 28 Khimikiv Avenue;

Lysychansk: RTI, 40 Rokiv Peremohy, 324 Sosiury Street

Popasna: 42 Pervomaiska Street;

Hirske: 13a Haharina Street;

Nyzhne: 13 Parova Street;

Rubizhne: 11 Chekhova Street.

Authorities are urging people from Donetsk and Luhansk regions to evacuate immediately. After the start of a new offensive by the occupiers, it will be almost impossible to do it later, Minister of Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories, Iryna Vereshchuk, emphasizes.

The Kharkiv region is subject to partial evacuation, the Ministry of Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories clarified. Authorities in Kharkiv are advising residents of Lozova and Barvinkove ​​to evacuate.

The enemy plans to focus on eastern Ukraine, as the withdrawal of occupier troops from Kyiv and Chernihiv regions was by no means a ""gesture of goodwill"" before the next round of talks, as the russian authorities are trying to convey.

23:00 – During the day, almost 5,000 people were evacuated through humanitarian corridors, more than 1,200 of them from the Luhansk region, said Minister Vereshchuk.

Who's coming to Ukraine?

About financial aid, weapons, and volunteer fighters

Estonia handed over to Ukraine a batch of D-30 howitzers, ammunition for small arms, and bulletproof vests.

And the United States will allocate an additional $100 million for the purchase of anti-tank systems for Ukraine. This was announced by Secretary of State Blinken.

Thanks to concerts in different countries around the world, people managed to raise more than 83 million euros in support of Ukraine.

And the National Health Service of Great Britain will provide Ukraine with 20 ambulances. It is noted that the cars are not new, but will be able to replace cars destroyed as a result of hostilities in Ukraine. The first batch of ambulances will arrive in Lviv this week. From there, they will be sent to regions where hostilities continue.

The European Union does not want Ukraine to lose in the war and will therefore continue to arm it. This was stated by the head of the EU diplomatic corps Josep Borrell in a new statement on russia's invasion. At the same time, the representative of European diplomacy says that the European Union should avoid a direct conflict with russia.

In addition, German Chancellor Scholz said that Germany is sending all weapons from the Bundeswehr's reserves to Ukraine, which can be delivered quickly. What exactly this weapon is not yet disclosed.

20:30 – Biden said that today he signed a new package of defense assistance to Ukraine, which includes Javelin missiles.

News from partners

Candles are lit in Stockholm in memory of those killed in Ukraine.

Yesterday, the European Union's executive body launched a new disciplinary procedure against Hungary, which could freeze Prime Minister Viktor Orban's funding for undermining liberal democratic rights. It seems that Orban rubbed the wrong way not only Ukraine with his commitment to the ""russian world.""

The United States will ban Russia from using frozen foreign currency accounts in US banks to repay sovereign debt, as was previously possible, the White House said.

Turkey returns embassy staff to Kyiv after a temporary evacuation.

Pope Francis unfurls a Ukrainian flag sent from Bucha.

In Romania, a car crashed into the gates of the russian embassy. The incident took place in Bucharest. According to local media, after the collision the car caught fire, and the driver died at the scene. It is still unknown whether this is a coincidence or a planned action.

Europe is proposing to discuss asylum for russian soldiers who refuse to fight against Ukraine; European Council President Charles Michel reported on the intention to provide protection to those who do not want to kill.

After winning the election, Hungarian Prime Minister Orban reaffirmed Hungary's intention to pay for russian gas in rubles. ""If Russia asks to pay in rubles, we will pay in rubles,"" Orban said. Apparently, he sincerely believes that putin will never ask Hungary to ""denazify.""

Anonymous said they had gained access to the Kremlin's video surveillance system. ""Now we are inside the Kremlin,"" hackers say.

In Vilnius, the lake near the Russian embassy was painted in the color of blood. This is an artistic performance to draw the world's attention to the war crimes of Russia. The red color symbolizes the blood of murdered Ukrainians. Water-based paint is not harmful to animals and plants.

And the Prime Minister of Slovenia Janez Janša published a picture of how, in his opinion, the symbol of the Russian occupiers Z was born:

russia's war against Ukraine is entering a critical phase, and NATO allies are ready to provide Kyiv with all necessary assistance to counter the possible next invasion of the invaders. This was stated by NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg before the meeting of the North Atlantic Council at the level of foreign ministers.

The United States will not participate in G20 meetings attended by Russia, said US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.

Reaction to the atrocities of the russian army in Ukraine

Israeli Foreign Minister Jair Lapid has accused russians of war crimes. This is the first sharp comment from Israeli officials regarding the genocide in Bucha.

India has condemned the killings in Ukraine's Bucha and backed calls for an independent investigation.

moscow knew and deliberately conducted a campaign of atrocities in Bucha near Kyiv. This was emphasized by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken last night before leaving for a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels. ""What we saw in Bucha is not an accidental act of a criminal unit. This is a deliberate campaign: to kill, torture, rape, commit atrocities,"" Blinken said.

Ukraine already has a list of names of non-humans involved in atrocities in the Kyiv region, said Interior Minister Denys Monastyrskyi. During reconnaissance near one of the settlements of the former Borodianka district, the Ukrainian military found the headquarters of one of the battalion tactical groups (BTG) of the horde. Among the documents found is a book of staff records, a list of personnel, combat and numerical calculation, as well as a table of call signs.

What's in Russia?

russia, through its permanent representative to the UN, Vasily Nebenzyu, has admitted that it is waging a war in Ukraine, not a ""special operation."" Nebenzya used the word ""war"" instead of ""special operation"" at the UN press conference several times and admitted that the russian army was killing civilians.

And zakharova said that russian diplomats expelled from Western countries would be employed. Will everyone be accommodated in Eritrea?

Civilian personnel of the russian army is complaining about inflation, trade unions are threatening to sue. Today, the russian military-industrial complex is beginning to experience social unrest because of a sharp decline in wages and living standards. This is a logical consequence of the astronomical costs of the war and the inability to ensure stable budget revenues because of international sanctions and economic downturns, the Defense Intelligence said.

This morning, someone tried to set fire to Solovyov's villa on Lake Como (Italy) with the help of tires; unfortunately, firefighters arrived on time and managed to extinguish everything without damaging the villa.

Another drifting mine was found in the Black Sea off the island of Kefken off the coast of Turkey.

And some good news: zhirinovsky died again. This time it's final.

In russia, peskov explained the reason for the withdrawal of troops from the Kyiv region: ""The decision to withdraw russian troops from the Kyiv region was taken 'as a sign of goodwill to create favorable conditions for negotiations.'"" They really understood the main principle well: the more territories liberated, the more successful the negotiations.

It turned out that the Mir cards were issued on European chips. National Payment Card System companies no longer sell them to the card provider. There is nothing to replace imports with yet.

russia is threatening Finland with ""retaliatory measures"" if it joins NATO. ""Finland's accession to NATO would make it a target for Russian retaliation,"" said Vladimir Dzabarov, first deputy chairman of the International Committee of the Federation Council. Earlier, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that Finland and Sweden can count on NATO membership under the accelerated procedure.

What about Belarus?

Belarus is losing its human rights: Human Rights Watch has been blocked.

Like belarus, the russian occupiers can use the territory of unrecognized Transnistria to attack Ukraine. The airfield of Tiraspol is already being prepared for the reception of aircraft. In response to such assumptions, Moldovan President Maia Sandu said that the authorities had no information about the alleged preparation of Tiraspol airport for the reception of Russian aircraft, but such a risk can not be ruled out.

In belarus, three residents of Bobruisk were detained who, according to the authorities, were trying to prevent trains with russian equipment from moving towards Ukraine.

Two Belarusian citizens were detained in Poland. They are suspected of espionage for the benefit of the belarusian secret services, according to a statement from the Polish National Prosecutor's Office. Among other things, they collected data on military and civilian facilities that are crucial for Poland's defense.

Russian lies

Belgorod residents have started poisoning pigeons because of a television lie about Ukrainian biolabs. But there's really nothing funny here: it shows the depth of the disease of the society created by television.

The organizer of the russian rally in Berlin complains: ""Well, I did not know that there was such a tragedy, we would not go. My business is now destroyed. I get calls every minute from different countries with threats. My car service page was flooded with photos of corpses…."" Another one ""who knew nothing"" and was on the ""training.""

russian foreign ministry representative zakharova sings the usual verses on zombie television. According to zakharova, foreign media also became accomplices in the crimes in Bucha. In particular, America, which became an accomplice in ""this punitive action"" and ""spreading fakes,"" is to blame again. Nothing new. All around are enemies, as always.

Meanwhile, in the foreign exchange market, the official dollar exchange rate fell below 80 rubles. Moreover, on Aliexpress, it costs 146. The usual practice of a country with an ""iron curtain"" in the anamnesis. In the USSR, the dollar also had its own fictional ""exchange rate"" of 60 kopecks.

Sanctions on the aggressor!

American developer of electrical devices and components for computers Intel suspends all business operations in Russia. Earlier, the company suspended all deliveries to customers in russia and belarus.

The UK will freeze more than 60% of Russia's foreign exchange reserves. This will block Russia's access to $305 billion. This was announced by Foreign Minister Elizabeth Truss. Details of the government's decision are expected to be released this week.

Lithuanian product manufacturer Viciunu grupe will leave the russian market.

Following the Russian warship, Google sent a rosaviatsiya (russia's Federal Air Transport Agency) website.

The russian Finance Ministry said a foreign bank had refused to execute an order to pay coupon yields on russian bonds due on April 4. In fact, Russia now faces default.

According to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, Wopke Hoekstra, the country's customs arrested 14 russian yachts because of sanctions against russia. Twelve of them are only being built at shipyards, and two are under maintenance.

The United States is imposing full blocking sanctions against russia's Sberbank and Alfa-Bank. The United States is also banning new investments in the russian economy. It has been stated that the United States is trying to deprive russia of access to dollars so that it cannot service its foreign debt. The White House has said US sanctions could be tightened or eased depending on the situation.

The United States believes that sanctions will push back the russian economy by 15 years.

The United States is also imposing sanctions on putin's daughters and lavrov's wife and daughter, the White House said. Restrictions will also affect medvedev, mishustin and members of russia's Security Council.

Britain is also imposing new sanctions on russia. Among them is a ban on imports of russian iron and steel goods; a ban on new investments in russia, ban on exports to russia of oil refining equipment. The UK has also said it will stop importing russian coal by the end of 2022.

russian businessmen are trying to circumvent anti-russian sanctions; they are transferring business and capital to Turkey, which has not joined the sanctions against russia. For example, about 1,000 companies with 100% Russian capital have recently been opened in Turkey, said Izzet Ekmekcibashi, head of the Turkish-russian Business Council.

Trophies of the Ukrainian Armed Forces

The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine has allowed the territorial defense to use artillery and missile systems. This is stated in resolution №403. Previously, the Territorial Defense was allowed to use only small arms. Now our defenders will have many more battle trophies.

These days, soldiers of 81 separate airmobile brigades destroyed the electronic warfare unit of the Armed Forces of the russian federation. The EW unit was guarded by servicemen of one of the special-purpose brigades of the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the russian Armed Forces.

Life considering hostilities

The Center to Counter Disinformation at the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine once again calls for securing gadgets.

Ukrainians have begun receiving messages to recover accounts from phones stolen by the russian military in an attempt to restore access to looted ""trophies.""

An interactive Map of Cultural Losses has been launched in Ukraine. Anyone can join in filling it out by sending photos or video evidence of the destruction of cultural objects as a result of the war. This was reported on the website of the author of the project, the Ukrainian Cultural Foundation. According to the fund's estimates, more than 150 monuments and sites were either damaged or completely destroyed as a result of the war against Ukraine waged by the occupiers.

The National Police of Ukraine has opened a ""hotline"" for relatives of those killed in the hostilities in russia. Number 0 894 201 867. This line operates around the clock. Operators are ready to provide the necessary advice and clarification on the burial procedure.

Currently, in the settlements liberated from russian troops, police are working around the clock to search for and identify the dead civilians. The bodies of the victims of russia's military aggression are being sent for forensic examination to determine the cause of death. After conducting the necessary research, the bodies of the dead are handed over to relatives for burial.

Paralympic champion Serhii Yemelianov has put up for auction his Gold Medal from Tokyo 2020. The funds raised will go to volunteers to help the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The auction ends tomorrow. You can take part in it at this link.

Kyiv and region

There is still a high probability that the enemy will launch missile strikes on elements of Kyiv's military and civilian infrastructure. The Head of the Kyiv city military administration Mykola Zhyrnov warned about it.

During the 35 days of russian occupation in Hostomel, Kyiv region, more than 400 people went missing.

In Borodianka, the occupiers bombed high-rise buildings and forbade getting people buried alive from under the rubble,"" the mayor said.

The mayor of Bucha, Anatolii Fedoruk, said that he had witnessed the execution of several people by russians. ""I myself saw several episodes. There were three civilian cars trying to evacuate towards Kyiv and they brutally shot them. There was a pregnant woman, her husband crying and begging not to shoot her, but they took and simply brutally shot them,"" the mayor reports.

russian General Vitalii Shkolenko, who ordered the shelling of Bucha and Irpin, turned out to be Ukrainian. He is a native of the Uman district of the Cherkasy region. He used to visit relatives from Bucha and Irpin many times. For such, hell must begin in life.

In Vorzel, the occupiers hung the heads of chickens on clothespins on clotheslines… The civilized world will never understand the purpose of such actions, but only one thing is clear, in the russian hinterland, where people who now destroy all life on our earth come from psychopathy is the norm. The russian army is implementing everything that only a sick human psyche can imagine.

Also Vorzel. These are corgi paws. There is a ladder behind the house. To which russian fascist villains nailed dogs with self-tapping screws and then flayed them here. And then ate! What they didn't eat, they put in a bag to warm the pieces up. What words to describe all the atrocities of the rabid horde?

""After Bucha, Irpin, Hostomel, we thought we were ready for anything. But Borodianka. This is the most horrible thing I've ever seen,"" said Oleksiy Kuleba, head of the Kyiv Regional Office. ""Rescuers from all over Ukraine are going to dismantle the blockages in Borodianka. The occupiers wiped the village from the face of the earth,"" Kuleba said.

Donetsk and Luhansk regions

One person died in Rubizhne last night. Five more were injured. This was announced by the head of the Luhansk Regional State Administration Serhii Haidai.

In addition, 11 residential buildings were destroyed in the region. Such are the consequences of yesterday's shelling by the russian army of the residential districts of Rubizhne, Lysychansk, Popasna, Severodonetsk, and Toshkivka. ""In the old part of Severodonetsk, garages caught fire; in Rubizhne, tanks with nitric acid are burning. Preliminary, without consequences. Three floors of the residential building in Popasna burned down at once. During the russian shelling, one Rubizhne resident died. 5 locals are wounded. Seven were taken out of the rubble alive,"" the statement said.

Heavy fighting and airstrikes by russian aircraft continue in besieged Mariupol. The humanitarian situation in the city is deteriorating. More than 160,000 people have no electricity, communications, access to medicine, heat, or water.

Former mayor of Rubizhne Serhii Hortov did not just side with the russian invaders; he passed on information about people with a pro-Ukrainian position to the occupiers. This was announced by the head of the Luhansk Regional State Administration Serhii Haidai. ""Apart from joining the occupiers, the mayor is also actively cooperating with them in identifying Ukrainian activists. He is simply betraying them. He is such a traitor who betrays people with a pro-Ukrainian position to the occupiers,"" the head of the region said.

At the same time, according to Haidai, Ukraine was able to ""slightly break the plans of the occupiers, who wanted to create a picture of how the mayor hands over the keys to the occupiers, and how they are welcomed."" He submitted a petition, and the president signed a decree establishing a military-civil administration in Rubizhne. This means that ""the mayor is now nobody,"" and even the russian occupiers no longer need this traitor.

Also today, the 503rd Marine Battalion refuted the statements of the russian media about the capture of personnel in Mariupol.

After the widespread international genocide in Bucha, Russia's top leadership ordered the destruction of any evidence of crimes committed by its army in Mariupol. The russians left all the dirty work to the collaborationists. Eyewitnesses report that the russians recruited local and DPR terrorists to special brigades. They collect and burn the bodies of Mariupol residents murdered and killed as a result of the russian invasion. The work of these groups is directly coordinated by the self-proclaimed mayor-collaborator Kostiantyn Ivashchenko.

12:30 – The head of the Donetsk Regional State Administration Pavlo Kyrylenko said that orcs fired at the city of Vuhledar from jet artillery. They hit the place of humanitarian aid. According to preliminary data, two civilians were killed and five were injured.

15:40 – the russian military fired on Severodonetsk, and ten high-rise buildings caught fire. The number of injured is being clarified, said the head of the Luhansk regional military administration Gaidai.

The invaders destroyed one of the buildings of the city hospital in Mariupol, burning almost 50 people alive. The mayor of the city Vadym Boichenko reported about it. He called on the West to tighten sanctions against Russia for all these atrocities. According to the mayor, according to preliminary estimates, 5,000 people died in Mariupol during the month of the blockade. About 210 of the dead are children.

In the past day alone, Mariupol has been bombed 118 times! This was announced by the Verkhovna Rada Commissioner for Human Rights Liudmyla Denisova.

20:30 – The Return Alive Foundation was able to deliver aid to Mariupol surrounded by russians! The fund's team managed to hand over thermal imagers, quadcopters, and power banks to the city's defenders. Despite the overly complex logistics, they promise to do it again and again!

21:30 – The number of victims due to the shelling of Vuhledar increased to 4 people.

Zaporizhzhia region

Five deputies from the OPZZh party in Mariupol were informants and fire adjustors of the occupiers. They helped the Russians quickly paralyze the city and create a humanitarian catastrophe, said the Mariupol City Council. Now the supporters of genocide in Mariupol are actively promoting the establishment of the occupation administration. All materials on collaborationists have already been submitted to the SBU.

In Vasylivka, Zaporizhzhia region, occupation forces looted a communal building housing the Department of Social Protection and the Service Center for Educational Institutions. They stole all computer equipment, including the one where databases with residents were stored. As a result of the russians' actions, it will be impossible to transfer pensions and other social benefits. Now local authorities have blocked the entrance to the premises so that the occupiers can no longer steal community property.

Kherson region

The Armed Forces of Ukraine liberated the villages and settlements of the Kherson region: Dobrianka, Novovoznesenske, and Trudoliubivka. The head of the Kryvyi Rih military administration Oleksandr Vilkul clarified that these settlements were in the most dangerous southern direction from Kryvyi Rih, and now there is the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

Fighting is currently underway near the village of Oleksandrivka.

""I would very much like Kherson to be released. We can't say all the information now, but yes, we have plans to release Kherson,"" Ukrainian Interior Ministry adviser Vadym Denysenko said in an all-Ukrainian telethon.

In the Novotroitske community, the russian military abducted Serhii Maksymenko, a deputy of the regional council and head of the Svitanok agricultural enterprise, the local newspaper Trudova Slava reported. According to locals, it happened three days ago. The deputy was taken away together with his son after searches. Nothing is currently known about their whereabouts.

Due to constant threats and ""suggestions"" for cooperation from the Russian military, Skadovsk Mayor Oleksandr Yakovlev left the city. He said he had to do so.

Russian military surrounded the village of Novooleksiivka, Henichesk district. There are searches in houses, grenade launchers were fired at a residential building. The number of victims is currently unknown. The publication Ukrainian South reported this with reference to the Crimean Tatar Resource Center.

It was very hot in the Vysokopillia United Territorial Community today. The day began at 5 am with loud and active explosions. Those who remained in Vysokopillia sat in basements and other safe places until about 12:00. Everyone wants liberation, nerves are already giving up, but we must hold on. People believe that victory is very close.

20:00 – The Armed Forces of Ukraine liberated another village in the Kherson region, Osokorivka! The General Staff reports.

Zhytomyr region

More than 90 mines were found by specialized services on a separate section of the road of one of the forests of the Narodychi forestry. The State Agency of Forest Resources of Ukraine writes on the Facebook page about the beginning of demining of the northern territories of the Zhytomyr region liberated from russian troops. The equipment and the area near the administrative buildings need a thorough inspection. Citizens are asked not to visit the forest during martial law due to danger to life.

Chernihiv region

This is what the facilities of Chernihivvodokanal water supply company, which suffered as a result of shelling by the yussian military, look like. It is unknown when the centralized water supply will be restored in Chernihiv. ""Due to serious damage, neither the company nor even the city will be able to restore these facilities today without external assistance,"" Chernihivvodokanal reports.

Kharkiv region

Do not try to transfer them, eliminate them alone, etc. As soon as you see the ammunition, call 101,"" Sinegubov said.
