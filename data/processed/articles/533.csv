0,536d4fe3-270b-4d3c-98d4-b03230c5667c,[],,"In an impassioned address to the Security Council today detailing the death and destruction caused by Russian forces in Moscow’s war against Ukraine, the President of that country challenged members to uphold international law or disband the United Nations, calling for the convening of a global conference in Kyiv to determine how to reform the world security system.

The Council also heard briefings from the Secretary-General and two other senior United Nations officials on the political and humanitarian situations in Ukraine.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, speaking via videoconference, said that the most terrible war crimes since the Second World War are being committed in his country. Likening their actions to those of Da’esh, he said Russian troops are deliberately destroying Ukrainian cities, creating mass starvation, shooting columns of civilians trying to escape hostilities, blowing up shelters and creating conditions in their temporarily occupied territories to ensure that most civilians are killed. The massacre in Bucha is only one of many examples of what the occupiers have perpetrated for 41 days, in Mariupol, Kharviv and dozens of other communities. Hatred by the aggressor is supported at the State level and exported through a system of propaganda, seeking to provoke a global food crisis that could lead to famine in Africa, Asia and elsewhere, he added, stressing that the security which the Council must guarantee simply “is not there”.

Emphasizing that the purposes of the Charter of the United Nations, especially Article I — to maintain international peace and security — are being violated, he asked: “What is the point of all other Articles? […] Are you ready to close the United Nations? Do you think that the time for international law is gone?” If not, “you need to act immediately”. To support peace in Ukraine, the Council must either remove the Russian Federation from the organ as an aggressor and source of war, so it cannot block decisions made about its own war, or the Council can “dissolve yourselves altogether” if there is nothing it can do other than engage in conversation. “Ukraine needs peace. Europe needs peace. The world needs peace,” he insisted.

The Charter must be immediately restored and the system reformed so that the veto power does not represent the right to die, and so there is fair representation in the Council of all world regions, he said. If tyranny in places from Syria to Somalia had received a response, it would have ceased to exist, and an “honest peace” would have prevailed. A war against Ukrainian citizens would not have been launched. Instead, the world watched, and turned its eyes away from the occupation of Crimea, the war against Georgia, the taking of Transnistria from the Republic of Moldova and the preparations of Russian troops for another war near the border. The Russian military and those who gave them orders must be brought to justice and charged with war crimes in Ukraine, before a tribunal similar to the one created in Nuremburg.

He then proposed the convening of a global conference in Kyiv to determine how to reform the world security system, establish guarantees for the recognition of borders and the integrity of countries, and to assert the rule of international law. Stressing that the laws set in 1945 in San Francisco for the creation of a global security organization will remain elusive without reforms, he said “we must do everything within our power to pass on to the next generation an effective United Nations”, with the ability to respond preventively to security challenges and force aggressors to peace. For its part, Ukraine stands ready to provide a platform for an office of a newly updated security system, he said, proposing the creation of a “U24 office” specializing in preventive measures to maintain peace.

United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres described the war in Ukraine as one of the greatest challenges ever to the international order and the global peace architecture, because of its nature, intensity and consequences. “We are dealing with the full-fledged invasion, on several fronts, of one Member State of the United Nations, Ukraine, by another, the Russian Federation — a permanent member of the Security Council — in violation of the United Nations Charter, and with several aims, including redrawing the internationally recognized borders between the two countries,” he said.

The Russian offensive has also led to massive displacement and increases in the prices of food, energy and fertilizers; disrupted supply chains; and put more pressure on many developing countries that were already on the verge of debt collapse. “For all these reasons, it is more urgent by the day to silence the guns,” he emphasized, noting that he had asked the United Nations Emergency Relief Coordinator, Martin Griffiths, to travel to the Russian Federation and Ukraine to press for an urgent humanitarian ceasefire.

Mr. Griffiths, also Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, addressing the Council via videoconference from Geneva, recounted his recent trip to Moscow, noting that the Secretary-General had charged him with bringing both sides together to explore specific and sustained ways to reduce suffering. On 4 April, during “long and frank” exchanges with Minister for Foreign Affairs Sergey V. Lavrov and his Deputy, Sergey V. Vershinin, and separately with the Deputy Minister for Defence, he discussed humanitarian convoys, including the four which have already been able to move. He outlined possibilities for building on this cooperation, sharing suggestions for mutually agreed upon military freezes to allow for evacuations of civilians and for the safe passage of life-saving aid.

While his counterparts assured him of their intent to carefully study these ideas, he said he came away from these meetings believing that “we have a long road ahead of us — but it must be travelled, and we will travel it”. He expressed hope of traveling to Ukraine on 7 April to lead discussions with senior Government officials on these same issues, and to see first-hand the humanitarian response. Updating the Council on the situation on the ground, he said that, over the last six weeks, at least 1,430 people have been killed, among them over 121 children — figures which are likely a “serious underestimate”. Homes, bridges, hospitals and schools have been damaged and destroyed, while almost 11 million people have been forced to flee — more than 4.2 million of whom are now refugees in neighbouring countries and beyond. In total, over a quarter of Ukraine’s population has fled.

Rosemary Dicarlo, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, noting that the number of civilians killed has more than doubled since her 17 March briefing, said: “The devastation wrought on Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities is one of the shameful hallmarks of this senseless war.” The war is also threatening Ukraine’s future, with early assessment projections by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) suggesting that, if the war continues through 2022, 18 years of hard-won socioeconomic gains in Ukraine could be rolled back. While there has been a reported reduction of Russian troops and attacks around Kyiv and Chernihiv, such moves should not be merely tactical, repositioning forces for renewed attacks, she said, pointing out that the General Assembly has twice called for Russian forces to fully withdraw from Ukrainian territory and cease all military operations.

Diplomatic efforts to end the war, including direct talks between Ukrainian and Russian representatives, have continued, she said, commending Turkey for hosting these discussions, as well as the efforts of many others engaging with the Russian Federation and Ukraine. Welcoming the willingness for continued engagement to reach a mutual understanding, she said this requires good faith and earnest efforts, stressing: “Any progress in the negotiations should be translated quickly into action on the ground.”

In the ensuing discussion, most Council members expressed shock at the images of corpses coming out of Bucha while the Russian Federation’s representative argued that those images are fake and were staged.

The representative of the United States said that the heart-wrenching stories that will never get to be heard are the ones of those in the images from Bucha. Based on available data, her delegation determined that the Russian forces committed war crimes in Ukraine. Describing how the Russian Federation is sending Ukrainians to its “filtration camps”, she condemned Moscow’s literal disrespect for human rights. The United States seeks suspension of the Russian Federation from the Human Rights Council as that country uses its membership as a platform for its propaganda.

Albania’s representative, also backing the call for the Russian Federation’s suspension from the Human Rights Council and noting this is the fourteenth meeting on Ukraine since 31 January, said the Russian Federation’s imperial dreams have gone nowhere. Kyiv has proved “too hard to swallow”. Describing Bucha as “an open-air graveyard”, he said it is impossible to convince anyone that the destroyed tanks cluttering the roads or the civilians killed in arbitrary executions are staged scenes. “You may muzzle media back home, but you cannot fool satellite images,” he said. “These are facts, hard and sickening proof of the atrocities committed.” The Russian Federation has cancelled itself from international law, “but the law will pursue it”, he assured, deploring that the Russian Federation has become the world’s most sanctioned country in history and an international pariah to the point it is forced to seek support from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Syria.

Likewise, the Head of the European Union delegation, in its capacity as observer, welcomed the International Court of Justice’s provisional steps ordering Moscow to immediately suspend military operations, as well as the International Criminal Court Prosecutor’s investigation into war crimes and crimes against humanity, and the work of the independent Commission of Inquiry. He described the European Union’s assistance to Ukraine’s Prosecutor General in the collection and preservation of evidence of war crimes, assuring: “It is clear, there will be accountability.” The bloc has adopted sanctions against Moscow, its financial and defence sectors and those individuals enabling and financing the aggression.

The Russian Federation’s representative retorted that Ukraine’s President is laying blame at the feet of the Russian military, criminally staging events when, in fact, Ukrainian civilians were killed by their own radicals. As it turns out, Russian forces should not have withdrawn from Bucha. Describing flagrant inconsistencies being promoted by Ukraine and the Western media, he cited recordings of Ukrainian radicals shooting civilians. To the video presented by the Ukraine delegation to the Council, he responded that the corpses “in no way” resemble those who reportedly had been on the ground for four days.

The only dilatants who could fall for this fake are Western countries, who, in fact, do not care about Ukraine, he said, imploring Ukraine’s President to recognize that his country is only a pawn in the geopolitical game against the Russian Federation. President Zelenskyy should find a solution, because “we came to Ukraine to bring long-awaited peace to the blood-soaked land of Donbas”. He called for cutting out the malignant Nazi tumour that is consuming Ukraine and would, in time, consume the Russian Federation, urging Mr. Zelenskyy not to allow the West to achieve its goals.

China’s delegate said that the disturbing images from Bucha must be verified before jumping to conclusions and accusations. Citing the negative impact of sanctions against the Russian Federation on developing countries, he said such measures are not effective and only expedite the spillover effects. Indiscriminate sanctions are tantamount to weaponizing the world economy, he pointed out, adding that smaller countries should not be caught between the great Powers and must not be forced to take sides. He urged the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) members to engage with the Russian Federation head-on to establish a balanced, effective and sustainable security framework in the region. Beijing will play a constructive and responsible role in that regard.

Kenya’s representative recounted that, in April 1994, even as genocide engulfed Rwanda, there were members of the Council contesting the horrifying truth that a million people were being murdered. “We should stand warned that the inability of the Council to establish the facts and attribute responsibility may enable the risk of escalation into far worse crimes,” he stressed.

In a similar vein, Brazil’s delegate warned against the Council becoming “a bystander of the shocking consequences of the conflict”. So far, the organ is failing in its role to foster a constructive dialogue between the parties, with the aim of brokering an effective peace settlement to this conflict. “We deeply regret that the Security Council has not been able to speak with one voice throughout this crisis,” he said.

The United Arab Emirates’ delegate urged the Council not to forget the impact of war on a nation’s cultural heritage and identity, expressing concern over the dozens of cultural sites that have been damaged and calling on all sides to refrain from such wilful destruction. She also expressed alarm over how the war is affecting the 1.2 billion people in 47 developing countries who are at risk due to rising food prices and looked forward to efforts by the Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance.

Also speaking today were the representatives of Gabon, Ireland, Mexico, India, France, Norway, Ghana and the United Kingdom.

The meeting began at 10:05 a.m. and ended at 1:10 p.m.

Letter Dated 3 April from Russian Federation Requesting Meeting on 4 April

VASSILY A. NEBENZIA ( Russian Federation ) asked about his delegation’s two requests to convene a meeting on 4 April in connection with the horrific provocation by Ukrainian forces in Bucha. The United Kingdom’s delegation, as Council President, considered it was possible to “blatantly violate” the Council’s rules, marking the second time it issued a decision that was not coordinated with anyone. “This is an outrageous situation,” he stressed, asking the United Kingdom on what basis it decided it could act in such a manner, in contravention of existing norms and rules, and stressing that it should have instead convened a meeting and addressed the advisability of his delegation’s request through a vote. He pointed out that during its Council Presidency, the Russian Federation did not refuse any of the six meetings on Ukraine. He demanded an explanation for the decision and expressed hope the United Kingdom would not challenge any future requests.

BARBARA WOODWARD ( United Kingdom ) clarified that her delegation, as Council President, did not in fact reject the Russian Federation’s request. It had indeed received the letter on 3 April requesting the meeting and, in line with the obligation of the Presidency to schedule a meeting, proposed to either schedule it alongside today’s meeting — which is well within the 48-hour limit, the convention — or to hold the meetings sequentially. The Russian Federation turned down both proposals. Her delegation shares the view this is an urgent situation, and it offered either to hold a separate meeting today, or to combine a meeting with the current one. She noted that the presidency made its decisions in line with the Council’s provisional rules of procedure and that it had received no other complaints from Council members.

Mr. NEBENZIA ( Russian Federation ) replied that his delegation has evidence that “this was no less than 24 hours before” the meeting that it had requested. “This is confirmed in documents,” he said, nonetheless expressing hope that her comments reflect the fact that the presidency will not refuse Member State requests for meetings.

Ms. WOODWARD ( United Kingdom ) noted that her delegation, as Council President, will not refuse to hold meetings in the future.

Briefings

ANTÓNIO GUTERRES, Secretary-General of the United Nations, said that the war in Ukraine is one of the greatest challenges ever to the international order and the global peace architecture, founded on the Charter of the United Nations, because of its nature, intensity and consequences. “We are dealing with the full-fledged invasion, on several fronts, of one Member State of the United Nations, Ukraine, by another, the Russian Federation — a permanent member of the Security Council — in violation of the United Nations Charter, and with several aims, including redrawing the internationally recognized borders between the two countries,” he said. He said he will never forget the horrifying images of civilians killed in Bucha and had immediately called for an independent investigation to guarantee effective accountability. He was also deeply shocked by the personal testimony of rapes and sexual violence that are now emerging. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has spoken of possible war crimes, grave breaches of international humanitarian law and serious violations of international human rights law.

The Russian offensive has also led to massive displacement and increases in the prices of food, energy and fertilizers; disrupted supply chains; and put more pressure on many developing countries that were already on the verge of debt collapse. “For all these reasons, it is more urgent by the day to silence the guns,” he emphasized, noting that he had asked the United Nations Emergency Relief Coordinator, Martin Griffiths, to travel to the Russian Federation and Ukraine to press for an urgent humanitarian ceasefire. But as Secretary-General of the United Nations, it is his duty to call the attention of the Council to the serious damage being done to the global economy, and particularly to vulnerable people and developing countries, he stressed. United Nations analysis indicates that 74 developing countries, with a total population of 1.2 billion people, are particularly vulnerable to spiking food, energy and fertilizer costs. Debt obligations take up some 16 per cent of developing countries’ export earnings. In small island developing States, the figure is 34 per cent and rising.

Some countries are moving from vulnerability into crisis, and signs of serious social unrest are emerging, as the flames of conflict are fuelled by inequality, deprivation and underfunding. “With all the warning signals flashing red, we have a duty to act,” he said, noting that the Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance he set up in March has made some initial recommendations for the consideration of Member States, international financial institutions and others. He urged all countries to keep markets open, resist unjustified and unnecessary export restrictions, and make reserves available to countries at risk of hunger and famine. “This is not the time for protectionism. Humanitarian appeals must be fully funded,” he said, stressing: “People caught up in crisis around the world cannot pay the price for this war.” While the use of strategic energy stockpiles and additional reserves could help to ease the energy crisis in the short term, the only medium- and long-term solution is to expedite the deployment of renewable energy, which is not impacted by market fluctuations.

“The war in Ukraine must stop — now,” he said, stressing the need for serious peace negotiations, based on Charter principles. Expressing deep regret over the divisions that have prevented the Council from acting not only on Ukraine, but also on other threats to peace and security around the world, he urged the Council to do everything in its power to end the Ukraine war and to mitigate its impact, both on the suffering people of Ukraine and on vulnerable people and developing countries worldwide.

ROSEMARY DICARLO, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, said that the security situation in Ukraine has seriously deteriorated since her 17 March briefing. The number of Ukrainian civilians killed has more than doubled; Ukrainian cities continue to be mercilessly pounded, often indiscriminately, by heavy artillery and aerial bombardments; and hundreds of thousands of people remain trapped in encircled areas under nightmarish conditions. “The devastation wrought on Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities is one of the shameful hallmarks of this senseless war,” she said. The horror deepened this past weekend, as shocking images emerged of dead civilians, some with hands bound, lying in the streets of Bucha, the town near Kyiv formerly held by Russian forces. Many bodies were also found in a mass grave in the same locality. Reports by non-governmental organizations and media also allege summary executions of civilians, rape and looting in the Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Kyiv regions.

Diplomatic efforts to end the war, including direct talks between Ukrainian and Russian representatives, have continued, she said, commending Turkey for hosting these discussions, as well as the efforts of many others engaging with the Russian Federation and Ukraine. Welcoming the willingness for continued engagement to reach a mutual understanding, she said this requires good faith and earnest efforts, stressing: “Any progress in the negotiations should be translated quickly into action on the ground.”

While there has been a reported reduction of Russian troops and attacks around Kyiv and Chernihiv, such moves should not be merely tactical, repositioning forces for renewed attacks on Ukrainian cities and towns, she said, pointing out that the General Assembly has twice called for Russian forces to fully withdraw from Ukrainian territory and cease all military operations. Noting the reported withdrawal of Russian forces from around the Chernobyl nuclear site, she said the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reports that this will hopefully allow it to conduct an assistance and support mission to provide technical advice and to deliver equipment, where necessary, as soon as possible. All Ukraine nuclear sites must be fully protected and secured, and military operations in or around these locations must be avoided.

Expressing grave concern over the persistent use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area in or near populated areas, she said such weapons are causing most civilian casualties, as well as massive destruction of civilian infrastructure, including residential buildings, hospitals, schools, water stations and electricity systems. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has received credible allegations that Russian forces have used cluster munitions in populated areas at least 24 times. Allegations that Ukrainian forces have used such weapons are also being investigated. Emphasizing that indiscriminate attacks are prohibited under international humanitarian law and may amount to war crimes, she said: “The massive destruction of civilian objects and the high number of civilian casualties strongly indicate that the fundamental principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution have not been sufficiently adhered to.”

As of 4 April, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported a total of 85 attacks on health‑care facilities causing at least 72 fatalities and 43 injuries, she said. Seriously concerned about reported cases of arbitrary arrests and enforced disappearances of persons who have been vocal against the Russian invasion, she called for their immediate release. She also pointed to allegations of conflict-related sexual violence perpetrated by Russian forces, including gang rape and rapes in front of children. The United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine continues to seek to verify all these allegations, she said, noting disturbing videos depicting abuse of prisoners of war on both sides.

“The many credible allegations of serious violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law, from the areas recently retaken from Russian forces, must not go unanswered,” she said, supporting efforts to examine these allegations and gather evidence, and stressing the need for accountability and justice. Gravely concerned about the risk of human trafficking, as one quarter of Ukraine’s population is displaced, she said suspected and verified cases are surfacing in the surrounding countries, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM).

The war is also threatening Ukraine’s future, she said. Early assessment projections by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) suggest that, if the war continues through 2022, Ukraine faces the prospect of losing 18 years of socioeconomic progress. This would set the country — and the region — back decades and leave deep long-term social and economic fissures, she said, highlighting UNDP’s work to preserve Ukraine’s hard-won development gains, including helping the Government to sustain essential governance structures, basic services and livelihoods, such as through cash-based assistance. The war has damaged Europe’s security architecture; its economic repercussions are evident far from the battlefield, she said, warning that the longer the war continues, the greater the risk of it further weakening global peace and security institutions and mechanisms. “This war was started by choice. There is no inevitability to it or to the suffering it is causing,” she said, adding: “The United Nations is ready to do everything within its means to help bring it to an end.”

MARTIN GRIFFITHS, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, addressing the Council via videoconference from Geneva, said that, over the last six weeks, at least 1,430 people have been killed, among them over 121 children — figures which are likely a “serious underestimate”. Homes, bridges, hospitals and schools have been damaged and destroyed, while almost 11 million people have been forced to flee — more than 4.2 million of whom are now refugees in neighbouring countries and beyond. In total, over a quarter of Ukraine’s population has fled.

He said the ground and air offensives and counteroffensives are making life nearly impossible for civilians, with families, the elderly, women and children trapped by the fighting. For more than five weeks, the people of Mariupol have been caught up in fighting, while other cities — including Chernihiv, Sumy and Kharkiv — remain cut off from essential goods and services. “Perilous conditions are hampering our efforts to access civilians — or for them to access us,” he stressed. “Civilians must be allowed to move to safer areas without the fear of attacks”. He called on all parties to protect civilians and allow impartial humanitarian organizations safe, rapid and unimpeded access to all civilians in need, wherever they are in Ukraine.

For its part, the Organization and its partners are making every effort to dramatically increase support, he said. Six thousand volunteers from the Ukraine Red Cross, together with those from local non-governmental organizations in eastern Ukraine, are working tirelessly to provide a lifeline to communities. The World Food Programme (WFP) meanwhile has reached more than 1.3 million people with cash and food assistance and plans to reach around 2.5 million people in this month. Health partners report more than 180 tons of medical supplies were delivered, with another 470 tons on the way, addressing the health needs of 6 million people.

He also announced that, after much effort, in the past day another convoy was dispatched from the humanitarian coordination hub in Dnipro to Severodonetsk — in the far east. “Today, food, winter clothing, non-food items, medicine and hygiene kits were offloaded to the Ukraine Red Cross and will reach the hands of those in most need in Severodonetsk,” he assured. Following notification to both parties, four convoys in total have provided critical support to people in some of the cities with ongoing fighting. Several more are planned. “While these are initial steps, it gives us a basis to now expand, taking our efforts to scale,” he said.

Reiterating his concern over the growing number of reports of human trafficking, sexual violence, exploitation and abuse in Ukraine and the region — many of which overwhelmingly impact displaced women and children — he said the United Nations is bolstering protection and gender-based‑violence services to provide specialized care for survivors. These services are being designed and carried out in collaboration with Ukrainian civil society organizations, he added.

He went on to recount his recent trip to Moscow, noting that the Secretary‑General had charged him with bringing both sides together to explore specific and sustained ways to reduce suffering, including by pursuing a humanitarian ceasefire. On 4 April, during “long and frank” exchanges with Minister for Foreign Affairs Sergey V. Lavrov and his Deputy, Sergey V. Vershinin, and separately with the Deputy Minister for Defence, he discussed humanitarian convoys, including the four which have already been able to move. He outlined possibilities for building on this cooperation, sharing suggestions for mutually agreed upon military freezes to allow for evacuations of civilians and for the safe passage of life-saving aid.

While his counterparts assured him of their intent to carefully study these ideas, he said he came away from these meetings believing that “we have a long road ahead of us — but it must be travelled, and we will travel it”. On 7 April, he expressed hope of traveling to Ukraine to lead discussions with senior Government officials on these same issues, and to see first-hand the humanitarian response.

On that point, he said the humanitarian response since February has been scaled up, allowing his team to meet the needs of 1.4 million people. Stressing that funding must not be diverted from other crises, he said conflict, climate shocks and COVID-19, compounded by soaring food and fuel costs, could push another 47 million people into severe food insecurity. The total number of people who will not know where their next meal comes, could be driven to 325 million — by far the highest in recent history and well over double what it was less than three years ago.

He closed by reminding the Council of what it already knows: “The world cannot afford this war.” He called on the Council — and all Member States with influence — to support the pursuit of peace and alleviation of humanitarian suffering, for the sake of the people of Ukraine and those around the world who cannot afford to bear the burden this war will impose on them.

Statements

VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, President of Ukraine , briefing the Council via videoconference, said he had returned from Bucha on 4 April, an area newly liberated from Russian troops. Stressing that “there is not a single crime they would not commit there”, he recounted how they sought and purposely killed anyone who served Ukraine, including women outside their houses, and then burned the bodies. Addressing the Council today in honour of the deceased, those who were shot in the head after being tortured and others who were thrown into wells, crushed by tanks while sitting in their cars, those whose limbs were cut off and tongues pulled out because the aggressors did not hear what they wanted to hear.

He said these actions are no different than those of Da’esh, except that they are being perpetrated by a member of the Security Council, one that is destroying borders and taking away the rights of countries that are self‑determined, in constant pursuit of a policy to destroy ethnic and religious diversity. Hatred by the aggressor is supported at the State level and exported through a system of propaganda, seeking to provoke a global food crisis that could lead to famine in Africa, Asia and elsewhere. He said the security which the Council must guarantee simply “is not there” and that the global institution established to prevent aggression “simply cannot work effectively”. While the world can now witness Russian military actions in Bucha, it has yet to see what those troops have done in other occupied Ukrainian cities. “Geography might be different, but cruelty is the same, crimes are the same,” he assured. “Accountability must be inevitable”.

He recalled Article I of the Charter of the United Nations, stating that the purpose of the United Nations is to maintain peace. With this foundational document being violated, starting with Article I: “What is the point of all other Articles?”, he asked, drawing attention to the most terrible war crimes being committed since the Second World War. Russian troops are deliberately destroying Ukrainian cities, deliberately creating mass starvation, shooting columns of civilians trying to escape hostilities, blowing up shelters and creating conditions in their temporarily occupied territories to ensure that most civilians are killed. The massacre in Bucha is only one of many examples of what the occupiers have perpetrated for 41 days in Mariupol, Kharviv and dozens of other communities.

The response by the Russian Federation is always the same, he said, most evidently on display after its downing of a Malaysian Airlines flight over Donbas or during the war in Syria: “They will blame everyone just to justify their own actions,” and offer different versions of events to obfuscate what is true, he said. They will say all videos are staged. However, it is 2022: There is evidence and satellite images. Full, transparent investigations can be conducted, maximum access can be granted for journalists and maximum cooperation extended with international institutions, with involvement by the International Criminal Court to establish truth and full accountability. “Every Member State of the United Nations should be interested in this,” he said, in order punish those who believe they can get away with anything.

He described Russian leaders as the colonizers of ancient times, who need Ukraine’s wealth and who have deported hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians to their own country and abducted children. He accused the Russian Federation of wanting to “turn Ukrainians into silent slaves” and openly stealing everything, “starting with food and ending with gold earrings that are pulled out and covered with blood”. He warned that “we are dealing with a State that is turning the veto of the United Nations Security Council into the right to die”, undermining the global security architecture. If it continues, countries will rely only on the power of their own arms to ensure security, rather than international law and global institutions.

Going forward, he offered options. The United Nations can be simply closed. “Are you ready to close the United Nations? Do you think that the time for international law is gone?”, he asked. If not, “you need to act immediately”. The United Nations Charter must be immediately restored and the system reformed so that the veto does not represent the right to die, and so there is fair representation in the Council of all world regions. Determination is needed. The massacres from Syria to Somalia, from Afghanistan to Yemen and Libya should have been stopped long ago. If tyranny had received a response to the war it had waged, it would have ceased to exist, and an “honest peace” would have prevailed. A war against Ukrainian citizens would not have been launched.

Instead, the world watched, he said, and turned its eyes away from the occupation of Crimea, the war against Georgia, the taking of Transnistria from the Republic of Moldova and the preparations of Russian troops for another war near the border. The Russian military and those who gave them orders must be brought to justice and charged with war crimes in Ukraine, brought before a tribunal similar to the one created in Nuremburg. Recalling that Holocaust organizer Adolf Eichmann did not go unpunished, he said “it is time to transform the United Nations”.

He proposed the convening of a global conference in Kyiv to determine how to reform the world security system, establish guarantees for the recognition of borders and the integrity of countries, and to assert the rule of international law. Stressing that the laws set in 1945 in San Francisco for the creation of a global security organization have not been achieved, and will remain elusive without reforms, he said “we must do everything within our power to pass on to the next generation an effective United Nations”, with the ability to respond preventively to security challenges and force the aggressors to peace. “The power of peace must become dominant.”

For its part, Ukraine stands ready to provide a platform for an office of a newly updated security system. He proposed the creation of a “U24 office” that specializes in preventive measures to maintain peace and recalled his country’s evacuation of more than 1,000 people from Afghanistan at its own expense, taking in people of different nationalities and ethnic groups, without distinction. “We helped all of them,” he emphasized, conveying its moral right to propose reform of global security system.

Now, decisions are needed from the Security Council in support of peace in Ukraine, he said. He recommended either removing the Russian Federation as an aggressor and source of war, so it cannot block decisions made about its own war, and then exerting utmost efforts to establish peace. Or the Council can “dissolve yourselves altogether”, he said, urging its members to admit if there is nothing they can do other than engage in conversation. “Ukraine needs peace. Europe needs peace. The world needs peace,” he insisted. He then asked them to watch a video.

Ms. WOODWARD ( United Kingdom ), speaking in her national capacity, then thanked President Zelenskyy for his leadership in wartime and the extraordinary fortitude and bravery of the Ukrainian people during the unprovoked and illegal invasion.

LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD ( United States ) gave her own account of the refugee crisis in parts of Europe, noting that she returned last night from her trip to the Republic of Moldova and Romania. Behind bombed‑out buildings are destroyed lives, she said, telling the stories of three Ukrainians she spoke to. They are just a few among the more than 10 million people displaced, of whom about 4 million people left Ukraine, she stressed. Commending the “big heartedness” of the neighboring countries that host them, she said the United States has committed $1 billion in new humanitarian funding to support these refugees and is welcoming 100,000 refugees from Ukraine to her country. The heart-wrenching stories that will never get to be heard are the ones of those in the images coming out of Bucha. Based on available data, her delegation determined that the Russian forces committed war crimes in Ukraine. Describing how the Russian Federation is sending Ukrainians to their “filtration camps”, she condemned Moscow’s literal disrespect for human rights. The United States seeks suspension of the Russian Federation from the Human Rights Council. Moscow uses its membership in that organ as a platform for its propaganda. Recalling 141 Member States voted in the General Assembly against the Russian aggression, she said “now is the time to match those words with action”, she said.

FERIT HOXHA ( Albania ), describing the events described by President Zelenskyy as “revolting”, commended Ukrainians for their heroic resistance and resilience. “You have the world on your side,” he said. “Slavia Ukraine.” Noting that this is the fourteenth meeting on Ukraine since 31 January, he said the Russian Federation’s imperial dreams have gone nowhere. Kyiv has proved “too hard to swallow”. While the Russian army is in disarray, it has not stopped its shelling and bombardments, leaving behind unspeakable horrors and soul-crushing images: executions of people with a bullet in the neck, or with their hands tied behind their backs; people shot on their bicycles. There are images of mass graves and looted homes, acts that are usually only attributed to thugs. He described Bucha as “an open-air graveyard”, noting that, time and again, the Council has heard that the Russian Federation is not to blame. Yet, it is impossible to convince anyone that the destroyed tanks cluttering the roads or the civilians killed in arbitrary executions are staged scenes.

“You may muzzle media back home, but you cannot fool satellite images,” he said, or non-governmental organizations on the ground. “These are facts, hard and sickening proof of the atrocities committed.” These crimes, verified by Human Rights Watch, call for answers, investigations, accountability and justice. The Russian Federation has the obligation to abide by the laws of war, including the 1949 Geneva Conventions and its First Additional Protocol, and the International Court of Justice opinion that it must halt its military activities. The Russian Federation has cancelled itself from international law, “but the law will pursue it”, he assured. He expressed support for the call to suspend the Russian Federation from participating in the Human Rights Council, noting that it has blocked the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Mission in Ukraine, denying the international community of the eyes it needs there and leading to more war crimes and humanitarian disasters. Indeed, it is out-gunned and out-numbered by the Ukrainian resistance. It has become the world’s most sanctioned country in history and an international pariah to the point it is forced to seek support from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Syria.

EDWIGE KOUMBY MISSAMBO ( Gabon ) said that one day of war is one day too many. While the conflict is in its sixth week, the number of displaced people now exceeds the 10 million mark, including nearly 4 million refugees in neighbouring countries. This is a frightening humanitarian catastrophe, with transregional knock-on effects, she said. Expressing concern about reports of atrocities in Bucha, she stressed the urgent need for a United Nations to carry out an independent probe into the incidents. The Security Council should not lose sight of its responsibility to restore peace and security by offering an alternative to war. This war has gone on too long, she said, calling for a ceasefire, and the creation of the conditions for the safe, unfettered deployment of humanitarian aid to the populations in distress. Expressing her country’s appreciation to the neighbouring countries of Ukraine, she asked that the same welcome be granted to all people in distress without distinction of origin or of race, including African nationals and students.

Mr. NEBENZIA ( Russian Federation ) said the Emergency Relief Coordinator should know better than anyone the efforts being made by his country to organize humanitarian corridors. Without any participation from Ukraine, the Russian Federation saved 123,500 people in Mariupol. Over 600,000 have been evacuated to the Russian Federation since the special operation began. “We’re not talking about coercion or abduction,” he clarified, adding that their voluntary decisions are supported by videos on social media. To Ukraine’s President, he said: “We place on your conscience the ungrounded accusations against the Russian military,” which are uncorroborated by eye-witnesses. Recalling the many hopes tied to the President’s election, as he had pledged an end to the war in Donbas and protection for its Russian-speaking inhabitants, he said “we were on the verge of correcting injustices” sparked by the events at Maidan in 2014. However, those hopes failed to materialize, as the President now calls people in Donetsk and Luhansk a subspecies, repeating remarks by his predecessor who said those people would “rot in their basements”. He accused the Ukrainian President of launching a linguistic inquisition against Russian speakers in the region, and being responsible for the explosions occurring across Ukraine “because there was, unfortunately, no other way to bring peace to the Donbas”.

He went on to blame Ukraine’s President for refusing to comply with the Minsk agreements. To claims that there are no Nazis in Ukraine, he retorted: “Not only are they there, they are running the show”, calling Ukraine’s national heroes Nazi collaborators, responsible for the killing of Russians, Ukrainians, Poles and Jews. While Ukraine’s President pretends not to acknowledge Ukrainian Nazis, they are often young people and “they’re not concealing it”, he said. They decorate their clothes with swastikas and give Nazi greetings to one another. There are many in the national battalions, including the Azov battalion. And they are not just killing Russian prisoners and soldiers; they are killing their own people, showing unrivalled cruelty by using civilians as human shields. Reading out testimonials about cruelty of Ukrainian nationals, including from a grandmother who said the Azov battalion did not allow her to leave her basement, and offering accounts of girls who were stripped naked and had their jewellery stolen, he went on to describe Ukrainians in Mariupol who since 25 February have taken up armed positions and fired against residential buildings. When asked why they were taking these actions, he said Ukrainian soldiers replied that they would do so until they destroyed the Russian spirit. It was the Donetsk people’s republic forces who helped one woman escape.

He accused Ukraine’s President of laying blame at the feet of the Russian military, criminally staging events when, in fact, Ukrainian civilians were killed by their own radicals. As it turns out, Russian forces should not have withdrawn from Bucha. Describing flagrant inconsistencies being promoted by Ukraine and the Western media, he cited recordings of Ukrainian radicals shooting civilians. To the video presented to the Council, he responded that the corpses “in no way” resemble those who reportedly had been on the ground for four days. The only dilatants who could fall for this fake are Western countries, who in fact do not care about Ukraine. He implored Ukraine’s President to recognize that his country is only a pawn in the geopolitical game against the Russian Federation and questioned how people could sink to such depths of cruelty, notably laid bare by the Azov battalion. He expressed hope President Zelenskyy would find a solution, because “we came to Ukraine to bring long‑awaited peace to the blood-soaked land of Donbas”. He called for cutting out the malignant Nazi tumour that is consuming Ukraine and would, in time, consume the Russian Federation, urging President Zelenskyy not to allow the West to achieve its goals. He must make decisions that are right for his country.

GERALDINE BYRNE NASON ( Ireland ) stressed that the world has witnessed a level of destruction not seen in Europe in many years, pointing particularly to the shocking images of civilians lying dead in the streets of Bucha and piled into improvised mass graves. There can never be impunity for such crimes, she said, calling for full investigation and prosecution by domestic and international courts, including the International Criminal Court. Noting that her country will continue to support such efforts, she called for accountability and justice for the victims and survivors of this war. “We at this table share that responsibility in face of such atrocities,” she said, calling on the parties to the conflict to comply with international humanitarian law. Pointing to increasing allegations of sexual violence by Russian soldiers, she stressed that conflict-related sexual violence can constitute a war crime and that the perpetrators of such crimes must be held accountable. Echoing the Secretary-General’s call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, she highlighted the spillover effects of the war throughout the world, including deterioration of food security, surging energy prices and increasing poverty, with the most vulnerable and impoverished in developing countries to suffer the most.

RONALDO COSTA FILHO ( Brazil ) echoed calls for an independent and thorough investigation of the recent human rights violations in Ukraine, while reiterating pleas for a broad, effective and immediate cessation of hostilities. Noting that Brazil supported the General Assembly’s recently adopted resolution on the country’s humanitarian situation, he said the Council “must not become a bystander of the shocking consequences of the conflict”. So far, the organ is failing in its role to foster a constructive dialogue between the parties, with the aim of brokering an effective peace settlement to this conflict. “We deeply regret that the Security Council has not been able to speak with one voice throughout this crisis,” he said, adding that it should support civilians wishing to flee to safety and urging the parties to grant safe passage. Meanwhile, there can be no politicization of humanitarian actions nor selective application of international humanitarian law, and geopolitical objectives must not supersede the quest for peace nor prolong the suffering caused by war.

MARTIN KIMANI ( Kenya ) said the continued contestation of the truth about Bucha — even as the world beholds civilians murdered with their hands tied behind their back — “is the surest sign that we stand on the precipice”. In April 1994, even as genocide engulfed Rwanda, there were members of the Council contesting the horrifying truth that a million people were being murdered. “We should stand warned that the inability of the Council to establish the facts and attribute responsibility may enable the risk of escalation into far worse crimes,” he stressed. What started as a special military operation is now a war which has led to thousands of dead civilians and millions of refugees, and no one can doubt that there are flagrant violations of international law, international humanitarian law and the Charter of the United Nations under way in Ukraine. Condemning the unjustifiable actions undertaken in recent weeks, he called for an impartial and prompt United Nations investigation into the atrocities committed in Bucha and urged the parties to make clear to their military officers that they will be held to account for their actions. He also called for the urgent safe passage of civilians, especially from Mariupol, Kherson and other besieged cities.

JUAN RAMÓN DE LA FUENTE RAMÍREZ ( Mexico ) recalled that, through two General Assembly resolutions, the international community has sent a strong, clear message against the invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation. Noting that the International Court of Justice also demanded the immediate suspension of military operations on Ukraine territory, he said it is up to the United Nations to ensure compliance with the Court’s decisions. All mechanisms for the peaceful settlement of disputes established by international law must be used towards that common goal. Strongly condemning the atrocities committed in Bucha, he said the international community must protect the civilian population. Mexico supports the Secretary-General’s call for prompt, impartial investigations to identify the perpetrators. It will also closely follow the work of the International Criminal Court, which is investigating alleged international crimes committed in Ukraine, as well as the Commission on Inquiry, created for the same purposes by the Human Rights Council. The efforts of the international community to deal with the humanitarian crisis are only temporary, he said, stressing that the solution must be an immediate cessation of hostilities and a political agreement.

T.S. TIRUMURTI ( India ) said that since the Council last discussed Ukraine, the security and humanitarian situations have only deteriorated. Describing recent reports of civilian killings in Bucha as deeply disturbing and condemning them unequivocally, he called for an independent investigation and expressed his hope that the international community will continue to respond to Ukraine’s humanitarian needs. India supports calls urging for safe passage guarantees to deliver essential humanitarian and medical supplies and has been sending aid to Ukraine and its neighbours. It continues to call for the immediate cessation of violence and an end to hostilities. “When innocent human lives are at stake, diplomacy must prevail as the only viable option,” he stressed, taking note of the parties’ ongoing efforts in that regard. Also voicing concern that the impact of the crisis is being felt beyond the region with increasing food and energy costs - especially for many developing countries – he said it is in everyone’s interest to work constructively, both within and outside the United Nations, towards an early resolution to the conflict.

ZHANG JUN ( China ) welcomed the round of talks between Ukraine and the Russian Federation, urging the international community to create space for diplomacy, instead of creating obstacles and adding fuel to the fire. His country attaches great importance to humanitarian aid, calling on parties to the conflict to abide by the principle of civilian protection. Calling for neutrality and impartiality in humanitarian assistance, he said civilians should be spared from any violence. Turning to the disturbing images from Bucha, he said they must be verified before jumping to conclusions and accusations. Citing the negative impact of sanctions on developing countries, he said such measures are not effective and only accelerate the spillover effects. Indiscriminate sanctions are tantamount to weaponizing the world economy, he pointed out, deploring that more than 30 years after the end of the cold war, geopolitical risks remain. Stressing the need to uphold sovereignty of States, he said that smaller countries should not be caught between the great Powers and must not be forced to take sides. He urged the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) members to engage with the Russian Federation head-on to establish a balanced, effective and sustainable security framework in the region. China’s only goal is peace, and Beijing will play a constructive and responsible role in that regard.

NATHALIE BROADHURST ESTIVAL ( France ), stressing that the war of aggression has reached a new threshold of horror following events in Bucha, Borodianka and Motyiyn, condemned in the strongest terms the atrocities committed by Russian forces, which could constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity. Moscow has added to its disgrace that of invoking lies and denial. She urged the Council not to give in to hatred and to instead take action, first and foremost by maintaining the strongest possible pressure on Moscow to compel it to end its war, which is compromising global security. Stressing that France, with its European partners, will continue to support Ukraine, she said credible, independent inquiries must be allowed to judge these actions. She called on the sides to cooperate with the International Criminal Court and the Human Rights Council Commission of Inquiry. International humanitarian law must be respected, and civilians and humanitarian personnel protected. Noting that the European Union has mobilized €500 million in urgent support, she said all efforts must be made to achieve a cessation of hostilities. After this is secured, France will support Ukraine’s authorities in seeking a political solution, while maintaining dialogue with the Russian Federation. She also called on the Russian people to find ways to express their opposition to the aggression and to break the logic of hatred.

MONA JUUL ( Norway ), stressing that the need for peace in Ukraine could not be more urgent, said her delegation is appalled by the reports emerging from the areas around Kyiv and other regions. “We are deeply shocked by the atrocities committed against civilians in places that have been held by Russian forces, including Bucha,” she added, citing evidence of mass graves, as well as the destruction of homes, schools, hospitals and other civilian infrastructure. “Russia is desperate to hide the truth about the war,” she said. However, atrocities must be investigated and those responsible must be brought to justice. She welcomed the establishment by the Human Rights Council of a Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine and urged the International Criminal Court to investigate all alleged violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law, while urging Moscow and anyone holding evidence to fully cooperate with those investigations. Norway has called for a negotiated solution to end the war, in view of the massive suffering and displacement, the global implications of the conflict and the fact that reconstruction will take decades.

HAROLD ADLAI AGYEMAN ( Ghana ) echoed concerns raised over the prolongation of the war in Ukraine and the increasing humanitarian cost arising from the unjustified aggression by the Russian Federation. Expressing grave concern over reports of alleged gross violations of international humanitarian law and international criminal law, including emerging reports and images of killings and human rights violations, he echoed the call for an independent, impartial and thorough investigations to establish facts and to hold all perpetrators accountable. The killing of children, the elderly, medical personnel, humanitarian workers and journalists is particularly deplorable, he said, condemning such acts unreservedly. Calling for restraint by all sides and emphasizing the urgency of an unconditional nationwide cessation of hostilities, he urged the Council to focus its attention on confidence-building measures that facilitate a negotiated settlement, and on the wider question of European security on the basis of international law and other internationally agreed frameworks.

LANA ZAKI NUSSEIBEH ( United Arab Emirates ) said the briefings delivered today are a reminder of the rapidly deteriorating conditions in Ukraine, with the rising death toll a grim reflection of the human cost of war. To the shocking images emerging from Bucha, and the crimes they entail, she said: “We must establish what has happened here,” underscoring the imperative that “we do not get caught up in a war of narratives”. Existing mechanisms must be able to conduct investigations and she voiced support for an independent investigation. With the war now in its sixth week, an immediate cessation of hostilities is imperative. The United Arab Emirates views ongoing negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv as “a very positive development” and remains hopeful that they can translate to de‑escalation on the ground. She urged others to support these efforts, noting that establishing a viable humanitarian ceasefire could offer a bridge to broader negotiations. The priority must be to alleviate civilian suffering. The Council must continue to reaffirm the need for all parties to abide by their international humanitarian law obligations, and to the principles of distinction and proportionality.

Difficulties for providing humanitarian access must be urgently addressed. Stressing that false narratives and disinformation cause real harm for humanitarian organizations, she said technology has only increased the scale and speed of harmful information in reaching audiences online. She also urged the Council not to forget the impact of war on a nation’s cultural heritage and identity, expressing concern over the dozens of cultural sites that have been damaged and calling on all sides to refrain from such willful destruction. She expressed alarm over how the war is affecting the 1.2 billion people in 47 developing countries who are at risk due to rising food prices and looked forward to efforts by the Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance.

Ms. WOODWARD ( United Kingdom ), Council President for April, speaking in her national capacity, recalled that the United Nations was created in the wake of a European war of aggression that laid waste to Europe and engulfed the world. Yet, the world is seeing another war of aggression in Europe, hearing again today about the devastating impact of the Russian Federation’s unilateral and illegal military action on Ukraine, on surrounding countries and the region, and on the security and prosperity of the wider world. Now, as the Russian Federation is forced into retreat from areas around Kyiv, the brutality of the invasion is laid bare, she said, noting the horrific images from the towns of Bucha and Irpin of civilians deliberately killed in areas from which Russian forces have recently withdrawn. These acts, and all other credible incidents, must be investigated as war crimes. Her country fully supports the work of the International Criminal Court and the work of the Ukrainian Prosecutor General and other national prosecutors. “As we and so many others have said so many times, all of this could be stopped if the Russian Federation ends this war now,” she said.

Mr. NEBENZIA ( Russian Federation ), taking the floor again, pointed again to the events in Bucha, which led to far-reaching conclusions by Western countries. All units of the Russian armed forces fully withdrew on 30 March from Bucha as a gesture of good faith. During the time when the town was under Russian control, not a single civilian suffered from any kind of violence. People moved around freely and used their cellphones. The Russian army supplied 450 tons of humanitarian assistance to the towns in Kyiv Oblast. People were not prevented from leaving the towns to the north. The southern areas of Bucha, including residential areas, were shelled around the clock by Ukraine forces. On 31 March, the mayor of Bucha confirmed that there were no more Russian soldiers left in town; he did not mention any people being shot with hands tied. It is hard to believe that the mayor would not have noticed 280 corpses on the street. In an eight-minute video about a mop-up operation by Ukraine’s police on 2 April, there were no bodies of civilians on the street. Testimonies of crimes by the Russian armed forces appeared on the fourth day after their withdrawal.

He expressed displeasure at how these Ukrainian videos were picked up by Western media and human rights organizations that claim to be impartial, adding that, if bodies were out in the open for several days, they would have shown signs well known to forensic specialists. The New York Times even went further to report that the bodies had been there since 20 March. In videos circulated by Ukraine, there were many bodies wearing a white armband. White armbands were worn by civilians after the entry of Russian forces. In one of the videos posted on social media by Ukraine radicals, there is a call to shoot anyone not wearing a blue armband. One member of the municipal council of Bucha stated, in an interview by Medusa, that she did not see the Russian armed forces execute civilians and that the Ukrainian armed forces are guilty of most violations.

He warned that Ukrainian disinformation and staging experts are preparing staged videos for future release by Western media, predicting that there will be a further horrible provocation similar to the one about Bucha. The aim is to depict Russian soldiers as murderers and rapists, he said, adding that modern technology allows for the creation of any video. To his United States counterpart, he said her country’s crusade to expel the Russian Federation from the Human Rights Council was a manipulation, reminding other delegations that the United States left that organ when it criticized United States soldiers in Afghanistan.

SERGIY KYSLYTSYA ( Ukraine ) said that his Russian counterpart decided to quote from an interview in Medusa, but failed to quote the interview in full. The woman he had quoted said that Russian soldiers gave dry rations, and after lowering them, they tossed grenades into the basement. This is Moscow’s idea of humanitarian assistance. He asked the Russian representative how Russians got to the level of cruelty of the Nazis and when they started enjoying acting like Nazis by killing civilians, attempting to redraw internationally recognized borders and deciding to resolve the Ukrainian issue in the way that Adolf Hitler attempted to resolve the Jewish issue. “I’m appalled over your cynical and outright lie that you don’t hit civilian targets,” he said. “You hit civilian targets and you killed civilians.”

He said that, at a press conference the Russian Federation gave on Monday, Mr. Nebenzia stated that civilians were killed by the Russian army. In Mr. Nebenzia’s mind, a hospital destroyed by the Russian army on Monday was a military target and a child killed there was a Ukrainian nationalist. However, Ukraine will win and so will the world. If there is anything to thank the Russian representative for, it is his acknowledgement of a “war” the Russians waged against Ukraine, not a “special military operation”. That confession should impact the United Nations assessment of what is happening in the centre of Europe. Mr. Nebenzia should be reminded that former German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop denied any knowledge of concentration camps and racial extermination policies, but was found guilty by the Nuremberg war crime tribunal, adding: “We all know what happened to him on 16 October in 1946.”

OLOF SKOOG, Head of the European Union delegation, speaking in its capacity as observer, said the Russian Federation’s war of aggression is in a blatant violation of international law, the Charter and the “acquis” of OSCE, jeopardizing the rules-based order, as well as European and global security. Stressing that the images from Bucha are a “stain on our common humanity”, he demanded that Moscow immediately stop its military aggression, unconditionally withdraw all forces from Ukraine’s entire territory and fully respect its territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence within its internationally recognized borders, as demanded by General Assembly resolution A/ES-11/1.

Accusing the Russian Federation of directing attacks against civilians and targeting civilian infrastructure, he welcomed the International Court of Justice’s provisional measures ordering Moscow to immediately suspend military operations, as well as the International Criminal Court Prosecutor’s investigation into war crimes and crimes against humanity, and the work of the independent Commission of Inquiry. He described the European Union’s assistance to Ukraine’s Prosecutor General in the collection and preservation of evidence of war crimes, assuring: “It is clear, there will be accountability.” The European Union has adopted sanctions against Moscow, its financial and defence sectors and those individuals enabling and financing the aggression. It has mobilized € 1.1 billion in emergency aid, on top of the €2.4 billion in humanitarian, emergency and early recovery assistance provided to Ukraine since 2014. And in the largest operation under the Civil Protection Mechanism, 29 European countries, together with Norway and Turkey, have sent over 13,000 metric tons of medicines, hospital equipment, ambulances and firefighting equipment, food aid and energy supplies. A Ukraine Solidarity Trust Fund also has been set up to channel support to post-war reconstruction, he added, calling for an immediate ceasefire, safe passage for civilians and uninterrupted humanitarian access.",https://www.un.org/press/en/2022/sc14854.doc.htm

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

Spurred by reports of Russian atrocities outside Ukraine’s capital, and alarmed at signs that Russia’s invasion force is about to escalate assaults in eastern Ukraine, many civilians in that region are fleeing while they can, officials said Wednesday.

“The cities of the Luhansk region are in ruins,” warned one eastern governor. “Thousands of residents have not yet left. Get out of the way!”

The exodus accelerated as Western nations moved to provide more weapons to Ukraine’s military and further ostracize Russia economically with new sanctions, including restrictions on its leading banks and on the assets of President Vladimir V. Putin’s children.

The new sanctions are a response to outrage and revulsion over the atrocities, including executions and torture, that appear to have been carried out by Russian forces before they retreated from areas outside Kyiv in the past few weeks. Russia has denied responsibility, saying the atrocities were fabricated or were committed by the Ukrainians themselves.

The European Union also was weighing a ban on coal from Russia, the leading provider of fossil-fuel energy to Europe, and Russia appeared to move closer to default on its foreign debt because of U.S. currency restrictions.

“Together with our allies and our partners, we’re going to keep raising the economic costs and ratchet up the pain for Putin, and further increase Russia’s economic isolation,” said President Biden, who has described Mr. Putin as a war criminal and suggested he should not remain in power.

More than 11 million Ukrainians — roughly one in four — have fled their homes since the Feb. 24 invasion, according to the United Nations, including more than four million who have fled the country. It is the biggest refugee crisis in Europe since World War II.

The Russian military announced last week that it would focus its campaign on eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting for eight years. The redeployment came as the Russians, hampered by botched planning and fierce Ukrainian military resistance, retreated from the Kyiv area and apparently abandoned — at least for now — any effort to capture the capital in their war to subjugate the former Soviet republic.

Western military analysts have said the Russians vastly underestimated the challenges in Ukraine and that their initial invasion force of more than 150,000 has been weakened by losses, exhaustion and low morale. But that does not mean Russia’s military cannot undertake a powerful new assault in eastern Ukraine.

The shift has accelerated civilian displacement in the east. Thousands of people have been leaving, according to Ukrainian officials, and photos and videos posted online. Ukrainian officials say Russian troops have been massing in the Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv regions.

In Kramatorsk, a city in the north of the Donetsk region, photos showed crowds of people huddled at a platform in a central train station.

At least two people were killed and five injured when Russian forces launched a strike on a humanitarian aid site in the town of Vugledar in the Donetsk region, according to Pavlo Kyrylenko, the Donetsk governor.

Russian forces now control 60 percent of the town of Rubizhne, in the Luhansk region, according to the governor there, Serhiy Haidai, who said the attackers had scaled up their offensive this week.

“Evacuations are taking place under the roar of enemy guns,” Mr. Haidai wrote in a Facebook post on Wednesday, saying that approximately 30,000 people had left the region since Russia invaded. He urged remaining residents to flee before Russia scaled up attacks.

Oleg Synegubov, the state administrator for the Kharkiv military region, said Wednesday in a post on Telegram that the army would evacuate two towns in the eastern part of the country because fighting was escalating there.

The towns, Lozova and Barvinkove, are southwest of Izium, a city Russian forces seized as part of an apparent drive toward Sloviansk, which military analysts say is strategically critical to Russia’s plan to gain full control of eastern Ukraine.

Earlier this week, Oleksiy Danilov, the head of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, speaking on national television, said “large groupings of Russian troops” had been massing in the region.

“They are not going to stop,” he said. “They have a great desire to create big problems for our armed forces in this direction, and we also expect that fierce battles will be fought there for our territory in the near future.”

The Pentagon’s assessment of Russian deployments appeared to corroborate what Ukrainian officials were saying. Pentagon officials said Russia had withdrawn all of its troops arrayed against Kyiv and another city in the north, Chernihiv, and sent them back to Russia or to its ally Belarus to rearm, resupply and possibly redeploy in eastern Ukraine.

The Pentagon officials said those forces included as many as 40,000 troops that, in many cases, had departed under fierce attack from the Ukrainian military units that retook the territory.

“We believe they are all out,” one senior Pentagon official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential operational issues.

Russia now has about 30 battalion tactical groups — as many as 30,000 troops — in the east, the senior Pentagon official said. Earlier this week, Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden’s national security adviser, said Russia would most likely send “tens of thousands of soldiers to the front line in Ukraine’s east” in the coming weeks.

Largely in anticipation of this next major phase of the war, the Pentagon announced late Tuesday that it was sending $100 million worth of Javelin anti-tank missiles — roughly several hundred missiles — to Ukraine, where the weapon has been used with high success in destroying Russian tanks and other armored vehicles.

NATO foreign ministers, meeting this week, have been discussing how to further help Ukraine prosecute the war without entangling the alliance in direct combat with Russian forces.

The war, they said, is far from over, noting that however badly Russia’s forces have performed, and their retreat from areas around Kyiv notwithstanding, they are making slow and brutal progress in the east.

“Moscow is not giving up its ambitions in Ukraine,” said Jens Stoltenberg, NATO’s secretary general.

Ukrainian officials in a number of areas, including Mykolayiv in the south and the Luhansk and Donetsk regions in the east, have been sharing schedules of planned evacuations or links to online portals for people to sign up to join buses and trains that are transporting residents to safer places.

But in some besieged cities in the south, like Mariupol, it is already nearly impossible to leave, making evacuations sporadic and risky.

Attempts by the Red Cross to enter Mariupol to supervise civilian departures have repeatedly been scrubbed, leaving fearful residents to fend for themselves. On Wednesday, 500 people who had escaped Mariupol to join a Red Cross convoy in the nearby city of Berdyansk arrived in Zaporizhzhia, about 100 miles away.

The climate of fear gripping Mariupol has spread to the region of Kherson, near the Black Sea, where people have lived under occupation by Russian forces since they encircled and entered the city and its suburbs on March 2.

“Anyone who did not leave early is now stuck here,” said Evgeniya Selivantseva, a doctor from Velyka Lepetyka, a village on the Dnipro River, in the Kherson region.

Dr. Selivantseva, 38, described a deepening humanitarian crisis in the village: Gasoline stations have run out of fuel, and food and medical supplies are running low. Food is so scarce that local leaders have started a makeshift flour mill.

“We feel helpless and totally defenseless,” she said. “People are afraid to leave their homes.”

The proposed European Union ban on Russian coal, part of the bloc’s effort to further penalize Russia over atrocities in Ukraine, reflected a choice of an imported energy source that would be the easiest to replace.

Deliberations over the ban and other sanctions were set to continue into Thursday, and European Union officials and diplomats anticipated that the measures would be approved. The process reflected the challenges of reaching agreement among all 27 member nations on the penalties, which would also include banning Russian ships from E.U. ports.

If approved, the sanctions would be the harshest enforced by the bloc since the invasion.

Though the European Union depends on Russian coal, the bloc could find substitute imports more easily than for natural gas and oil.

But banning coal from Russia could send energy prices soaring for European consumers, given the existing shortages in the bloc, according to Rystad Energy, a consulting firm. Carlos Torres Diaz, a senior vice president at Rystad, called the potential sanctions “a double-edged sword.”

3,536d4fe3-270b-4d3c-98d4-b03230c5667c,[],,"On February 24 2022, around 5 AM Moscow time, on Vladimir Putin’s order the Russian army launched an unprovoked war against Ukraine.

There is no chance for us to fall into Kremlin’s propagandistic trap and accept circumventing the term war for this aggression and use Moscow’s expression.

The re-invasion Russia launched on ground, from the air and from the sea is the largest attack of a state against another state in Europe after the WWII. The 2014 invasion should not be forgotten and that is why we used the term re-invasion which is, otherwise, coming across in the international media.

From its military dimension, the conflict became manifest in the economic, diplomatic, media and social fields in the countries directly involved, yet with reverberations in almost all of the world’s countries.

The present approach will deal predominantly with the military aspects while not neglecting the essential aspects in other fields.



1. Why did Russia attack Ukraine?

Ever since president Putin delivered his speech at the 2007 Munich Security Conference, it was quite obvious that Russia would not accept the geopolitical developments that followed the fall of the Berlin Wall and will try to re-establish its lost sphere of influence especially in Europe. Soon, in August 2008, the conflict in Georgia followed with almost no reactions from the Western democracies and that encouraged Moscow to annex Crimea in 2014 and to partially occupy regions in eastern Ukraine, regions which were later on declared as separatist Donetsk and Lugansk republics. That time too, the international community’s reaction was rather feeble, with superficial sanctions against the said aggression.

AP/VADIM GHIRDA - A pro-Russian rebel looks up as he rides a Russian-flagged tank on a road east of Donetsk, eastern Ukraine.

It is possible that encouraged by that reaction and most probably miscalculating the consequences of launching the war against Ukraine, as well as of Ukraine’s internal situation, Putin believed he could replicate in the whole of Ukraine the situation he was met with in Crimea and could set up a pro-Muscovite puppet regime within days from launching the offensive.

Putin made the decision to attack Ukraine seeing the demarches the country has made to join the EU and NATO, although they were already provided for in the 2019 Ukrainian constitution.



2. The way the conflict unfolds

However, after the first day of war, the Russian ground forces missed the initial moment of the offensive due to lack of fuel (some unconfirmed enough sources speak of the Russian military bartering fuel for alcohol), of ammunition and even of food supplies. It is also assessed that the first echelon of the Russian troops included not only poorly trained military but also an equally poor leadership.

The offensive was simultaneously launched on four directions:

• Towards Kyiv (around 2,8 mil. inhabitants) from Belarus (circa 90 km north) and from further east, from the Russian territory;

• Towards Harkiv, Ukraine’s second city (around 1,4 mil. inhabitants) from the east, from the Russian territory, less than 30 km from the Russian border;

• From the south, from Crimea and the Black Sea, pursuing the closure of the Ukrainian sea shore of the Black Sea by achieving the land connection between Russia and Crimea and by occupying Odessa (Ukraine’s third city, with more than 1 mil. inhabitants).

The land offensive started simultaneously with the launching of 160 missiles from the ground, from the air and from the sea as well as with two aviation attack waves (around 80 bombers and escort fighter jets), namely in total 400 attacks in the first 24 hours which targeted 15 commandments and command centers, 18 air defense units, 11 airfields and six military bases.

At the end of the first fighting day, the Snake Island (0,15 Km2), which is 45 km far from the Romanian sea shore, was occupied. The Ukrainian garrison there (some 15 military) was captured and it was initially announced that the military there were killed. This very action proves the importance Russia attaches to the tiny island. The satellite images show that a Russian military navy entered the island’s tiny port.

From unofficial sources, I can say that before the invasion started, there was a proposal to the American side that NATO set up radar and a symbolic garrison on the island in order to protect it and avoid its occupation, a proposal which was rejected by the US.

The Russian Special Forces in uniforms and civilian clothes have been spotted in Kyiv’s center while paratroopers landing from helicopters tried to occupy the Hostomel airport situated to the north-west of the capital. Initially, the Russian forces succeeded in occupying the airport, but at the end of the fighting day the Ukrainian forces resumed the control of the objective.

With the exception of long-distance missiles strikes, almost all the initial targets of the invasion were missed. Ukraine’s air defense was not totally annihilated and not all of the airfields were disabled. The Ukrainian forces maintained, to a large extent, their freedom of movement and kept their positions.

The Ukrainian reserves and its territorial defenses mobilized in no time. The Russian landing troops and the special forces placed deeply into the Ukrainian territory were isolated from the troops deployed on the front and re-supplying the former, especially with ammunition, was made more difficult.



From the way the operations were unfolding, it was clear that Russia did not succeed to integrate in the best circumstances some modern warfare instruments – electronic, cyber and outer space ones into the terrestrial offensive.

AP/SERGEI SUPINSKY - A fighter of the Territorial Defence Forces of Ukraine, the military reserve of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, stands guard at the Independence Square position in Kiev, 2 March 2022.

Around 150,000 Russian military took part initially to the invasion (almost 200 battalions), i.e. an important force, but launching operations on 15 different directions meant diminishing the strength on each and every offensive direction. Most probably, the Russian planers underestimated the resistance of the Ukrainian army.

We present below the situation and the evolution of the Russian controlled territory two weeks after the invasion started:



We will not enter the details concerning the military operations and especially the losses mentioned by each side as we keep in mind a quotation saying that “truth is the first to die in case of war”, but from the way the operations were carried out to date, some important conclusions may be drawn:

• The Ukrainian army achieved important progress in training and equipping, as compared to the situation in 2014 and put up a resistance that the invading army did not expect;

• The defense was organized on areas enjoying an extended command independence and logistic flexibility as compared to the ultra-centralized command of the Russian army;

• The anti-tank and air defense equipment sent to Kyiv was extremely efficient against the Russian tanks, fighter jets and helicopters;

• The poor command of the Russian troops of the first echelon and presumably the low morale of the latter made the higher military leadership of the invasion decide sending Russian generals close to the contact line and that explains the fact that, by March 26, the Ukrainian snipers killed around 15 high ranking Russian military among whom six generals. It is presumed that they were spotted as a result of the non-observance of communication rules and used their mobile phones for getting in touch with certain subordinates;

REUTERS/IAN LANGSDON - EU heads of state attend an informal meeting at the Château de Versailles in Versailles, outside Paris, France, 11 March 2022.

• Russia was unable to obtain air supremacy over the entire Ukrainian territory and most likely it does not have enough highly trained pilots ready for such a large-scale conflict;

• As of March 19 and 20, Russia started using Kinjal and Kaliber hypersonic missiles launched from the Caspian Sea, the Black Sea and from the air space for striking certain tactical targets (ammunition and fuel depots, a training center for the Ukrainian special forces and probably mercenaries). That demonstrated president Putin’s desire to obtain as quickly as possible important results in the offensive operation. According to certain (not fully confirmed) reports, an important percentage (even more than 50%) of the launched cruise missiles did not explode on their targets;

• I consider that Ukraine benefits too from important intelligence concerning the deployment and the movement of the Russian invading forces supplied by satellites and other means by certain NATO states;

• Ukraine’s counterintelligence services in general and the military ones in particular succeeded after 2014 in countering the FSB and GRU actions both within the local political class and especially within the Ukrainian army (in 2014 Ukraine had to disband the 15 Airborne Brigade which was accused of treason);

• After the first three weeks since launching the invasion, a certain change in the share of the targets hit by the Russian missiles and aviation is noticed as they aim at diminishing the capacities of supply and communications and of the Ukrainian troops movements; also, the troops positioned on the north fringes of Kyiv started engineering works, sign that the extended offensive on the capital is not imminent.

An interesting issue that is worth mentioning is that of the foreign mercenaries. Early as February 27, Ukraine appealed to foreign fighters to join a so-called “Foreign Legion”. An important number of volunteers crowded the Ukrainian embassies abroad and around 20,000 people of 52 countries offered their services. Their status within the Ukrainian army is not known and Kyiv promised them Ukrainian citizenship, social incentives and an unrevealed salary. It seems that 3,000 Americans, 1,000 Canadians, 600 Czechs, 100 Scots as well as Georgians, Polish, Germans, Israelis and others enlisted already. According to certain sources, after March 20, the number of candidates decreased sharply and almost no new volunteers applied.

On March 11, President Vladimir Putin asked the minister of defense Sergei Shoigu to facilitate the transit of the military from the Middle East wishing to fight in Ukraine on Russia’s side. 16,000 Syrian paramilitary volunteers and members of the 5th Corps are mentioned among those wishing to enlist. It is possible that fighters of the Lebanese Hezbollah and of Hamas join the Syrian volunteers. Some other mercenaries as well could have been recruited from Libya according to an understanding reached during the recent visit to Moscow of the Libyan General Khalifa Haftar. The average payment of these fighters is estimated between 300 and 500 $/month and is to be paid from the Russian budget.



AFP/LUDOVIC MARIN - France's President Emmanuel Macron and EU leaders pose for a family photo at the Palace of Versailles near Paris on March 10, 2022, ahead of a summit of EU leaders to discuss the consequences of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

We do not believe that the mercenaries’ participation, on either side, could have an important influence on the way the military operations are carried out as they are disadvantaged by the fact they do not know the ground, the language and will have probably major logistical and cultural problems.



From the information and the stands taken by the two sides, from the assessments and analyses of as objective as possible sources, it is clearer and clearer that at the end of the first month of the invasion Russia will finish the invasion and will withdraw from most of the occupied territories, an operation that will be completed the latest around May 7 2022. A first signal to that end was conveyed on March 25 2022 by the speech of the head of the Main Operational Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Federation Army, Colonel Gen. Serghei Rudskoy.

It is likely that in the coming weeks, the Russian forces will focus on surrounding the Ukrainian group of forces situated close to the west of the separatist regions and securing a terrestrial connection of the Sea of Azov shore and Crimea. General Rudskoy’s speech offers already a first glance on the Russian justification for the coming to an end, in a near future, of the invasion of Ukraine indeed by proclaiming the “victory” – the achievement of the objectives set at the beginning of the conflict.



3. Sanctions, economic impact, peace negotiations

Russia’s military actions had nevertheless effects and repercussions that we believe the Kremlin did not assess to their full magnitude and that lead to a reinforcement of the democratic Europe’s cohesion and unity and of the transatlantic relations.

a. Sanctions and their economic impact

The sanctions are penalties imposed by a country to another country to stop the latter to act aggressively or to break the international law. In this case, the sanctions Russia is subject to are the most severe among those applied so far to Moscow and a great number of countries imposed them. We mention some of them:

• Banning the export of dual use (civilian and military) goods, including the spare parts for vehicles imposed by the EU, US and Great Britain;

• Banning the flights of all Russian companies in the air space of the EU, US and Great Britain (which banned also the private charters leased by Russia);

• The EU, US and Great Britain applied sanctions to more than 1,000 individuals and companies generically designated as oligarchs, considered close associates to the Kremlin; the properties belonging to president Vladimir Putin and to the minister of Foreign Affairs Serghei Lavrov were frozen;

• The US banned oil and gas imports from Russia while the Great Britain will cease importing Russian oil by the end of 2022; The EU declared it will move to alternate energy sources and will become independent from the energy Russia supplies before 2030. During the recent visit of president Joe Biden to Europe, it has been agreed that the US supply around 50 billion cubic meters of liquefied gas to the EU;

• Germany suspended for the time being the formalities for the commission of North Stream 2;

• Among the financial sanctions, we mention the freeze of the assets of the Central Bank of Russia, amounting to 630 billion dollars, a step that caused a ruble’s devaluation by 22% since the beginning of 2022, an increase of prices of the imported goods and an inflation of 14%;

• Certain Russian Banks were excluded from the international financial system SWIFT.

It is worth mentioning that information coming recently from Great Britain stresses that if Russia withdraws its invasion troops, London (Londongrad as it is also named due to the presence there of a great number of Russian oligarchs) will lift the sanctions imposed on Moscow.

REUTERS/THIBAULT CAMUS - Russian President Vladimir Putin, demands to pay for gas in roubles

- President Putin declared that the unfriendly nations will be obliged to pay for gas imports from Russia in rubles in order to help the recovery of the national currency.

Russia banned the export of around 200 goods till the end of 2022 including telecom and medical products, vehicles, food and agricultural produce, electric equipment and timber. Other retaliatory steps have been also taken in the financial and banking fields.

We do express our hope that Europe drew the real conclusions and will succeed in escaping the „Russian energy trap” and do not repeat the Nabucco experience, a project initiated in 2002, agreed upon in 2009 and then abandoned in 2013 mainly due to political reasons.

b. Peace negotiations

The peace negotiations started on February 28, a few days after the attack begun, initially in physical form and continued on March 3 and 7 on the Belarusian territory, and after that on line at experts’ level. A breakthrough was Turkey’s facilitating a meeting at the level of the foreign ministers of the two countries and the negotiations took place in Antalya under the auspices of the Antalya Diplomacy Forum on March 10 with the participation of the Turkish minister of Foreign Affairs, Mevlut Cavusoglu. Although no progress was registered this time, it was very clear from the Russian minister of Foreign Affairs Serghei Lavrov’s answers at the press conference organized after the meeting that in the Kremlin’s opinion, it is not about a Russia-Ukraine conflict but about a Russia conflict with the West in which the invasion of Ukraine is just a stage.

A peculiarity of these negotiations is that the Russian side never accepted any cease fire during the talks.

The Ukrainian President Volodimir Zelensky expressed repeatedly his readiness of meeting and negotiating with President Vladimir Putin, a proposal the Russian side did not accept. The Kremlin’s reply was, of course, that such a meeting would take place when Kyiv accepts Moscow’s conditions. An interesting nuance included in the Ukrainian president’s offer for negotiations is his statement that any agreed upon understanding which will include possible territorial or of other nature important alterations contradicting the provisions of the constitution in force should be subject to a referendum in order to be enforced.

Russia’s main four conditions are: An Ukraine declaration of neutrality; the formal agreement that the Crimean Peninsula, annexed by Russia in 2014, is Russian territory and that the Donbas region controlled by the Russian separatists in Eastern Ukraine is independent; Ukraine’s demilitarization; lifting the Western sanctions imposed on Russia. As far as Ukraine is concerned, it seems the country is ready to accept some of these requests including giving up to joining NATO and some territorial compromises.



A new round of negotiations took place in physical form in Istanbul on March 29 and 30. Both Turkey and Israel hope of being able to successfully mediate the negotiations, but I think that probably the informal negotiations among the Russian and the Ukrainian oligarchs will be much more effective.



4. Brief conclusions

I think Putin overestimated the possibilities of the Russian army of achieving the established strategic political objectives while underestimating, at the same time, Ukraine’s capacity of resisting Russia’s plans. Concomitantly, it could be about a mistake in managing the relation between the political leadership and the intelligence services agencies, although it is unlikely that the Russian intelligence services were so wrong in their getting acquainted and reporting the situation in Ukraine.

The military conclusions will be indeed interesting especially after the war operations end, yet it is already obvious that a particular higher attention will be paid to cyber actions and UAVs, to a greater interaction between terrestrial and spacial, to an increased role of the missiles to the detriment of artillery, to the importance of small forces possessing a high fire power and mobility, to decentralizing the command and so on. Not in the least, the psychological training of troops should gain more and more in importance.



PHOTO/ARCHIVO - Ukrainian President Volodymir Zelensky in a message to the nation during the Russian invasion.

Coming back to a wider framework, the conflict in Ukraine highlights the fact that in what concerns the dispute between Samuel Huntington and Francis Fukuyama on the humankind’s future, it seems that the former (with whom I had long discussions at Harvard in the summer of 2001) was right, less in what concerns the border he traced between the two civilizations and which, I believe, is much farther to the east of Romania. We are living into a world of ethnical conflicts and civilizational confrontations which is shaping the future otherwise than the much more optimistic way (liberty, democracy, market economy and secularization of cultures) foreseen by Fukuyama.

I further conclude that social media become an active player in geopolitics. Brexit, Trump, pandemic and now the war in Ukraine, all had a big component of influencing, via the platforms of the big tech companies which were clearly positioned on a certain side. I remind that the Big 5, who are governing the world now are: Pharma, Defense, Oil, Tech, and Banks. Let us not forget about the banks as someone has to lend/manage trillions. Look for who are those who fund the conflicts for a better understanding.

An old proverb says that when two quarrel, the third wins. Such is now the case in the fight between Kyiv (which, it should be made clear, is historically the cradle of the Russian civilization, something which, in equally clear terms, cannot represent in any case a justification for the Russian invasion) and Moscow, as neither of the two belligerents will win, nor the EU, but the US and China.

I think that under such complex circumstances, we have to position ourselves in such a way that we capitalize best our advantages, to stress our possibilities and prove loyalty towards the strategic partners, without neglecting the national interests. Politically, as it is the case in the military field, one should act rapidly, decisively and especially in a clever way. The political correctness, a much used and dear term of today politicians, has proved its limits and the return to Real Politic could represent a clever solution of the contemporary political world.

Dear Mr. Secretary General!

Dear members of the Security Council and other participants of the meeting!

Thank you for the opportunity.

I am sure that all the representatives of the UN member states will hear me today.

Yesterday I returned from our city of Bucha, recently liberated from the troops of the Russian Federation.

It is difficult to find a war crime that the occupiers have not committed there.

The Russian military searched for and purposefully killed anyone who served our state.

They executed women outside the houses when approaching and simply calling someone alive.

They killed whole families – adults and children. And they tried to burn their bodies.

I am addressing you on behalf of the people who honor the memory of the deceased everyday. Everyday, in the morning.

The memory of the killed civilians.

Who were shot in the back of the head or in the eye after being tortured. Who were shot just on the streets.

Who were thrown into the well, so that they die there in suffering.

Who were killed in apartments, houses, blown up by grenades. Who were crushed by tanks in civilian cars in the middle of the road. For fun.

Whose limbs were cut off, whose throat was cut. Who were raped and killed in front of their own children.

Their tongues were torn out only because they did not hear from them what they wanted to hear.

How is this different from what the ISIS terrorists were doing in the occupied territory?

Except that it is done by a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.

It destroys the internal unity of states.

Destroys state borders.

Denies the right of more than a dozen peoples on two continents to self-determination and independent state life. Pursues a consistent policy of destroying ethnic and religious diversity.

Inflames wars and deliberately wages them in such a way as to kill as many ordinary civilians as possible. To destroy as many ordinary peaceful cities as possible. To leave in the country where it sends its troops only ruins and mass graves. You’ve seen it all.

Promotes hatred at the state level and seeks to export it to other countries through its system of propaganda and political corruption.

Provokes a global food crisis that could lead to famine in Africa and Asia, and will certainly end in large-scale political chaos in countries where food price stability is a key factor of domestic security.

So where is the security that the Security Council must guarantee? There is no security. Although there is a Security Council, as if nothing happened.

So where is the peace that the United Nations was created to guarantee?

It is obvious that the key institution of the world, which must ensure the coercion of any aggressors to peace, simply cannot work effectively.

Now the world has seen what the Russian military did in Bucha while keeping our city under occupation. But the world has yet to see what they have done in other occupied cities, in other occupied areas of our country.

Geography may be different, but cruelty is the same. Crimes are the same.

And responsibility must be inevitable.

Ladies and Gentlemen!

I would like to remind you of the first article of the first chapter of the UN Charter. What is the purpose of our organization? To maintain peace. And to force to peace. Now the UN Charter is being violated literally from the first article. And if so, what is the point of all other articles?

Today, it is as a result of Russia’s actions on the territory of my state, on the territory of Ukraine, that the most heinous war crimes of all time since the end of World War II are being committed.

Russian troops are deliberately destroying Ukrainian cities to ashes with artillery and air strikes.

They are deliberately blocking cities, creating mass starvation in them. They are deliberately shooting at columns of civilians on the roads who are trying to escape from the territory of hostilities.

They are even deliberately blowing up shelters where civilians are hiding from air strikes. They are deliberately creating conditions in the temporarily occupied territories so that as many civilians as possible are killed there.

The massacre in our city of Bucha is just one, unfortunately, of many examples of what the occupiers have been doing on our land for 41 days.

And there are many other such places that the world has yet to find out the full truth of: Mariupol, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Okhtyrka, Borodyanka and dozens of other Ukrainian communities, each of which is like Bucha.

I know, and you know very well, what the representatives of Russia will say in response to the accusations of these crimes. They have said this many times. The most illustrative was after the downing of a Malaysian Boeing over Donbas by Russian forces with Russian weapons. Or during the war in Syria.

They will blame everyone, just to justify themselves. They will say that there are different versions, and which of them is true is allegedly impossible to establish yet. They will even say that the bodies of those killed were allegedly “planted”, and all the videos are staged.

But. Now is the year 2022. There is conclusive evidence. There are satellite images. It is possible to conduct a full, transparent investigation.

That is what we are interested in.

Maximum access of journalists. Maximum cooperation with international institutions. Involvement of the International Criminal Court. Full truth, full responsibility.

I am sure that every state in the UN system should be interested in this. For what? In order to punish once and for all those who consider themselves privileged, consider themselves unpunished. Hence, to show all other potential war criminals in the world that they will inevitably be punished as well. If the biggest is punished, everyone will be punished.

Why did Russia come to Ukraine, tell me?

I will answer. Russia’s leadership feels like colonizers – as in ancient times. They need our wealth and our people. Russia has already deported tens of thousands of our citizens to its territory. Then there will be hundreds. It abducted more than two thousand children. Simply abducted thousands of children. And continues to do so. Russia wants to turn Ukrainians into silent slaves.

The Russian militaries are openly looting the cities and villages they have captured. This is looting of the highest scale. They steal everything from food to gold earrings they just rip out with blood.

We are dealing with a state that turns the right of veto in the UN Security Council into a right to kill.

Which undermines the whole architecture of global security.

Which allows evil to go unpunished and spread the world. Destroying everything that can work for peace and security.

If this continues, the finale will be that each state will rely only on the power of arms to ensure its security, not on international law, not on international institutions.

Then, the UN can simply be dissolved.

Ladies and Gentlemen!

Are you ready for the dissolving of the UN? Do you think that the time of international law has passed?

If your answer is no, you need to act now, act immediately.

The power of the UN Charter must be restored immediately.

The UN system must be reformed immediately so that the right of veto is not a right to kill. So that there is a fair representation of all regions of the world in the Security Council.

The aggressor must be forced to peace immediately. Determination is needed. The chain of mass killings from Syria to Somalia, from Afghanistan to Yemen and Libya should have been stopped a long time ago to be honest.

If tyranny had ever received such a response to the war it had unleashed that it would have ceased to exist and a fair peace would have been guaranteed after it, the world would have changed for sure.

And then, perhaps, we would not have a war, a war in my country. Against our nation, the Ukrainian nation. Against people.

But the world watched and did not want to see the occupation of Crimea, or even before – the war against Georgia, or even earlier – the alienation from Moldova of the entire Transnistrian region. It also didn’t want to see how Russia was preparing the ground for other conflicts and wars near its borders.

How to stop it?

Immediately bring the Russian military and those who gave them orders to justice for war crimes in Ukraine.

Everyone who gave criminal orders and fulfilled them by killing people will face a tribunal similar to the Nuremberg trials.

I want to remind Russian diplomats that a man like von Ribbentrop has not avoided punishment after World War II.

And I also want to remind the architects of Russia’s criminal policy that punishment has reached Adolf Eichmann as well.

None of the culprits will escape. No one.

But the main thing is that today is the time to transform the system, the core of which is the United Nations. To do this, we propose to convene a global conference. And we ask to do it already in peaceful Kyiv – in order to decide.

How we will reform the world security system.

How we will really guarantee the inviolability of universally recognized borders and the integrity of states.

How we will ensure the rule of international law.

It is now clear that the goals set in San Francisco in 1945 during the creation of a global international security organization have not been achieved. And it is impossible to achieve them without reforms.

Therefore, we must do everything in our power to pass on to the next generations an effective UN with the ability to respond preventively to security challenges and thus guarantee peace.

Prevent aggression and force aggressors to peace. Have the determination and ability to punish if the principles of peace are violated.

There can be no more exceptions, privileges. Everyone must be equal. All participants in international relations. Regardless of economic strength, geographical area and individual ambitions.

The power of peace must become dominant. The power of justice and the power of security. As humanity has always dreamed of.

Ukraine is ready to provide a platform for one of the main offices of the updated security system.

Just as the Geneva office specializes in human rights, just as the Nairobi office specializes in the field of environmental protection, the Kyiv U-24 Office can specialize in preventive measures to maintain peace.

I want to remind you of our peaceful mission in Afghanistan. When, at our own expense, we Ukrainians evacuated more than a thousand people from this country. And it was the hottest phase. But people needed help – and Ukraine came. Just like other states.

We evacuated people of different nationalities, different faiths. Afghans, citizens of European countries, USA, Canada. We did not distinguish who needs help, whether these are our people or not. We saved everyone.

If every time there was a need everyone in the world was confident that help would come, the world would be definitely safer.

Therefore, Ukraine has the necessary moral right to propose a reform of the world security system.

We have proven that we help others not only in good times, but also in dark times.

And now we need decisions from the Security Council. For peace in Ukraine. If you do not know how to adopt this decision, you can do two things.

Remove Russia as an aggressor and a source of war from blocking decisions about its own aggression, its own war. And then do everything that can establish peace.

Or show how you can reformat and really work for peace.

Or if your current format is unalterable and there is simply no way out, then the only option would be to dissolve yourself altogether.

I am convinced that you can do without the third option.

Ukraine needs peace. We need peace. Europe needs peace. The world needs peace.

And finally, I’m asking you to watch the video. A short one.

A video of what has come to replace your power because someone alone can abuse his rights.

This is what impunity leads to.

If possible – watch this video. Because there is no opportunity for everyone to come to us and see it. So watch it.

Thank you.",https://prorhetoric.com/are-you-ready-for-the-u-n-to-be-dissolved-do-you-think-that-the-time-of-international-law-has-passed/

Charter to the conduct of international relations. In a revealing 2005 position paper on proposals for U.N. reform, China lauded the United Nations’ “indispensable role in international affairs.” It made such statements even as it rejected calls at the time to endorse a “Responsibility to Protect” principle that would allow the use of force to prevent humanitarian atrocities. The U.N. Security Council, China argued at that time, “is the only body that can decide the use of force.”

Beijing’s silence on Ukraine may represent a temporary accommodation of its most important geopolitical ally, but it could also represent a meaningful shift in the Chinese government’s views on the propriety of the use of force. Either way, China’s silence as Russia blatantly violates one of its most cherished principles of international law deserves both criticism and careful attention if it also represents a shift toward a more aggressive and dangerous Chinese foreign policy.

“China always opposes the use of force in international relations.” This boilerplate statement, frequently repeated by China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reflects Beijing’s long-standing, publicly stated opposition to the use of military force outside the limitations imposed by Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter. It is a fundamental principle of its approach to international law and a significant feature of its self-portrayal as neutral, peaceful state in contrast to the United States. Yet China, which has repeatedly refused to criticize Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, appears to have abandoned its long-standing legal and diplomatic position.

Yet China, which has repeatedly refused to criticize Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, appears to have abandoned its long-standing legal and diplomatic position.

Beijing’s silence on Ukraine may represent a temporary accommodation of its most important geopolitical ally, but it could also represent a meaningful shift in the Chinese government’s views on the propriety of the use of force. Either way, China’s silence as Russia blatantly violates one of its most cherished principles of international law deserves both criticism and careful attention if it also represents a shift toward a more aggressive and dangerous Chinese foreign policy.

Since its admission into the United Nations in 1971, China has emerged as a reliable defender of the centrality of the world body and the U.N. Charter to the conduct of international relations. In a revealing 2005 position paper on proposals for U.N. reform, China lauded the United Nations’ “indispensable role in international affairs.” It made such statements even as it rejected calls at the time to endorse a “Responsibility to Protect” principle that would allow the use of force to prevent humanitarian atrocities. The U.N. Security Council, China argued at that time, “is the only body that can decide the use of force.”

This position is consistent with both prior and subsequent Chinese government statements. For instance, even before it joined the U.N. but after it had diplomatically split with the Soviet Union, China publicly condemned the Soviet Union’s use of force in Czechoslovakia in 1968. And unlike its current silence on Russia, the Chinese foreign ministry didn’t hesitate to call the U.S. military action in Panama a “military invasion” that “constitutes an infringement against a sovereign state of the third world and violates the norms of international law and the aims and purposes of the United Nations Charter.” This condemnation was made even though China and Panama had no diplomatic relations at that time, with Panama instead recognizing Taiwan.

A decade later, the Chinese government aggressively opposed NATO’s military intervention against Yugoslavia during the Kosovo crisis and joined only Russia and Namibia in supporting a U.N. Security Council resolution that would have condemned NATO’s use of force. As China’s U.N. ambassador declared months earlier, NATO’s use of force “violated the purposes, principles, and relevant provisions of the United Nations Charter, as well as international law and widely acknowledged norms governing relations between states.”

In light of its position on NATO’s intervention in Kosovo, it is not surprising that China also emerged as a fierce opponent of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Kong Quan denounced the attack as going “around the U.N. Security Council, which constitutes a violation of the U.N. Charter and basic norms of international law.”

In the years since the Iraq War, China has not been shy about condemning the use of force, especially in Syria. Not only did it condemn the 2018 U.S. airstrikes in response to the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime as violating international law; it also condemned the Israeli and Turkish military strikes in 2017 and 2019, respectively, in the same conflict. Most recently, in 2020, the Chinese government opposed the U.S. targeted strike that killed Iranian Quds Force commander Qassem Suleimani. As the Chinese foreign ministry reiterated in its now standard criticism: “China has always opposed the use of force in international relations.”

To be sure, China did not condemn Russia’s use of force in either Georgia or Crimea and eastern Ukraine. But those cases differ from Russia’s current invasion of Ukraine because the Kremlin cloaked those interventions as civil conflicts that did not rise to the level of a “use of force in international relations.” Russian military force was then later justified with the “consent” of the new governments. This narrative of civil conflict, and then consent by the prevailing government, also allowed China to accept Russia’s military intervention at the behest of the Assad regime in Syria.

Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine did not claim either the consent of the Ukrainian government or that its forces were simply supporting Ukrainian rebels in an internal conflict. Rather, Russia’s invasion is the largest use of force by one sovereign state against another since the U.S. invasion of Iraq. China’s refusal to recognize, much less condemn, Russia’s openly illegal use of force against Ukraine is therefore remarkable. Chinese government spokespeople have neither repeated their well-worn “China opposes the use of force” boilerplate statement nor have they even acknowledged that Russia has invaded Ukraine.

Despite numerous opportunities to do so, Chinese spokespeople have only acknowledged that there is a conflict in Ukraine and called on “all sides” to exercise restraint. For example, during a Feb. 25 press briefing, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson was asked: “Does China consider Russia’s action an invasion now? And if not, then what does China think the nature of this conflict actually is?” In response, the spokesperson dodged the question as to whether Russia has invaded Ukraine and simply repeated that “the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries should be respected and upheld. The purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter should also be jointly upheld.”

This statement somehow managed to avoid addressing whether Russia’s use of force is “upholding” the charter. China has maintained this silence on the question of the use of force and has abstained from both U.N. Security Council and General Assembly resolutions that condemned Russia’s use of force. The only party that China is willing to condemn in the war has actually not used any military force at all: NATO. Nonetheless, China has repeatedly blamed the bloc for causing the war by expanding eastward despite Russia’s security concerns.

There are at least two possible explanations for China’s apparent about-face on its prior opposition to the “use of force in international relations” with respect to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Both are troubling for U.S. policymakers concerned about China’s potential threat to United States and allied interests.

First, the most obvious explanation for Beijing’s silence on the use of force against Ukraine is that China’s need to support its strategic partnership with Russia is more important than any commitment it has to an abstract principle of international law. Its willingness to accept blatant large-scale use of military force against a sovereign state goes far beyond its tacit acceptance of Russia’s actions in Georgia and Crimea. This is hardly shocking, nor are inconsistent views on the legality of the use of force unique to China.

But even the United States, which has wrestled most publicly with the legality of its own use of force, has typically offered justifications for the international legality of its actions under either a capacious view of self-defense or the need to prevent a humanitarian atrocity. China has simply refused to offer any legal explanation at all for its non-position on Russia’s obviously illegal use of force. The much-scrutinized joint statement between Presidents Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping actually condemned “[s]ome actors” that “continue to advocate unilateral approaches to addressing international issues and resort to force” (emphasis added). Thus, not only is Russia resorting to “force” in a very unilateral way, but China has decided that it will not condemn Russia for undermining a principle both countries endorsed within the past two months.

There is a second, and more troubling, explanation for China’s silence on the legality of the use of force. China’s adherence to such a legal principle may have been more attractive when it was a negligible military power outside its own borders. But while China is not yet the equal of the United States in military terms, it has growing geopolitical ambitions within Asia as well as around the world. Not only is China embroiled in potentially violent border disputes with almost all of its geographic neighbors, including Japan, Vietnam, the Philippines, and India, but it has established or is considering military presences in the Middle East (Djibouti) and in regions as far-flung as the Atlantic and the South Pacific.

A rising global military power might take a less restrictive view of the U.N. Charter’s limitations on the use of force, as, indeed, the United States has appeared to do in its recent history when it used force in the former Yugoslavia and Syria without any widely accepted international law justification. But a China that is not even notionally committed to the U.N. Charter’s limitations on the use of force is much more of a threat than one that is simply giving its strategic partner Russia a hypocritical pass.

Either way, the United States and its allies should demand China justify its silence on the legality of Russia’s use of force against Ukraine. While the United States may, in the eyes of many international lawyers, have violated this same rule many times before, it is still important to force China to spell out whether it is likely to disregard this prohibition in the future with respect to its own interests. Countries otherwise sympathetic to China’s professed commitment to the U.N. Charter (such as in Europe, Africa, or Southeast Asia) will be put on notice of Beijing’s hypocrisy or, worse, its potential abandonment of this principle.

China is either so committed to Russia that it will abandon a core principle of the U.N. Charter it once valorized—or it sees itself as a nation that does not need to be bound by such rules. Neither option is attractive, and both require us to rethink the nature of China’s position in the global order and the viability of such principles as the prohibition on the use of force in that order.",https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/04/07/china-ditched-principles-ukraine-russia-use-of-force/

On February 24, the Russian Federation launched a massive war against Ukraine. Most of the events before the war were connected with the upcoming escalation in hostilities.

1. PREWAR DEVELOPMENTS IN UKRAINE

Russia Pressures the West with Demands Regarding Ukraine

Last year’s negotiations between U.S. and Russian top officials on security regimes at the Russia-Ukraine border and NATO expansion continued in early 2022. Among other unfulfillable requests, Russia demanded a written guarantee that Ukraine would never join NATO. The U.S. representatives and NATO reiterated that the decision on joining NATO could not be based on third-party pressure and that it was the sovereign right of states to shape their own security policy.

On January 12, according to media reports, CIA director Bill Burns unofficially visited Kyiv and met with President Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss Russia’s military buildup. On January 19, U.S. secretary of state Antony Blinken visited Kyiv to discuss the same issue.

After Russian attempts to gain concessions failed, the Kremlin resorted to blackmail: Putin threatened a ""military-technical"" response if NATO did not acquiesce to Russian demands. Two days before the invasion Vladimir Putin said that the situation might be normalized if Ukraine canceled its NATO aspirations and recognized Russia’s annexation of Crimea. But by then it was very clear that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was not about NATO but about something much bigger, the Kremlin’s desire to control the country in the same way it controls some other former Soviet Union states.

Negotiations Over the Donbas

The year 2022 started with political negotiations over peacemaking in the Donbas: a meeting of the quadrilateral group—Russia, Ukraine, Germany, and France—in the Normandy Format was held on January 26 in Paris and again on February 10 in Berlin. The Ukrainian representatives insisted on keeping the discussions focused on Ukraine’s national security interests, while the Russians blamed the Ukrainians for stalling the negotiations. Some analysts believe that Moscow’s inability to impose its will on Ukraine with respect to implementing the Minsk agreements was among the factors that finally pushed Russia to invade. (Two earlier Kennan Focus Ukraine posts addressed this issue: one described the risks of implementing the Minsk agreements as they currently stand; and the other noted that for Ukraine, the accords represent a national humiliation.)

On February 18 and 19, Russian representatives refused to attend a planned meeting of the Trilateral Contact Group—Russia, Ukraine, and the OSCE—to discuss peacemaking, a meeting convened at the OSCE’s initiative.

Concentration of Russian Troops on the Ukrainian Border

Since the first information about Russia’s plan to attack Ukraine came to light in October 2021, Russia has continued aggregating troops and equipment on the border with Ukraine, even as Moscow dismissed such troop movements as routine exercises and issued statements saying it was moving the forces back from the border. In mid-January Putin’s spokesperson, Vladimir Peskov, said that Russia could not put up with “NATO’s invasion of Ukraine” anymore—a reference to NATO member states sending military equipment and instructors to Ukraine—and so would need to keep forces along Ukraine’s border. Later, Russia transferred to the border helicopters, tanks, truck-mounted Grad rocket launchers, fuel, and blood supplies.

In January, Russia announced the largest joint military drills with Belarus ever, “Allied Determination-2022,” to take place February 10–20. In addition, Russia conducted drills in Abkhazia, an occupied part of Georgia, and military exercises in the Black Sea, which affected Ukraine economically by virtually halting shipping and severing Ukraine’s sea connections. The six Russian ships sent to the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov were of the kind typically used to unload troops and equipment onto land.

A few days before the invasion, Russian general Stanislav Zas, the secretary general of the Collective Security Treaty Organization, a Russia-led military alliance of a few former Soviet Union states that in early 2022 had helped suppress protests in Kazakhstan, proposed sending peacekeepers to Ukraine. Later, when Russia started the war, Kazakhstan refused to join the operation.

At the same time, however, Russian officials on several occasions issued statements denying any plans to invade Ukraine, saying that Russia had a right to engage in troop maneuvers. However, Secretary of the Russian Security Council Nikolai Patrushev blamed the West for ”imposing” war on Russia against Ukraine for its own purposes, and said the United States was responsible for the war’s escalation. Earlier, in 2021, Patrushev had said that a “fire might swallow” Ukraine that would lead to millions of refugees fleeing the country.

In mid-February, the Verkhovna Rada called on foreign parliaments, governments, and international organizations to condemn the concentration of Russian troops on the border and to demand a de-escalation.

The Belarusian Factor before the War

In mid-January 2022, Russian military troops and equipment began arriving in Belarus to take part in Allied Determination-2022 drills on Ukraine’s border. In late January Russia dispatched fighter aircraft to airfields in Belarus. Aleksandr Lukashenko said Ukraine had been engaged in troop buildup near the border and stated that Belarus needed “reliable protection in the case of inadequacy of Ukraine’s government.”

Lukashenko described the military concentration in the Baltic states and Ukraine as a threat and promised to organize a huge military presence at the Belarusian border. Later, NATO’s Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg observed that the Russian military buildup in Belarus was the biggest since the Cold War. The head of the Russian General Staff, Valery Gerasimov, joined the drills to direct them in January 2022.

Diplomatic Escalation on the Russian Side

One month before the invasion, Russian officials started accusing Ukraine of preparing to attack the unrecognized republics in the Donbas, the self-declared Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR) and Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), and Russia. This was done to justify Russia’s war intentions.

In late January the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs accused Ukraine and the United States of planning military and information provocations against Russia. On February 19 Russian officials said a shell had hit a building in Rostov oblast, close to the border with Ukraine, and on February 21, a border patrol facility also in Rostov and 150 meters from the border was shelled. Russia laid responsibility for these isolated attacks at Ukraine’s feet; Kyiv denied the accusations.

Russia also fabricated the story that Ukraine planned to produce nuclear weapons. On February 21, Russian defense minister Sergei Shoigu said that Ukraine had everything necessary to manufacture nuclear weapons. That same day, Vladimir Putin in his hourlong address said that it was impossible for Russia not to respond to this threat.

Russia’s Military Support for and Recognition of the DPR and LPR

Arm supplies. In late January, Russian representatives said they intended to protect Russian citizens living in the DPR and LPR if Ukraine and the West attacked them. The Russian ruling party called on Putin to send arms and military equipment to the Donbas separatists. Commenting on this, Foreign Affairs Minister Sergei Lavrov did not exclude such support, arguing that the West had failed to pressure Ukraine to implement the Minsk agreements.

Separatists playing along with the Kremlin’s speculations. Following provocative statements from Russia implying that the Ukrainian army was preparing to launch an operation against the self-declared republics in eastern Ukraine, on February 18 the separatist leaders announced the evacuation of civilians to Russia. Later in February these leaders announced a general mobilization.

Recognizing the separatists. On February 15 the Russia State Duma voted to ask Vladimir Putin to recognize the independence of the LPR and DPR. On February 21 the separatists addressed the Kremlin with the same demand. Later that same day, President Putin issued a decree recognizing the independence of the self-declared republics, and the next day the State Duma and the Federation Council ratified the recognition. After this step, Putin said that the Minsk agreements were no longer in force.

Exposing the Kremlin’s Plans

Moscow’s desire to establish a pro-Russian government in Kyiv. In late January 2022, the UK foreign office said it had evidences that Russia intended to change the authorities in Ukraine and install a pro-Russian puppet regime. According to media reports, the U.S. State Department had acquired similar information about Russia’s plans. Naturally, Russian representatives denied that the Kremlin harbored such plans.

Later, Ukrainian intelligence said that Moscow considered former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, who had fled Ukraine for Russia during the 2013–2014 Maidan uprising, to be Ukraine’s legitimate president, and that Moscow had characterized the Euromaidan and the following elections as a coup. In January 2022, Yanukovych addressed the court in Kyiv demanding he be returned to the presidency, which he lost in 2015 after parliament passed a corresponding law. In early March 2022 Yanukovych visited Minsk, but since then he has kept a low profile.

Planned repressions. A few days before the beginning of the war, the US ambassador to the UN sent a letter to the UN high commissioner for human rights saying credible evidence existed that Russian authorities planned repressions on the territory of Ukraine in case of war, to include forced detention and killings. Later, Ukrainian forces, following successful attacks on Russian military convoys, found that the Russian forces had riot-police gear, typically used to disperse demonstrations.

Military Escalation in the Donbas before the Start of Full-Fledged War

Since the beginning of 2022 and up to the start of the war, the number of ceasefire violations in the Donbas grew exponentially. In the four-day period of February 20–23 alone, the number of ceasefire violations exceeded the typical number for a month in relatively quiet periods.

On February 19, a delegation that included members of Ukraine’s parliament, Interior Affairs minister Denys Monastyrskiy, and foreign journalists from CNN, FoxNews, the Washington Post, the New York Times, and Voice of America came under fire from the Russia-backed separatists in the Donbas. The Ukrainian officials had joined the visiting journalists to demonstrate provocations on the part of the separatists. Massive fires set by the separatists to destroy civilian infrastructure and take out Ukrainian army positions were arguably an attempt to provoke the Ukrainian army into creating a casus belli for the Russian invasion.

In response to the military escalation, and facing a clear risk of further lethal provocations, on February 23 the Ukrainian parliament approved President Zelensky’s decision to introduce a state of emergency across the country, stipulating close security control.

The Final Stage of Escalation before the War

Putin’s February 21 decree recognizing the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk region as independent also stipulated sending Russian army troops to the Donbas to “support peace.” The decree was followed by the movement of troops and tanks to the line between the government-controlled and the occupied territories of the Donbas. After a brief hesitation, Putin said he recognized all parts of the Donbas, including the territory controlled by Ukraine, as independent republics. This announcement made clear that Russia would try to get more territory under the control of its proxies in eastern Ukraine.

On February 23, Russia evacuated its diplomatic staff from Kyiv and closed the airspace on Ukraine’s eastern border, where the Russian troops were located, to civilian aviation. That same day, the separatist leaders of the non-government-controlled LHR and DPR asked Putin to introduce military forces to protect them from “the Ukrainian threat.”

2. ROLLOUT OF THE WAR

The First Stage of the War

Putin announces war. In the early morning of February 24, Vladimir Putin appeared on TV announcing his decision to conduct a “special military operation”—to this day he has not called it a war—against Ukraine. This speech had allegedly been recorded three days earlier, on February 21. During the address he mentioned the separatists’ request for military aid and rehearsed the by now customary Russia propaganda messaging, blaming the West, and in particular the United States, for NATO in expansion to the east, the “Maidan coup” in Ukraine, and the like. He characterized the “special operation” against Ukraine as aimed at the “demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine” and at “protecting” Ukrainians from “those who had taken them as hostages.”

First strikes. The speech was followed by air strikes on Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Odesa, and against military and civilian infrastructure across Ukraine. Then Russian troops crossed the border of Ukraine from Russian and Belarusian oblasts and from Crimea.

Shortly after the start of the invasion, the Verkhovna Rada approvedPresident Zelensky’s decision to introduce martial law in the country and announced a general mobilization.

The Kremlin’s plan to kill Zelensky. According to Western media reports, the Russian leadership ordered mercenaries to assassinate President Zelensky and members of the Ukrainian government to help shift power in Kyiv. Later, representative of Ukraine’s presidential administration confirmed the facts of attempts to assassinate Zelensky.Despite several threats to his life, Zelensky refused offers from the UK and the United States to help him leave the country.

Failed Russian plan for a blitzkrieg. On the second day of the war, Russian army units attempted to enter Kyiv. Since then all attempts to capture Ukraine’s capital have failed.

Civilians Join the Fight

When the war started, many volunteers, not just those with military experience, sought to join Ukraine’s armed forces: Ukrainian officials reported there were about 100,000 volunteers during the first two days of the war. Besides the regular army, reserve Territorial Defense units in each region are accepting local residents ready to fight. In some regions and cities, such as Kyiv, the government has provided guns and arms to Territorial Defense volunteers to protect their cities. About 150,000 Ukrainian men who lived or stayed abroad have returned to Ukraine to help defend their country.

In addition, thousands of foreign volunteers with military experience from more than fifty countries have joined the Ukrainian forces to fight the Russian occupants in Ukraine.

Civilian Infrastructure and Civilians under Attack

When Russia’s plan for a quick regime change failed, Russian forces adopted a different strategy, bombing and shelling civilian infrastructure. Cities close to the Russian border, including Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, are among those that have borne the brunt of the shelling. In some cases, Moscow has not even bothered to deny the deliberate shelling of civilian infrastructure, as happened in the critical Black Sea port of Mariupol. Residents of this city have not had access to humanitarian aid or food or water for weeks, and evacuation routes have been repeatedly shelled.

As of late March, over four million Ukrainians had left the country as refugees, and another 6.5 million had become internally displaced persons. More than a quarter of the country’s population has had to leave home.

Kidnappings. On the temporarily occupied territories, Russian forces have kidnapped local officials—mayors of cities and members of city and regional councils—as well as journalists and activists, forcing them to cooperate or leave.

Use of prohibited weapons by the Russian army. Ukraine’s representatives and international organizations, including NATO, say that Russia has used cluster and vacuum bombs and white phosphorus munitions, which use is condemned by international agreements. Western governments and intelligence also point to the high risk that Russia will use chemical and biological weapons in Ukraine.

Engagement of Belarus

On February 27, Belarusian president Aleksandr Lukashenko confirmed that some missiles used to attack Ukraine had been launched from Belarus, but denied that Belarus was engaged in the war against Ukraine. Nonetheless, Lukashenko cited a possible attack from Ukraine as a reason for going to war, and threatened a Belarusian “special operation” against Ukraine.

President Zelensky then held a phone conversation with Lukashenko to try to persuade him not to join the Russian war against Ukraine. After that conversation, and up to the time of publication of this text, Belarusian troops have not entered Ukraine. However, Russian troops have on several occasions used Belarus as a base for launching missiles into Ukraine.

Nuclear Terrorism

During the war, the Russian army has exhibited highly risky behavior with respect to nuclear facilities and hydroelectric power plants, behavior that poses a great danger to Ukraine and neighboring states and to the Russian troops themselves. The risky Russian maneuvers have included seizing control of the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear power plant (NPP), with a subsequent increase in levels of radiation in that area, and of Zaporizhzhia NPP, the largest NPP in Europe. Russian forces also took NPP personnel hostage, shelled the NPP grounds, and so forth, as elaborated in a recent Kennan Focus Ukraine analysis.

Negotiations with Russia

On February 25, Volodymyr Zelensky called on his Russian counterpart to start negotiations in earnest to stop the war and the killings. The first round of negotiations was held on February 28 in Belarus. Among other key issues, the parties discussed opening humanitarian corridors to allow noncombatants to leave areas of heavy fighting. Regardless of what agreements were reached, Russian troops often violated them by blocking evacuation routes or shelling evacuation corridors.

On March 10, Ukrainian and Russian foreign affairs ministers met in Turkey, but reached no agreement on a ceasefire. On March 29 the parties held another round of talks in Istanbul mediated by Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan. A representative of the Russian delegation said that Russia would reduce military activity in two sectors near Kyiv, but the situation after the meeting proved his words false.

Ukraine presented its initial terms on March 29. It is expected that Russian authorities will provide their answer in the next two weeks, which would then be followed by another meeting of Russian and Ukrainian foreign affairs ministers. Direct meetings of the presidents are not yet countenanced.

3. INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS

Investigation of Russian War Crimes in Ukraine

After the Russian army invaded Ukraine, on February 28 the International Criminal Court prosecutor Karim A. A. Khan announced he was prepared to open an investigation into the acts of violence committed against civilians and the destruction of civil infrastructure. Even though Ukraine is not a State Party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and so cannot itself refer the situation to the court, the investigation was opened on the referral of thirty-nine states on March 2, 2022. The Ukrainian government has collected evidence of Russian army crimes since then.

On March 16, the UN’s International Court of Justice ordered Russia to halt its invasion of Ukraine, but the Kremlin rejected the order. In late March the UN established a commission to investigate violations and abuses of human rights, violations of international humanitarian law, and related crimes in the context of the aggression against Ukraine by the Russian Federation.

Alliance with UK and Poland

One week before the war, Ukraine—together with Poland and the UK—announced establishing a new strategic cooperative alliance designed to contribute to security and develop trade among the three states. The idea of the alliance was proposed by Kyiv in October 2021. As of now, the UK and Poland are among the key partners supporting Ukraine in the war with Russia.

EU Integration

On February 26, Polish president Andrzej Duda proposed that the EU offer Ukraine an accelerated path to EU membership. This idea was later supported by Hungary, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Ukraine’s EU aspirations were also supported by the president of the European Commission. Representatives of some other states, including France and the Netherlands, however, did not endorse a fast track to EU membership.

On February 28, President Zelensky signed a request to join the EU. On March 10, participants in a European Council summit expressed support for Ukraine’s application and approved a decision on Ukraine’s future EU membership: the council acknowledged the European aspirations of Ukraine and invited the European Commission to submit its opinion regarding this application. Later, Slovenia’s prime minister Janez Jansa said that the EU should have specifically promised Ukraine EU membership. According to polls, most people in Germany, France, and Italy support the idea of Ukraine becoming a member of the EU.

Relations with NATO

Since the start of the war, President Zelensky has persistently called on NATO to establish a no-flight zone over Ukraine. However, NATO itself and member states have refused, fearing escalation or the unleashing of a world war.

At an extraordinary session on March 24, NATO issued a statement urging Russia to allow rapid, safe, and unhindered humanitarian access and safe passage for civilians, and to allow humanitarian aid to be delivered to the besieged cities. NATO member states committed to continue supporting Ukraine politically and offered to provide assistance in cybersecurity and protection against threats of a chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear nature. They also called on China to cease amplifying the Kremlin’s false narratives and to promote a peaceful resolution to the conflict.

Canada

In March, Canada’s parliament voted to introduce a visa-free regime for Ukrainians. Earlier Canada had expressed support for Ukraine and committed to helping with energy exports to reduce Ukraine’s need for Russian oil, gas, and uranium.

4. INTERNAL AFFAIRS

Energy Crises Avoided and Energy Developments during the War

In the winter of 2021–2022, many politicians and experts expected an energy crisis in Ukraine because of a rally in energy prices and restrictions on importing coal supplies from Russia. With a warm winter, however, the energy sector survived the season without much problem. Despite the Russian invasion, Ukraine’s energy sector has exhibited an unexpected resilience, as detailed in an earlier Kennan Focus Ukraine analysis.

Once the war started, Ukraine lost supplies from Russia and Belarus. Now fuel is being delivered only from the EU.

Confiscation of Russian Property in Ukraine

On March 10, President Zelensky signed a law stipulating the confiscation of Russian property in Ukraine. The law set out the rules for seizing without compensation property owned by Russian residents, the Russian state, or Russian companies.

Ban on Pro-Russian Political Forces for the Duration of the War

In March 2022, Ukraine’s Security Council suspended operations of the Opposition Platform—For Life political party, co-led by the pro-Russian politician Viktor Medvedchuk, and of ten more political parties suspected of harboring pro-Russian sympathies. Medvedchuk had been under house arrest, suspected of high treason, but he escaped when the war started.

At the time of Joe Biden’s assumption of power, the former president had bluntly declared Vladimir Putin a “killer” to the enragement of Russians. Here we have listed the countries supporting Russia & Ukraine.

Countries Supporting Russia & Ukraine

Some or all of these organizations would rush to President Putin’s aid if Russia invaded Ukraine, despite the organization’s reluctance to deal with internal issues.

Azerbaijan (not a CSTO member) is also expected to ignore any calls for rising against Russia during a conflict. Russia’s president brokered a truce between Armenia and Azerbaijan, raging in Nagorno-Karabakh.

A ceasefire pact was only achieved after Putin’s intervention, despite the entire world calling for the war to end. A subsequent Russian deployment aimed at preventing a new ethnic conflict was placed around the disputed area. Even if Azerbaijan does not openly support Russia, it is almost sure that it won’t join forces against it.

Iranian support for Russia would go further towards the Middle East. The Iranian leadership consistently courted Russia for a rejoinder after the Nuclear Deal fell apart.

Russia has supplied arms to Iran and has cooperated with it during the Syrian war, amid rising tensions between the US and its allies on the one hand and Iran on the other.

After Qasem Soleimani’s assassination, Washington and Tehran’s relations thawed. Moscow condemned the attack without ambiguity. Iran is expected to support Russia wholeheartedly as it continues to be subjected to sanctions by the US.

However, one of the most critical factors is that the world’s largest economy, the so-called ‘Asian Dragon’ – China, is one of Russia’s major trading partners. Over the past few years, Moscow has strengthened its partnership with Beijing as tensions between the West and China have continued to escalate.

It is a known fact that both Russia and China are partners on a multi-dimensional basis, with a wide range of cooperation from business to the military to space. According to the Chinese government, the US should set aside the mentality of the Cold War and take seriously the security concerns that Russia holds. China would not hesitate to support Russia in the event of a conflict.

Countries Supporting Russia in War with Ukraine

In the article we published today, we covered the countries supporting Russia.

In this conflict, countries that were once part of the Soviet Union, including Belarus, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kyrgyzstan, will stand by Russia.

Also extending its support to Putin was Cuba, a close ally of the Russians.

Due to its good relations with the Russian Federation and Ukraine, India has maintained a neutral position as a non-aligned state.

China aims to take diplomatic measures and strike a balance between western countries and Russia.
