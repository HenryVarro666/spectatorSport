Videos posted on social media showed that gunfire could be heard in Kyiv throughout the night, indicating that Ukrainian forces were battling the Russian “sabotage groups” that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has claimed are operating in the city.

In an address to Ukrainians on Saturday, Zelensky said that Ukrainian forces had “derailed” Russia’s plans to quickly capture Kyiv, according to Agence France Presse.

“We have withstood and successfully repelled enemy attacks,” Zelenskyy said in a speech Saturday morning. “The fighting continues in many cities and districts of our state, but we know that we are protecting the country, the land, the future of children.”

Zelensky had warned in an earlier speech just before midnight on Friday that an attack on the capital was imminent and Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko had separately warned that Russian troops were “very close to the capital,” adding that “the night and the morning will be difficult.”

As of Saturday, Russian troops were about 30 kilometers north of Kyiv, said a senior defense official, who cautioned reporters that the situation on the ground changes by the hour. The official also said that Russian “reconnaissance elements” are operating in and near the capital, but he did not elaborate on what types of forces these are or how many are inside Kyiv.

Video of fighting reportedly near the Berestreiska metro station in western Kyiv. https://t.co/rUALEn4cX0 pic.twitter.com/JAu4uLnujY — Rob Lee (@RALee85) February 26, 2022

Nearly three days after the invasion began, the Russians have committed more than half of the combat forces that had been amassed around Ukraine’s border to the fight, the senior official said during a Saturday press call. The Russians have also fired more than 250 missiles at Ukraine and conducted an amphibious landing from the Sea of Azov to the west of the Ukrainian city of Mariupol.

Yet U.S. military officials believe the invasion is moving slower than the Russians had expected, in part because of stiff Ukrainian resistance, the official said.

“We continue to believe, based on what we’ve observed, that this resistance is greater than what the Russians expected, and we have indications that the Russians are increasingly frustrated by their lack of momentum over the last 24 hours, particularly in the north parts of Ukraine,” the official said.

U.S. military officials also believe that the Russians have sent more fuel and other logistics support to its invading forces than they had expected to do at this point in the operation, the official said.

A video posted on Twitter purportedly shows a Ukrainian man driving next to a stopped Russian military vehicle and asking if they had broken down. When the Russian troops respond that they have run out of fuel, the Ukrainian man offers to tow them back to Russia.

A priceless exchange of a brave Ukrainian citizen with Russian army stuck out of fuel. ENGLISH SUBTITLES.

So far, Russian forces have advanced from the occupied Crimea peninsula toward the Ukrainian city of Kherson; from Belarus towards Kyiv; and from Belgorod, Russia, toward Kharkiv, Ukraine, the senior defense official said. Both military targets and civilian areas have been struck by Russian missiles, said the official, who added the U.S. military does not have an estimate of how many casualties and damage the Russian invasion has created.

Kyiv has clearly been in Russia’s crosshairs since the start of the invasion. The senior defense official told reporters on Thursday that Russia appears intent on “decapitating” the Ukrainian government by taking Kyiv quickly and installing their own governing apparatus. Earlier that day, CNN reporter Matthew Chance reported live from the scene as Russian paratroopers captured an airport just 21 miles from the capital.

On Friday, Russian special operations forces who had attacked the Obolon district of Kyiv were reportedly repulsed by Ukrainian troops, Coffee or Die Magazine editor Nolan Peterson reported.

Zelensky has ordered a “general mobilization” for the Ukrainian military, according to CNN, which means that many male Ukrainian citizens are now barred from leaving the country and will be conscripted into the military to defend Kyiv, a city of nearly 3 million.

It has been nearly three days since Russia launched its full-scale assault on cities across the country that began from the North, South, and East. Explosions were reported in Kyiv in the early morning hours of Thursday. Similar explosions were reported in nearby Boryspil, as well as cities throughout the country, which is about the size of Texas.

The Russian attack followed a weeks-long military buildup of nearly 200,000 troops along the Ukrainian border.

Russia’s pre-dawn invasion of Ukraine kicked off shortly after Russian Vladimir Putin announced in a pre-recorded speech that he had “taken the decision to carry out a special military operation” in the country and called on Ukrainian soldiers to lay down their arms.

“All service members of the Ukrainian army who follow these demands will be able to leave the battle zone,” Putin said in the speech, warning: “Anyone who tries to interfere with us, or even more so, to create threats for our country and our people, must know that Russia’s response will be immediate and will lead you to such consequences as you have never before experienced in your history. We are ready for any turn of events.”

Putin on Monday recognized two separatist regions in Ukraine as independent and then deployed Russian troops to the provinces as a so-called “peacekeeping” force. It was just the latest Russian incursion into Ukraine — an independent nation since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 — after Moscow annexed the country’s Crimea peninsula in 2014 and began training and supporting an armed insurgency in the east that has cost the lives of nearly 13,000 people, according to the International Crisis Group.

The U.S. government closed its embassy in Kyiv and ordered Americans to leave the country prior to the Russian invasion. Apache helicopters, F-35 fighter jets, and hundreds of U.S. troops have been deployed to Poland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania in support of NATO allies.

President Joe Biden had previously stressed the deployment of troops to the region was a “defensive move on our part” and the U.S. had “no intention of fighting Russia.”

Speaking at the White House on Thursday, Biden reiterated that U.S. troops would not fight Russia in Ukraine while announcing he had ordered additional troops to deploy from the United States to NATO allies in the region.

Most of those 7,000 additional service members will mostly come from the Army’s 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team,3rd Infantry Division, who will deploy to Germany in the coming days, a senior defense official said. In total, between 10,000 and 12,000 U.S. troops have been placed on prepare to deploy orders to respond to the Russian invasion, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said during a Friday news briefing.

“Our forces are not and will not be engaged in a conflict with Russia in Ukraine,” Biden said. “Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our NATO allies and assure those NATO allies in the east.”

Thousands of people have been fleeing Kyiv in recent days.

Earlier, at the main train station, hundreds of people gathered in a desperate attempt to flee Ukraine's capital. Even those who have cars struggled to leave the city because almost all petrol stations in the region are closed.

With the metro and buses not running, many people walked to the station - some for many kilometres - and on the way, when sirens went off, they dashed to buildings with a basement or a bomb shelter.

Evacuation trains were organised by the Ukrainian railway to take people to the west of the country and whenever one pulled up, a huge crowd quickly gathered trying to scramble aboard.

Those who couldn't get a train before the curfew began at 17:00 local time will be spending the night in the station as a Russian attack looms.",https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-60517447?ns_mchannel=social&ns_source=twitter&ns_campaign=bbc_live&ns_linkname=6219de85ec502b53cd47fb6c%26Russian%20plan%20to%20capture%20me%20derailed%20-%20Zelensky%262022-02-26T11%3A43%3A51.702Z&ns_fee=0&pinned_post_locator=urn:asset:f535efa0-c574-410f-a1ef-95991b4031ee&pinned_post_asset_id=6219de85ec502b53cd47fb6c&pinned_post_type=share

(CNN) — Explosions have been seen and heard in parts of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, as the fight by Ukrainian forces to hold back a Russian advance on the capital intensifies in the early hours of Saturday morning, amid warnings the city could fall within days and as officials handed out weapons to reservists.

“This night will be very difficult, and the enemy will use all available forces to break the resistance of Ukrainians,” President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a late-night video message Friday. “This night we have to stand ground. The fate of Ukraine is being decided right now.”

Earlier Saturday, videos from eyewitnesses showed explosions taking place in an area north-west of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. There is a military base in the area.

CNN teams in the capital also reported hearing loud explosions to the west and south of the city Saturday. Shortly afterward, Ukraine’s State Service of Special Communications said clashes are underway in an eastern suburb as well — as Russian forces close in on the capital from multiple sides.

Meanwhile, the Ukrainian armed forces reported heavy fighting around the city of Vasylkiv, some 30 kilometers southwest of Kyiv.

“Heavy fighting is currently underway in the town of Vasylkiv in the Kyiv region, where the occupiers are trying to land a landing party,” the armed forces said.

Russian forces are close to Kyiv, Zelensky confirmed in his message Friday, advancing on the capital from the north and east after seizing control Thursday of an airbase just north of the city. But “Ukrainians resist the Russian aggression heroically,” he said.

Russia’s military claimed earlier Friday its forces had staged a “successful landing operation” to capture Hostomel airfield, viewed as strategically important, on Kyiv’s outskirts.

Zelensky’s comments came hours after a video was posted on his Facebook page, showing him with a group of men, saying, “We are here. We are in Kyiv. We are defending Ukraine.”

Before dawn Friday, explosions lit up the sky above the capital as Russia targeted the city with missile strikes, according to a Ukrainian government adviser. A CNN team reported hearing two large blasts in central Kyiv and a third loud explosion in the distance, followed by at least three more explosions to the south-west of the city a few hours later.

“Strikes on Kyiv with cruise or ballistic missiles continued,” Anton Gerashchenko, adviser to the Head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine told reporters via text message Friday.

Meanwhile, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said Russian reconnaissance troops had entered the Obolon district of northern Kyiv, just a few miles from the city center. Videos from the area showed chaotic scenes as civilians tried to hide from small arms fire.

A tweet from the ministry asked citizens of the district to report any suspicious movements, adding: “Make Molotov cocktails and take down the occupier.”

CNN witnessed a group of Ukrainian security forces leave the city police headquarters with weapons and ammunition — apparently heading towards Obolon.

Meanwhile, 92 people working at the Chernobyl power plant, the site of the world’s worst-ever nuclear disaster, have been taken hostage, the Ukrainian ambassador to the US said Friday. Russian forces took control of the site on Thursday, sparking fears that the fighting could interfere with the operation of nuclear waste facilities.

As Russian troops advance, US intelligence officials are concerned that Kyiv could fall under Russian control within days, according to two sources familiar with the latest intelligence.

However, the latest British defense intelligence assessment said Russia had made “limited progress” Friday in its attack.

“Fighting continues in key locations. Russia has made limited progress so far today and Ukraine retains control of key cities. Ukrainian MOD reports that Russian forces have arrived in the suburbs of Kyiv,” the UK Ministry of Defence tweeted.

A senior US defense official told reporters that the Russians have “about a third of their combat power” in Ukraine out of the total combat power they have amassed on the country’s borders right now, but “that does not mean that they will not commit more.”

The Ukrainian Defense Ministry earlier said that airborne assault troops blew up a bridge over the Teteriv River at Ivankiv, about 30 miles north of Kyiv, successfully preventing a Russian column of forces from advancing towards the capital, which has a population of close to 3 million.

For now, Ukraine’s democratically elected government remains intact but President Volodymr Zelensky warned in a video address late Thursday that “enemy sabotage groups” had entered this city and he is their No. 1 target. “They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state,” he said.

“Russian forces continued to launch missile strikes on the territory of Ukraine. They say that they are only targeting military facilities, but these are lies. In fact, they do not distinguish in which areas they operate,” he said. “Such attacks on our capital haven’t occurred since 1941.”

In an address Friday morning, Zelensky said Ukrainians were “showing their true heroism” but that they were defending their country “alone.” The sanctions imposed on Russia by Western powers are “not enough to get these foreign troops off our soil,” he said.

A few hours later, Zelensky released a message in which he again called for Russian President Vladimir Putin to hold direct talks. “There is fighting all over Ukraine now. Let’s sit down at the negotiation table to stop the people’s deaths,” he said, speaking in Russian.

Shortly afterward, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was ready to send a delegation to Minsk, the capital of Belarus, for talks with Ukraine, Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti reported.

“As you know, today the President of Ukraine Zelensky announced his readiness to discuss the neutral status of Ukraine,” Peskov said, according to RIA. The talks would concern “neutral status,” he suggested. Peskov said later Friday that the Ukrainian side had countered with a proposal to meet in Warsaw and then dropped contact.

Zelensky has not directly proposed neutral status but has signaled a willingness to discuss it, while insisting his country be provided security guarantees.

“Ukraine has been and remains ready to talk about a ceasefire and peace. This is our constant position,” Sergii Nykyforov, a spokesperson for Zelensky, said late Friday. He also denied what he called “claims that we have refused to negotiate.”

Meanwhile, Putin called on Ukraine’s armed forces to overthrow their government in remarks to his security council Friday.

“Do not let Banderites (Ukrainian nationalists) and neo-Nazis use your children, wives and old people as human shields,” Putin said in remarks aired on Russian state television. “Take power into your own hands, it looks like it will be easier for us to come to an agreement than with this gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis that has settled in Kyiv and taken hostage the entire Ukrainian people.”

Putin frequently repeats the baseless and inaccurate claim that the democratically elected Ukrainian government is a “Nazi” or “fascist” regime. The language has been roundly condemned internationally, especially considering that Zelensky is Jewish.

Asked by CNN at a news conference Friday what Moscow’s plans were for the leadership of Ukraine as Russian forces advance on Kyiv, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov replied: “Nobody is going to attack the people of Ukraine.”

In an interview with CNN on the streets of Kyiv, former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko accused Putin of being “simply crazy” in wanting to “come here to kill Ukrainians” — and vowed they would resist. “We demonstrate a unique quality that we can stand against Russian aggression,” he said.

Homes damaged

The advance on Kyiv comes only a day after Russian forces entered Ukraine from three sides, by land, sea and air, prompting a barrage of international condemnation and sanctions — and questions about Putin’s wider ambitions for the country and its capital.

It’s unclear how long Ukrainian forces can resist the advance of Russian forces who are much better equipped and have superior air power.

Two residential buildings in Kyiv suffered damage in the early hours of Friday, but it’s not clear if they were intentionally struck or hit by debris, or if anyone was injured.

Ukrainian Deputy Interior Minister Evgeny Yenin told CNN a Ukrainian Sukhoi Su-27 fighter jet was shot down over Kyiv. Photos tweeted by the emergency forces appear to show a fire at a two-story private house with debris from what looks to be a plane nearby. It is unclear if the house was hit by remnants of the jet.

Separately, images showed firefighters working to put out a blaze at an apartment building on the left bank of the city.

As they approach, many Ukrainians are preparing to fight back. Some 18,000 guns with ammunition have been distributed to reservists in the Kyiv region alone since the Russian invasion began early Thursday, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said, with more weapons on their way.

Outside the Kyiv region, fighting continued in cities including Sumy, in the northeast, Chernihiv in the north and Kherson to the south.

A CNN team that visited a bridge crossing from Russian-held areas into the southern city of Kherson saw four large shell craters, 10 discarded Ukrainian armored vehicles and several bodies, but the Ukrainians appeared to have been able to push Russian forces back.

Low-flying jets could be seen overhead and air raid sirens wailed across the city.

A Russian defense ministry spokesperson said in a statement that a “counter-offensive” was underway in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, and that Ukrainian service members had surrendered to Russian troops and pro-Russian separatists. CNN could not immediately check the veracity of those claims.

Makeshift bunkers

Officials in the country believe Russia’s plan is to overthrow the Ukrainian leadership and install a pro-Russian government.

Those fears were shared with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, who said Thursday that he’s “convinced” Moscow is going to try to overthrow the Ukrainian government.

If that happens, Blinken said he believes “Moscow has developed plans to inflict widespread human rights abuses — and potentially worse — on the Ukrainian people.”

The fighting in Ukraine appears to be some of the worst conventional warfare Europe has seen since World War II and the conflicts in the Balkans in the 1990s. Preliminary figures indicate 137 Ukrainian solders have been killed, including every soldier defending an island in the Black Sea that was taken over by Russian troops, according to President Zelensky.

The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said its armed forces had caused around 800 casualties among Russian forces since the attacks started early on Thursday. It was not immediately clear whether the ministry was referring solely to the number killed and CNN is not able to independently verify Ukraine’s figures.

By the end of Thursday, Putin’s forces had launched “in total more than 160 missiles for airstrikes,” a senior US defense official said, prompting a response reminiscent of the late 1930s, with vulnerable children evacuated by train from eastern Ukraine and packed subway stations turned into makeshift bunkers as air raid sirens wailed.

In an ominous sign a ground war could escalate, Zelensky barred male citizens between the ages of 18 and 60 from leaving the country, according to the State Border Guard Service.

Zelensky also ordered a general military mobilization “in order to ensure the defense of the state, maintaining combat and mobilization readiness of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other military formations, in a declaration signed late Thursday.

More than 100,000 people have already fled areas most at risk of attack within Ukraine, according to the United Nations refugee agency. The mass movement followed warnings from the US Ambassador to the UN, who said Russia’s actions in Ukraine could create one of the largest refugee crises facing the world today, displacing as many as five million people.

Polish officials reported an increase in the number of people crossing into the country from Ukraine in the hours after the Russian invasion began.

Sanctioning Putin

The United States will impose sanctions on Putin and Lavrov, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Friday, hours after the European Union and United Kingdom said they would do the same.

The EU also announced a slew of other new sanctions on Russia, designed to have “maximum impact on the Russian economy and political elite.”

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the sanctions would hit Russia’s financial, energy and transport sectors, visa policy, and include export controls and export financing bans.

“We want to financially isolate Russia, we want to cut all the ties between Russia and the international financial system,” said French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire.

Speaking in Brussels on Thursday, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg described Russia’s attack on Ukraine as a “brutal act of war.”

The alliance activated the NATO Response Force (NRF) for the first time ever in response to the invasion. The NRF is made up of land, air, sea and special operations forces from the allies that can deploy quickly in support of the NATO alliance.

“We have over 100 jets at high alert, operating in over 30 different locations, and over 120 ships from the high north, to the Mediterranean. We activated the defense plans yesterday, and now elements of this force are being deployed,” Stoltenberg said during a press briefing on Friday, following an extraordinary meeting of NATO Heads of State and Government in Brussels. He also clarified that while the United States, Canada and European allies have “deployed thousands more troops” to the eastern part of the alliance, NATO is not deploying the entire Response Force.

A big concern for NATO is whether Putin’s intentions lie beyond Ukraine, a prospect that risks drawing all 30 members — including the US, the United Kingdom, Canada, France and Germany — into a wider conflict on European soil.

“You don’t need intelligence to tell you that that’s exactly what President Putin wants. He has made clear he’d like to reconstitute the Soviet Empire, short of that he’d like to reassert a sphere of influence around the neighboring countries that were once part of the Soviet bloc,” said Blinken on CBS Evening News.

Blinken said NATO would stand in the way if those were Putin’s ultimate goals.

“Now, when it comes to a threat beyond Ukraine’s borders. There’s something very powerful standing in his way. That’s article five of NATO, an attack on one is an attack on all,” the top diplomat said.

On Thursday, the US Secretary of Defense ordered the deployment of 7,000 US service members to Europe. The deployment brings the number of US troops moved towards eastern Europe at more than 14,000.",https://kslnewsradio.com/1964733/battle-for-ukrainian-capital-underway-as-explosions-seen-and-heard-in-kyiv/

Pope calls for weapons to be 'silenced,' urges support for those fleeing Ukraine Pope Francis called for weapons to be ""silenced"" in Ukraine Sunday, and he urged the international community to support those fleeing the country. ""God is with the peacemakers, not with those who use violence,"" he said during the Sunday Angelus, according to Vatican News, an outlet officially affiliated with the Catholic Church. He also condemned the ""diabolical and perverse logic of weapons."" Francis said those fleeing Ukraine were ""brothers and sisters for whom it is urgent to open humanitarian corridors and who must be welcomed, with an aching heart, for what is happening in Ukraine."" The pontiff also reminded people not to forget about the conflicts unfolding elsewhere in the world, pointing to conflicts in Yemen, Syria and Ethiopia. Share this -







Ukrainian ambassador to U.S. accuses Russia of war crimes Russia has committed war crimes, taken civilians hostage and attacked an orphanage with 50 children inside, Oksana Markarova, the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States, said at a press conference Friday. ""The Russian propaganda machine says that civilians were not targeted. I want to tell you that is not true,"" she said, claiming that Russian rockets hit residential areas and ambulances, injured children and destroyed strategic gas pipelines. She said that Ukrainian armed forces are keeping the situation under control, claiming that 2,800 Russians were dead in the conflict and that 80 Russian tanks, 10 planes and seven helicopters had been destroyed. NBC News has not confirmed the numbers of any injuries or deaths on either side. The ambassador also raised concerns about the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, which remains irradiated and a key storage facility for atomic waste after the infamous 1986 meltdown. The Russians seized control and took 92 hostages, she said, forcing them to work in shifts that do not comply with international regulations. ""All responsibility now lies with the Russian army,"" she said regarding the continued maintenance of Chernobyl. Markarova noted that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and President Joe Biden had another call Friday to discuss an anti-war coalition that included 73 countries, ""working hand in hand,"" though she said those countries should also work to further defend Ukraine from Russian attacks. While she applauded the sanctions the U.S. and other countries have announced on Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, she said the sanctions on Russia should go further to fully ""exclude it"" from the international financial system. The press conference concluded with Markarova thanking Russians who had ""protested against Putin's attack on Ukraine."" ""We would like to say, we see you, and it gives us hope that there are forces in Russia that don’t support a brutal attack on this nation,"" she said. Share this -







Russian offensive unexpectedly slowed by stiff Ukrainian resistance Two days in, the Russian offensive appeared to be stymied by stiffer-than-expected resistance from highly motivated Ukrainian armed forces.

A growing number of cultural, sports institutions cut ties with Russia Russia's invasion of Ukraine has pushed several cultural and sports institutions to take a stand. Eurovision banned Russia from its competition, Manchester United severed its sponsorship deal with the Russian airline Aeroflot, and the German soccer club Schalke removed the logo of its main sponsor, the Russian state-owned energy powerhouse Gazprom, from player jerseys. “Given our norms today, [the invasion] is such a gross violation of what we see as our humanity that we’re going to react that way,"" said Matthew Schmidt, a professor of national security and political science at the University of New Haven, who specializes in Russian affairs.

Russia has launched an amphibious assault near the city of Mariupol, U.S. defense official says Russia has launched an amphibious assault to the west of Mariupol in southeastern Ukraine, a senior U.S. defense official told NBC News on Friday. Indications suggest that thousands of naval forces are being put ashore there, said the defense official, who was not authorized to speak publicly. The official added that it was assumed those forces would move toward the Donbas region, where Russian-backed separatists have been battling Ukrainian forces since 2014. “We do assess that there is greater resistance by the Ukrainians than the Russians expected. They are fighting for their country,” the official said, adding that the Russians had lost a little bit of momentum and had not advanced as far as they had expected to. The majority of Russian targets were military related, including air and missile defenses, aircraft and areas where the Ukrainian military was located, the official said. Share this -

U.S. public sees Russia-Ukraine conflict as a critical threat, Gallup finds Before Russia invaded Ukraine earlier this week, just more than half (52 percent) of Americans viewed the conflict between the two nations as critical to U.S. interests, a Gallup poll released Friday found. That is considerably more than the 44 percent who thought in 2015 that Russia annexing the Crimean Peninsula was critical to U.S. interests. Similar percentages of Republicans (56 percent) and Democrats (61 percent) are likely to see the conflict as a critical threat to U.S. vital interests, the polling taken between Feb. 1 and Feb. 17 found. Russia’s image has also deteriorated further, with 85 percent of Americans viewing the nation unfavorably, an 8 percentage point increase from 2021. Just 15 percent have a positive opinion of it.

Hillary Clinton calls on U.S., European allies to move 'more quickly' on sanctions, targeting Putin and Russian oligarchs Hillary Clinton said in an interview on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" on Friday that she believes the Biden administration and U.S. allies need to impose harsher sanctions on Russia that target President Vladimir Putin himself and his oligarchs. The former secretary of state said she hopes the U.S. and its European allies ""move even more quickly"" to impose sanctions not only on the Russian economy, but also on individual actors ""all the way up to Putin."" ""I think that the only pressure that Putin would respond to, or that could have any kind of impact on his thinking, would be [sanctioning] those who he relies on to launder his money, to keep the funding going into his secret accounts,"" she said. ""We've got to go after those oligarchs who are supporting Putin financially."" Clinton said the U.S. needs to call the oligarchs out by name and go after their assets, such as by a temporary suspension of access to things such as their yachts or huge houses or their bank accounts. ""Because if we don't up the pressure now, whatever we are doing, which I think is absolutely right to bring the world together to bring more troops to protect our NATO allies, it will take longer and Ukraine will be burning,"" she warned. She said there is an ""urgency"" to imposing these more powerful sanctions because some of the attacks haven't gone as well as Russia had wanted in Ukraine. As a result, she said, ""They will get more vicious and they will attack even more randomly and indiscriminately.” Clinton: What's left of the GOP must stand against those giving 'aid and comfort' to Putin Feb. 25, 2022 05:57 Share this -

The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a statement Friday that the U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine had received reports of at least 102 people injured, in addition to the 25 killed, as of midnight Thursday going into Friday. ""This is more than the total number of civilian casualties recorded by the U.N. Human Rights Office on both sides of the contact line for the whole of 2021,"" it said, noting that the figures for 2021 were 25 killed and 85 injured. Of those civilians killed or wounded, the U.N. human rights office said 23 were killed and 91 injured in government-controlled territory, including in the Donetsk, Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson and Luhansk regions. ""Because of the security situation, civilian casualties in Government-controlled territory are likely to be under-reported, and real figures, therefore, could be higher,"" the office said. In armed group-controlled territory, it said, two people were killed and 11 injured in Donetsk and Horlivka on Thursday. ""Our colleagues on the ground are working to corroborate these figures. However, as indicated, the figures we have are likely to be under-estimates,"" it said, adding that it is ""currently difficult to verify information, given both the security situation as well as the number of false reports emerging amid an information war.""

Russia sanctions are a ‘big deal,’ experts say. But effects could take years. The flurry of sanctions the U.S. announced this week against Russia are some of the hardest-hitting that Moscow has ever faced, but the slow pain they inflict may not be enough to deter President Vladimir Putin from escalating his invasion of Ukraine, experts said. President Joe Biden and several U.S. allies, including the European Union, the United Kingdom and Japan, have vowed to review further restrictions on Moscow as punishment for the invasion. The sanctions already announced are significant in size and scope, former U.S. Treasury and State Department officials who handled American sanctions in the past said, but the longtime American reliance on the national security tool has left the U.S. with few other options if Putin and Russia do not respond. Nevertheless, the Russian economy is already feeling the effects of war, and the sanctions could over time further cause the Russian stock market to falter, deflate the value of the ruble — which hit an all-time low Thursday — and make doing business in Russia increasingly difficult.

Sanctions are focused on preventing 'worst-case scenario,' Price says Sanctions being pushed on Russia as a ""primarily punitive"" measure are part of a larger strategic move against Putin, State Department spokesman Ned Price told MSNBC on Thursday. The sanctions, which were initially imposed Monday but escalated Thursday after Putin's attack on Ukraine, target 80 percent of Russia's banking assets. But they also limit Russia's ability to import about half of the technologies it needs, Price said. ""This is to do everything we can to prevent, to deter, a worst-case scenario,"" Price said. ""We know that what Putin has put in place is the ability to mount a massive, large-scale, bloody, devastating campaign against Ukraine, but also against the Ukrainian people."" Price said the sanctions will build and gain momentum over time. Russia has been hit with sanctions by the U.S. several U.S. allies, including the European Union, the United Kingdom and Japan. The ruble plummeted to an all-time low against the U.S. dollar Thursday as a result, but Russia's central bank promised to support any bank hurt by sanctions, insisting that it has the ability to maintain economic stability.

(CNN) -- Ukrainians in the capital Kyiv huddled in air raid shelters Friday morning, as a battle for the city raged overhead and Ukrainian forces sought to hold back rapidly advancing Russian troops by blowing up a key bridge.

Before dawn, explosions lit up the sky as Russia targeted the city with missile strikes, according to a Ukrainian government adviser. A CNN team reported hearing two large blasts in central Kyiv and a third loud explosion in the distance, followed by at least three more explosions to the south-west of the city a few hours later.

""Strikes on Kyiv with cruise or ballistic missiles continued,"" Anton Gerashchenko, adviser to the Head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine told reporters via text message Friday.

Meanwhile, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said Russian reconnaissance troops had entered the Obolon district of northern Kyiv, just a few miles from the city center. Videos from the area showed chaotic scenes as civilians tried to hide from small arms fire.

LIVE UPDATES ON INVASION

A tweet from the ministry asked citizens of the district to report any suspicious movements, adding: ""Make Molotov cocktails and take down the occupier.""

CNN witnessed a group of Ukrainian security forces leave the city police headquarters with weapons and ammunition -- apparently heading towards Obolon.

As Russian troops advance, US intelligence officials are concerned that Kyiv could fall under Russian control within days, according to two sources familiar with the latest intelligence.

US officials warned lawmakers that Russian forces who entered Ukraine through Belarus were about 20 miles (32 kilometers) away from Kyiv, sources told CNN.

The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said airborne assault troops blew up a bridge over the Teteriv River at Ivankiv, about 30 miles north of Kyiv, successfully preventing a Russian column of forces from advancing towards the capital, which has a population of close to 3 million.

For now, Ukraine's democratically elected government remains intact but President Volodymr Zelensky warned in a video address late Thursday that ""enemy sabotage groups"" had entered this city and he is their No. 1 target. ""They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state,"" he said.

""Russian forces continued to launch missile strikes on the territory of Ukraine. They say that they are only targeting military facilities, but these are lies. In fact, they do not distinguish in which areas they operate,"" he said. ""Such attacks on our capital haven't occurred since 1941.""

In an address Friday morning, Zelensky said Ukrainians were ""showing their true heroism"" but that they were defending their country ""alone,"" as ""the most powerful country in the world looked on from a distance,"" an apparent reference to the United States. The sanctions imposed on Russia by Western powers are ""not enough to get these foreign troops off our soil,"" he said.

A few hours later, Zelensky released a message in which he again called for Russian President Vladimir Putin to hold direct talks. ""There is fighting all over Ukraine now. Let's sit down at the negotiation table to stop the people's deaths,"" he said, speaking in Russian.

Shortly afterward, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was ready to send a delegation to Minsk, the capital of Belarus, for talks with Ukraine, Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti reported.

""As you know, today the President of Ukraine Zelensky announced his readiness to discuss the neutral status of Ukraine,"" Peskov said, according to RIA.

""Initially, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the purpose of the operation was to help the LPR and the DPR, including through the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine. And this, in fact, is an integral component of neutral status."" The LPR and DPR refer to the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, separatist areas in eastern Ukraine recently recognized by Russia as independent.

Ukrainian presidential advisor Oleksiy Arestovych told CNN Friday that the Ukrainian government is ""considering the proposal"" to hold talks in Minsk.

Putin has repeatedly called for the ""denazification"" of Ukraine, language that has been roundly condemned internationally, especially considering that Zelensky is Jewish.

Zelensky has not directly proposed neutral status but has signaled a willingness to discuss it, while insisting his country be provided security guarantees.

Asked by CNN at a news conference Friday what Moscow's plans were for the leadership of Ukraine as Russian forces advance on Kyiv, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov replied: ""Nobody is going to attack the people of Ukraine.""

In an interview with CNN on the streets of Kyiv, former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko accused Putin of being ""simply crazy"" in wanting to ""come here to kill Ukrainians"" -- and vowed they would resist. ""We demonstrate a unique quality that we can stand against Russian aggression,"" he said.





Homes damaged





The advance on Kyiv comes only a day after Russian forces entered Ukraine from three sides, by land, sea and air, prompting a barrage of international condemnation and sanctions -- and questions about Putin's wider ambitions for the country and its capital.

It's unclear how long Ukrainian forces can resist the advance of Russian forces who are better equipped and have superior air power.

Two residential buildings in Kyiv suffered damage in the early hours of Friday, but it's not clear if they were intentionally struck or hit by debris, or if anyone was injured.

Ukrainian Deputy Interior Minister Evgeny Yenin told CNN a Ukrainian Sukhoi Su-27 fighter jet was shot down over Kyiv. Photos tweeted by the emergency forces appear to show a fire at a two-story private house with debris from what appears to be a plane nearby. It is unclear if the house was hit by remnants of the jet.

Separately, images showed firefighters working to put out a blaze at an apartment building on the left bank of the city.

As they approach, many Ukrainians are preparing to fight back. Some 18,000 guns with ammunition have been distributed to reservists in the Kyiv region alone since the Russian invasion began early Thursday, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said, with more weapons on their way.

Ukrainian lawmaker Kira Rudik told CNN she believed in the Ukrainian military's capabilities and that it was her duty to remain in Kyiv. ""I'm armed and I have my crew armed and we have a couple of sets of people with territorial defense who are also armed and who will fight for every inch of Ukrainian soil -- right now of Kyiv soil -- not to let the Russians in.""

Outside the Kyiv region, fighting continued in cities including Sumy, in the northeast, Chernihiv in the north and Kherson to the south.

A CNN team that visited a bridge crossing from Russian-held areas into the southern city of Kherson saw four large shell craters, 10 discarded Ukrainian armored vehicles and several bodies, but the Ukrainians appeared to have been able to push Russian forces back.

Low-flying jets could be seen overhead and air raid sirens wailed across the city.

A Russian defense ministry spokesperson said in a statement that a ""counter-offensive"" was underway in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, and that Ukrainian service members had surrendered to Russian troops and pro-Russian separatists. CNN could not immediately check the veracity of those claims.





Makeshift bunkers





Officials in the country believe Russia's plan is to overthrow the Ukrainian leadership and install a pro-Russian government.

Those fears were shared with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, who said Thursday that he's ""convinced"" Moscow is going to try to overthrow the Ukrainian government.

If that happens, Blinken said he believes ""Moscow has developed plans to inflict widespread human rights abuses -- and potentially worse -- on the Ukrainian people.""

French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said Putin, in choosing to launch a ""massive offensive"" had ""decided to take Ukraine off the map of nations,"" in comments Friday to radio station France Inter.

The fighting in Ukraine appears to be some of the worst conventional warfare Europe has seen since World War II and the conflicts in the Balkans in the 1990s. Preliminary figures indicate 137 Ukrainian solders have been killed, including every soldier defending an island in the Black Sea that was taken over by Russian troops, according to President Zelensky.

The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said its armed forces had caused around 800 casualties among Russian forces since the attacks started early on Thursday. It was not immediately clear whether the ministry was referring solely to the number killed and CNN is not able to independently verify Ukraine's figures.

By the end of Thursday, Putin's forces had launched ""in total more than 160 missiles for airstrikes,"" a senior US defense official said, prompting a response reminiscent of the late 1930s, with vulnerable children evacuated by train from eastern Ukraine and packed subway stations turned into makeshift bunkers as air raid sirens wailed.

Overnight, in an ominous sign a ground war could escalate, Zelensky barred male citizens between the ages of 18 and 60 from leaving the country, according to the State Border Guard Service.

Zelensky also ordered a general military mobilization ""in order to ensure the defense of the state, maintaining combat and mobilization readiness of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other military formations, in a declaration signed late Thursday.

More than 100,000 people have already fled areas most at risk of attack within Ukraine, according to the United Nations refugee agency. The mass movement followed warnings from the US Ambassador to the UN, who said Russia's actions in Ukraine could create one of the largest refugee crises facing the world today, displacing as many as five million people.

Polish officials reported an increase in the number of people crossing into the country from Ukraine in the hours after the Russian invasion began.





Putin's wider ambitions





The European Union has announced new sanctions on Russia, designed to have ""maximum impact on the Russian economy and political elite.""

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the sanctions would hit Russia's financial, energy and transport sectors, visa policy, and include export controls and export financing bans.

""We want to financially isolate Russia, we want to cut all the ties between Russia and the international financial system,"" said French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire.

Speaking in Brussels on Thursday, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg described Russia's attack on Ukraine as a ""brutal act of war.""

A big concern for NATO is whether Putin's intentions lie beyond Ukraine, a prospect that risks drawing all 30 members -- including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, France and Germany -- into a wider conflict on European soil.

""You don't need intelligence to tell you that that's exactly what President Putin wants. He has made clear he'd like to reconstitute the Soviet Empire, short of that he'd like to reassert a sphere of influence around the neighboring countries that were once part of the Soviet bloc,"" said Blinken on CBS Evening News.

Blinken said NATO would stand in the way if those were Putin's ultimate goals.

""Now, when it comes to a threat beyond Ukraine's borders. There's something very powerful standing in his way. That's article five of NATO, an attack on one is an attack on all,"" the top diplomat said.

On Thursday, the US Secretary of Defense ordered the deployment of 7,000 US service members to Europe. The deployment brings the number of US troops moved towards eastern Europe at more than 14,000.

In his address announcing Russia's ""military operation"" in Ukraine Thursday, Putin threatened ""those who may be tempted to intervene"" on Ukraine's behalf, saying Russia's response would be ""immediate"" and lead to ""such consequences as you have never experienced in your history,"" he said.
