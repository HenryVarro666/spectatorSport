The United States announced a deal with European leaders on Friday to increase shipments of natural gas to help wean Europe off Russian energy. And Germany set an ambitious goal of halving its imports of Russian oil and coal this year and freeing itself from its dependence on Russian natural gas by the middle of 2024.

Germany’s timelines, outlined by its vice chancellor, are a remarkable turnabout by Europe’s largest economy, which has long relied extensively on Russia for energy. Just a few months ago, Germany was still aiming to buy even more natural gas from Moscow through a new pipeline called Nord Stream 2.

But President Vladimir V. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has forced leaders in Germany and other European countries to rip up the energy playbook they had used for years, decades even, in just a month. The German vice chancellor, Robert Habeck, said at a briefing in Berlin that his country was shifting away from Russian energy at an “insane pace.”

President Biden is seeking to encourage similar moves by other European countries, in part by offering up the United States as an energy supplier.

The deal he announced, in Brussels earlier on Friday, lacked many details but contained some big goals: The United States would send an additional 15 billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas to Europe this year — roughly 10 to 12 percent of current annual U.S. exports to all countries. By 2030, the president said, the United States will aim to increase supplies by as much as 50 billion cubic meters a year.

The moves caught many in the U.S. energy industry by surprise. Oil and gas executives who have become accustomed to being pilloried for their contributions to climate change were suddenly being called up to help liberate European allies from Russian energy. While the industry was not certain how Europe would make such a giant pivot, executives clearly relished their new casting as saviors rather than villains.

“I have no idea how they are going to do this, but I don’t want to criticize them, because for the first time they are trying to do the right thing,” said Charif Souki, the executive chairman of Tellurian, a U.S. gas producer that is planning to build an export terminal in Louisiana.

Mr. Biden and the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said many of the specifics would be worked out by a task force dedicated to reducing Europe’s dependency on Russian oil and gas in ways that would not undermine the climate policies of the two partners.

Among the things they did not address was the shortage of port capacity to ship and receive more gas on both sides of the Atlantic. The effort could also struggle because the Biden administration can’t simply order U.S. exporters to sell gas to European buyers or to set prices acceptable to those buyers.

“We’re going to have to make sure that families in Europe can get through this winter and the next while we’re building an infrastructure for a diversified, resilient and clean energy future,” Mr. Biden said.

The European Union is heavily reliant on energy imports from Russia, a big producer of oil, diesel, coal and, perhaps most important, natural gas. That dependence has become a growing problem as the European Union seeks to punish Mr. Putin. Russia provides about 40 percent of Europe’s natural gas, and a sizable chunk of it is shipped by pipeline through Ukraine.

Germany has long been one of Russia’s biggest customers. Having decided to shut down its nuclear plants, Germany has increasingly relied on natural gas. Because it got relatively affordable gas by pipeline from Russia — and some from the Netherlands, Norway and other suppliers — it declined to build any terminals where liquefied natural gas could be imported.

Germany also imports nearly a third of its crude oil from Russia. It has been trying to slash its consumption with generous subsidies for electric cars and greater investment in public transportation.

The Ukraine war has accelerated such German efforts under Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who leads a coalition government made up of conservatives, liberals and environmentalists. Germany this year has revived plans to build gas importing terminals and has suspended final approvals of Nord Stream 2, an almost-complete pipeline that would have fed it a steady supply of Russian gas.

“Every supply contract that is terminated hurts Putin,” Mr. Habeck said on Friday.

Later in the day, E.U. countries agreed to jointly purchase and store natural gas. They set a target of filling 80 percent of their underground gas storage facilities by November as a buffer against supply disruptions during winter, when gas use increases for heating.

In the United States, gas exporters were already shifting sales to Europe from Asia in recent months, largely because prices in Europe have been higher than almost anywhere else in the world because of rising tensions with Russia and, more recently, the war in Ukraine. Nearly 75 percent of U.S. L.N.G. exports have gone to Europe so far this year, up from 34 percent in 2021. The Biden administration has encouraged that shift by relaxing export restrictions to certain European countries.

Charlie Riedl, the executive director at the Center for Liquefied Natural Gas, a trade group, said he thought an extra 15 billion cubic feet of U.S. gas exports to Europe could be achieved relatively easily. He said two-thirds of that total could come from diverting shipments that otherwise would be bound for Asia, and the rest could come from recent federal approvals for additional production from existing American L.N.G. export terminals.

“Obviously it’s a positive sign that Europe is making attempts to wean itself off Russian gas,” Mr. Riedl said.

Energy executives say the Biden administration could help increase the flow of gas by streamlining permitting for new U.S. export terminals, where natural gas is chilled into a liquid and pumped into oceangoing tankers. Washington and the European Union could also provide loan guarantees for U.S. export terminals and European import terminals. There are roughly a dozen U.S. export terminals that have won regulatory approval but need financing to be built. About 10 European import terminals are being built.

Executives complain it can take more time to obtain permits for pipelines and export terminals than to build them.

Export terminals require investments of up to $10 billion, while import terminals cost about $1 billion to build. The United States has seven export terminals, and Europe has 28 large-scale import terminals.

Environmentalists criticized Mr. Biden’s announcement because they fear it will commit the United States and Europe to using fossil fuels for decades longer than they argue is sustainable given the growing toll of climate change.

“There is no way to ramp up U.S. L.N.G. exports and deliver on the imperative climate commitments that the U.S. and E.U. have pledged,” said Abigail Dillen, the president of Earthjustice, an environmental law organization. She warned that the buildup of L.N.G. infrastructure would “lock in expensive fossil dependence and dangerous pollution for decades to come.”

American and European officials also agreed to seek ways to decrease greenhouse gas emissions from L.N.G. infrastructure and pipelines and to reduce the release of methane from gas operations. They said they would ramp up energy efficiency initiatives, such as the deployment of heat pumps and the use of clean hydrogen technologies to displace fossil fuels, as well as expedite planning and approval of renewable energy projects such as offshore wind and solar power.

The Biden administration has banned Russian energy imports as part of a set of sanctions against Mr. Putin, a relatively easy step for the United States because it is a net exporter of energy. Some U.S. lawmakers would like the European Union to stop buying oil and gas from Russia altogether, but the prospect for that has been dismissed by several E.U. leaders, who see it as a financially disastrous step that would hurt Europe more than Russia.

Some energy experts said a further escalation of the war, such as a decision by Mr. Putin to use chemical, biological or nuclear weapons, could leave the European Union with little choice but to bar the purchase of Russian energy.

“We want as Europeans to diversify away from Russia, toward suppliers that we trust, that are friends and that are reliable,” Ms. von der Leyen of the European Commission said at the announcement with Mr. Biden. “Therefore the U.S. commitment to provide the European Union with an additional at least 15 billion cubic meters of L.N.G. this year is a big step in this direction, because this will replace the L.N.G. supply we currently receive from Russia.”

Still, oil and gas executives said Mr. Biden and Ms. von der Leyen would have to be patient and recognize that decisions on who sold gas to whom would be made across negotiating tables by private companies, not by politicians. Ultimately, exporters will seek to sell their gas to buyers willing to pay the highest price.

“This is a capitalist system,” Mr. Souki, the Tellurian executive, said. “It’s people like me who make those decisions. The government can’t tell us where to send the gas.”

Russia plans to ‘decapitate’ Ukraine’s government, US defence official says

The United States believes Russia’s invasion is designed to “decapitate” Ukraine’s government and one of the three main axes of assault is directed at Kyiv, a senior defence official has said.

“The indications we’ve seen thus far, in just these first, not even 12 hours, are in keeping with our assessment earlier, that would be his goal: to decapitate this government,” the official told reporters, speaking on condition of anonymity.

“What we’re seeing are initial phases of a large-scale invasion,” the official added, suggesting the other axes of the attack were a Russian advance south into the northern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv and a push north out of Russian-controlled Crimea to the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson.

“We haven’t seen a conventional move like this, nation state to nation state, since World War II, certainly nothing on this size and scope and scale … It has every potential to be very bloody, very costly and very impactful on European security writ large.”

Putin claims he had no choice but to order ‘operation’ against Ukraine

Putin has claimed he had no other option but to order what he described as a “special operation” against Ukraine, arguing all of Moscow’s previous attempts to ensure its security concerns were addressed had come to nothing.

Red Cross fears ‘massive casualty numbers’ in Ukraine

The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has warned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could unleash death and destruction on a scale that is “frightening to contemplate”.

“I fear increased suffering, with the potential of massive casualty numbers and extensive destruction of civilian objects like water and electricity plants, as well as mass displacement, trauma, family separation, and missing persons,” Peter Maurer said in a statement.

“The ICRC has seen many conflicts start and escalate in recent years, but too few of them end, and in each one it is the civilian populations that bear the consequences,” he added.

Today @ICRC stands with the people of #Ukraine. Legally, and in the name of humanity, they must be protected from the fighting.⁰

“Today each of you should keep calm. Stay at home if you can. We are working. The army is working. The whole sector of defence and security is working,” Zelenskyy said. “No panic. We are strong. We are ready for everything. We will win over everybody because we are Ukraine.”

Russian military ‘tight-lipped’ on Ukraine attack

Al Jazeera’s Dorsa Jabbari, reporting from Moscow, says the Russian military is being “very tight-lipped on what is happening on the ground with Ukraine”.

“We are hearing reports of the Russian military going in from various sides of Ukraine – from the east, from the west and now allegedly from the north in Belarus,” Jabbari said.

“It is clear now that this is not just a small military operation in the eastern region of Donbas as the president [Putin] had said,” she added.

“Many residents in Moscow yesterday were commemorating their version of Remembrance day. They said they could not possibly fathom the idea of going to war with Ukraine. [They said] Ukraine is their neighbour, is part of their family, they are brother and sisters and there is really no justification for launching a full-scale attack on Ukraine.”

Russia’s move could ‘change dynamics in Russia’, analyst says

Chris Weafer, Macro-Advisory CEO, said that Russia’s move could pose a risk for Putin’s domestic consensus.

“What Putin has done is not just risky in terms of geopolitics and in terms of western reaction, but it is also in terms of domestic politics,” Weafer said, pointing out that a growing active part of the population will not easily accept the consequences for them that will now come from Russia’s invasion.

“We are already seeing a weak ruble at the early opening this morning that will have consequences in terms of inflation and lifestyle,” he added, noting that sanctions could affect people’s ability to use bank cards, to withdraw money from ATMs and to travel.

“All of these are potential consequences and if that happens there will be a domestic public reaction. Not immediately, but it will start to change dynamics in Russia.”

Airlines should stop flying over all of Ukraine’s airspace – conflict zone monitor

Airlines should stop flying over any part of Ukraine because of the risk of an unintended shootdown or a cyberattack targeting air traffic control amid tensions with Russia, a conflict zone monitor has said.

Safe Airspace, which was set up to provide safety and conflict zone information for airlines after Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine in 2014, said it had increased its risk level to “do not fly”.

“Regardless of the actual movements of Russian forces into Ukraine, the level of tension and uncertainty in Ukraine is now extreme,” Safe Airspace said on its website. “This itself gives rise to significant risk to civil aviation.”

Now the country is in the throes of war, with a humanitarian disaster unfolding.

After months of military buildup and brinkmanship on Russia's side of the border, Ukraine's 44 million residents woke up to an all-out conflict on Thursday. Fighting has erupted in several cities across the country, including in the capital, Kyiv, and nearly a half a million people have fled to neighboring countries, according to the United Nations.

Russia had been tightening its military grip around Ukraine since last year, amassing tens of thousands of soldiers, as well as equipment and artillery, on the country's doorstep.

Black smoke rises from a military airport in Chuguyev near Kharkiv, the second-largest city in Ukraine, on Thursday.

Frenzied diplomatic efforts early this year failed to avert the worst-case scenario. Now those troops are engaged in combat with Ukrainians for control of the country.

The escalation in a years-long conflict between the nations has now triggered the greatest security crisis in Europe since the Cold War. Russia's attack on the country has also sparked an intense showdown between Western powers and Moscow.

So how did we get here? The picture on the ground is shifting rapidly, but here's a breakdown of what we know.

How did Russia invade Ukraine?

Several areas across Ukraine came under attack on Thursday morning after Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the start of a ""special military operation"" and warned of bloodshed unless Ukrainian forces lay down their arms.

The move came after months of speculation about what Moscow's intentions were with the troops it had massed on the Ukrainian border. At least 150,000 Russian troops encircled the country on three sides, like a sickle, according to estimates from US and Ukrainian intelligence officials.

In late 2021 and early 2022, fears heightened as satellite images revealed new Russian deployments of troops, tanks, artillery and other equipment cropping up in multiple locations, including near eastern Ukraine, Crimea and Belarus, where its forces were participating in joint drills with Moscow's closest international ally.

Some of those forces began pouring across the border, crossing into Ukraine from the north in Belarus and to the south from Crimea, according to the Ukrainian State Border Service. Elsewhere, explosions rang out in multiple cities, including the capital Kyiv.

Missile strikes and street fighting have raged in the days since. Military aged men have been ordered to stay in Ukraine, while countless others have fled westwards towards Poland or Romania.

Russia's larger and far better-equipped military has, faced determined resistance across the country, as ordinary Ukrainians and reservists have joined efforts to defend their families and homes, frustrating Moscow's attempts.

That resistance has been ""stiffer than expected"" and Russia has had unexpected difficulties supplying its forces, two senior US officials with direct knowledge told CNN. On the battlefield, Russia is suffering heavier losses in personnel and armor and aircraft than expected. This is due in part to the fact that Ukrainian air defenses have performed better than pre-invasion US intelligence assessments had anticipated.

But US intelligence and defense officials closely tracking the Russian campaign say that Putin still holds a number of moves in reserve that could devastate the Ukrainian resistance.

The US and its allies have said they have no intention of sending troops into Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. But Ukraine has received assistance in other forms from Europe, the US and beyond, as the West united in condemnation of Putin's move. NATO's Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg condemned the Russian attack as a ""grave breach of international law, and a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security.""

And a raft of heavy sanctions have threatened to cripple Russia's economy; Moscow has been virtually cut off from the Western financial apparatus and the value of its currency, the ruble, has tanked.

The coordinated assault came days after Putin announced that Moscow would officially recognize the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics (DNR and LNR), in eastern Ukraine's Donbas region, ordering the deployment of Russian troops there in what was widely believed to be the opening salvo to a broader military confrontation.

The territory recognized by Putin extended beyond the areas controlled by pro-Russian separatists, raising red flags about Russia's intended creep into Ukraine.

What set the stage for the conflict?

Ukraine was a cornerstone of the Soviet Union until it voted overwhelmingly for independence in a democratic referendum in 1991, a milestone that turned out to be a death knell for the failing superpower.

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO pushed eastward, bringing into the fold most of the Eastern European nations that had been in the Communist orbit. In 2004, NATO added the former Soviet Baltic republics Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Four years later, it declared its intention to offer membership to Ukraine some day in the distant future -- crossing a red line for Russia.

Putin has seen NATO's expansion as an existential threat, and the prospect of Ukraine joining the Western military alliance a ""hostile act"" -- a view he invoked in a televised speech on Thursday, saying that Ukraine's aspiration to join the military alliance was a dire threat to Russia.

In interviews and speeches, Putin has previously emphasized his view that Ukraine is part of Russia, culturally, linguistically and politically. While some of the mostly Russian-speaking population in Ukraine's east feel the same, a more nationalist, Ukrainian-speaking population in the west has historically supported greater integration with Europe.

In early 2014, mass protests in the capital Kyiv known as Euromaidan forced out a Russia-friendly president after he refused to sign an EU association agreement. Russia responded by annexing the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and fomenting a separatist rebellion in Ukraine's east, which seized control of part of the Donbas region. Despite a ceasefire agreement in 2015 , the two sides have not seen a stable peace, and the front line has barely moved since. Nearly 14,000 people have died in the conflict, and there are 1.5 million people internally displaced in Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian government.

In the eight years since, Moscow has been accused of engaging in hybrid warfare against Ukraine, using cyberattacks, economic pressure and propaganda to whip up discord. Those tactics have escalated in recent months, and in early February the State Department claimed Putin was preparing a false-flag operation to create ""a pretext for an invasion.""

What does Putin want?

In a lengthy essay penned in July 2021, Putin referred to Russians and Ukrainians as ""one people,"" and suggested the West had corrupted Ukraine and yanked it out of Russia's orbit through a ""forced change of identity.""

That type of historical revisionism was on full display in Putin's emotional and grievance-packed address to the nation last Monday announcing his decision to recognize the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, while casting doubt on Ukraine's own sovereignty.

But Ukrainians, who in the last three decades have sought to align more closely with Western institutions like the European Union and NATO, have pushed back against the notion that they are little more than the West's ""puppet.""

In fact, Putin's efforts to bring Ukraine back into Russia's sphere have been met with a backlash, with several recent polls showing that a majority of Ukrainians now favor membership of the US-led transatlantic military alliance.

In December, Putin presented the US and NATO with a list of security demands. Chief among them was a guarantee that Ukraine will never enter NATO and that the alliance rolls back its military footprint in Eastern and Central Europe -- proposals that the US and its allies have repeatedly said are non-starters.

Putin indicated he was not interested in lengthy negotiations on the topic. ""It is you who must give us guarantees, and you must do it immediately, right now,"" he said at his annual news conference late last year. ""Are we deploying missiles near the US border? No, we are not. It is the United States that has come to our home with its missiles and is already standing at our doorstep.""

High-level talks between the West and Russia wrapped in January without any breakthroughs. The standoff left Europe's leaders to engage in a frenzy of shuttle diplomacy, exploring whether a negotiating channel established between France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine to resolve the conflict in Ukraine's east -- known as the Normandy Format talks -- could provide an avenue for calming the current crisis.

In a news conference with the new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on February 16, Putin repeated unsubstantiated claims that Ukraine is carrying out a ""genocide"" against Russian speakers in the Donbas region and called for the conflict to be resolved through the Minsk peace progress -- echoing similar rhetoric that was used as a pretext for annexing Crimea.

But less than a week later, after Russia's upper house of parliament approved the deployment of military forces outside the country on February 22, Putin told reporters that the Minsk agreements ""no longer exist,"" adding: ""What is there to implement if we have recognized these two entities?""

The agreements, known as Minsk 1 and Minsk 2 -- which were hammered out in the Belarusian capital in a bid to end a bloody in eastern Ukraine -- have never been fully implemented, with key issues remaining unresolved.

Moscow and Kyiv have long been at odds over key elements of the peace deal, the second of which was inked in 2015 and lays out a plan for reintegrating the two breakaway republics into Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently stated that he did not like a single point of the Minsk accords , which require dialogue on local elections in the Russian-backed separatist regions and -- although unclear in what sequence -- would also restore the Ukrainian government's control over its eastern borders. Critics say the agreement could give Moscow undue sway over Ukrainian politics.

Putin previously responded in blunt terms by saying that regardless of whether Zelensky likes the plan, it must be implemented. ""Like it or don't like it, it's your duty, my beauty,"" Putin said in a news conference alongside French President Emmanuel Macron. Zelensky, a former comedian and TV star, won a 2019 election in a landslide on promises to end the war in Donbas, but little has changed. Responding to a question about Putin's stark, undiplomatic language, Zelensky responded in Russian, saying bluntly: ""We are not his.""

How has Ukraine responded?

President Zelensky previously downplayed the danger of all-out war with Russia, noting that the threat has existed for years and that Ukraine is prepared for military aggression. But on Thursday, as Russia launched an assault on his country, Zelensky made an emotional address directly to the Ukrainian people, declaring martial law in the country.

""Russia began an attack on Ukraine today. Putin began war against Ukraine, against the entire democratic world. He wants to destroy my country, our country, everything we've been building, everything we are living for,"" Zelensky said in a video message posted on his official Facebook page.

Across the country, residents have been preparing for the worst -- packing emergency evacuation kits and taking time out of their weekends to train as reservists

Ukraine's government insists that Moscow cannot prevent Kyiv from building closer ties with NATO, or otherwise interfere in its domestic or foreign politics. ""Russia cannot stop Ukraine from getting closer with NATO and has no right to have any say in relevant discussions,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement to CNN.

Zelensky has since requested Ukraine be admitted ""urgently"" to the European Union, and has implored Western leaders to help boost Ukrainian forces on the ground.

Delegates from Ukraine and Russia held talks on Monday near the border of Belarus, a country which has assisted Putin's invasion, and which Ukrainian officials fear could soon put its own boots on the ground in support of Russia.

Ukraine demanded a full Russian withdrawal in advance of those talks, but it is unclear whether the meetings will result in a Russian retreat. Zelensky downplayed the significance of the talks, which he did not attend in person. ""I do not really believe in the result of this meeting, but let them try, so that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance,"" he said Sunday,

Tensions between the two countries had been exacerbated by a deepening Ukrainian energy crisis that Kyiv believes Moscow has purposefully provoked. Ukraine views the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline -- connecting Russian gas supplies directly to Germany -- as a threat to its own security.

Nord Stream 2 is one of two pipelines that Russia has laid underwater in the Baltic Sea -- in addition to its traditional land-based pipeline network that runs through eastern Europe, including Ukraine. Kyiv views the pipelines across Ukraine as an element of protection against invasion by Russia, since any military action could potentially disrupt the vital flow of gas to Europe.

After requests from Zelensky and the US administration, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Tuesday that he would halt the certification of the pipeline following Putin's decision to order troops into parts of eastern Ukraine.

Nord Stream 2 was just one of myriad challenges facing Zelensky's government; the former actor, who played a president on Ukrainian television, had experienced a brutal baptism of fire into real-world politics since assuming office in 2019, thanks in part to the pandemic and ongoing tensions with Russia.

But in the days since the invasion, admiration for him has soared both inside and outside Ukraine; Zelensky refused to leave the country and has instead posted frequent videos from the streets of Kyiv, where he has been encouraging his fellow countrymen to resist Russian forces.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/24/europe/ukraine-russia-conflict-explainer-2-cmd-intl/index.html

Ukrainian officials say Russian troops have landed in Odessa while others are crossing the border into Kharkiv.

The Ukrainian interior ministry made the announcement on Telegram, adding that rocket attacks are targeting Ukrainian fighter jets at an airport outside Kyiv.

Ukraine’s state emergency service says attacks have been launched against 10 Ukrainian regions, primarily in the east and south of the country.

At least seven “powerful” airstrikes on Vasilkovsky airport outside Kyiv, where Ukraine’s military fighter bombers are kept, Kyiv command says



Guardian senior reporter Peter Beaumont tells us if the reports coming in from around Ukraine are accurate, this is far from a being a limited operation by Russia.

Instead it looks like military operations of different kinds are being launched in a broad crescent from Odessa in the south-west along the coast eastwards towards Mariupol, through to Kharkiv further north and finally Kyiv at the top of the crescent.

While a lot of reported attacks so far appear to have involved missile strikes, there are unconfirmed reports now via Ifax and elsewhere of troops landing in the south and crossing the border near Kharkiv too.

Why would Russia want to take Chernobyl? Few places conjure more foreboding than Chernobyl, the site of the deadly 1986 nuclear disaster. So alarm bells rang in the West when Russian forces seized the decommissioned power plant in the early hours of their invasion of Ukraine on Thursday. Why would Russia make a radioactive wasteland one of its very first targets in Ukraine? While the full answer may be known only to top officials in Moscow, the site happens to lie along one of the most direct paths to Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital. “The location is important because of where it sits,” retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, former commanding general of U.S. Army Europe, said in an interview. ""If Russian forces were attacking Kyiv from the north, Chernobyl is right there on the way, almost in the way."" Chernobyl is less than 10 miles from Ukraine's border with Belarus, a Russian ally where Moscow has been massing troops in preparation for its attack on Ukraine. From there, it's a relatively straight shot of about 80 miles south to Kyiv. Read the full story here. Share this -







Russia sanctions are a ‘big deal,’ experts say. But effects could take years. The flurry of sanctions the U.S. announced this week against Russia are some of the hardest-hitting that Moscow has ever faced, but the slow pain they inflict may not be enough to deter Putin from escalating his invasion of Ukraine, experts said. Biden and several U.S. allies, including the European Union, the United Kingdom and Japan, have vowed to review further restrictions on Moscow as punishment for the invasion. The sanctions that have already been announced are significant in size and scope, said former Treasury and State Department officials who handled U.S. sanctions in the past, but the longtime U.S. reliance on the national security tool has left the U.S. with few other options if Putin and Russia do not respond. Nevertheless, the Russian economy is already feeling the effects of war, and the sanctions could over time further cause the Russian stock market to falter, deflate the value of the ruble — which hit an all-time low Thursday — and make doing business in Russia increasingly difficult. “We’re counting a lot on sanctions, and the ones the Biden administration have put together are really pretty tough,” said Daniel Fried, a longtime diplomat and former ambassador to Poland who helped lead the West’s 2014 response to Moscow’s aggression against Ukraine as the State Department coordinator for sanctions policy. He called the recent sanctions ""a big deal."" Read the full story here. Share this -







Russia says it will support banks under sanctions Russia said its central bank will support banks affected by the sanctions the U.S. and other countries imposed this week. Leaders in Europe, Canada and the U.S. announced Thursday that they are committed to issuing severe economic sanctions following Putin's decision to attack Ukraine. Biden took aim at Putin by mounting pressure through Russia's economy, including the two largest majority state-owned institutions, Sberbank and VTB. Russia issued a statement through its central bank assuring that the state has a plan to remain functioning regardless of the sanctions. ""All operations of banks in rubles will be carried out, and the corresponding services will be provided to all customers as usual,"" the statement said. ""All customer funds in foreign currencies are also held and can be withdrawn in the account currency. The Bank of Russia is ready to support banks with funds in rubles and foreign currency."" A majority of the bank's balance at each bank is measured in rubles, the statement insists, and ""maintain a high margin of stability."" Share this -







Some Russians share black squares on social media to indicate anti-war stance Some well-known Russians have posted black squares on social media to publicly indicate their opposition to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Black squares were shared to show solidarity with the protests in the U.S. after the death of George Floyd nearly two years ago. And Thursday, many Russians appeared to use the same tactic to show their support for the country's anti-war movement. Television host and comedian Ivan Urgant posted “Fear and pain. NO to war"" on Instagram, alongside a black square, for his 9.9 million followers. Maxim Galkin, a Russian singer and comedian, posted the same black square for his 9.4 million Instagram followers, writing: ""There can be no justification for war! No War!"" Two-time Olympic figure skating silver medalist Evgenia Medvedevа wrote over a black background on her Instagram story, ""I hope this all ends as soon as possible, like a bad dream,"" placing a white dove emoji below the text for her 1.3 million followers. Former television host Xenia Sobchak, whose father was a mentor to Putin, posted the black square to Instagram for her millions of followers. ""We are all now locked in this situation. No exit. We, the Russians, will be dealing with the consequences of today for many years to come,"" she wrote. Share this -

Conductor Valery Gergiev, a Putin supporter, replaced ahead of Carnegie Hall performance Russian conductor Valery Gergiev, a known friend and supporter of Putin’s, will no longer lead a series of concerts this weekend at Carnegie Hall. Carnegie Hall and the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra announced Thursday that the Canadian conductor Yannick Nézet-Séguin will step in for Gergiev, leading the orchestra in three concerts at Carnegie Hall from Friday through Sunday. No reason was cited for Gergiev’s removal from the program; his relationship with Putin reflects the global denunciation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Daniel Froschauer, the orchestra’s chairman, called Gergiev a gifted artist and said he would take the podium for the Carnegie dates. “He’s going as a performer, not a politician,” Froschauer said. Carnegie Hall and the orchestra also said the Russian pianist Denis Matsuev, who had been scheduled to perform with Gergiev and the orchestra Friday, would not appear. Share this -







Russian forces have moved closer to Kyiv, fired more than 160 missiles, says U.S. defense official Russia has launched more than 160 missiles since it began striking Ukraine, a senior U.S. defense official said. Russian troops, meanwhile, have moved closer to Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, the official said Thursday, adding that the country has also sent additional airborne troops to Kharkiv, where fighting is ongoing. As part of its response to Russia's aggression and in support of its NATO allies, the U.S will deploy 7,000 more troops to Germany from Fort Carson, Colorado, the Defense Department said.

U.S. sanctions also target Belarus for supporting Russia The new round of sanctions against Russia that Biden unveiled Thursday also targets another country: Belarus. The measures take aim at Belarusian state-owned banks and the country's defense and security industries, as well as a number of its ""regime-connected officials and elites,"" for their support of Russia's invasion, according to the Treasury Department. The White House said in a statement, ""We call on Belarus to withdraw its support for Russian aggression in Ukraine."" Biden announced the latest round of sanctions just hours after the United Kingdom slapped similar sanctions on Belarus, as well as Russia. Other U.S. allies are expected to follow suit. Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus and a close ally of Putin's, said Thursday that troops from his country could be used in further Russian military operations in Ukraine if necessary, local media reported.

U.S. expels No. 2 ranking Russian diplomat The second-highest ranking Russian diplomat is being expelled from the U.S. in retaliation for a similar move made by Russia earlier this month, a senior State Department official told NBC News Thursday. Sergey Trepelkov is the second-highest ranking diplomat at the Russian Embassy in Washington, D.C., under Ambassador Antoly Antonov. The move is not a response to the Ukraine invasion, the State Department official said, but is instead a counter to Russia ousting U.S. Deputy Chief of Mission Bart Gorman earlier this month. Gorman had not completed his three-year diplomatic tour before being told to leave Russia. “We believe it is critical that our countries have the necessary diplomatic personnel in place to facilitate communication between our governments,” the official said. “However, we will not let actions like this go without a response and today, we have announced our response.” Share this -

Putin using false 'Nazi' narrative in attack on Ukraine, experts say Putin peddled accusations of Nazi elements within Ukraine on Thursday to justify the Russian attack, a move that experts slammed as slanderous and false. In announcing he had launched Russian forces against key Ukrainian military and logistics posts, Putin said he's striving for ""the demilitarization and denazification"" of the sovereign democracy in Kyiv. David Harris, the CEO of the American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group, said he's confident that Putin's Nazi narrative ""won't work."" ""First, Ukraine is led by a Jewish president, who was overwhelmingly chosen by voters in a democratic election. It reflects today's Ukrainian mindset and outlook, a far cry from the past,"" Harris said. ""And second, the ones behaving like Nazis are, let's be clear, Putin and his regime. Brazenly invading another country, invoking fake grievances, lying incessantly and denying another nation's right to chart its own destiny are all, yes, taken from the Nazi playbook.""

European leaders not interested in pulling Russia out of SWIFT, Biden says Pulling Russia out of the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or SWIFT, is not an option European leaders are currently pursuing, Biden told reporters on Thursday. ""The sanctions that were proposed on all their banks have equal consequence — maybe more consequences — than SWIFT number one,"" Biden said. ""Number two, it is always an option. But right now, that's not the position that the rest of Europe wishes to take."" SWIFT is a secure messaging system that links more than 11,000 financial institutions in over 200 countries and territories. Removing Russia from the coalition would prevent the country from making most international transactions but could also hurt other economies. Share this -

On TikTok, livestreams show protests — and attract scams Livestreams on TikTok are bringing a first-person view of the conflict from all over Europe — but some of the streams purporting to come from Ukraine appeared to be fake. Some of the livestreams appear to be authentic, showing crowds gathered in major cities to protest Russian aggression. But other TikTok users are pretending to be in Ukraine, using doctored or dubbed footage of other places in an attempt to solicit followers and monetary donations. One account, which called for donations through TikTok, featured a livestream of a line of houses in a residential area as the sounds of gunshots, sirens and people screaming for help could be heard in the background. But that account hours earlier had posted a different angle of the same street in which cars with U.K. license plates were visible. Other videos posted to TikTok appear to be recycling old video and passing it off as coming from Ukraine. In one video viewed almost 20 million times on TikTok and posted about two hours after the first reports of shellings in Ukraine, a soldier is seen parachuting out of an airplane. “Bro is recording an invasion,” the top comment reads. The video is from a training exercise, first posted to an Instagram account by a user with the same username on April 6, 2016. The user on TikTok was seen later on Tuesday livestreaming on his couch.

U.S. defense official: Russians fired more than 100 missiles in opening phase of invasion A senior defense official, as part of operational update in the situation in Ukraine, told NBC News that the initial phase of Russia's invasion of Ukraine began around 9:30 p.m. ET, with sea- and land-based missile launches. More than 100 Russian missiles – including short range ballistic missiles, medium range ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, surface to air missiles and sea missiles launched from the Black Sea – were fired in the initial salvo, the official said. Targets have so far been military and air defenses, barracks, ammunition depots, and 10 airfields, the official said, adding that there is no clear understanding of the level of casualties on either side.

The full scope of electronic warfare (jamming) and cyberattacks have not come into play yet but still could be used. Russia will also use cruise missile strikes to target government buildings, including in civilian population centers, the official said, citing the U.S. assessment of Russia’s next moves. The official said that several U.S. F-35 fighter jets are arriving to the region later Thursday: two to Estonia, two to Lithuania and two to Romania. In addition, 32 Apache helicopters were en route to the region Thursday, but weather may delay the arrival of some. The official said that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Gen.

Ukraine invasion jeopardizes U.S.-Russia space cooperation Russia's invasion of Ukraine is already causing tension in the space community, one of the few global arenas in which the U.S. and Russia still cooperate. In a statement posted Wednesday on Twitter, Dmitry Rogozin, the director general of Russia’s space agency, hinted at tensions but said he values cooperation with NASA. “We greatly value our professional relationship with NASA, but as a Russian and a citizen of Russia I am very unhappy with the openly hostile policy of the U.S. towards my country,” Rogozin said, according to a translation. Rogozin also tweeted “Glory to Russia!” on Monday, after Russian President Vladimir Putin gave a televised speech with misleading claims that Ukraine is “historically Russian land” and false claims the country has fallen into the hands of neo-Nazis and corrupt “puppets” controlled by the West. NASA said in a statement that the agency is carrying out spaceflight operations as normal: “NASA continues working with Roscosmos and our other international partners in Canada, Europe, and Japan to maintain safe and continuous International Space Station operations.” Share this -

Russian disinformation, propaganda ramp up as conflict in Ukraine grows Russia’s effort to spread disinformation and propaganda across the internet and through foreign and domestic media about its invasion of Ukraine started weeks ago — and it’s expected to ramp up now that the conflict has begun. Disinformation experts say that they have seen a concerted effort from Russian leaders and state-backed media to push a false narrative around the reasons for invading Ukraine, and that they expect that to continue as both international pressure and even some domestic Russian resistance to war grows. “We’re going to see a huge onslaught,” said Jane Lytvynenko, senior research fellow at Harvard University’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy. “And we need to be prepared for that.” Lytvynenko said people should be prepared for a wide variety of disinformation and propaganda, including the use of authentic images and video to push false narratives.

Zelenskyy praised the work of Ukrainian forces at the Russian border while calling the fight in the southern part of the nation ""complicated"" in remarks posted on Telegram.

""The sounds that we hear today are not only missile strikes, explosions and rockets — it’s the sound of the Iron Curtain falling down and closing Russia from the other civilized world,"" Zelenskyy said. He renewed calls for Ukrainian citizens to aid territorial defense forces, asking anyone with military experience to offer themselves in the effort.

U.S. defense official: Russians 'making a move' on Kyiv The Russian invasion of Ukraine has so far focused on three main axes of assault – all of which have been assessed to have the intention of taking key population centers – and Putin's forces are ""making a move on Kyiv,"" a senior defense official told NBC News. The first axis is a south-to-north approach from Crimea to Kherson; the second axis is a north-central to south approach from Belarus to Kyiv; and the third axis is a northeast to south approach occurring around Kharkiv, where the heaviest fighting is currently occurring, the official said. The official disclosed the information as part of an operational update on the situation in Ukraine. Russia is “making a move on Kyiv,” the official said, adding that the the U.S. assessment of Putin’s actions indicate that Russia has “every intention of basically decapitating the government and installing their own method of governance.” “We have not been surprised so far with what we have seen them do,” the official said. “It is very much in line with what was expected.” Russia’s actions so far indicate that its invasion is still only in its initial phase, the official said. Russia’s military operation will include multiple phases, but the U.S. does not currently know how many phases the invasion will include – or how long the phases will take. Share this -







SWIFT banking system could be used as sanction against Russia. What is it? In recent weeks, President Joe Biden has threatened Russian President Vladimir Putin with ""severe economic consequences"" and sanctions like ""he's never seen"" if Russia invades Ukraine. Now, with Putin taking military action against Ukraine, Biden and U.S. allies may consider imposing one of the harshest financial penalties against Russia: kicking it out of the SWIFT banking system. But doing so, which some financial analysts have likened to a ""nuclear option,"" would be an unprecedented move against one of the world's largest economies. The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or SWIFT, is a cooperative of financial institutions formed in 1973 and headquartered in Belgium. It is overseen by the National Bank of Belgium with cooperation from other major central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve System, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank.

Twitter publishes security advice in Ukrainian, Russian Twitter on Thursday published updated advice in Ukrainian, Russian and English on how people can secure their accounts while in conflict zones. In a series of tweets from @TwitterSafety, the San Francisco-based tech company said it was important for users to be aware of settings such as how to set a strong password, how to keep location information private and how to delete an account if a user wants to for safety reasons. The tweets did not say whether the company was aware of specific accounts being compromised in connection to with the Russia-Ukraine crisis, but the social media network has been a battleground for views and information about the conflict.

Journalists in other cities also reported hearing explosions. Putin said he was taking action to “demilitarize” Ukraine because the West had pushed too far in trying to draw the country into the NATO alliance and had threatened Russian-speakers in eastern Ukraine. “I urge you to immediately lay down your weapons and go home,” Putin said, speaking to Ukrainian soldiers during a special televised address.

Sen. Mitt Romney slams Russia, past U.S. foreign policy Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, slammed Russia and past U.S. foreign policy under both Democratic and Republican presidents in a statement late Wednesday night. ""Putin's Ukraine invasion is the first time in 80 years that a great power has moved to conquer a sovereign nation. It is without justification, without provocation and without honor,"" he said.

Putin says he is fighting a resurgence of Nazism. That's not true. Putin's rationalization for invading Ukraine includes a claim that he is fighting neo-Nazism. ""It is not surprising that Ukrainian society was faced with the rise of far-right nationalism, which rapidly developed into aggressive Russophobia and neo-Nazism,"" Putin said Monday, suggesting that NATO countries are backing neo-Nazis. While it's true that the Ukrainian National Guard is home to the Azov Battalion — a force populated by neo-Nazis — there is no evidence to suggest widespread support for such extreme-right nationalism in the government, military or electorate. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is Jewish; three of his family members were killed in the Holocaust. In the most recent Ukrainian parliamentary elections in 2019, a coalition of ultranationalist right-wing parties failed to win even a single seat in the Rada, the country's 450-member legislature. And for several years, U.S. appropriations laws have included a provision banning spending in support of the Azov Battalion. But in accusing Ukraine of pro-Nazi sentiment, Putin is playing to generations-old scars from World War II, when his country was allied with the U.S., Britain and other countries in defeating the Axis powers. According to the World War II museum in New Orleans, an estimated 24 million Russians died in that war. Share this -

He has absolutely no right to invade Ukraine’s sovereign borders and impose Russia’s will on the freedom-loving people of Ukraine,"" Cramer said in a statement. “We needed sanctions months ago to ward off exactly this type of action. Now that Putin has taken these steps we must implement strong, primary and secondary sanctions immediately,” he added. “Our response here is greater than Russia and Ukraine; what we choose to do will also send a message to China on Taiwan.” Share this -

'Not thinking about the stock market': Why sanctions are unlikely to stop Putin After months of threats, the United States and its allies moved swiftly to sanction Russia after President Vladimir Putin ordered troops into eastern Ukraine, a move President Joe Biden said amounted to “the beginning of a Russian invasion.” The question now is whether those measures will do anything to damage — or deter — the Russian leader, who has taken Europe to the brink of a devastating new conflict. The first salvo of Western sanctions targeted large Russian banks, oligarchs with close ties to the Kremlin, a key gas pipeline and a host of other individuals. The European Union is set to unveil its own, with reports suggesting they may go even further. But while leaders in Washington, Europe and Asia were able to present a united front against Moscow's aggression, officials and analysts say it's unlikely the sanctions will do anything to deter Putin from pursuing a large-scale invasion of Ukraine.

6,21d00bcc-5da9-40d5-bd00-f9859b202a4c,['Voa News'],,"Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday recognized the Russian-speaking regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine as independent states, signing documents declaring them no longer part of Ukraine. Hours earlier, the separatist leaders of the regions made a video appeal for the independence declaration.

Location

The Donetsk and Luhansk regions — collectively known as the Donbas — are in eastern Ukraine, near the border with Russia. The region comprises both Kyiv-controlled parts as well as separatist-controlled areas. Its main industries are coal mining and steel production.

Population

Most of the 3.6 million people living in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions speak Russian, a result of a migration of Russian workers to the regions after World War II, during the Soviet era. Moscow has in recent years issued more than 720,000 Russian passports to roughly one-fifth of the region's population, according to The Associated Press.

Rebel control

Pro-Russian separatists in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions took over government buildings in 2014 and proclaimed the regions as independent ""people's republics."" The move followed Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.

Fighting

Since 2014, more than 14,000 people have been killed in fighting in the Donbas region between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian forces. Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of backing the separatists both militarily and financially, a charge Moscow denies.

Amid the fighting, a Malaysian airliner was shot down over eastern Ukraine in 2014, killing all 298 people on board. International investigators concluded the missile was supplied by Russia and fired from an area controlled by pro-Russian separatists. Russia has denied involvement.

Independence

After separatists in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions took power in 2014, they held a vote to declare independence. Until now, no country recognized their bid. On Monday, Putin announced the independence of the regions after meeting with the Russian Security Council. His announcement followed a video appeal by the regions' separatist leaders for the recognition of independence.

Regional leaders

Each of the regions has its own self-proclaimed president. In a vote disputed by Kyiv, Denis Pushilin was elected in 2018 to lead the so-called Donetsk People's Republic, while Leonid Pasechnik is the leader of the Luhansk separatist region.

Minsk peace process

Russia's recognition of the regions effectively ends the Minsk peace agreements, which were never fully implemented. The agreements, signed in 2014 and 2015, had called for a large amount of autonomy for the two regions inside Ukraine.

Other breakaway regions

Russia has previously recognized the independence of two Georgian breakaway regions — Abkhazia and South Ossetia — after a brief war with Georgia in 2008. Russia has since stationed troops in those regions and offered Russian citizenship to their populations.

7,21d00bcc-5da9-40d5-bd00-f9859b202a4c,"[""Rfe Rl'S Russian Service""]",,"KYIV -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has threatened to break off talks with Moscow should Russian forces wipe out the remaining Ukrainian soldiers trapped in Mariupol as Moscow claimed it had taken control of the besieged and battered port city after a weeks-long battle.

The Russian Defense Ministry on April 16 said it had cleared the Mariupol urban area of Ukrainian troops and had trapped a few remaining fighters in the Azovstal steel plant, according to Russian state-run media.

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the major developments on Russia's invasion, how Kyiv is fighting back, the plight of civilians, and Western reaction. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.

A Russian Defense Ministry spokesman was quoted by Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency as saying that Ukrainian forces have lost a total of 4,000 troops during the long fight for the city -- a battle that has caught the world’s attention for its brutality.

Casualty figures from both sides have proved impossible to independently confirm during the conflict, which began with Russia's unprovoked invasion on February 24.

Ukraine has not commented on the latest Russian claims but in recent days has indicated the situation in Mariupol was desperate, with deaths mounting among the trapped civilian population and many experts predicting the city would soon fall to the Russians.

In an interview published earlier on April 16 with Ukrayinska Pravda, Zelenskiy warned Russia against committing atrocities against Ukrainian soldiers in the city.

""The elimination of our troops, of our men [in Mariupol] will put an end to any negotiations,” he said.

""That will bring an impasse as we don't negotiate on either our territories or our people,"" he added.

Peace talks have taken place between the two sides since Russia's invasion began, with little or no progress.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Reports early on April 16 said heavy fighting continued in several parts of Mariupol as Ukrainian troops attempted to fend off Russian soldiers who have been bolstered by reinforcements in recent days.

""The situation is very difficult [in Mariupol],"" Zelenskiy said early in the day. ""Our soldiers are blocked, the wounded are blocked. There is a humanitarian crisis.... Nevertheless, the guys are defending themselves.""

As the battle for the ruins of Mariupol appeared to be near its bloody end, air-raid sirens could be heard in many other parts of Ukraine on April 16, including in Kyiv, after Russia said it would seek revenge on the capital for what it claimed, without evidence, was Ukrainian targeting of Russian border towns.

Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko said at least one person was killed and several others wounded in early morning attacks.

""For those Kyivites who left and are already thinking of heading back to return to the capital, I ask you to refrain from this and stay in safer places,"" Klitschko said in a message on his Telegram channel.

Russian troops have faced tougher-than-expected resistance -- both from the Ukrainian military and from ordinary citizens -- forcing them to retreat from areas in the north and to focus on eastern and southern regions of Ukraine, including Mariupol.

In his nightly address to the nation, Zelenskiy said the success of Ukraine's military and that of international sanctions against Russia will determine how long the war will last.

""The success of our military on the battlefield has been really significant. Historically significant. But it's still not enough to clear our land from the invading forces,"" he said.

""The sanctions against Russia are very serious, economically painful. But it is not enough to starve Russia's military machine. We need to promote stronger, more destructive sanctions. This will determine how long this war will last,"" he added.

Russia's warning to inflict more damage on Ukraine came a day after it suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, the Moskva, which sank while being towed to port on April 14 after suffering heavy damage under circumstances that remain in dispute.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on the Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

The National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) has rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Kyiv did claim, however, to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Meanwhile, the United States and its Western allies continued to pile pressure on Moscow over its campaign.

The German government said on April 15 that it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.



The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Russia's Foreign Ministry on April 16 said it was banning British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Foreign Minister Liz Truss, and several other cabinet ministers over British measures aimed at isolating Moscow and crippling the country's economy.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

The UN refugee agency said as of April 16 that 4,836,445 million Ukrainians had left the country since the Russian invasion -- up by 40,200 from the previous day’s total.
