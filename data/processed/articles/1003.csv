On the same day, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis announced on Twitter that Lithuania‚Äôs Ambassador to Ukraine would head back to Kyiv.

‚ÄúLithuania stands in full solidarity with Ukraine and the Ukrainian people, who are victims of Russia‚Äôs unprecedented aggression. We are therefore lowering the level of Russia‚Äôs diplomatic representation,‚Äù Landsbergis said.

In response to the Russian aggression against Ukraine, the government also closed down the Consulate General of Russia in Klaipƒóda. The foreign ministry of Lithuania summoned representatives of Russia‚Äôs embassy in Vilnius and informed them of the decision.

Lithuania strongly condemned the atrocities committed by Russian forces in several previously occupied Ukrainian towns, including the massacre in Bucha.

‚ÄúUnfortunately, what the world saw in Bucha can be only the beginning. We will be able to discover even more evidence of cruel war crimes in other towns upon their liberation. The war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by the Russian armed forces in Ukraine will not be forgotten,‚Äù Landsbergis said.

Lithuania supports all measures to ensure the accountability of the Russian armed forces for violations of human rights and the international humanitarian law in Ukraine, the government added.

Lithuania‚Äôs Ambassador in Moscow will also return to Lithuania ‚Äúin the near future‚Äù.

Commenting on the decision made on Monday, Linas Kojala, director of the Eastern Europe Studies Centre, tweeted: ‚ÄúFormally, it is a downgrade of diplomatic ties, though it is difficult to see how they could be maintained‚Äù.
