Summary Companies Targets banks, Putin's circle, wealthy Russians

Could knock percentage points off Russia's economy

LONDON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveiled Britain's largest-ever package of sanctions against Russia on Thursday, targeting banks, members of President Vladimir Putin's closest circle and wealthy Russians who enjoy high-rolling London lifestyles.

Western nations are coordinating action to impose tough sanctions against Russia in response to its all-out invasion on neighbouring Ukraine by staging missile strikes on cities and pouring its troops into the country. read more

Speaking to Parliament just hours after Putin declared war with Ukraine, Johnson said the Russian leader would be condemned by the world and by history for his invasion, never able to cleanse the ""blood of Ukraine from his hands"".

""This hideous and barbarous venture of Vladimir Putin must end in failure,"" he told parliament when announcing the new sanctions, announcing a which saw sanctions being imposed on more than 100 Russian individuals and entities. read more

""For our part today the UK is announcing the largest and most severe package of economic sanctions that Russia has ever seen.""

After the West was criticised for earlier, weaker sanctions this week in response to Russia recognising two breakaway republics in Ukraine, Johnson said leaders had agreed to work together to ""maximise the economic price"" Putin will pay.

A government official said the coordinated sanctions would knock percentage points off the Russian economy in the next 12 to 18 months.

END OF LONDONGRAD?

In the 10-point sanctions package, the British government said it would impose an asset freeze on some major Russian banks, including state-owned VTB, its second-biggest bank, and stop major Russian companies from raising finance in Britain.

""Sanctions have been a reality for us over the past few years, and another round of politically motivated anti-Russian sanctions came as no surprise,"" VTB said in a statement.

""We have had time to learn the lessons and prepare for the most severe scenario, we have worked through several plans to counter the sanctions in ways which minimise the negative consequences for our clients.""

Since the fall of the Soviet Union three decades ago, London's capital markets have been the favoured destination for Russian companies seeking to raise money outside Moscow.

Among the people targeted by the second wave of sanctions included Kirill Shamalov, Putin's once son-in-law.

Pyotr Fradkov, chairman of Promsvyazbank, was also under sanctions. The finance ministry has accused Fradkov of working to transform the bank into one that serves the defence industry.

Britain will also ban Russia's flagship airline Aeroflot from landing in Britain, suspend dual export licences to Russia and ban exports of some high tech exports and parts of the extractive industry.

Johnson also went further than some other Western countries, calling for Russia to be excluded from SWIFT, the inter-bank messaging network which is the backbone of international finance - a demand made by Ukraine.

At home, officials said the sanctions were aimed at preventing wealthy Russians from using London, often dubbed 'Londongrad' or Moscow-on-Thames, as their playground, reducing their ability to store large amounts of cash in Britain's banks.

""These are people who have international lifestyles,"" a diplomatic source said. ""They come to Harrods to shop, they stay in our best hotels when they like, they send their children to our best (fee-paying) schools, and that is what's being stopped.""

LONDON/NEW YORK, Feb 25 (Reuters) - The United States, Britain and European Union leaders are targeting Russian banks as part of a new package of sanctions following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.

Here is a rundown of how sanctions which have already been announced impact banks and investors:

WHAT HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED SO FAR?

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

The U.S. Treasury Department said it was targeting the ""core infrastructure"" of Russia's financial system, sanctioning two of its largest banks - state-backed Sberbank (SBER.MM) and VTB (VTBR.MM). Also on the sanctions list are Otkritie, Sovcombank and Novikombank and some senior executives at state-owned banks.

U.S. banks must sever their correspondent banking ties - which allow banks to make payments between one another and move money around the globe - with Russia's largest lender, Sberbank, within 30 days.

Officials in Washington also wielded the government's most powerful sanctioning tool, adding VTB, Otkritie, Novikombank and Sovcombank to the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list. The move effectively kicks the banks out of the U.S. financial system, bans their trade with Americans, and freezes their U.S. assets. read more

The U.S. sanctions also target two Belarusian state-owned banks - Belinvestbank and Bank Dabrabyt - over the country's support for Moscow's attack.

The U.S. sanctions came soon after the British government said it would impose an asset freeze on all major Russian banks, including VTB, and stop major Russian companies from raising finance in Britain.

Russian banks would be cut off from sterling markets and clearing payments, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said.

Britain also announced asset freezes and travel bans on members of Russia's political and financial elite, including those who have long enjoyed high-rolling London lifestyles.

More than 100 individuals, entities and subsidiaries will ultimately be sanctioned.

Britain had earlier imposed sanctions on just three billionaires with close links to Russian President Vladimir Putin and five relatively small lenders. read more

EU leaders have agreed sanctions on Moscow that target 70% of the Russian banking market, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Friday.

The bloc imposed a ban on issuing bonds, shares or loans in the EU for refinancing Alfa Bank and Bank Otkritie, after freezing assets at Rossiya Bank, Promsvyazbank and VEB earlier in the week.

The top three Russian banks Sberbank, VTB and Gazprombank, however, do not face an EU asset freeze.

The bloc also set a cap of 100,000 euros ($112,700.00) for EU bank accounts of Russian citizens, who will not be allowed to buy euro denominated shares.

Refinancing in the EU of Russian state-owned enterprises is also forbidden, with the exception of some utilities. Securities settlement houses in the EU will not be allowed to serve Russian counterparties.

Unlike the United States and Britain, the EU has decided not to stop correspondent banks from dealing with top Russia lenders.

European leaders earlier in the week had agreed to sanction 27 individuals and entities, including banks financing Russian decision-makers and operations in the breakaway territories in Ukraine, but not the biggest lenders.

Washington had imposed sanctions on Promsvyazbank and VEB.

The United States had also ramped up prohibitions on Russian sovereign debt, which U.S. President Joe Biden said would cut the Russian government off from Western financing. read more

Swiss financial watchdog FINMA told banks on Friday to freeze assets of people and entities on the EU's sanctions list. read more

WHAT NEXT?

Russia's large banks are deeply integrated into the global financial system, meaning any sanctions on the biggest institutions could be felt far beyond its borders.

The U.S. Treasury said Thursday's sanctions would disrupt billions of dollars worth of daily foreign exchange transactions conducted by Russian financial institutions. Overall, these institutions conduct about $46 billion worth of forex transactions, 80% of which are in dollars. ""The vast majority of those transactions will now be disrupted,"" it said.

The sanctions target nearly 80% of all banking assets in Russia.

Sberbank said that it was prepared for any developments. read more

VTB said it had prepared for the most severe scenario.

""We have worked through several plans to counter the sanctions in ways which minimize the negative consequences for our clients,"" it said in a statement.

Sovcombank, Otkritie and Novikombank did not reply to requests for comment. The Russian embassy in the United States also did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

The new sanctions EU leaders are preparing to announce are likely to include freezing Russia's assets and halting access to financial markets by its banks.

WHAT WOULD HIT HARDEST?

What banks and Western creditors fear most is that Russia is banned from the global payment system, SWIFT, which is used by more than 11,000 financial institutions in over 200 countries. read more

Such a move would hit Russian banks hard but the consequences are complex. Banning SWIFT would make it tough for European creditors to get their money back. read more

The EU said it will assess the consequences of cutting Russia out of SWIFT before deciding whether to use that ""financial nuclear weapon"". read more

Britain's Johnson said on Thursday he intended to work with allies to shut off Russia's access to SWIFT. U.S. President Joe Biden said it remained an option.

Analysts said Russian institutions are better able to cope with sanctions than eight years earlier, although that does not mean they would not hurt.

The Institute of International Finance, the largest international banking group, said U.S. sanctions on Russia will have a sizeable impact on Russia's economy and citizens and could cause a recession.

WHICH FOREIGN BANKS ARE MOST EXPOSED?

Many foreign banks have significantly reduced their exposure to Russia since 2014 but several Western banks have been involved in deals and have other relationships.

There were big falls in shares of European banks on Thursday, with an index of European banking stocks (.SX7P) closing down 8.1%.

Banks with significant operations in Russia were particularly hard hit, with Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International (RBIV.VI) down 23% and France's Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) losing 12%.

Italian and French banks each had outstanding claims of some $25 billion on Russia in the third quarter of 2021, based on Bank of International Settlement figures.

Austrian banks had $17.5 billion. That compares with $14.7 billion for the United States.

Feb 26 (Reuters) - The United States, Britain, Europe and Canada announced new sanctions on Russia on Saturday - including blocking certain lenders’ access to the SWIFT international payment system - following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Thursday.

Below are details on the measures proposed so far:

SWITCHING OFF SWIFT

Washington and its partners started to deploy what was widely seen as one of the harshest sanction measures: barring banks from SWIFT - a step that will stop lenders from conducting most of their financial transactions worldwide and, according to the statement, effectively curb Russian exports and imports.

The step, which will include restrictions on the central bank’s international reserves, will be implemented in the coming days, the nations said in a joint statement that also vowed further action.

It was not immediately clear which Russian banks would be removed from SWIFT, but Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said the move would ensure those selected were “disconnected from the international financial system” in a way that would “harm their ability to operate globally.”

SWIFT is used by more than 11,000 financial institutions in over 200 countries.

BANKS & FINANCIAL FIRMS

The United States and Britain announced restrictions that, combined with previous sanctions, would in effect kick the vast majority of Russian banking assets out of both countries. New targets included Sberbank and VTB Bank, Russia’s two largest lenders.

U.S. banks must sever correspondent banking ties - allowing banks to make payments between one another and move money around the globe - with Russia’s largest lender, Sberbank, within 30 days.

Officials in Washington also wielded their most powerful sanctioning tool, adding VTB, Otkritie, Novikombank and Sovcombank to the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list - effectively kicking them out of the U.S. financial system, banning trade with Americans and freezing their U.S. assets.

EU leaders have agreed sanctions targeting 70% of the Russian banking market and important state-owned companies, including in defence.

Russia’s large banks are deeply integrated into the global financial system and sanctions will be felt far beyond its borders. Data from the Bank for International Settlements showed European lenders hold the lion’s share of the around $120 billion in foreign banks’ exposure to Russia.

According to data from Russia’s central bank, total Russian banking foreign assets and liabilities stood at $200.6 billion and $134.5 billion, respectively, with the U.S.-dollar share amounting to around 53% of both, down from 76%-81% two decades ago.

SOVEREIGN DEBT & CAPITAL MARKETS

Britain announced it would ban Russian sovereign debt sales in London. Russia has issued $4.1 billion of sovereign debt in London since the beginning of 2020.

The coming package of EU measures will “target the ability of the Russian state and government to access the EU’s capital and financial markets and services, to limit the financing of escalatory and aggressive policies,” the bloc said. It will ban EU investors from trading in Russian state bonds.

Washington announced new restrictions on dealings in Russia sovereign debt on Tuesday. Americans - already barred from investing in Russian sovereign debt directly - will be banned from purchasing it in the secondary market after March 1.

Even before the latest events, access to Russian bonds had become increasingly restricted.

U.S. sanctions imposed in 2015 made future Russian dollar debt ineligible for many investors and key indexes. In April 2021, President Joe Biden barred U.S. investors from buying new Russian rouble bonds over accusations of Russian election meddling.

The curbs have cut Russia’s external debt by 33% since early 2014 - from $733 billion to $489 billion in the third quarter of 2021.

INDIVIDUALS

The U.S., the EU and Britain have already imposed asset freezes, travel bans and other curbs on Russian individuals.

Britain announced sanctions on more than 100 Russian individuals and entities, including an asset freeze and travel ban on Yelena Georgieva, chair of the board of Novikombank; Pyotr Fradkov, Promsvyazbank chairman; Denis Bortnikov, VTB deputy president; Kirill Shamalov, President Vladimir Putin’s former son-in-law; and United Aircraft’s Yury Slyusar.

Britain will also introduce legislation to limit deposits that Russian nationals can hold in UK bank accounts. The limit will be 50,000 pounds ($66,860) at British banks.

Washington sanctioned Fradkov and Bortnikov on Tuesday, as well as Vladimir Kiriyenko, the son of a former prime minister.

On Thursday, Washington targeted others close to Putin, including Sergei Ivanov, CEO of Russian state-owned diamond mining company Alrosa; Andrey Patrushev, who has served in leadership roles at Russian state-owned gas company Gazprom; and Ivan Sechin, reportedly a deputy head of a department at energy company Rosneft.

Biden said on Thursday he would consider personal sanctions on Putin, a move Moscow has said would not harm the Russian president personally but would prove “politically destructive”.

The EU has already imposed sanctions on five people who were involved in a Russian parliamentary election in annexed Crimea last September, and said it would blacklist all lawmakers who voted to recognise two regions controlled by pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, freeze any assets they have in the EU and ban them from travelling to the bloc.

ENERGY CORPORATES & NORD STREAM 2

The United States and the EU already have sanctions in place on Russia’s energy and defence sectors, with state-owned gas company Gazprom, its oil arm Gazpromneft and oil producers Lukoil, Rosneft and Surgutneftegaz facing various types of curbs on exports/imports and debt-raising.

Sanctions could be deepened, with one possible option being to prevent companies settling in U.S. dollars.

Nord Stream 2, a recently completed pipeline from Russia to Germany, was awaiting regulatory approval by EU and German authorities before Berlin put its certification on ice.

The U.S. on Wednesday imposed sanctions on the company in charge of building Russia’s Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.

CURBING TECHNOLOGY

The EU has vowed to introduce measures to crimp Russia’s technological position in key areas - from high-tech components to cutting-edge software.

The U.S. Commerce Department said on Thursday it was implementing export controls that will severely restrict Russia’s access to semiconductors, computers, telecommunications, information security equipment, lasers, and sensors that it needs to sustain its military capabilities.

Similar measures were deployed during the Cold War, when sanctions kept the Soviet Union technologically backward and crimped economic growth.",https://www.reuters.com/article/ukraine-crisis-russia-sanctions-idCNL8N2UZ8MJ

The United States, Britain, Europe and Canada committed on Saturday to removing some Russian banks from the SWIFT payments system, deploying what the French finance minister had earlier called a ""financial nuclear weapon"" because of the damage it would cause to Russia as well as its trading partners.

The latest round of sanctions came after the U.S. Treasury Department said it was targeting the ""core infrastructure"" of Russia's financial system, sanctioning two of its largest banks - state-backed Sberbank (SBER.MM) and VTB (VTBR.MM).

Russia's large banks are deeply integrated into the global financial system, meaning any sanctions on the biggest institutions could be felt far beyond its borders. Cutting them from SWIFT would make transactions more difficult and costlier.

But it is also expected to hurt the country's trading partners in Europe and elsewhere. While further details are awaited, Germany suggested on Saturday that the allies were looking for ""targeted and functional restriction of SWIFT"" to limit collateral damage.

A ban from SWIFT would come on top of other sanctions that limit the ability of some of Russia's largest banks to do business internationally.

U.S. Treasury said Thursday's sanctions would disrupt billions of dollars worth of daily foreign exchange transactions conducted by Russian financial institutions. Overall, these institutions conduct about $46 billion worth of forex transactions, 80% of which are in dollars. ""The vast majority of those transactions will now be disrupted,"" it said.

Such a move would hit Russian banks hard but the consequences are complex. Western officials have said blocking Russia is technically difficult and would hurt trading partners.

EU assesses impact of cutting Russia out of SWIFT

Shares recover some of steep falls from Thursday

FRANKFURT/LONDON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - European and U.S. bank shares on Friday clawed back some of the previous day's steep losses as the sector started to get to grips with a slew of sanctions unveiled this week in retaliation for Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Shares got off to a jittery start as missiles pounded the Ukrainian capital and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy pleaded with the international community to do more, saying sanctions announced so far were not enough. read more

Investors have been on high alert for sanctions against Russia over fears of rippling complexity and compliance risks for global banks. But many U.S. and European industry executives say they had already reduced their exposure to Russia.

After early losses, leading European banks later edged up, with a European banking sector index (.SX7P) 4.27% higher by mid-afternoon, having fallen 8% on Thursday.

Shares of major U.S. banks also closed up, with JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N), and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) adding between 2% and 3.26%.

The S&P 500 banks index (.SPXBK) rose 3.36% while the KBW Bank index (.BKX) rose 4%.

After the market close late on Friday, the European Union said in a statement it had adopted further sanctions that will have ""massive and severe consequences"" for Russia.

The EU imposed a ban on issuing bonds, shares or loans in the bloc for refinancing Russia's Alfa Bank and Bank Otkritie.

Three Russian banks were already subject to asset freezes from earlier in the week. The top three Russian banks - Sberbank (SBER.MM), VTB (VTBR.MM) and Gazprombank - were not included in the measure.

The bloc also set a cap of 100,000 euros for EU bank accounts of Russian citizens, who will not be allowed to buy euro-denominated shares, while Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov were put on the EU sanctions list.

""This package includes financial sanctions, targeting 70% of the Russian banking market and key state-owned companies, including in defence,"" EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said on Twitter.

Swiss financial watchdog FINMA told banks on Friday to freeze assets of people and entities on the EU's sanctions list. read more

Behind the scenes, bankers said they and their lawyers were scrambling to determine the impact of sanctions.

Washington on Friday also imposed sanctions on Putin and Lavrov, following on from a tranche of sanctions against Russian banks and individuals on Thursday. read more

""What banks are focused on right now is updating their screening mechanisms within their compliance programs to make sure they are capturing all the entities that have been designated by the Treasury Department,"" said Caroline Brown, a partner at Crowell & Moring in Washington.

Germany's financial regulator, BaFin, said that it was in close contact with the banks it oversees regarding risks from the crisis and it expected full compliance with sanctions.

In a sign that sanctions were beginning to bite, the London Stock Exchange suspended the membership of VTB's subsidiary VTB Capital. read more

Elsewhere, compliance officials at insurance brokers are instructing staff to cease using Russian insurers and find alternatives, said Ben Sheppard, senior research analyst at insurance investment adviser Argenta Private Capital.

DISAGREEMENT OVER SWIFT

In a report on Friday, JP Morgan analysts said sanctions would have a limited impact on banks directly and the bigger problem was the impact on the economy.

""The key risk for European banks relates to potential GDP downgrades due to higher commodity related prices and hence potential delays in interest rate hike expectations,"" the report said.

The prospect of higher interest rates had brightened the earnings outlook for banks after years of ultra-low and negative rates ate away at their profit margins.

On the ground in Ukraine, banks have been carrying out emergency measures. Germany's Solarisbank said that it had evacuated its tech hub in Kyiv, which it opened last year with dozens of employees.

""It is sad to think that just one week ago, I was in Kyiv, working and developing business. Now we have to rebuild our plans and to adapt,"" the bank's Ukraine chief, Dumitru Condrea, posted on LinkedIn.

On Thursday, banks with the biggest exposure to Russia fell the most.

That included Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International (RBIV.VI), which lost 23%, regaining 4.6% on Friday. Societe Generale (SOGN.PA), which lost 12% on Thursday, was up 4.2% on Friday.

Some investors had already cut exposure to Russia.

""We had our own screening view of what businesses would most likely be impacted through strong sanctions and that had been an area where we've been seeking to reduce our exposure,"" said Andrew Formica, the chief executive of Jupiter Fund Management (JUP.L).

For European banks, the greatest concern has been that governments would cut Russia out of the SWIFT international payment network, but so far that hasn't happened.

Bankers have argued cutting Russia off from the international payments network could seriously hurt its economy and everyday citizens, and would create enormous complexity and compliance risks for the global banking industry.

While Britain is pushing to cut Russia out of SWIFT, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Friday that option would only be used as a last resort but is being assessed for its impact. read more

NEW YORK, Feb 26 (Reuters) - The United States, Britain, Europe and Canada on Saturday moved to block Russia's access to the SWIFT international payment system as part of another round of sanctions against Moscow as it continues its assault against Ukraine.

SWIFT is the world's main international payments network.

Here are some comments from market analysts and banks:

HARRY BROADMAN, CHAIR OF EMERGING MARKETS PRACTICE, BERKELEY RESEARCH GROUP, WASHINGTON, D.C.

“Sanctions have lots of foibles as we know from history. The more comprehensive they can be, the more they cover, the more you raise the probability of effectiveness. But in this case it is hard to understand what drives Putin’s decision-making process. The more sanctions we get and the broader the coalition of people putting them in place, the probability of success goes higher. But there’s no formula.”

FORMER RUSSIAN DEPUTY CENTRAL BANK CHAIRMAN SERGEY ALEKSASHENKO, WASHINGTON DC:

""It means there is going to be a catastrophe on the Russian currency market on Monday. I think they will stop trading and then the exchange rate will be fixed at an artificial level just like in Soviet times.""

""It's much worse than [the Russian financial crisis of] of 1991 because it's not clear on what conditions all this can be canceled. This is a very strong decision, the strongest one that could be taken and I consider it is absolutely correct.""

ROSS DELSTON, U.S. LAWYER AND FORMER BANKING REGULATOR, ST LOUIS, MO:

“It’s the closest thing to a declaration of war from a financial perspective. If there was an actual hot war between the US and Russia, these are the kind of sanctions that one would expect to occur.

""It’s going to result in Russia being viewed as radioactive by US and EU banks, which in turn would be a major barrier to trade with Russia.”

JORDAN KAHN, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, ACM FUNDS, LOS ANGELES:

“If we're talking effects on the market, my guess is that it's going to be viewed as a net negative … global banks are all interconnected at some point and so if this causes a run on Russian banks, or anything like that, I think that that's a negative perception, combined with the fact that the U.S. is tightening the screws on Russia by enacting SWIFT.

""We already saw late last week some cyber attacks... I think that there could be some concern amongst investors about further retaliation on the part of Russia: are they going to try to intensify things out there?

""And so I think the concern is going to be does this kind of escalate the back and forth retaliation? … It might be a longer term positive because it's an attempt to try to pressure Putin towards resolution. But in the short term, it seems like it's kind of a net negative.”

“There's perception and sentiment, and then there's the reality and the fundamentals. I don't think at the end of the day, when banks report their earnings, especially for the year as a whole, I don't think that there's going to be any mention or charges that they have to take as a result of this, but in the short term, sentiment-wise and just fear-wise, I think that the U.S. banks could get caught up in some concern about: does this have any ripple effects throughout the global banking system?”

CLAY LOWERY, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, INSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCE:

“These new sanctions, which include removing several Russian banks from SWIFT and sanctioning Russia’s central bank, are likely to cause serious damage to the Russian economy and its banking system. This will most likely exacerbate ongoing bank runs and dollarization, causing a sharp sell-off, and a drain on reserves.

""One of the biggest impacts on the global economy is likely to be on trade. While details on how the new sanctions affect energy are still emerging, we do know that sanctions on its central bank will make it more difficult for Russia to export energy and other commodities. As a result, we may see commodity prices surge.”

DENNIS DICK, HEAD OF MARKETS STRUCTURE AND PROPRIETARY TRADER AT BRIGHT TRADING LLC, LAS VEGAS:

“I think the whole world is trying to figure out a way to obviously rectify or at least stop what's happening over in Ukraine without physical intervention.

“Any type of action they can do that obviously avoids... us ... sending troops over, is going to probably be seen as a positive by Wall Street.”

""Is the worst behind us for Wall Street? I kind of tend to think it might be.”

“I think, whatever the U.S. can do to limit Putin’s finances is going to be viewed as a positive by Wall Street.”

SONIA KOWAL, PRESIDENT, ZEVIN ASSET MANAGEMENT, BOSTON

“You need a functioning banking system to have a functioning economy. This goes some way toward undermining the Russian economy.”

EDWARD MOYA, SENIOR MARKET ANALYST, OANDA, NEW YORK:

""This will draw comparisons to what happened to Iran, and the crippling effect to their economy, and this is more likely to deliver a major shock to global financial markets when we open up on Sunday night.”

""I think a lot of traders were kind of becoming convinced that the US and Europe were not taking a hard stance and that they were really focused on protecting the economic situation at hand and not really posing a major blow to the financial system. This action will be really difficult to digest and it will really pick a nerve for a lot of investors ... a lot of the rebound we saw in the latter half of last week will be tested.”

MICHAEL FARR, CEO AND FOUNDER OF FARR, MILLER & WASHINGTON LLC:

""Markets are looking for surprises, and this could be a surprise that is not taken very well if it means a slowdown in international trade.

""This move to remove Russia from SWIFT means that they are actually putting their money where their mouths are. This curtails Russia’s ability to execute transactions around the world, and cuts their financial flows off from most countries, so it is a severe step that should get their full attention.

""The issue will be the inflation that gets caused here, and the extent to which it can really slow the European economy. It could create headwinds if it goes on and on and on.""

PAUL MARQARDT, LAWYER WITH DAVIS POLK, WASHINGTON DC:

""Getting kicked out of SWIFT doesn’t make transactions impossible, it makes them much more difficult – getting kicked out of SWIFT would increase transaction costs significantly.”

PHIL ORLANDO, CHIEF EQUITY MARKET STRATEGIST, FEDERATED HERMES, NEW YORK:

“We’ve been calling for US to ban Russia from SWIFT and sanction purchase of Russian oil and gas. We can tighten the screws further. [Investors must] expect [Russia], if backed into an economic corner, [to] resort to some form of cybersecurity against those who acted.” That would increase market volatility, he said.

""These powers will enable us totally to exclude Russian banks from the UK financial system, which is of course by far the largest in Europe, stopping them from accessing sterling and clearing payments through the UK,"" Johnson told parliament, adding the United States was taking similar measures.

""These powers will also enable us to ban Russian state and private companies from raising funds in the UK, banning dealing with their securities, and making loans to them. We will limit the amount of money the Russian nationals will be able to deposit in their UK bank accounts.""
