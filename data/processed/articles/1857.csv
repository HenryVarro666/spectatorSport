The decrease in the activities of Russian troops in Kyiv and Chernihiv regions does not mean their withdrawal; it is the result of the work of Ukrainian soldiers.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said this in his video address, Ukrinform reports.

""There is an ongoing negotiation process. But these are still words. So far no specifics. There are also other words about the alleged withdrawal of Russian troops from Kyiv and Chernihiv, about the alleged reduction of the occupiers' activity in these areas. We know that this is not a withdrawal, but the result of expulsion, the result of the work of our defenders. However, we also see that there is an accumulation of Russian troops for new strikes in Donbas, and we are getting ready for this,"" - Volodymyr Zelensky said.

10:14 Stratcom Centre: Russian occupiers blew up their APC on the border with Ukraine

It was a provocation, planned by Russians, said Dmytro Zhyvytskyi, Head of the Sumy region military administration. The invaders placed their armored personnel carrier at the crossing point Ryzhivka and blew it up. This provocation was meant to ""create a picture"" for Russian media and justify the destruction of the border crossing point.

The Working Group will also include the legal experts from companies ""Covington & Burling LLP"", ""Sygna Partners"", ""Withers"", and receive support from international human rights scientists from various institutions and the IBA.

08:25 Security Service of Ukraine: 20 Russian ""internet spies"" were undercovered since the start of the full-scale Russian invasion.

7 of them have confirmed their connection to Russian intelligence, some of them have already been convicted by the court. According to the SSU, these ""internet spies"" spread propaganda in support of the occupiers and violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine.

07:50 General Staff: operational information as of 06:00, 30.03.2022 regarding the Russian invasion. Key points:

Russian units of the 4th (Tskhinvali district, South Ossetia) and 7th (Abkhazia) military bases, which are part of the Southern Military District of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, were transferred from the occupied territories of Georgia to the territory of Ukraine for replenishment of the armed groups. Three BTGs with a total number of up to 1,200 Russian and Ossetian servicemen were formed from the 4th military base and sent to Ukraine. Two units were formed from the 7th military base, which is about 800 people.

Illegal acts against locals: Russian occupiers dispersed throughout the Velyka Bilozirka settlement and placed their military equipment between residential buildings. Russian invaders on the outskirts of the city equipped checkpoints and strengthened the bypass regime in Melitopol city. Russians continue to loot the homes and apartments of local residents, detain pro-Ukrainian activists and government officials in Ukraine. The Russian-backed ""authorities"" of the temporarily occupied territories in the Luhansk region plan to hold another wave of mobilization from April 1 this year. The recently occupied territories of the region might be involved in this process, too.

The armed forces of the Russian Federation still have problems with staffing its units. For instance, after participation in the war with Ukraine contract servicemen of the 26th Tank Regiment of the 47th Tank Division began to submit reports requesting to terminate the contract and send them to a permanent location for further service.

Over the past 24 hours, the Joint Forces of Ukraine have repulsed four Russian attacks in the Donetsk and Luhansk directions. Ukrainian soldiers destroyed 7 tanks, 7 armored vehicles, 2 soft-skin vehicles, and an anti-tank gun, as well as inflicted manpower casualties on the occupiers.

07:44 Ministry of Finance of Luxembourg: as of today, operators in Luxembourg have frozen Russian assets worth 2.5 billion euros due to the EU .sanctions. It was reported by the Finance Minister of Luxembourg Yuriko Backes.

07:25 Verkhovna Rada: this year's sowing campaign is the most challenging in the history of independent Ukraine.

The war caused agrarians a lot of problems, the Committee on Agrarian and Land Policy of the Ukrainian Parliament wrote in a statement. In particular, even land plots to which farmers have access are often mined. Minefields treat is recorded in the regions currently most affected by war, namely: Sumy, Chernihiv, Donetsk, Luhansk, Mykolayiv, sometimes in Kyiv and Kharkiv regions.

People are afraid to work on them, the Committee stated. In Kherson oblast, there are cases of targeted strikes on warehouses, agricultural machinery parking, and engineering bases in order to disrupt sowing.

Although some of the problems are challenging to deal with now, the parliament has already adopted some decisions meant to facilitate the sowing campaign: access to fuel, registration of agricultural machinery, and seed certification have already been simplified; licensing of pesticides and agrochemicals has been deregulated.

""Due to the war, sowing in 2022 will become even more crucial because the food security of both Ukraine and the world depends on the work of Ukrainian farmers,"" the Committee noted.

01:24 According to British intelligence, Russia will try to use the units withdrawn from the north to attack the Donbas. This was reported by the Ministry of Defense of the United Kingdom.

The intelligence service noted that the repeated failures of the Russians and the successful counterattacks of the Ukrainian troops meant that, most likely, the Russian offensive had not achieved its goal of encircling Kyiv.

""Russia's statements about the reduction of activity around Kyiv and the withdrawal of some Russian units may indicate Russia's recognition that it has lost initiative in the region,"" the statement said.

01:05 General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine: the operational update regarding the russian invasionon 24.00 on March 29, 2022, key points:

The tasks of reaching the administrative borders of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, encircling the city of Kyiv and establishing control over the left-bank part of Ukraine remain unfulfilled by the enemy.

Withdrawal of units of the Armed Forces of the russian federation from the territory of Kyiv and Chernihiv oblasts continues.

According to some indications, the russian enemy is regrouping units to focus its main efforts on the East. At the same time, the so-called ""withdrawal of troops"" is probably a rotation of individual units and aims to mislead the military leadership of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and create a misconception about the occupiers' refusal to plan to encircle the city of Kyiv.

There are no significant changes in the composition and position of the russian enemy's troops in the Volyn, Polissya, and Siversky areas. The russian occupiers are trying to keep the previously occupied borders, they are not carrying out active offensive operations in these areas.

In the direction of Slovyansk, the enemy continues to hold positions in the area of the settlements of Kamyanka, Sukha Kamyanka? implement measures to supply russian troops, regroup units and replenish supplies continued.

In the Donetsk direction, the enemy continues to fire and storm. It carried out air and missile strikes in the areas of Kreminna and Mariupol. Its main efforts were focused on taking control of the settlements of Popasna, Rubizhne, as well as the complete capture of Mariupol, which was not successful.

No changes in the composition and position of the enemy were recorded in the Tavriya direction.

In the South Buh direction, the russian enemy is taking measures to restore the combat capability of its units. It does artillery fire and air strikes, trying to restrain the actions of units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

The russian enemy carried out artillery shelling of the positions of the units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine near the settlements of Stepnohirsk, Orikhove, and Huliaipole.

In the areas of Novokarlivka and Luhivske settlements, the russian enemy continues to carry out fortification equipment of occupied positions and install minefields.

Background:

February, 24: Russian President Vladimir Putin authorized a ""special military operation"" against Ukraine. A number of cities of Ukraine suffered a missile attack. Missiles hit several military facilities in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Dniprocities. In a few hours, martial law was imposed in Ukraine.

The war lasts for more than a month. An impressive rundown of the first days of the war was provided by the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy in his address to the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

Key points regarding the current state of warfare:

- Ukrainian defenders continue to defend our land on Donetsk and Luhansk directions, though the enemy increased its firepower and intensified assault operations, the main efforts are on taking control of Popasna and Mariupol. No success achieved.

- Ukraine managed to establish the defense, Russian offense has stalled, in some directions Ukrainian military push back the invaders.

- Belarus provides its lands to Russian troops and equipment; still hasn't joined the war directly.

- Russia uses terroristic methods of war, shelling civilian facilities where there are no military facilities nearby, keeping cities in a full blockade, and sabotaging humanitarian corridors for evacuation and convoys with humanitarian aid.

- Russian army targets nuclear power plants; Chernobyl NPP and Zaporizhzhia NPP are seized by occupiers; military activities by Russian forces near the power plants were described by Ukraine as nuclear terrorism

- Ukraine urges NATO to close the sky over Ukraine or at least provide air defense equipment: fighter jets or ground-based missile systems; some countries have expressed willingness to give their weapons if NATO provides corresponding defensive equipment in exchange (Poland, Slovakia)

- Ukraine appealed for EU membership via an accelerated procedure. The EU Council summit concluded that such a fast-track application process is impossible, yet they stated that ""Ukraine belongs to the European Union""

- Ukrainian citizens in the occupied cities rally against Russians; thousands of civilian volunteers join the Territorial Defense of the Armed Forces of Ukraine; the fighting has become a national struggle for survival

- Ukraine has had several rounds of negotiations with Russia; still, no significant progress towards ceasefire and peace, the main question, for now, is establishing humanitarian corridors for the supply of aid and evacuation of civilians; the negotiations continue ""non-stop"" in an online format; President Zelenskyy expressed readiness to directly talk with Putin.",https://en.defence-ua.com/news/day_35th_of_ukraines_defense_against_russian_invasion_live_updates-2406.html

Clashes have continued in Kyiv Region March 31 despite Russia's previous insistence that it would reduce military operations around the capital. Ukrainian forces have clashed with Russian troops in towns along the Zhytomyr Highway, as well as in Bucha, Hostomel, and Nemishayeve. Artillery shells and rocket barrages continue to target settlements near Kyiv, including Sviatopetrivske; however, shelling within the city proper has subsided over the past 24 hours. To the east of Kyiv, Ukrainian forces have entered the towns of Svitylnia, Hrebelky, and Ploske, and are reportedly engaging in skirmishes with Russian forces around the town of Nova Basan.

There have, however, been some reported Russian withdrawals from Kyiv Region in recent days. Russian forces were reportedly withdrawing from the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone in the north of Kyiv Region as of March 31 and previously withdrew from Slavutych March 30. Additionally, Russian troops are believed to have withdrawn from Velykodymerska and Kalytyanska, northeast of Kyiv city. Local authorities have warned potential returning residents of a severe threat from unexploded ordnance. Notably, Ukrainian forces are actively conducting limited counteroffensives in many of these areas, excluding Chernobyl.

Intense clashes have continued in the southeastern Donbas regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. In Luhansk, the Russian ground assaults continue to focus on Rubizhne and Popasna. Russian forces claim to have captured Zhitlovka and are now fighting on the outskirts of Kremennaya. In Donetsk, clashes have centered on Novobahmutivka, Marinka, Zolotaya Niva, and Velyka Novosilka. Heavy clashes and persistent bombardment are ongoing in Mariupol, where the area controlled by Ukrainian forces reportedly continues to shrink. Russian forces have been reliably identified within the city center, where they are engaging Ukrainian defenders. Additionally, reports indicate Russia may be redirecting troops from Kharkiv toward fighting on the road from Izyum to Slovyansk, in Donetsk Region, possibly with the ultimate aim of linking up with troops in Luhansk Region.

Ukraine continues to conduct counteroffensives and other ground operations toward the towns of Mala Rohan, Chuhuiv, and Derhachi in Kharkiv Region, as well as in northwestern areas of Chernihiv Region and southwestern areas of Mykolaiv Region, as of March 31. These offensives are likely limited in size and scope, as Ukraine resists the temptation to overcommit forces amid reports of a Russian withdrawal from some areas to focus on the Donbas.

Elsewhere, shelling and missile strikes continue to be reported against targets across the country. A missile strike on an oil depot near Dnipro caused a major fire late March 30; no casualties were reported. Intense shelling continues to be reported in Chernihiv city, as well as on targets in Zaporizhzhia Region, including Hulyaipole and Orikhiv. Russian shelling was also reported on the towns of Novovorontsovka, in Kherson Region, and Nyzhyn in Chernihiv Region. Further intense shelling and missile strikes, including strikes on targets in western regions, are highly likely.

Protests denouncing the Russian offensive and the subsequent occupation continue to take place in multiple urban centers. Most protests are reported in Kherson Region, where Russian forces have maintained a presence since March 2. Russian troops have used tear gas and opened fire on protesters on several occasions, highlighting the difficulty Russian forces may encounter when attempting to impose order in some cities under their occupation. Elsewhere, protests have occurred in Henichesk, Berdyansk, and Melitopol, which are also under Russian occupation.

Disruptions and Shortages

Ukrainian Railways (UZ) continues to operate evacuation trains from Kyiv and multiple other areas, including Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kryvyi Rih, Zakarpattia, Zaporizhzhia, and Odesa. Clashes and artillery strikes periodically prompt the suspension of evacuations. Large crowds continue to be reported at stations offering evacuation services. Intercity and regional rail services are available intermittently; rail services are subject to disruptions without warning. Civilian aviation remains suspended, and the nation's seaports are closed.

Nightly curfews are in effect in multiple regions during various time frames. In Kyiv Region, a curfew is in place 21:00-06:00; in Mykolaiv, a curfew is in place from 20:00-06:00; in Zaporizhzhia, the curfew is in place from 20:00-05:00; and, in Rivne, authorities have declared a curfew from 22:00-06:00. Generally, civilians must stay indoors during curfew hours; exemptions exist for workers in critical infrastructure and persons seeking urgent medical care or bomb shelters. Authorities may extend or amend curfew hours on short notice, depending on local developments.

Intermittent telecommunications, internet, and utility disruptions continue across much of the country. Reports also indicate a shortage of basic supplies, including groceries and pharmaceutical products, in multiple cities facing Russian ground assaults. The most severe shortages and disruptions are consistently reported in Chernihiv, Kharkiv, and Mariupol, which have suffered heavy bombardments and repeated ground assaults in recent days. Similar situations are likely in other cities facing Russian ground offensives or heavy bombardments. Finally, the National Bank of Ukraine has limited foreign currency transfers and withdrawals.

Ukraine's borders with Belarus, Russia, and the Transnistria region of Moldova are closed to foreign nationals; only Ukrainian citizens can enter from these areas. Ukraine's borders with Hungary, Moldova, Poland, and Slovakia remain open. Though congestion has eased since the early days of the conflict, delays may worsen depending on conflict developments elsewhere in the country.

Context

The conflict appears to be entering a protracted phase, and Russian troops are likely digging in defensively while they await resupply or reinforcement or otherwise regain the initiative they had during the early days of the conflict. Ukrainian counteroffensives, though limited, have reportedly been effective at pushing Russian forces out of some areas in recent days.

However, given that Russia is likely concentrating on the southeast to fulfill the stated aim of capturing the entirety of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, limited Ukrainian counteroffensives are unlikely to impact the course of the conflict significantly. Accordingly, offensive operations have increasingly focused on the Donbas. Though progress has slowed considerably from the initial phase of the war, Russian and Russia-backed forces continue to make slow but steady gains in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions while continuing to engage in heavy clashes with Ukrainian defenders in Mariupol city center.



While negotiations are ongoing, it is likely that Russian officials will only present concrete proposals once they feel the military position in southeastern Ukraine is relatively secure. Recent talks have failed to yield any concrete de-escalation of the conflict, though both Russian and Ukrainian positions are believed to have softened. Moscow is reportedly no longer demanding Ukraine's unconditional surrender, while Kyiv has indicated a willingness to abandon the pursuit of NATO membership in exchange for security guarantees.

Advice

Avoid travel to Ukraine until the situation stabilizes; consider exiting the country if safe to do so. Where fighting or airstrikes are occurring, shelter in place until the situation becomes clear. If officials report incoming fire, stay away from windows and exterior walls. Strictly heed the instructions of local security personnel, particularly when ordered to air-raid shelters. Stockpile food, fuel, and water when possible and safe to do so. Maintain contact with your diplomatic representation. Confirm that a thorough communication plan exists to ensure rapid accountability for all personnel operating in Ukraine. Reconfirm the status of public transport services, road routes, and borders before departure. Due to the threat of unexploded ordnance, consider avoiding off-road travel. Travel on well-used routes only. Do not approach suspected unexploded ordnance.

This was announced by Draghi at a press conference on Thursday, the EP reports with reference to Reuters.

Nuclear objects

Russian troops begin to leave the Chornobyl nuclear power plant. This was reported by sources in the Pentagon. So far, only part of the troops has left the station.

The IAEA will send nuclear safety equipment to Ukraine. The IAEA is also organizing several missions to support the Ukrainian side: at the Zaporizhzhya NPP and the Chornobyl NPP, these will be online missions. Other stations will set up emergency teams of experts who will go to the scene in case of threat to ""prevent acts of aggression, as at ZNPP.""

Who's coming to Ukraine?

About financial aid, weapons, and volunteer fighters

The United States has already sent a new batch of weapons to Ukraine. U.S. Department of Defense spokesman John Kirby said on the night of March 31: ""Deliveries are coming to the region every day, including the last 24 hours. We have already shipped the top 50 cargo planes out of about 30 within the $800 million received by the president."" Kirby stressed that the shipments include weapons that Ukrainian forces need most, including anti-tank and anti-aircraft systems.

Norwegian authorities sent 2,000 M72 anti-tank grenade launchers to Ukraine. This decision was made after the speech of the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Norwegian Parliament.

Ukraine will be able to buy weapons from German defense companies. Preliminarily, the purchase of weapons and equipment worth €300 million has already been agreed upon. In total, about 200 items are on the list and some of them will be delivered as soon as possible.

The Spanish government has already sent ten offensive planes to Ukraine. This was stated by Spanish Defense Minister Margarita Robles.

And this is Denmark playing with the Netherlands. Thank you for your solidarity with the Ukrainian people!

Russian nuclear planes violated Swedish airspace. Sweden believes that this was intimidation.

What's in Russia?

Unrecognized South Ossetia will soon take legal steps to join Russia. Reunification with Russia is the country's strategic goal. This was stated by the President of South Ossetia Bibilov. Prior to that, the leader of the so-called ""LPR"" Leonid Pasichnyk stated the same intentions, but he was told by Russia that ""now is not the time.""

Self-proclaimed Abkhazia abandoned the idea of ​​joining Russia.

Meanwhile, soldiers from South Ossetia refused to ""liberate"" Donbas and returned home. The information was confirmed by the former President of South Ossetia Eduard Kokoity. He said that ""it is not necessary to condemn the military,"" but it is necessary to ""understand the reasons for what happened."" Ossetian blogger Alik Pukhayev also said that 300 servicemen refused to fight voluntarily: ""Today, about 300 servicemen (mostly ethnic Ossetians) from a Russian military base returned to South Ossetia voluntarily because they thought they had been left to die during a 'special operation' in Ukraine,"" he wrote. And rightly so.

13:00 – Georgia reacted to South Ossetia's statement on holding a referendum on joining Russia: ""Talks on a referendum in South Ossetia are unacceptable,"" said the Georgian Foreign Minister.

Putin ""turned on the back"" about paying for gas in rubles. The aggressor country will not require Europeans to pay for gas supplies in rubles. They will be able to pay in euros.

This was reported on the website of the Consulate General of the French Embassy in Russia. It becomes clear why Macron calls Putin every week.

In Russia, there was hysteria over the disqualification of skaters. Russian-titled Russian coach Tatiana Tarasova reacted to the International Skating Union's (ISU) decision to remove Russian figure skaters from competition because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine: ""You should have a conscience. The life of an athlete is very short, and they take it away. Bandits!"" Disrespectful Tarasova, your compatriots, real thugs of the Russian army, are taking the lives of Ukrainians, not figuratively, but literally. But you are unlikely to realize this, so the sanctions will continue to work.

The thief country doesn't return leased aircraft to Europe. AerCap, the world's largest aircraft leasing company, is demanding from insurers about $3.5 billion in compensation for aircraft stuck in Russia, Bloomberg reports. It is noted that the Irish company managed to return only 22 of the 135 aircraft and 3 of the 14 engines installed on Russian aircraft before the ""special operation.""

What about Belarus?

The occupiers are using the airport in Brest, Belarus, to shell Ukraine. The issue of the invasion of Belarusian troops into our country ""went away."" ""The offensive from Belarus is already underway, but not the Belarusian army. Moreover, the Russians have begun to use the Brest airport, from which the shelling of our territories starts,"" said the adviser to the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine Vadym Denisenko.

The second train in three days in Belarus derailed. It was equipped with Russian military equipment. 8 activists were detained.

And in Ukraine, the Ukrainian Armed Forces began to form a Belarusian regiment Pogonia (Chase) of Belarusian volunteers. The regiment was created on the initiative of Belarusian officers with the support of the Armed Forces to protect the independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as to create a base for a new professional Belarusian army.

Russian lies

The Center for Strategic Communications explored the main narratives in Russia's Telegram channels on March 28-29. Russian fascist propagandists talk about ""neo-Nazis,"" the sale of orphans, and discrimination against black people. The occupying country demonizes the Ukrainian army and lies about bullying the Russian military, promotes the topic of ""black transplantology"" and argues that poverty has already begun in Europe because of sanctions against Russia. All these are obvious throwaways and fakes.

The Kremlin's lies are very professional and convincing. According to a Levada Center poll, after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russian support for Putin's actions rose to 83%.

The Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security states that Russian propaganda media have begun to disperse new lies about Ukraine. They claim our country allegedly did purposeful work to distort the historical truth and ideological preparation for the military operation against Russia. This conclusion is based on the results of an ""analysis of about 300 Ukrainian textbooks and manuals"" conducted by Russian educators and historians. The aggressor state pretends to be the victim, and the victim is tried to be shown as the aggressor. This is how politics is done in Putin's Russia.

Sanctions on the aggressor!

Australia imposes additional duties of 35% on all goods imported from Russia and Belarus.

Japan has included gold bars in the list of luxury items; now they're prohibited to export to Russia. This is the strengthening of sanctions in response to Russian aggression in Ukraine. In addition to ingots, it is also forbidden to export gold coins and banknotes.

Britain has expanded the list of sanctions against Russia. It includes:

– Chairman of the National Center for Defense Management of Russia Mikhail Mizintsev;

– TV presenter Sergei Brilov;

– General Director of Gazprom-Media Aleksandr Zharov;

– Russia Today media group (works under the Sputnik brand);

– RT channel.

UPDATE 07.13 Forţele ruse din jurul Kievului au început o ""repoziţionare”, dar ""nu o retragere reală"", a declarat marţi purtătorul de cuvânt al Departamentului Apărării, John Kirby, citat de AFP.

""Putem confirma că am văzut un număr mic de trupe care au început să se repoziţioneze”, a spus el reporterilor. Dar ""trebuie să fim pregătiţi să vedem o ofensivă majoră împotriva altor zone ale Ucrainei” şi ""asta nu înseamnă că ameninţarea împotriva Kievului a luat sfârşit”, a avertizat el.

""Marea majoritate a forţelor pe care le-au adunat lângă Kiev sunt încă acolo”, a spus John Kirby, iar asta ""este o repoziţionare, nu o retragere reală"".

Potrivit acestuia, Rusia nu şi-a îndeplinit obiectivul de a cuceri Kievul, nu şi-a îndeplinit obiectivul care a fost să preia controlul Ucrainei, ""dar încă poate provoca violenţe masive în ţară, inclusiv în Kiev"".

""Trebuie să fim lucizi cu privire la realitatea a ceea ce se întâmplă pe teren şi nimeni nu ar trebui să fie păcălit de anunţurile Rusiei”, a declarat Kate Bedingfield, o purtătoare de cuvânt de la Casa Albă.

Moscova a promis marţi că îşi va reduce ""radical"" activitatea militară în direcţia Kiev şi Cernihiv în Ucraina, după discuţii ""substanţiale"" ruso-ucrainene de la Istanbul.

Şi preşedintele Zelenski a vorbit despre situaţia de la Mîkolaiv. ""În timpul zilei, o operaţiune de salvare a fost în desfăşurare în Mîkolaiv. Resturile clădirii administraţiei regionale distruse de loviturile cu rachete ruseşti au fost destructurate. Trupele ruse au lovit Mîkolaiv într-un mod perfid. Într-un moment în care oamenii veneau dimineaţa la locul de muncă. Slavă Domnului, cei mai mulţi dintre cei aflaţi în clădire au reuşit să se evacueze când au auzit alarma aeriană. Încă un act al aşa-numitei denazificări ruseşti a Mîkolaivului a avut loc dimineaţa după aniversarea eliberării oraşului de invadatorii nazişti. Locuitorii Mîkolaiv îşi amintesc ziua de 28 martie 1944. Şi văd cu cine seamănă acum trupele ruse care încearcă să captureze oraşul"".

UPDATE 04.58 În Irpenul eliberat de ocupanţi, oamenii sunt căutaţi sub dărâmături, a anunţat şeful Direcţiei Principale a Poliţiei Naţionale a Ucrainei din regiunea Kiev, Andriy Nebytov. El a remarcat că evacuarea are loc din toate locurile în care ostilităţile continuă, sau aşezările sunt sub ocupaţie. „În aşezările eliberate am văzut rezultatele efective ale activităţilor noastre militare. În sate sunt echipamente inamice distruse, tancuri, vehicule de luptă de infanterie, care au fost sfărâmate în bucăţi. Dar mai este mult de lucru, inclusiv pentru explozivi” - spune Nebitov. El a spus că oamenii sunt de obicei scoşi prin aşa-numitele „coridoare verzi”, dar de multe ori poliţia şi guvernele locale organizează evacuări exclusiv pe cont propriu.

„Numai în regiunea Kiev, cel puţin 100.000 de oameni au fost evacuaţi. Aceasta s-a făcut atât cu ajutorul transportului public, dacă este organizat de autorităţile locale, cât şi cu transportul privat. Ne-am descurcat. Am lucrat non-stop şi principalul lucru - am salvat aceşti oameni ""- a raportat Nebitov.

Şeful poliţiei din regiunea Kiev a menţionat că în prezent poliţia lucrează din greu pentru a identifica colaboratori, oameni care au ajutat armata rusă să ocupe oraşe şi să-şi stabilească propria ordine acolo. El a menţionat că în regiunea Kiev au fost deja deschise mai multe proceduri penale, iar autorii vor fi urmăriţi penal.

Uniunea Europeană a condamnat ferm bombardarea sediilor Misiunii de consiliere a UE (EUAM) din Mariupol. Acest lucru se precizează într-o declaraţie a diplomatului UE Josep Borrell, lansată marţi la Bruxelles.

UPDATE 03.24 Statul compensează pierderea unei case sau a unui apartament ca urmare a ostilităţilor. Acest lucru a fost anunţat de preşedintele Ucrainei, Volodimir Zelenski, în discursul său video de seară, adresat cetăţenilor Ucrainei, publicat de Biroul Preşedintelui.

Potrivit Voice of America, acest lucru a fost anunţat de Organizaţia Maritimă Internaţională (OMI), care este o agenţie a ONU care reglementează transportul comercial internaţional. Se observă şi că echipajele rămân fără alimente.

UPDATE 01.17 Conducerea Forţelor Armate ale Ucrainei presupune că, prin rotirea unităţilor individuale, inamicul vrea să creeze o impresie falsă că a abandonat ideea încercuirii Kievului. Acest lucru se precizează în informaţiile operaţionale ale Statului Major al Forţelor Armate ale Ucrainei cu privire la invazia rusă de la ora 24.00 pe 29 martie.
