With gasoline prices soaring, the International Energy Agency says it's time to cut oil use dramatically. The energy organization has a 10-point plan to do that, suggesting a range of actions — from cutting highway speed limits to launching car-free Sundays in big cities.

Global gasoline prices have surged following Russia's invasion of Ukraine last month, with U.S. gas prices setting a new national record of more than $4 per gallon.

As the U.S. and its allies continue to levy economic sanctions on Russia, markets have been bracing for serious disruptions to crude supplies. Earlier this month, U.S. oil prices rose to as high as $130.50 per barrel, the highest since 2008.

In response, the IEA has released a list of proposed actions to ease strains and price pains for oil as the peak consumption months of July and August are rapidly approaching.

""As a result of Russia's appalling aggression against Ukraine, the world may well be facing its biggest oil supply shock in decades, with huge implications for our economies and societies,"" IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said.

The United States and 30 other countries in the IEA have already moved to release 60 million barrels of oil from their reserves. ""We can also take action on demand to avoid the risk of a crippling oil crunch,"" Birol added.

The IEA says its plan would cut oil demand by 2.7 million barrels a day within four months of implementation, which it said would equal the oil demand of all the cars in China.

With a majority of oil demand coming from transportation, the plan mostly focuses on how to use less oil getting people and goods from place to place.

Some short-term measures recommended are reducing speed limits on highways by at least 10 kilometers per hour (about 6 mph), implementing car-free Sundays in cities, making public transportation cheaper and incentivizing walking and cycling.

The IEA also suggests encouraging people to work from home up to three days a week where possible.

The organization looked at air travel as another opportunity to cut down on global oil consumption, recommending that businesses avoid using air travel when alternatives exist and that individuals should consider using high-speed and night trains when possible.

It also highlights that adopting electric and more efficient vehicles will decrease oil demand into the future.

NPR has put together some other ways to help you get the most out of your tank of gas.

1,b7248074-30ba-449d-932c-addc78c4449c,[],,"Inflation is the main economic and political concern right now. Before Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, it was possible inflation would peak early in 2022, then ease as supply chain kinks unwound and consumers returned to normal spending patterns.

Russia’s barbaric war on Ukraine changed that equation, sending oil and gasoline prices soaring as a major source of world energy supply suddenly looked endangered. Russia is the world’s third largest supplier of oil and natural gas, and markets prepared for several disturbing possibilities. Sanctions or boycotts could have prevented Russia from selling some or all of its energy. Russia could have weaponized its energy by refusing to sell, which would particularly harm Germany and other European countries heavily dependent on Russia's gas for winter heating. There was also a chance of wartime damage to energy infrastructure running through Ukraine, another threat to supply.

There have definitely been disruptions—but so far, they’re nowhere near the worst-case scenario. Russian gas continues to flow to Europe, and the global market has so far managed the loss of some Russian oil as nations such as the United States ban imports and financial sanctions make other sales difficult or impossible. As a benchmark, oil prices tell the story.

Analysts say that in a full-blown energy crisis, oil prices could easily exceed $150 per barrel. The record high in 2008 was $145—which would be $187 today, adjusted for inflation. The 2008 spike didn’t even stem from a supply shock, suggesting prices could go higher still if supply shrank abruptly, without any replacement oil backfilling the loss.

This hasn’t happened yet—despite the reluctance of swing suppliers such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to produce more. Before the Russian invasion, U.S. crude oil prices were around $92. After the invasion began, they hit a peak of $123. The price then fell back to $95 on March 16 and is now around $103. That’s about 70% higher than it was a year ago, which is doubtless a pain point for oil consumers. But it’s nowhere near the worst that a major war could produce.

Story continues

Stock markets indicate a similar whiff of relief. Stocks drifted down the week before Russia's Feb. 24 invasion, then went lower still, hitting a low for the year on March 8. But the S&P 500 stock index is up 7% from the March 8 low and has recouped all its losses since Russia invaded, and then some.

The Russia-Ukraine war is obviously unpredictable, with a variety of outcomes possible, including some that would be terrible. But the direction of the war so far tells us a couple of important things we didn’t know when it started.

Ukraine's odds of winning are better than once expected

[Follow Rick Newman on Twitter, sign up for his newsletter or send in your thoughts.]

One is that the odds of Ukraine prevailing and remaining an independent nation are a lot higher than analysts once thought. Russia still has a firepower advantage, but it has sustained massive losses of troops and equipment, while revealing its once feared army to be a creaky and poorly managed relic. Russian President Vladimir Putin, once considered a chess master who routinely outsmarted the West, has stumbled repeatedly, overestimating his own nation’s abilities while underestimating Ukraine’s. He also misjudged Western unity and Russia’s ability to withstand sanctions.

Ukraine has obviously demonstrated a remarkable ability to punch above its weight, and its capabilities may grow as Western weapons flood the country and Russian troops grow more demoralized. Russia can shell cities from a distance and cause widespread destruction, but that alone isn’t a path to victory. In four weeks of warfare, Russia has taken few or none of the cities that would be key to seizing political control of Ukraine, and it may never.

The relative stability of energy markets

Another surprise is that energy markets have remained relatively stable despite tougher sanctions on Russia than most analysts expected and a legitimate hit to global energy supplies. It’s worth noting that Saudi Arabia, which in the past often produced more to stabilize markets during shocks, has declined this time and basically told President Biden, sorry, you’re on your own.

Here in America, people wonder why U.S. drillers aren’t producing more. The United States is the world’s biggest oil producer, so can’t we solve this on our own? Yes and no. Often overlooked is the fact that the government doesn’t control U.S. oil production; private-sector companies do. And big ones such as Exxon and Chevron no longer want to crank up production just because prices tick up for a while. They’d rather focus on profitability and err on the side of underproducing.

The good news is that some independent drillers are, in fact, producing more, and for now, cashing in. The U.S. rig count hit 663 in mid March, up 50% from a year ago. That will bring more oil to the U.S. market and eventually lower gasoline prices, though it can take several months for the oil to flow through to final purchasers. If there are no other shocks, that new supply will help lower gas prices by the summer driving season.

There’s still a lot that could go off the rails in Ukraine. One big concern is the possible Russian use of chemical, biological or even nuclear weapons in Ukraine, which would force a draconian change in the U.S. and European response. Russia could miscalculate further and bring the war to a NATO country, turning a regional war into a bigger conflagration. It’s possible Russia could regroup and turn the battle back in its favor, and energy disruptions could still happen.

But Russia already faces the biggest humiliation of Putin’s 20-year reign, and a disastrous rupture with much of the world economy. Many onlookers think he can’t win, and it may just be a matter of time until Putin himself accepts that. Wars rarely end cleanly, but they do end, and it’s becoming possible to glimpse the last gasp of Putin’s Ukraine misadventure.

Global airlines have bemoaned the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war and spike in the price of aviation fuel on airline costs.

The airlines, under the aegis of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), said the positive figures recorded in January have been eroded by crisis and flight disruptions.

IATA noted that the resulting sanctions and airspace closures on account of the Russia-Ukraine crisis are expected to have a negative impact on travel, primarily among neighbouring countries.

The Ukraine market accounted for 3.3 per cent of European passenger traffic and 0.8 per cent of global traffic in 2021. The Russian international market represented 5.7 per cent of European traffic (excluding Russian domestic market) and 1.3 per cent of global traffic in 2021.

Airspace closures have led to rerouting or cancellations of flights on some routes, mostly in Europe-Asia but also in the Asia-North America market. This impact is mitigated owing to greatly diminished flight activity since borders in Asia were largely closed owing to COVID-19.

IATA’s Director-General, Willie Walsh, said in addition to these disruptions, the sudden spike in fuel prices is putting pressure on airline costs.

“When we made our most recent industry financial forecast last autumn, we expected the airline industry to lose $11.6 billion in 2022 with jet fuel at $78/barrel and fuel accounting for 20 per cent of costs. As of March 4, jet fuel is trading at over $140/barrel.

“Absorbing such a massive hit on costs just as the industry is struggling to cut losses as it emerges from the two-year COVID-19 crisis is a huge challenge. If the jet fuel price stays that high, then over time, it is reasonable to expect that it will be reflected in airline yields,” Walsh said.

He added that the past few weeks have seen a dramatic shift by many governments around the world to ease or remove COVID-19-related travel restrictions and requirements as the disease enters its endemic phase.

“It’s vital that this process continue and even accelerate, to more quickly restore damaged global supply chains and enable people to resume their lives. One step to encourage a return to normality is to remove mask mandates for air travel.

“It makes no sense to continue to require masks on aeroplanes when they are no longer being required in shopping malls, theatres or offices. Aircraft are equipped with highly sophisticated hospital quality filtration systems and have much higher airflow and air exchange rates than most other indoor environments where mask mandates already have been removed,” Walsh said.

IATA announced that the recovery in air travel slowed for both domestic and international in January 2022 compared to December 2021, owing to the imposition of travel restrictions following the emergence of Omicron last November.

Total demand for air travel in January 2022 (measured in revenue passenger kilometers or RPKs) was up 82.3 per cent compared to January 2021. However, it was down 4.9 per cent compared to the previous month (December 2021) on a seasonally adjusted basis.

January domestic air travel was up 41.5 per cent compared to the year-ago period but fell 7.2 per cent compared to December 2021 on a seasonally adjusted basis.

International RPKs rose 165.6 per cent versus January 2021 but fell by 2.2 per cent month-on-month between December 2021 and January 2022 on a seasonally adjusted basis.

“The recovery in air travel continued in January, despite hitting a speed bump called Omicron. Strengthened border controls did not stop the spread of the variant. But where population immunity was strong, the public health systems were not overwhelmed. Many governments are now adjusting COVID-19 policies to align with those for other endemic viruses. This includes lifting travel restrictions that have had such a devastating impact on lives, economies and the freedom to travel,” Walsh said.

African airlines’ traffic rose 17.9 per cent in January 2022 versus a year ago, a slowdown compared to the 26.3 per cent year-over-year increase recorded in December 2021. January 2022 capacity was up 6.3 per cent and load factor climbed 6.0 percentage points to 60.5 per cent.

European carriers’ January international traffic rose 225.1 per cent versus January 2021, which was up slightly compared to a 223.3 per cent increase in December 2021 versus the same month in 2020. Capacity rose 129.9 per cent and load factor climbed 19.4 percentage points to 66.4 per cent.",https://guardian.ng/business-services/aviation-business/russia-ukraine-war-fuel-price-spike-airline-costs/

Russians are starting to feel the economic pinch after Western countries imposed an unprecedented set of sanctions over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

Following weeks of mounting tensions, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a land, sea and air invasion on February 24, triggering a wave of financial restrictions that have plunged the value of the rouble, skyrocketed inflation and left many jobless.

In a speech to government ministers broadcast on Wednesday, Putin insisted Russia could withstand the “economic blitzkrieg”.

Below is a look at how sanctions are biting daily life for Russians:

Burgeoning inflation

The official Rosstat statistics agency said on Wednesday inflation was 2.1 percent between March 5-11, the second-highest weekly figure in more than 20 years. According to the ministry of economics, annual inflation jumped to 12.5 percent as of March 11 from 10.4 percent the previous week.

The business newspaper Kommersant reported a 10.4 percent increase in food prices from February 26 to March 4 – the highest rise since 1998.

A social media user from the southwestern city of Samara, who identified himself as Ivan, said a can of tuna now costs between 160-180 roubles, from what used to be 130 roubles. He also said in a Twitter post that sugar could not be found in many shops.

The Russian currency has lost an estimated 20 percent of its value over the past three weeks, triggering many retailers to raise their prices.

One of these is Procter & Gamble, which raised its prices by an average of 40 percent, Kommersant reported, because of higher costs in logistics, materials and the drop in the rouble. Female hygiene products now cost as much as 30 percent more.

To contrast cost increases, retailers committed to a five percent markup of basic goods, including dairy products and some vegetables, TASS news agency reported.

Medicine scarcity

Sasha, a woman living in Saint Petersburg, who asked to remain anonymous, described an “endless queue” in front of pharmacies with prices of medicine increasing. Two of her friends, she said, were considering going to Finland to get needed medication.

While sales of drugs are not subjected to sanctions, prices are expected to increase, though not as much as other goods, after major shipping companies halted their services to Russia. Local media reported drug prices in the Saratov region increased by 2.3-6.7 percent.

Andrey Baratov, head of the regional department of Roszdravnadzor – the federal service for surveillance in healthcare, was quoted as saying it was not expecting a “fatal” increase in drug prices, though he said authorities heard complaints from citizens over the lack of vital medicines in pharmacies and doubts over Russian medicine suitability in replacing foreign drugs.

Rising unemployment

After some hesitation, Western nations agreed to remove some Russian banks from the SWIFT international payment system, meaning companies like Visa, Mastercard and others would greatly limit their services.

Such a move, coupled with other sanctions, could cause Russia’s economy to contract by 10 percent, according to Elina Ribakova, an economist at the Institute of International Finance.

While official numbers are not yet available, the closure or departure of a large number of multinational companies such as Apple and IKEA are expected to have a significant effect on employment figures. US fast-food franchise McDonald’s lamented the fallout for about 62,000 people employed at 850 restaurants in Russia before halting its operations on March 8.

An analyst quoted by Kommersant estimated an “inevitable” fall in wages and an increase in unemployment of about seven percent by the end of 2022.

Sergei Grishunin, managing director of the National Rating Agency, told local news site Gazeta.ru it expects “explosive growth” in the number of bankruptcy cases in 2022, more than double compared with the previous year.

Although the press was full of comparisons with oil shocks in the 1970s, they wrote that a nearer relative was the dislocation after the second world war, when supply shortages interacted with pent-up demand. It was a well-reasoned argument. But the surge in commodity prices over the past month, in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, gives rise to an unsettling question: is the global economy now seeing a 1970s-style price shock on top of a late-1940s-style supply crunch?

To be sure, no serious economist expects inflation in the rich world to reach the giddy double-digit heights of those episodes. On March 16th the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the first time since 2018, kicking off a tightening cycle that it expects to continue well into next year. Moreover, the retreat in oil markets in recent days could offer relief.

Nevertheless, surging prices for everything from wheat to nickel threaten to add to inflation. And rolling lockdowns in parts of China could exacerbate strains on global supply chains. Consumer-price inflation in America already stood at a 40-year high in February, at 7.9% year on year; the rate in the euro area, meanwhile, exceeded 5%.

Investors are still far from persuaded that central bankers are on top of the problem. The most striking evidence is the inflation expectations that can be found in fixed-income markets in America. ICE , a financial firm, distils a few different numbers, including yields on inflation-protected bonds and interest-rate swaps, into short-term and long-term indices for gauging expectations. In late January the expected rate of inflation over the next year was 3.5%. On March 15th it stood at 5.4%. Expectations in the euro area have seen similar, if slightly steeper, trends. The one-year inflation swap rate rose to 5.9% on March 8th (see chart 2).

Markets are inherently volatile, so deriving inflation predictions from bond yields should be taken with a pinch of salt. But the shift in prices is broadly in line with what economists are forecasting. Last week Bank of America raised its inflation forecasts for much of the world. In America it now expects inflation over 2022 as a whole to average 7%, up from its prior forecast of 6.3%. In the euro zone it sees an even bigger increase, with inflation averaging 6% this year, well above its previous forecast of 4.4%. The challenge is greater for Europe because of its high dependency on Russia, which supplies about 45% of its gas imports. In an indication of just how pervasive the pressures are likely to be, economists are even ratcheting up their inflation forecasts for Japan, where deflation has long been the bigger threat. On March 8th S & P , a rating agency, said that Japanese inflation would average 2% this year, more than double its previous prediction. So far forecasters expect a relatively modest increase in overall inflation in emerging markets. But rising food costs will be especially damaging for their poorest citizens. Two related questions emerge from these forecasts. The first is whether the rise in commodity prices today will feed through into lofty inflation in the longer run. There is, in fact, reason for cautious optimism. A large body of research shows that the pass-through from higher oil prices into non-energy inflation is quite limited. For instance, Goldman Sachs, a bank, calculates that a 10% increase in crude-oil prices leads to a jump of nearly three-tenths of a percentage point in headline inflation in America, but to an increase of just about three-hundredths of a percentage point in core inflation (stripping out food and energy prices). That helps explain why market expectations of longer-term price trends remain more subdued: pricing for inflation five years from now is close to the Fed’s goal of keeping inflation to an average of 2%. The follow-up is what central bankers choose to do about rising commodity prices. The received wisdom of the past few decades is that policymakers should avoid over-tightening in the face of oil shocks. Indeed, surging energy prices can act as a drag on consumption, which is a particular concern for Europe.

But with real interest rates deeply negative in both America and Europe, central banks still have a long way to go to rein in inflation, whatever happens to commodity prices. On March 10th the European Central Bank surprised markets by announcing that it would wind down its bond-buying more quickly. And according to the Fed’s projections, its quarter-point rate increase is likely to be the first of seven this year. Central banks are, for now, sticking to their pre-war plans. ■

Previously', 'He Served As Deputy Editor Of Roll Call', 'As Founding Editor']",2022-03-17 09:55:22+00:00,"President Joe Biden recently cast blame for a spike in gas prices on Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“We’ve seen the price of gas go up over $1 just since he put his troops on the border of Ukraine,” Biden said in an address to the National League of Cities on March 14. “It went up $1.05. A big part of that reason is Putin began amassing troops along the border and then crossed (it). And guess what? The world took notice. The market anticipated; prices went up. And then Putin invaded.”

Biden continued, “Make no mistake: The current spike in gas prices is largely the fault of Vladimir Putin. It has nothing to do with the American Rescue Plan,” referring to the big coronavirus and economic relief package Biden pushed through Congress and signed early in his presidency.

Gasoline prices have risen most aggressively since Putin began preparing his invasion of Ukraine.

“Current,” however, is doing a lot of work in Biden’s remarks, which ignore a long run-up of gas-price increases prior to the escalation of military conflict in Ukraine. And while assessments differ over how much the American Rescue Plan promoted inflation generally, the legislation is widely credited with aiding the nation’s economic recovery, which in turn increased demand for gasoline and pushed prices higher.

“Gasoline and crude oil prices overall have increased significantly over the past year due to a variety of factors, mainly driven by increased demand due to recovery from the COVID pandemic and associated problems with the supply chain and employment,” said Hugh Daigle, an associate professor at the University of Texas-Austin’s Center for Subsurface Energy and the Environment.

The United States imports some crude oil from Russia, but Russian oil has a relatively small footprint in the U.S. market. Recent data shows Russian imports accounting for about 7% of total U.S. imports; in turn, imports are roughly equal to U.S. crude oil production, making the importance of Russian oil even more modest.

That said, the price of oil is determined by international factors, and because other countries are more heavily dependent on Russian oil than the U.S. is, any cutbacks in the use of Russian oil elsewhere can reduce global supplies, pushing prices higher for U.S. consumers.

To put Putin’s impact on U.S. gasoline prices in context, we looked at weekly per-gallon gasoline prices from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, dating back to the low point for gas prices in May 2020. That was just a few months into the coronavirus pandemic, when commuting and travel had slowed dramatically, producing low demand and low prices for gasoline.

In mid-May 2020, gas prices sat at around $1.88 a gallon. By late January 2021, when President Donald Trump left office and Biden was sworn in, a gallon of gas had risen to about $2.39 a gallon, an increase of about 50 cents.

From Biden’s inauguration until early November, the price of gas continued to rise: It reached $3.39 in early November, or an increase of about another dollar.

We chose November 2021 as a turning point because that’s when a continuing Russian troop buildup on Ukraine’s borders began to attract wider notice. On Nov. 3, Ukrainian officials said the number of Russian troops on its borders had reached 90,000, and on Nov. 10, the Biden administration offered public warnings about the military buildup.

By early December, the buildup and potential invasion became widely known to news consumers in the U.S., documented in the New York Times and other publications.

Between early November and the start of the Russian invasion in late February, U.S. gas prices rose modestly, climbing 10 cents to $3.49.

The big spike came when the invasion began, with the price of gas rising by 83 cents to $4.32.

So Putin’s invasion clearly caused the single biggest gas price spike during this period. And gas prices did rise during the four-month-long build-up to the invasion.

What Biden’s comment leaves out is that the gas price rise following Putin’s military buildup accounted for a fraction of the overall rise in gasoline prices.

Looking at the entire period starting with March 2020, the low point for gas prices, only about 38% of the price increase to today came during the period when Putin was threatening or conducting war in Ukraine. The remaining 62% of the rise had already occurred before the buildup became a major story in November.

And even if you only look at the rise during Biden’s tenure in office, less than half of the rise in gas prices occurred before the troop buildup became big news in November 2021.

So if Putin’s war plans aren’t “largely” the cause of the increase in gas prices, what other factors played a role? The big one is the economic recovery from the pandemic.

When the U.S. economy began sputtering back to life during the second half of 2020, it increased demand for oil, which in turn pushed up gas prices.

“I think it’s fair to say that much of the run-up happened before Russia’s buildup became a focus, and was driven by the post-COVID recovery in global demand,” said Mark Finley, a fellow at Rice University’s Center for Energy Studies. Finley added that a longstanding refusal by the OPEC oil cartel and its allies to increase production has added to the upward pressure in prices.

Dean Baker, co-founder of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, agreed. “Biden was definitely overstating the case” in blaming Putin as the primary driver of high gas prices, Bake said. “Clearly, the recovery was a factor in gas prices.”

It’s important to note that some of the early rise in gas prices after March 2020 was simply a “return to a more ‘normal’ supply-demand balance” following the extraordinary economic shutdowns of the early pandemic, said Clark Williams-Derry, an energy finance analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

He added that a significant part of why supply has trailed demand for the past two years is low investment in production during the pandemic, due to uncertainty about how to plan for a recovery.

“Oil prices and oil markets are influenced by a complicated, multi-directional, global network of causes and effects,” he said. But he added that “any analysis of oil price shifts since 2019 that doesn’t put COVID front and center is flat out wrong.”

The White House’s response

The White House acknowledged to PolitiFact that Biden did not mean to suggest that every cent of increase since May 2020, or since January 2021, was attributable to Putin, and they said that a number of factors have fed into the overall increase in gas prices.

Instead, the White House focused on Biden’s use of the term “current spike,” saying that the most recent rise does stem largely from Putin’s actions.

In the meantime, it’s important for everyone “to avoid a U.S. bias,” Williams-Derry said. “Oil prices are set globally, so there’s a tendency to blame U.S. politicians for things that they have literally no control over.”

Our ruling

Biden said, “Make no mistake: The current spike in gas prices is largely the fault of Vladimir Putin.”

By current, Biden means very current. The most recent spike in gas prices has stemmed largely from Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.

But gas prices were rising before the Russian troop buildup around Ukraine became front-page news. About two-thirds of the price rise since gas prices’ low point in May 2020 came before the Ukraine buildup became a major international story, an increase that experts say stemmed primarily from the economic recovery following the pandemic.

Developing countries — which are already affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, rising debt levels and climate change — will be hit the hardest by disruptions in food, fuel and finance, the agency said in report that evaluates the impact of war on trade.

About 26 African countries, including some least-developed ones, import more than a third of their wheat from the two nations at war, the report said.

For 17 of these African countries, the share of imports is more than half.

On average, more than 5 per cent of the world's poorest countries’ import basket is composed of products that whose prices are expected to increase due to the Russia-Ukraine war, Unctad calculations showed. The share is below 1 per cent for richer countries.

“Soaring food and fuel prices will affect the most vulnerable in developing countries, putting pressure on the poorest households which spend the highest share of their income on food, resulting in hardship and hunger,” Unctad secretary general Rebeca Grynspan said.

“This is cause for great concern as social and political stability and increasing food prices are highly correlated.”

Russia and Ukraine are major players in the global agricultural commodity markets, representing 53 per cent of the global trade of sunflower oil and seed trade and 27 per cent of wheat trade worldwide, said Unctad.

International food and feed prices could rise by up to 22 per cent as a result of the continuing conflict and the ensuing supply gap, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation said last week.

Some countries are particularly dependent on agricultural commodities from Russian and Ukraine.

The share of imports from the two countries — as a percentage of total imports of wheat, maize, barley, colza, sunflower oil and seeds — is 25.9 per cent for Turkey, 23 per cent for China and 13 per cent for India, Unctad said. Poor countries face the highest exposure.

The risk of civil unrest, food shortages and inflation-induced recessions cannot be discounted, the report said, particularly given the fragile state of the global economy and developing countries due to the pandemic.

“Agrifood commodity cycles have coincided with major political events, such as the 2007–2008 food riots and the Arab Spring,” Unctad said.

Freight rates to rise even higher

The conflict could also drive up cargo rates, which were already elevated as a result of the pandemic, the UN agency warned.

“Such increases would have a significant impact on economies and households,” the report said.

Restrictive measures on airspace and security concerns are complicating all trade routes going through Russia and Ukraine, it said. Global air freight capacity will be further constrained and air cargo prices are set to rise as airlines are forced to take longer routes and spend more money on fuel.

The already expensive and overstretched maritime trade will find it difficult to replace these suddenly unviable land and air routes, the agency said.

Reversal of green investments trend

Unctad's rapid assessment of the war's impact beyond the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine shows heightened financial volatility, sustainable development divestment, complex global supply chain reconfigurations and mounting trade costs.

“Countries already under severe pressure due to the costs of the pandemic will see disruption in trade”, widening deficit and a contraction in investment, Ms Grynspan said.

Moreover, the sharp rise in oil and gas prices can shift investment back into fossil fuel-based energy generation, which raises the risk of reversing the trend towards renewables as the world deals with an acute climate crisis, said Unctad.

“All these shocks threaten the gains made towards recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and block the path towards sustainable development,” Ms Grynspan said.

Mounting debt burdens, rising climate change costs, continuing pandemic effects and commodity price shocks increase the risk of a debt crisis in developing countries, the report said.

The combination of high food and fuel prices and macroeconomic tightening will place severe pressure on households in developing countries: real incomes will be squeezed and economic growth will be constrained, the UN body said.

“Even in the absence of disorderly moves in financial markets, developing economies will face severe constraints on growth and development,” the report said.",https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/economy/2022/03/17/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-due-to-ukraine-war-to-hit-developing-nations-hardest-says-un/

Russia is one of the world’s top three oil producers, after the United States and Saudi Arabia.

“This price is still above long-term normals, adding further support to the idea that oil markets remain fragile,” he added.

As of Thursday 6pm, Brent crude futures stood at US$102.95 a barrel, while the US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was at US$99.60 a barrel.

​​Singapore University of Social Sciences’ economist Walter Theseira noted that oil trading markets are influenced not just by current demand and supply conditions but also expectations of what may happen in the near future.

“The problem has been that the news coming in on a daily basis is causing the market to change expectations just as often,"" he said.

""Since there is no clear path to stability in Ukraine, and there is also uncertainty about how other major oil suppliers will respond, the market simply swings based on whatever news appears the most important and updated at that point in time.""

In addition to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, there has also recently been news of lockdowns in China due to the resurgence of COVID-19. This, Dr Theseira said, pointed to “continuing uncertainty on many fronts” and would also dampen demand.

CIMB Private Banking economist Song Seng Wun said that it remains unclear if the downward trend in oil and pump prices over the past few days will continue.

""Factors which have drove prices up - worries over supply, the Iran nuclear talks, supply disruptions are still there. Except now, people look on the so-called the glass half full (perspective),"" he said.

""It is still simply put, volatile ... It can go either way.""

A ""NATURAL CORRELATION""

As oil prices change, the value of the petrol sitting in tanks and the supply chain changes, said Dr Theseira.

“It is quite normal for retail pump prices to follow market oil prices both up and down,"" he said.

""Of course, the timing and extent of the change will also depend on market conditions and the supply of retail petrol … but the general trend is that oil market prices have a direct link to retail petrol prices.

“So there would be volatility at the pump price for as long as there is also uncertainty affecting the oil market.”

Given that fuel from the pumps is refined from oil, there will be a “natural correlation” between the two “complementary markets”, said Dr Broadstock.

“What impacts oil will intuitively impact petrol in a similar manner, but perhaps with some delay and usually with lower severity,"" he said.

""In this regard it is reasonable for consumers to be anxious when oil prices spike, as they have done in recent days, and remain high.""

Petrol retailers in Singapore do not use crude oil prices in their cost accounting and pricing decisions for pump petrol. The Mean of Platts Singapore prices – the wholesale price of refined oil published by markets research firm S&P Global Platts – is used instead.

Other considerations that go into the pricing decisions of retailers include duties, the cost of storage, land and labour, as well as currency differences. There is also typically a “lag effect” given how pump prices are based on older inventories bought at either higher or lower prices depending on the market situation then.

The pass-through effects from oil to pump prices are impacted by many factors, noted Dr Broadstock.

“Expectations are certainly built into pricing mechanisms, and we can use that to position some useful trajectories,"" he said.

""For example, we have seen prices abruptly knocked away from their ‘normal position’ due to the onset of the crisis. Markets, presented with such unique events, often err on the side of caution, and overreact.""

Dr Broadstock added: “What follows is a slower-paced process of price-discovery, as supply-chains recalibrate, and clarity forms over new fuel contracts. Ideally prices will then stabilise and converge to a steady level.

""This process is not yet complete for oil, and therefore not complete for pump prices.”",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/petrol-prices-crude-oil-volatility-russia-ukraine-conflict-2570996
