The White House separately said the two discussed Washington’s efforts “to fulfill the main security assistance requests by Ukraine, the critical effects those weapons have had on the conflict, and continued efforts by the United States with allies and partners to identify additional capabilities to help the Ukrainian military defend its country.”



Their call came as Russian forces continued bombardments near Kyiv and another northern Ukraine city one day after promising to scale down operations nearly five weeks after invading its southern neighbor.



The West has dismissed Moscow’s promise as a ploy to regroup by invaders taking heavy losses.



Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special operation” that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbor’s military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.



A US official, citing declassified intelligence, on Wednesday said Russian President Vladimir Putin was misled by advisers who were too scared to tell him how poorly the war in Ukraine is going and how damaging Western sanctions have been.

Meanwhile, clarifying the controversy, the US Defence Department has asserted that American troops in Poland were “liaising” Ukrainian forces but not training them “in the classic sense”. Earlier this week, American President Joe Biden seemingly suggested that the US was training Ukrainian troops in Poland. US NSA Jake Sullivan has strongly denied the claim and said “We do, of course, have U.S. troops defending NATO territory.""

""It's not training in the classic sense that many people think of training. I would just say it's liaising,"" Kirby said on Tuesday stopping short of revealing details of the operation.

The US provided $800m in aid to Ukraine earlier this month that included Stinger anti-aircraft systems, Javelin missiles and drones.

On Tuesday, peace talks between Ukraine and Russia appeared to have made their ""most meaningful progress"" since the invasion began, Turkey's foreign minister said, after Moscow vowed it would curtail its military operations near Kyiv.

Moscow's promise was met with scepticism in the West, as Mr Biden told reporters he would not ""read anything into it until I see what their actions are.""

The Pentagon added that the movement of Russian forces was more of a repositioning than a withdrawal, adding that any redeployment of troops from the Ukrainian capital indicates a significant setback for Moscow.

A US official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Russian President Vladimir Putin is being misinformed by his advisers about his forces' struggles, AP reported.

In Washington, lawmakers on Capitol Hill continue to press ahead with a Russian sanctions package. After it was overwhelmingly approved by the House, the legislation designed to revoke Russia's preferred trade status has been stuck in the Senate for weeks.

Some progress appeared to be made on Wednesday after language of the bill was changed to satisfy Rand Paul, a Republican senator, whose opposition has forced the bill to stall.

The call came after Ukrainian and Russian delegations met in Istanbul, Turkey Tuesday for the first in-person discussion in nearly three weeks as the situation on the ground changed to a war of attrition.

Russia’ deputy minister of defense told reporters in Moscow Tuesday that Russian forces would withdraw from Kyiv and Chernihiv to establish goodwill during the talks, but defense experts warned Fox News that Moscow was simply buying time to reorganize its troops. Russian forces continued their shelling overnight of several Ukrainian cities. By Wednesday, the defense ministry announced it would ""resume"" offensive operations, meaning forward movement on the ground.

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Wednesday that Russian units have been ""repositioning"" around Kyiv in the past 24 hours and also have been moving north into Belarus, noting that the Russians themselves have said they are going to prioritize eastern Ukraine in the Donbas region.

Kirby also spoke about U.S. European Command Commander Gen. Tod Walters’ testimony before Congress Tuesday, saying that some 100 kamikaze switchblade drones promised by Biden have been delayed. In an interview with Stuart Varney, Kirby blamed ""inventory"" and ""modality"" issues, saying he’s expecting shipments of the tactical unmanned systems to arrive in Ukraine ""relatively soon.""
