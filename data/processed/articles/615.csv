Another image, taken by a drone hovering above the nearby village of Komyshany, also shows the large plume of smoke rising from the airport.

CNN has geolocated and verified the authenticity of the image.

The military strike at the airport was picked up by NASA's Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS), which tracks large fires around the world.

According to the sensory data collected by FIRMS, the military strike occurred around 1:42 p.m. local time.

Prior To Joining Aviation Week In November', 'Tony Was At Shephard Media Group Where He Was Deputy Editor For Rotorhub', 'Defence Helicopter Magazines.']",,"LONDON—Satellite imagery appears to confirm that a Ukrainian attack on an airfield previously captured by Russian forces resulted in the destruction of several Russian helicopters.

Planet imagery of Kherson airbase, captured on March 15, shows several helicopters destroyed and more on fire after apparent attacks by Ukrainian forces.

Ukraine’s defense ministry reported that 30 helicopters were destroyed in an apparent commando raid on the airfield overnight on March 6/7, but the claims could not be independently verified.

The new imagery suggests that Ukrainian forces may have since followed up on that raid with artillery. The satellite imagery shows the airfield pockmarked by shell craters.

Joseph Dempsey, a research associate for defense at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, tells Aerospace DAILY that cloud cover over the region had limited the availability of imagery since the first claimed Ukrainian attacks.

“It is possible Russia may have moved its helicopters to more defensible positions in the wake of the initial attack, which in turn may have made them more vulnerable to a targeted artillery strike if not as dispersed,” Dempsey suggests.

Analysis by the Oryx blog, a group of independent open-source intelligence analysts, suggests as many as 15 helicopters may have been destroyed at Kherson, along with vehicles and air defense systems.

Imagery suggests Russian forces had captured the airfield and were using it as a forward operating base.

The airfield is on the outskirts of the city of Kherson, one of the first major Ukrainian cities to be captured by Russian forces since the beginning of the invasion on Feb. 24.

Prior to the conflict, the base had been home to a regiment of helicopters belonging to Ukrainian Army Aviation.",https://aviationweek.com/defense-space/budget-policy-operations/satellite-imagery-confirms-ukrainian-counterattacks-russian

Planet Labs has published satellite images showing burning Russian trucks and helicopters at the airport in occupied Kherson. The images were acquired on March 15 after the Armed Forces of Ukraine carried out an artillery strike on the airport.

CNN experts who studied the images say they show at least three burning Russian helicopters, as well as several pieces of other military equipment. It is impossible to establish the exact number of destroyed vehicles from the images due to the dense smoke screen.

CNN reported that the Armed Forces of Ukraine had conducted a strike against Russian equipment in occupied Kherson on March 15 at 1342. Exactly at that time that NASA satellites recorded a fire in this area.

Earlier, journalist Denys Kazanskyi said that an artillery strike had been conducted against Russian forces at Kherson Airport. According to him, dozens of pieces of equipment were destroyed.

Reports claim that three military helicopters were destroyed on Monday as black smoke was seen billowing from the airport. Large fires around the world are tracked by NASA’s Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) and the burning wreckage of the Russian aircraft was picked up by the system.

The data collected from the NASA system has said that the military strike occurred around 1.42pm local time. Russian forces claimed control of Kherson two weeks ago with this strike being the second major attack from Ukrainian forces in an attempt to reclaim their key port. The amount of smoke coming from the tarmac at the international airport may be obscuring further damage caused by the military strike. Other smaller fires can be seen around the base including under the plume of smoke which shows that core infrastructure at the airport has also been damaged.

At other areas of the base, wreckage of scorched helicopters can be seen that are no longer burning and showing some of the results of previous attacks on the base. People have taken to Twitter to express their views on the attack on the airbase, with one user Tim McMillan, a retired Police lieutenant, posting his analysis of drone footage. He said: “Drone footage, likewise, shows smoke billowing from the airport. “Russia has been using the airport to stage large formations of helicopters and equipment, so it’s likely today’s strike put a dent in Russia’s combat power in the south.” READ MORE:Covid travel rules change - Every measure that's been lifted

The Kremlin claimed to have full control of the Kherson region on Tuesday, though the claim made by Russia’s defence ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenov, has not been verified. The UK Ministry of Defence has issued a warning that Russia may attempt to appoint a pro-Moscow government in Kherson in an attempt to assert “political control”. Russia “may seek to stage a ‘referendum’ in Kherson in an attempt to legitimise the area as a ‘breakaway republic’ similar to Donetsk and Luhansk and Crimea.” DON'T MISS:
