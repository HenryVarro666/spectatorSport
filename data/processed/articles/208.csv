Russian missiles pounded Kyiv on Friday, families cowered in shelters and authorities told residents to prepare Molotov cocktails to defend Ukraine's capital from an assault that the mayor said had already begun with saboteurs in the city.

But the U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, suggested a mixed picture for the Russian effort to press an offensive that Washington and Kyiv say is aimed at decapitating the government and installing a puppet regime.

""We do assess that there is greater resistance by the Ukrainians than the Russians expected,"" the senior defense official said, adding Ukraine's command and control of its military ""remains intact"".

""They are not moving on Kyiv as fast as what we believe they anticipated they would be able to do. That said, they continue to try to move on Kyiv.""

Still, Russia has not yet mobilized the majority of its forces arrayed around Ukraine, the official said, assessing that just about one-third have now been ""committed"" to its offensive.

The official cited indications of a Russian amphibious assault west of Mariupol, ""putting potentially thousands of naval infantry ashore there"". The United States had also observed more than 200 total missile launches so far.

Although most of the Russian targeting has been against Ukrainian military installations, some of the missiles have landed on civilian residential areas, the official said.

Ukraine's military was putting up a fight, the official said.

""They are fighting for the country,"" the official said, noting that Russia had yet to establish control of the airspace above Ukraine or used the extent of its electronic warfare capabilities.

""In general, the Russians have lost a little bit of their momentum,"" the official said.

The official said several hundred American citizens have left Ukraine over the past 24 hours.

Kramer']",2022-02-25 00:00:00,"KYIV, Ukraine — The Ukrainian defense forces, outmanned and outgunned, waged a ferocious resistance to the Russian invasion on Saturday, battling to keep control of the capital, Kyiv, and other cities around the country.

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine posted a video on Twitter, telling the public not to believe false reports.

He was alive. Kyiv had not fallen. Any reports of Ukraine laying down its arms was a lie, Mr. Zelensky said.

“I’m here,” he said. “We are not putting down any arms. We will protect our country, because our weapons are our truth. The truth is that this is our land, our country, our children, and we will protect them all.”

“That is it. That’s what I wanted to tell you. Glory to Ukraine.”

His comments, released before 9 a.m., came as fighting intensified in Kyiv. What until three days ago had been a thriving European metropolis has been transformed into a battle zone. Russian troops pressed in from all directions.

There was intense street fighting, and bursts of gunfire and explosions could be heard across the city, including its heart, Maidan square, where in 2014 Ukrainian protests led to the toppling of a pro-Moscow government.

The Russian military has a decisive edge in cyberwarfare, tanks, heavy weaponry, missiles, fighter planes and warships. In sheer numbers, its military dwarfs that of Ukraine.

Russia has established attack lines into three cities — Kyiv in the north, Kharkiv in the northeast and Kherson in the south — and Ukrainian troops are fighting to hold all three. The Pentagon reported late Friday that the Russians did not appear to be in control of a single major population center. Significantly, a senior U.S. defense official said, Ukrainian command and control remains intact.

The Ukrainian government reported that hundreds of Russian soldiers had been killed in the war, along with scores of their own soldiers, while the Russian defense ministry issued a statement on Saturday morning that made no mention of any casualties or anything about the fight for Kyiv.

The Russian invasion started with targeted airstrikes before dawn on Thursday, but on the third day of the war, bloody battles were often being waged in close quarters. Ukrainska Pravda, a Ukrainian news site, citing witnesses, reported combat 400 yards from Maidan Square in central Kyiv.

All Ukrainian men of fighting are being drafted into service, and tens of thousands are signing up. Ukrainians were asked to make Molotov cocktails. And there were tearful scenes at airports in western Ukraine as wives kissed their husbands goodbye before they headed to front.

The nation has rallied around its president, Mr. Zelensky, a former comedian.

To him and other officials, the objective of the Russian invasion of a neighboring country that possessed no military threat is to topple the government.

Mr. Zelensky has said that he is “target no. 1.”

As battles were waged around the city on Saturday morning, there were reports of clashes near the city’s train station and along a central thoroughfare, Bohdan Khmelnitsky Street, leading from Victory Square toward the city center, according to the witness accounts. Along that street, closer to the city center, bursts of gunfire could be heard through the night.

“We are stopping the horde, so far as we can,” the secretary of the Ukrainian Security and Defense Council, Oleksy Danilov, said around 7 a.m. “The situation is under control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and citizens of Kyiv.”

In dozens of interviews in the tense hours before the invasion and in the days after, Ukrainians struggled to understand how a country at peace so suddenly found itself at war. For many Ukrainians, the answer was found in Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin.

This is Mr. Putin’s war. But what frightened people perhaps as much as the threat of missiles and bombs was that they did not know what he wanted.

The fear was evident in the drive from Kyiv to a small village outside the city. Military convoys had replaced families going on vacation or visiting friends. Where once Kyiv was known as a city where the music played a touch too loud in its cafes, the incessant wail of air raid sirens drowned out all joy.

The fear was evident in the faces of the people seeking safety in Western Ukraine, after they emerged from 20-hour train rides in packed carriages that were kept pitch-black to avoid being targeting by Russian rockets.

From Lviv in the west to Odessa in the south and Kharkiv and nearly all points in between, people huddled in air raid shelters and lined up and bank machines and stocked up on essentials.

While the Russians, for the moment, were not in control of any city, it was only the first phase of a conflict that could stretch into weeks or longer.",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/02/25/world/russia-ukraine-war

The announcement was a remarkable change of direction for European powers that, until recent days, were reluctant to end a 30-year effort to integrate Russia into the European economy.

WASHINGTON — The Biden administration and key allies announced on Saturday that they would remove some Russian banks from the SWIFT financial messaging system, essentially barring them from international transactions. They also said they would impose new restrictions on Russia’s central bank to prevent it from using its large international reserves to undermine sanctions.

The actions, agreed to by the European Commission, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and the United States, represented a significant escalation in the effort to impose severe economic costs on Russia over President Vladimir V. Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine.

“Russia’s war represents an assault on fundamental international rules and norms that have prevailed since the Second World War, which we are committed to defending,” the countries said in a joint statement. “We will hold Russia to account and collectively ensure that this war is a strategic failure for Putin.”

The announcement was a remarkable change of direction for European powers that, until recent days, were reluctant to end a 30-year effort to integrate Russia into the European economy. Now, like the Biden administration, European nations appear to be headed toward a policy of containment.

But, out of a sense of political self-preservation, they stopped short of barring energy transactions with Russia. The result is that Germany, Italy and other European nations will continue purchasing and paying for natural gas that flows through pipelines from Russia — through Ukrainian territory that is suddenly a war zone.

Some in Europe, along with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, had called for all Russian institutions and individuals to be cut off from SWIFT in an effort to bring the Russian economy to its knees. About 40 percent of the Russian government’s budget comes from energy sales.

While the announcement on Saturday was limited in its scope, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said that “cutting banks off will stop them from conducting most of their financial transactions worldwide and effectively block Russian exports and imports.”

Ms. von der Leyen said the trans-Atlantic coalition would also try to cripple Russia’s central bank by freezing its transactions and making it “impossible for the central bank to liquidate assets.”

The targeting of the central bank could, in the end, prove more consequential than the action regarding SWIFT. Russia has spent the last several years bolstering its defenses against sanctions, amassing more than $630 billion in foreign currency reserves by diverting its oil and gas revenue. Those reserves can be used to prop up the ruble, whose value has fallen dramatically amid the latest rounds of sanctions.

Biden administration officials said on Saturday that there would be new restrictions by the United States and its allies against selling rubles to Russia, undercutting the country’s ability to support its currency in the face of new sanctions on its financial sector. That, in turn, could cause inflation — and while administration officials did not say so explicitly, they are clearly hoping that could fuel protests against Mr. Putin’s rule in Russia.

“We know that Russia has been taking steps since 2014 to sanctions-proof its economy, in part through the stockpiling of foreign exchange reserves,” said Emily Kilcrease, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. “The central bank sanctions will limit their ability to leverage this asset, along with constraining their ability to conduct monetary policy of any sort to manage the economic damage from other sanctions.”

The United States and its allies also announced steps to put pressure on Russia’s elites, including creating a task force that the White House said would “identify, hunt down and freeze the assets of sanctioned Russian companies and oligarchs — their yachts, their mansions and any other ill-gotten gains that we can find and freeze under the law.”

The idea is to strike those who are closest to Mr. Putin and undermine their ability to live in both Russia and the West. In another new move, the United States and its allies said they would seek to limit the sale of so-called golden passports that allow wealthy Russians who are connected to the Russian government to become citizens of Western nations and gain access to their financial systems.

While the steps are some of the harshest taken yet, the announcement falls short of a blanket cutoff of Russia from SWIFT, which some officials see as a nuclear option of sorts. Such a move would have essentially severed Russia from much of the global financial system.

And some experts say that it may only drive Russia to expand the alternative to the SWIFT system that it created several years ago when it began trying to “sanction-proof” its economy. But Russia’s equivalent system is primarily domestic; making it a competitor to SWIFT, officials say, would require teaming up with China.

The moves on Saturday came on the same day that Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, announced that his government was approving a transfer of antitank weapons to the Ukrainian military, ending his insistence on providing only nonlethal aid, such as helmets.

At the same time, in a post on Twitter, Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, and its economy minister, Robert Habeck, acknowledged that the country was moving from opposing a SWIFT ban to favoring a narrowly targeted one.

“We are working intensively on how to limit the collateral damage of a disconnection from #SWIFT so that it hits the right people,” they said. “What we need is a targeted and functional restriction of SWIFT.”

The announcement by the United States and its allies did not specify which banks would be cut off from the system.

SWIFT, a Belgian messaging service formally known as the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, connects more than 11,000 financial institutions around the world. It does not hold or transfer funds, but it lets banks and financial institutions alert one another of transactions about to take place.

For weeks, the Biden administration publicly played down the notion of cutting Russia off from the system, suggesting that while all options were on the table, such a move could create more problems than it would solve.

But behind the scenes, American officials were pressing European allies to give some kind of indication to Mr. Putin that Europe was moving toward greater economic isolation of his country.

Moreover, because SWIFT is a European organization, the United States has been allowing European countries to take the lead on the issue. The only unilateral lever that the United States could use would be to impose sanctions, or threaten them, on the SWIFT organization itself if it continued to transmit messages for Russian institutions.

Some experts on sanctions have argued that barring Russian financial institutions from SWIFT is overblown as a tool for punishing Russia, saying that strict sanctions on the country’s banks will have the same effect.

But others have argued that blocking Russian institutions from the system would deal a blow to the country’s financial sector and that barring only a handful of banks does not go far enough.

“A targeted cutoff would not achieve what is needed,” said Marshall S. Billingslea, who was the assistant Treasury secretary for terrorist financing in the Trump administration. “They’ll simply reorganize the banking sector to put somebody else forward. The much more straightforward approach is to simply detach SWIFT from all of the Russian financial institutions.”

Russian troops bore down on Ukraine’s capital Friday (Saturday AEDT) while the president grimly predicted that the conflict would soon intensify and fears of wider war in Europe triggered new international efforts to make Moscow stop, including direct sanctions on President Vladimir Putin.

Amid reports of hundreds of casualties — including shelling that sliced through a Kyiv apartment building and pummeled bridges and schools — there also were growing signs that Russia may be seeking to overthrow Ukraine’s government, which US officials have described as Putin’s ultimate objective. It would be his boldest effort yet to redraw the world map and revive Moscow’s Cold War-era influence.

His country fending off explosions and gunfire, Ukraine President Volodomyr Zelensky appealed for a cease-fire and warned in a bleak statement that multiple cities were under attack.

“This night they will storm,” he said.

For their part, US defence officials believe the Russian offensive has encountered considerable resistance and is proceeding slower than Moscow had envisioned, though that could change quickly.

The Kremlin accepted Kyiv’s offer to hold talks, but it appeared to be an effort to squeeze concessions out of the embattled Zelensky instead of a gesture toward a diplomatic solution. Ukraine nonetheless remains “ready to discuss a cease-fire and peace,” said Zelensky spokesman Sergii Nikiforov.

The Russian military continued its advance, laying claim Friday to the southern Ukraine city of Melitopol. Still, it was unclear in the fog of war how much of Ukraine is still under Ukrainian control and how much or little Russian forces have seized.

As fighting persisted, Ukraine’s military reported shooting down an II-76 Russian transport plane carrying paratroopers near Vasylkiv, a city 40 kilometres south of Kyiv, an account confirmed by a senior American intelligence official. It was unclear how many were on board. Transport planes can carry up to 125 paratroopers.

The US and other global powers slapped ever-tougher sanctions on Russia as the invasion reverberated through the world’s economy and energy supplies, threatening to further hit ordinary households. UN officials said millions could flee Ukraine. Sports leagues moved to punish Russia and even the popular Eurovision song contest banned it from the May finals in Italy.

Through it all, Russia remained unbowed, vetoing a UN Security Council resolution demanding that it stop attacking Ukraine and withdraw troops immediately.

NATO, meanwhile, decided to send parts of the alliance’s response force to help protect its member nations in the east for the first time. NATO did not say how many troops would be deployed but added that it would involve land, sea and air power.

Day Two of Russia’s invasion, the largest ground war in Europe since World War II, focused on the Ukrainian capital, where Associated Press reporters heard explosions starting before dawn and gunfire was reported in several areas.

After 8 pm, a large boom was heard near Maidan Nezalezhnosti, the square in central Kyiv that was the heart of protests which led to the 2014 ouster of a Kremlin-friendly president. The cause was not immediately known.

Five explosions struck near a major power plant on Kyiv’s eastern outskirts, said Mayor Vitaly Klitschko. There was no information on what caused them, and no electrical outages were immediately reported.

Russia’s military said it seized a strategic airport outside Kyiv, allowing it to quickly build up forces to take the capital. It claimed to have already cut the city off from the west — the direction taken by many to escape the invasion — leading to lines of cars snaking toward the Polish border.

It was unclear how many people overall had died. Ukrainian officials reported at least 137 deaths on their side from the first full day of fighting and claimed hundreds on the Russian one. Russian authorities released no casualty figures.

UN officials reported 25 civilian deaths, mostly from shelling and airstrikes, and said that 100,000 people were believed to have left their homes, estimating up to 4 million could flee if the fighting escalates.

Zelensky tweeted that he and US President Joe Biden spoke by phone and discussed “strengthening sanctions, concrete defence assistance and an antiwar coalition,” adding that he was grateful for Washington’s support.

His whereabouts were kept secret after telling European leaders in a call Thursday night that he was Russia’s No. 1 target — and that they might not see him again alive. His office later released a video of him standing with senior aides outside the presidential office, saying he and other government officials would stay in the capital.

“All of us are here protecting our independence of our country,” Zelensky said. “And it will continue to be this way. Glory to our defenders, glory to Ukraine, glory to heroes.”

A US defence official said a Russian amphibious assault was underway, and thousands of Russian forces were moving ashore from the Sea of Azov, west of Mariupol. The official said Ukrainian air defences have been degraded but are still operating, and that about a third of the combat power that Russia had massed around Ukraine is now inside the country. The official estimated Russia had fired more than 200 missiles into Ukraine, with some hitting residential areas.

A senior American intelligence official with direct knowledge of current intelligence assessments told AP that Russian armor is 50 kilometres to both the north and west of Kyiv.

At the Pentagon, press secretary John Kirby said the US believes the offensive, including its advance on Kiev, has gone more slowly than Moscow had planned, noting that Ukraine forces have been fighting back.

The head of Britain's MI6 Secret Intelligence Service has said he believes Russia's war in Ukraine will prove 'unwinnable' because President Vladimir Putin will never attain political victory over the country's people.

Richard Moore, the chief of MI6, wrote how a report suggesting Putin's forces will ultimately fail in Ukraine because it underestimated its neighbour's military strength and fierce determination 'makes sense to me'.

The article Moore, 58, was reacting to was penned by Lawrence Freedman, the Emeritus Professor of War Studies at King's College London.

In the article titled 'A Reckless Gamble', Professor Freedman said Putin had 'become obsessed with Ukraine, and prone to outrageous theories which appear as pretexts for war but may also reflect his views.'

He wrote that victory for Moscow does not come in the form of a successful invasion that overthrows Ukraine's government, but with winning over the people of Ukraine.

This, the professor writes, is something Russia does not have the strength for.

'Even if the government loses control of the capital and is forced to flee, and the command systems for Ukrainian forces start to break down, that does not mean that Russia has won the war,' he wrote.

In an unusual move for the chief of MI6, Moore shared the article with his over 130,000 Twitter followers, writing: 'Fascinating. Makes sense to me.'

In a rebuke of Putin's human rights record, Moore also wrote around the same time in a separate tweet: 'With the tragedy and destruction unfolding so distressingly in Ukraine, we should remember the values and hard-won freedoms that distinguish us from Putin, none more than LGBT+ rights.'

Moore's endorsement of the article came as other intelligence sources claimed Putin's war with Ukraine is not going to plan due to Kremlin 'overconfidence', poor tactical planning, and 'shock' at the fierce resistance put up by brave Ukrainians fighting for their nation's survival.

Dramatic video on Saturday showed a destroyed Russian convoy with Z-markings near Kherson in the south of the country on the third day of fighting after Ukraine's army held control of Kyiv and last night successfully repelled Russian advances on the capital.

In addition to the video of the destroyed convoy, another video purportedly showed the destruction of a 20-vehicle Russia military column in Kharkiv.

Images of the carnage is the snow - from which it is suspected there were no survivors - appear to show Putin's invasion suffering brutal losses.

Kyiv's defence ministry has so far put Russia's losses at around 2,800 troops, 80 tanks, 516 armoured vehicles, and 10 airplanes and seven helicopters so far.

The Russian army has now been ordered to broaden its advance 'from all directions', with Kyiv residents braced Saturday for another night sheltering underground, as Russian troops closed in on the capital and skirmishes were reported on the outskirts.

However, a senior US defence officials claimed Russia is facing more resistance than Moscow anticipated in its invasion of Ukraine, and appears to have lost some of its momentum.

Professor Freedman's article backed this theory. He wrote: 'Despite the superiority of Russian forces they made less progress than might have been expected on the first day of the war when they had the advantages of tactical surprise and potentially overwhelming numbers.

'The Ukrainians demonstrated a spirited resistance and imposed casualties on the invaders,' he added.

Meanwhile, Ukraine's military is asking people to remove the names of streets, cities and villages from road signs in their regions in order to 'confuse and disorient the enemy'. In a tweet, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence said: 'We will do everything possible to clear Ukraine of the Russian occupier as soon as possible!'.

A sign over a part of the Boryspil highway triumphantly declared: 'Russian warship, go f**k yourself!', in reference to the killing of a small group of Ukrainian border guards stationed at Snake Island off the coast of Ukraine after they refused to surrender to Kremlin forces.

Estonia's former defence chief Riho Terras has now claimed that Putin's war is not going to plan because Russia is fast running out of money and weapons, and will have to enter negotiations with Volodymyr Zelensky's government if Kyiv holds off the Russians for 10 days.

Russia's tyrant has allegedly convened a meeting with the oligarchs in a bunker in the Ural Mountains, at which it is claimed that he furiously vented that he thought the war would be 'easy' and 'everything would be done in one to four days'.

Citing Ukrainian intelligence sources, Terras claimed that the war is costing Russia around £15billion-per-day, and that they have rockets for three to four days at most, which they are using sparingly.

He claimed that Putin's plan has relied on panicking the country, firing missiles at residential buildings 'at random' to 'intimidate' the Ukrainians, trigger mass army desertions, national surrender, and Zelensky's flight from the country. Terras also alleged that Russian special operations have been near Kyiv since February 18, and had planned to swiftly seize the capital and install a puppet regime.

'The Russians are in shock of the fierce resistance they have encountered. The Ukrainians must avoid panic! ... Ukraine must stay strong and we must provide assistance!', he wrote on Twitter.

However, in a worrying sign for Ukraine, video from Russia's Western border with Ukraine showed TOS-1 heavy flamethrower tanks moving towards its neighbour. The tanks are capable of firing high-power thermobaric weapons - dubbed the 'father of all bombs'.

In Russian, 'TOS' stands for 'heavy flame thrower'. However, what the TOS-1 launches is perhaps even more frightening - fuel-air explosives (FAE) that cause a 'wall of napalm'. As the bomb explodes, it scatters dust that ignites when it meets oxygen, causing the very air around it to appear as if it is bursting into flames.

Russia's Interfax news agency claimed Moscow had captured the southeastern city of Melitopol. Ukrainian officials were not immediately available to comment on the fate of Melitopol. If the Interfax report about Melitopol, which cited Russia's defence ministry, is confirmed, it would be the first significant population centre that the Kremlin has seized.

However, Britain's armed forces minister James Heappey cast doubt on the report, saying the city of some 150,000 people was still in Ukrainian hands and that fighting in the capital was so far confined to 'very isolated pockets of Russian special forces and paratroopers' and that 'the main armoured columns approaching Kyiv are still some way off'.

The Ukrainian health minister said 198 people have been killed and more than 1,000 wounded in the Russian offensive. Viktor Lyashko said there were three children among those killed.

His statement was unclear whether the casualties included military and civilians. He said another 1,115 people, including 33 children, were wounded in the Russian invasion.

It was later reported that a further 19 civilians were killed in shelling in Ukraine's east, while two were reported killed in a strike on a tower block early on Saturday - bringing the civilian death toll to 219.

Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov claimed Saturday that since the start of Moscow's attack, its military had hit 821 Ukrainian military facilities, 87 tanks and other targets.

Konashenkov didn't say how many Ukrainian troops were killed and didn't mention any casualties on the Russian side. Neither his claims nor Ukraine's allegations that its forces killed thousands of Kremlin troops could be independently verified.

HOW IS PUTIN'S WAR NOT GOING TO PLAN?

MONEY

According to Ukrainian intelligence sources, Putin's war with Ukraine is costing the Russian economy around £15billion-per-day alone – meaning the Kremlin will have spent around £45billion by the end of today in fighting Ukraine.

Writing on Twitter, Terras claimed that Russia would be forced to enter negotiations with Ukraine if Kyiv can hold off the Kremlin's advance for 10 days, by which point Russia will have spent around £150billion.

Though it is widely believed that the Russian dictator will have factored Western sanctions into his calculations, the combined effect of punitive measures on Russia's banking system will further squeeze its economy.

The United States, Britain, Japan, Canada, Australia and the European Union unveiled more sanctions on Moscow on top of penalties earlier this week, including a move by Germany to halt a gas pipeline from Russia.

President Joe Biden delivered further measures to target Russian banks, oligarchs and high-tech sectors, while the EU unveiled its own new package including financial, energy and technological sanctions.

WEAPONS AND RESOURCES

Citing Ukrainian intelligence, Terras also claimed that Russia has rockets for 'three to four days at most' which they use 'sparingly'.

He added: 'They lack weapons, the Tula and 2 Rotenberg plants can't physically fulfil the orders for weapons. Rifles and ammo are the most they can do.

'The next Russian weapons can be produced in 3-4 months – if even that. They have no raw materials. What was previously supplied mainly from Slovenia, Finland and Germany is now cut off.

'If Ukraine manages to hold the Russians off for 10 days, then the Russians will have to enter negotiations. Because they have no money, weapons, or resources'.

OVERCONFIDENCE

Terras also claimed that at a meeting of the oligarchs in his lair in the Urals, Putin was 'furious' and ranted about how he thought the war would be 'easily' won in 'one to four days'.

He continued: 'Russia's whole plan relies on panic – that the civilians and armed forces surrender and Zelensky flees.

'They expect Kharkiv to surrender first so the other cities would follow suit to avoid bloodshed. The Russians are in shock of the fierce resistance they have encountered'.

WHAT'S THE STATE OF PLAY TODAY?

HELICOPTERS, JETS AND PLANES

The mayor of a city south of the Ukrainian capital claimed that the country's military has fended off a Russian attempt to take control of a military air base.

Natalia Balansynovych, the mayor of Vasylkiv, about 25 miles south of Kyiv, said on Saturday that Russian airborne forces landed near the city overnight and tried to seize the base. She said fierce fighting also raged on Vasylkiv's central street.

She said that Ukrainian forces repelled the Russian attacks, and that the situation is now calm. Balansynovych claimed there were heavy casualties, but didn't give any numbers.

At around 3am on Saturday, fighting between Russia and Ukraine broke out at Vasylkiv, which is home to a Cold War-era base.

Ukraine's military claimed a Russian IL-76 military transporter planer was brought down, reportedly with 150 paratroopers on board. Sources in the city then claimed that Russian soldiers, allegedly dressed as Ukrainian police, ambushed a checkpoint.

Heavy fighting ensued in Vasylkiv, as Putin's forces tried to gain a foothold in the south from which to launch their attack on Kyiv.

At around 4am, Ukraine's Defence Ministry claimed 'two enemy targets were shot down' – identifying them as a Russian SU-25 helicopter and a military bomber – near the separatist zone in the east.

At around 4am, a second Russian military transport plane was shot down near Bila Tserkva, 50 miles south of Kyiv, according to two American officials with direct knowledge of conditions on the ground in Ukraine. The Russian military did not comment on either plane.

Ukraine's State Security Service (SBU) denied a report earlier on Saturday that Russian helicopters had landed in the Lviv region, a development that would have signalled a widening of the theatre of Moscow's invasion.

The mayor of Lviv, Andriy Sadovyi, said Russia had landed three helicopters near the city of Brody in the western Lviv region and that Ukrainian forces had repelled the attack.

The SBU said the information was false and that no such landing had taken place. It said a Ukrainian helicopter had done a reconnaissance flight in the area.

'We ask residents to remain calm!', the SBU said in a statement posted on Facebook.

Sadovyi's office declined to comment and the SBU declined further comment. The Lviv regional administration said that footage circulating on social media of a helicopter firing rockets in the Lviv region was Ukrainian, not Russian.

GROUND FORCES

Earlier, small arms fire and explosions were heard in the capital's northern district Obolonsky as what appeared to be an advance party of Russia's invasion force left a trail of destruction.

Ukrainian forces reported fighting with Russian armoured units in two locations between 40-80 kilometres north of Kyiv.

Ukraine's military claimed Russia had 'attacked one of the military units on Victory Avenue in Kyiv' but that the assault had been 'repulsed'. It also reported another incident northwest of the capital.

Kyiv said 137 people, including soldiers and civilians, have been killed during the fighting, and claimed that 2,800 Russian service personnel have died.

An adviser to Ukraine's president says that fighting is raging in the capital and in the country's south, and that the Ukrainian military is successfully fending off Russian assaults.

Russian forces were also focusing on the country's south, where intense fighting is underway in Kherson just north of Crimea, and in the Black Sea ports of Mykolaiv, Odesa and around Mariupol, it was claimed.

Mykhailo Podolyak said that Russia considers it a priority to seize the south, but it has failed to make any significant gains.

Britain claimed that Russian forces have not captured the south-eastern Ukrainian city of Melitopol and armoured columns advancing on the capital Kyiv have been held up by Ukrainian resistance.

Armed forces minister James Heappey said on Saturday it was the British assessment that Russia had so far failed to capture any of its day one targets for its invasion of Ukraine, which began on Thursday.

'Even Melitopol, which the Russians are claiming to have taken but we can't see anything to substantiate that, are all still in Ukrainian hands,' Heappey told BBC radio.

'The fighting ... reported on the outskirts of Kyiv overnight, we understand to just be Russian special forces and pockets of paratroopers. The reality is that the armoured columns that were coming down from Belarus and the north that were going to encircle Kyiv are still some way north because they've been held up by this incredible Ukrainian resistance.'

Russian missiles pounded Kyiv on Friday, families cowered in shelters and authorities told residents to prepare Molotov cocktails to defend Ukraine's capital from an assault that the mayor said had already begun with saboteurs in the city.

But an American official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, suggested a mixed picture for the Russian effort to press an offensive that Washington and Kyiv say is aimed at decapitating the government and installing a puppet regime.

'We do assess that there is greater resistance by the Ukrainians than the Russians expected,' the senior defence official said, adding Ukraine's command and control of its military 'remains intact'.

'They are not moving on Kyiv as fast as what we believe they anticipated they would be able to do. That said, they continue to try to move on Kyiv.'

Still, Russia has not yet mobilized the majority of its forces arrayed around Ukraine, the official said, assessing that just about one-third have now been 'committed' to its offensive.

Although most of the Russian targeting has been against Ukrainian military installations, some of the missiles have landed on civilian residential areas, the official said.

Ukraine's military was putting up a fight, the official added.

'They are fighting for the country,' the official said, noting that Russia had yet to establish control of the airspace above Ukraine or used the extent of its electronic warfare capabilities. 'In general, the Russians have lost a little bit of their momentum,' the official said.

RUSSIA'S ACTIONS

Kyiv officials are warning residents that street fighting is underway against Russian forces, and they are urging people to seek shelter.

The warning issued Saturday advised residents to remain in shelters, to avoid going near windows or on balconies, and to take precautions against being hit by debris or bullets.

The Ukrainian military said a battle was underway near a military unit to the west of the city center.

A rescue worker says at least six civilians were injured by a rocket that hit a high-rise apartment building on the outskirts of the Ukrainian capital.

Petro Prokopov, a firefighter who was taking part in rescue efforts, said the building on the southwestern edge of Kyiv near Zhuliany airport was hit between 16 and 21 floors on Saturday. He said at least six people were injured and apartments on two floors were gutted by fire. Emergency responders have evacuated 80 people.

AFP saw a dead man in civilian clothes lying sprawled on the pavement as nearby medics rushed to help another man whose car was crushed by an armoured vehicle.

Separately, Ukraine's Infrastructure Ministry said a Russian missile was shot down before dawn Saturday as it headed for the dam of the sprawling water reservoir that serves Kyiv.

'If the dam is destroyed, the flooding will cause catastrophic casualties and losses – including flooding of residential areas of Kyiv and its suburbs,' the ministry said.

Marine who blew himself up to destroy a bridge and halt advancing Russian troops is made a 'Hero of Ukraine' - the country's highest honour Volodmyr Zelensky has declared a marine who blew himself up along with a bridge near Crimea to repel advancing Russian forces a Hero of Ukraine. According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Vitaly Shakun was manning the Henichesk bridge in the Kherson region when Kremlin troops advanced and the battalion decided the only way to stop them was to blow up the bridge. It was mined, and Shakun had no time to get out. He texted them and told them he was going to blow up the bridge. Seconds later, they heard an explosion, a post on their Facebook page said. Shakun's efforts dramatically slowed down the Russian advance and allowed his comrades to regroup and re-deploy, the Ukrainian General Staff added. Zelensky has now made Shakun a Hero of Ukraine, the highest national title that can be conferred upon an individual citizen by the country's president.

This image was shared by Ukrainian state news agency Ukrinform on Thursday A post on the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine's Facebook page detailed his heroic efforts In an emotional speech to the besieged nation uploaded to Facebook, the Ukrainian President also accused Moscow of attempting to seize Kyiv, overthrow the government and install a 'puppet' regime 'like in Donetsk', one of two separatist regions which warmonger Vladimir Putin officially recognised before launching an all-out invasion. Declaring 'we derailed their idea', Zelensky added: 'The fights are going on in many cities and areas of our state. But we know that we are protecting the country, the land, the future of our children. Kyiv and key cities around the capital are controlled by our army. 'The [Russian] occupants wanted to block the centre of our state and put here their marionette, like in Donetsk. We derailed their idea.' Zelensky pushed for Ukraine's urgent ascension to the European Union, saying he discussed the issue with the EU leaders. He also urged cutting Russia from the SWIFT international electronic bank payment system, noting that Germany and Hungary should show 'courage' and agree to the move. Briefly switching to Russian, he claimed that thousands of Kremlin troops were killed and hundreds of those who were taken prisoner 'can't understand why they were sent into Ukraine to kill and get killed'. Thanking Russians who spoke out against the war and asked them to keep up the pressure on the Kremlin, he said: 'The sooner you say to your government that this war should be immediately stopped, the more of your people will stay alive.'

COULD RUSSIA LOSE THE WAR?

Despite Western fears, American officials believe that Putin's assault and attempted seizure of Kyiv has become bogged down.

While Russian special forces have reached the suburbs of Kyiv, the bulk of Moscow's heavy armour is believed to be still more than 30 miles away from the capital.

Britain claimed that Russia's invasion of Ukraine has been slowed by strong Ukrainian resistance.

Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said fighting in Kyiv was so far confined to 'very isolated pockets of Russian special forces and paratroopers'. He added that 'the main armored columns approaching Kyiv are still some way off'.

Heappey said: 'It looks like the Russian plan is nowhere near running to schedule. I think that will be a great cause of concern for President Putin and rather points to the fact that there was a lot of hubris in the Russian plan and that he may be awfully advised.'

However, Western officials fear that Putin could resort to high-power thermobaric weapons – dubbed the 'father of all bombs' that vaporize bodies and crush internal organs – as brave Ukrainians resist his attempts to take control of Kyiv.

Thermobaric weapons – also known as vacuum bombs – are high-powered explosive that use the atmosphere itself as part of the explosion. They are among the most powerful non-nuclear weapons ever developed.

A thermobaric bomb dropped by the US on Taliban in Afghanistan in 2017 weighed 21,600 pounds and left a crater more than 1,000ft wide after it exploded six feet above the ground.

Thermobaric weapons were developed by both the US and the Soviet Union in the 1960s. In 2007, Russia detonated the largest thermobaric weapon ever made, which created an explosion equivalent to 39.9 tons. The US version of the weapon reportedly costs over $16million each.

The official said: 'My fear would be that if they don't meet their timescale and objectives they would be indiscriminate in their use of violence.

'They don't adhere to the same principles of necessity and proportionality and rule of law that Western forces do.'

'Will we declare war on Russia? No': Armed Forces Minister James Heappey insists NATO troops will not be sent in to Ukraine as he admits 'ultimate economic sanction' of removing Russia from the SWIFT system will require 'further diplomacy' NATO troops will not set foot in the Ukrainian theatre of war as Britain presses ahead with its plans to enact the 'ultimate economic sanction' and boot Russia out of the SWIFT international payment network. Armed Forces Minister James Heappey warned that any further financial penalties were being held up in the courts and reiterated the Government's desire to see Russia expelled from the international SWIFT banking system. Speaking during his media round of interviews on Saturday morning, Mr Heappey also stopped short of committing sending NATO troops to fight in Ukraine. 'You're asking me if we will declare war on Russia? No,' was his answer when pressed by veteran journalist Martha Kearney on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Armed Forces Minister James Heappey reiterated NATO troops will not be entering the Ukrainian theatre of war Pictured: Ukrainian soldiers walk around debris of burning military trucks in a street in Kyiv, Ukraine, Saturday, February 26 In later comments to the BBC, Mr Heappey said the Government's position on removing Russia from the international SWIFT financial servers was clear. 'The reality is that SWIFT is not a unilateral decision the UK can take. If it were, the Government's position is clear and we will push ahead with every means at our disposal. 'Clearly, it's the ultimate economic sanction. It's the one the UK government wants to see enacted.' It was also revealed that the Government will continue to supply arms in its efforts to aid the Ukrainian's attempt to repel the Russian invasion and the Ministry of Defence is working on plans to potentially support a resistance movement and a government in exile if Ukraine was finally overrun. Warning that the Ukrainian conflict could last for months to come, Mr Heappey added: 'Nobody should think that this is anywhere near over. 'What stands in front of Ukraine, its armed forces and very tragically its people, is days, weeks, months more of what we have seen over that last 48 hours'. Advertisement

Ukraine's SECOND Tiananmen moment: Local man climbs on top of Russian tank before kneeling on the ground in bid to stop military convoy as Putin's men face fierce fight back on the streets

Another brave Ukrainian local has been captured on video trying to single-highhandedly block the advance of a Russian military convoy - in scenes reminiscent of Tiananmen Square's 'tank man' blocking Chinese forces in 1989.

The footage emerged as Moscow's forces continued their illegal invasion of the country, where Ukrainian soldiers and citizens alike are putting up a fierce resistance against Vladimir Putin's invading army.

Video of the brave face-off showed a column of Russian tanks passing through a junction in a Ukrainian town.

As the hulking vehicles rumbled through, one man decided to take a stand, heroically climbing on to the front of one of the tanks. It continued forward a few meters, but then came to a halt, blocking the route of those following.

Once the tank was no longer moving, the man can be seen climbing down from the tank and kneeling in the middle of the road, blocking the progress of the Russian convoy.

Recognising the futility of the man's protest, onlookers are seen trying to drag the man away from the tank.

However, defiant in his protest, the man continues to hold on to the front of the tank.

The incident came after a similar confrontation went viral on Friday, which saw another man bravely walk into the middle of the road and into the path of another column of Russian military vehicles passing through Ukraine.

The footage, thought to have been filmed in the south of the country close to Crimea, shows the man bravely waving down the convoy in an attempt to block its path.

Some military vehicles in the procession swerve around the man, but others are shown stopping for him, bringing those behind them to a complete stop as well.

The man has since been dubbed 'Tank Man' on social media, and while his identity is now known, his bravery quickly drew praise from others inspired by his protest which has become emblematic of Ukraine's resistance.

Cargo ship 'belonging to Russian bank that is pivotal' to country's defence sector and among those targeted by UK government sanctions against Moscow is SEIZED in the English Channel

A cargo ship bound for St. Petersburg was intercepted in the English Channel early on Saturday as the latest trade sanctions begin to hit at the Russian economy.

The 416ft commercial boat named the 'Baltic Leader' is understood to belong to Promsvyazbank, one of the five major Russian banks which were hit with crippling EU sanctions this week, and was seized in the English Channel early on Saturday morning.

Promsvyazbank was named in the House of Commons as one of five Russian state-owned financial institutions that would be hit with sanctions.

Meanwhile, a US Treasury document said 'Baltic Leader' was owned by Promsvyazbank, which was described as 'systemically important' to Russia's defence industry.

Maritime officers have been given the power to intercept and seize vessels suspected of contravening EU-backed sanctions of Russia in the wake of the Ukrainian invasion.

In what is understood to be the first instance of Russian assets being frozen while in transit, the boat was intercepted by customs officials near Honfleur, in Normandy, after departing from the French city of Rouen.

'Baltic Leader' departed from the French city of Rouen on Friday, February 25 before it was intercepted by French maritime officials and diverted to Boulogne-sur-Mer port in Normandy at around 3am local time (2am GMT)

Pictured: The cargo ship impounded in the port of Boulogne-sur-Mer, France on Saturday, February 26

French authorities said the ship, which has been loaded with cars, belonged to a company suspected of violating trade sanctions linked to the ongoing war in Ukraine.

'Baltic Leader' had arrived in the French city of Rouen on February 19 and spent almost six days docked there until departing on Friday night.

The vessel had been expected to reach St. Petersburg on Thursday, March 3.

Captain Véronique Magnin, regional communication officer for the maritime prefecture, said the ship was then diverted to the French port of Boulogne-sur-Mer between 3 and 4am (2/3am GMT) and that ongoing checks were being carried out by customs officials.

Those aboard 'Baltic Leader' are said to be co-operating with the investigation. The process could take up to 48 hours.

Captain Magnin said the boat is 'strongly suspected of being linked to Russian interests targeted by the sanctions'.

One official was quoted by the BBC saying: 'It has been taken to the French port after a request by the French government because it is suspected of belonging to a company targeted by EU sanctions against Moscow.

'French boarder forces are currently investigating the cargo ship. Crew aboard the 'Baltic Leader' has been cooperating with French authorities.'

The Russian embassy in France is said to be 'seeking explanations' from French authorities behind the seizure of one of its cargo ships.

Ukraine is today battling to keep control of its capital as US intelligence warns that Russia is hoping a lightning assault on the city is the quickest way to end the war and hand control of the country back to Moscow.

Intelligence sources, briefing journalists in the early hours of Friday, outlined what they believe the Russian battle plan to be - beginning with columns of armour and troops rolling into the city from the north and east.

The goal would be to surround Kyiv, besiege it, then capture one of two intact airfields - Sikorsky or Boryspilsia - which are located close to the centre of the city and on its eastern outskirts.

Once the airports are secured, a force of 10,000 Russian paratroopers would be flown in on Ilyushin Il-76 military transport planes backed by Beriev A-50 aircraft providing communications support.

The paratroopers would then be tasked with leading an assault on the city proper, with the goal being to locate and capture President Volodymyr Zelensky, his ministers and parliamentarians and force them to sign a peace deal. The deal would hand control of the country back to Russia, or a Moscow-backed puppet regime.

Such an attack could be coupled with an assault from the south and east - Crimea and the Donbass - to keep Ukrainian army units fighting there pinned down, stopping them from reinforcing the capital.

Sabotage attacks against Kyiv's power grid, along with bombing missions, could also be used to sow panic and get people to flee - clogging up roads and making it difficult for forces already in the city to move around.

Russian battle plans to take Kyiv and force an early end to the war in Ukraine have been revealed by US intelligence, who say troops and armour would be used to capture airfields, before a force of 10,000 paratroopers would be flown in to capture the city, round up the government, and force them to sign a peace deal handing control of the country back to Russia

Ukrainian national guard were forming up on Kyiv's streets Friday as they prepared to defend the city from a Russian assault, shortly before heavy gunfire and explosions were heard

US intelligence sources relayed the plan to American author Michael Weiss, while several Ukrainian sources also briefed journalists in the country of the plan on Friday morning.

It is thought Russia tried to pull off the plan on the first day of fighting, when around 20 helicopters landed a crack team of troops at Antonov Airprort - around 15 miles from the city centre.

After a fierce day of back-and-forth fighting, Ukrainian national guard troops announced they had retaken the airfield late Thursday evening. The runway has now been deliberately destroyed, rendering the airfield unusable.

A second attempt at putting the plan into action appeared to be underway Friday, with Russian armour fighting 20 miles north of the city in the early hours.

That was followed by reports of Russian troops entering the north-western outskirts, before national guard units were pictured deploying with rifles on to the streets - with explosions and gunfire heard soon afterwards.

Reports then started to emerge of power-cuts in certain parts of the capital, along with fighting on the road leading to Sikorsky Airport.

Another column of Russian armour was advancing on the city from the east, but was held up after running into heavy resistance around the town of Chernihiv. The force is now thought to have diverted around the city by capturing Konotop, providing them with another route into the capital.

'The hardest day will be today. The enemy's plan is to break through with tank columns from the side of Ivankiv and Chernihiv to Kyiv,' Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko said on Telegram.

As the Russian noose tightened around Kyiv, President Joe Biden and NATO allies sought to reassure member countries on the alliance's eastern flank that their security is guaranteed as Russia's large-scale invasion of Ukraine closes in on the capital Kyiv.

With Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appealing for help, NATO members ranging from Russia's neighbor Estonia in the north down around the west of conflict-hit Ukraine to Bulgaria on the Black Sea coast triggered urgent consultations about their security. Only Hungary refrained.

The leaders, meeting via videoconference, plan to take stock of NATO's own military buildup. The world's biggest security organization previously had around 5,000 troops stationed in the Baltic countries - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - and Poland, but has significantly beefed up its defenses over the last three months.

'Make no mistake, we will defend every ally against any attack on every inch of NATO territory,' NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, who will chair the summit, told reporters Thursday. 'An attack on one ally will trigger a response from the whole alliance.'

Some of NATO's 30 member countries are supplying arms, ammunition and other equipment to Ukraine, but NATO as an organization isn't. It won't launch any military action in support of Ukraine, which is a close partner but has no prospect of joining.

The Baltic members, however, have said the West should 'urgently provide Ukrainian people with weapons, ammunition and any other kind of military support to defend itself as well as economic, financial and political assistance and support, humanitarian aid.'

NATO began beefing up its defenses in northeastern Europe after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014. Recently, some members have also sent troops, aircraft and warships to the Black Sea region, near allies Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey.

Short-term, NATO has activated an emergency planning system to allow commanders to move forces more quickly. The Pentagon said Thursday that it is sending 7,000 troops to Europe in addition to 5,000 recently deployed personnel.

NATO surveillance aircraft have begun patrols inside allied territory. The planes would be able to watch Russian fighter jet and transport movements inside Ukraine, much as they monitored aircraft in Syria from Turkey's airspace.

The leaders are likely to consider Friday whether to activate the NATO Response Force, which can number up to 40,000 troops. A quickly deployable land brigade that is part of the NRF - made up of 5,000 troops and run by France alongside Germany, Poland, Portugal and Spain - is already on heightened alert.

Lithuania declared a state of emergency Thursday after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered troops into Ukraine. Lithuania borders Russia's Kaliningrad region to the southwest, Belarus to the east, Latvia to the north and Poland to the south.

8,ed5aa4fb-77df-4ac0-857a-3d64f446a623,['W.J. Hennigan'],,"The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has for the first time activated a military response force designed to boost the defenses of frontline nations in eastern Europe that feel vulnerable after Russia’s military assault on Ukraine.

Gen. Tod Wolters, NATO’s Supreme Allied Commander and the top U.S. military officer in Europe, said the multinational force consisting of land, air, sea and special operations troops intended to deter Russia from further aggression.

“This is an historic moment,” Wolters said in a statement. “These deterrence measures are prudent and enhance our speed, responsiveness and capability to shield and protect the one billion citizens we swore to protect.”

The first-time activation of thousands of NATO troops in Europe represents the latest escalation in a volatile ground war that has no modern precedent. In recent months, U.S. and European allies have increased air-policing missions over allied nations and moved troops, naval ships and heavy weaponry eastward on the continent, near where the Russian military is operating.

Ukraine is not a NATO member, but it borders four nations that are: Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania. The U.S. and other NATO allies have pledged to protect their eastern and central European members under the alliance’s defining Article 5 mutual defense commitments.

President Joe Biden has repeatedly insisted U.S. troops will not fight in Ukraine, but he has redoubled defenses in surrounding countries by moving roughly 14,000 troops eastward in Europe during the past three weeks. Washington has also provided about $650 million in military aid to the pro-Western government.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Friday he received commitments to provide additional equipment, including air defense systems, to Ukraine after leaders from the 30-member alliance held a virtual meeting. “We see rhetoric, the messages, which is strongly indicating that [Russia’s] aim is to remove the democratically-elected government in Kyiv,” he told reporters.

The Russian military advance on Kyiv is going slower than U.S. intelligence anticipated, a senior U.S. defense official said Friday, with Ukrainian forces showing stiff resistance.

“The Russians have lost a little bit of their momentum,” the official said. “They are not advancing as far or as fast as we believe they expected they would. A good indicator of that is no population centers have been taken. We also assess that Russia has yet to achieve air superiority over Ukraine.”

Despite fears that the Ukrainian military would crumble under the combat power Russia continues to pour into the country, Ukrainian command and control remains intact. Air missile defense systems are still working even though installations were destroyed by Russia’s opening salvos, and Ukrainian fighter jets continue to engage Russian warplanes, the U.S. official said.

Russia has yet to commit most of its forces to the assault, the official cautioned, with only about a third of the more than 150,000 troops amassed on Ukraine’s borders moving in so far. Russia launched an amphibious assault Friday on the port city of Mariupol, located on the Sea of Azov. “Indications are right now that they are putting potentially thousands of naval infantry ashore there,” the official said.

Explosions continue to rock several Ukrainian cities, including the capital Kyiv, in what the Pentagon believes is the first phase of a Russian “decapitation” strategy aimed at toppling the President Volodymir Zelensky’s government. More than 200 missiles have pummeled weapons depots, military installations and other targets, the Pentagon said.

Amnesty International said Friday that Russia’s invasion has been marked by indiscriminate attacks on civilian areas and strikes on protected targets such as hospitals. Amnesty issued a report that documented three incidents estimated to have killed at least six civilians and injured at least 12. “The Russian military has shown a blatant disregard for civilian lives by using ballistic missiles and other explosive weapons with wide area effects in densely populated areas,” said Agnès Callamard, the nonprofit’s secretary general.

At least 137 Ukrainians were killed and more than 300 injured on the first day of the invasion, Zelensky said Thursday evening. Thirteen border guards were killed Thursday on Snake Island, a 42-acre scrap of land in the Black Sea, near Romania, according to an audio recording reported by the Ukrainian news outlet Ukrayinska Pravda. Russia’s navy is heard imploring the unit to give up over radio communications. “Lay down your arms and surrender to avoid bloodshed and unnecessary deaths,” a Russian officer said. “Otherwise, you will be bombed.”

The reply from the Ukraine’s border guards was simple: “Russian warship, go f–k yourself.” Moments later, they were all killed.

9:35 p.m. Over three months, senior Biden administration officials held half a dozen urgent meetings with top Chinese officials in which the Americans presented intelligence showing Russia’s troop buildup around Ukraine, the New York Times reports, and beseeched the Chinese to tell Russia not to invade, according to U.S. officials.

Each time, the Chinese officials, including the foreign minister and the ambassador to the United States, rebuffed the Americans, saying they did not think an invasion was in the works. After one diplomatic exchange in December, U.S. officials got intelligence showing Beijing had shared the information with Moscow, telling the Russians that the United States was trying to sow discord — and that China would not try to impede Russian plans and actions, the officials said.

The previously unreported talks between American and Chinese officials show how the Biden administration tried to use intelligence findings and diplomacy to persuade a superpower it views as a growing adversary to stop the invasion of Ukraine, and how that nation, led by President Xi Jinping, persistently sided with Russia even as the evidence of Moscow’s plans for a military offensive grew over the winter.

9:27 p.m. Ukraine braced for an all-out assault on its capital Friday, according to the New York Times, as the military blew up a bridge to slow the advance of Russian soldiers, street fights erupted in a northern district of the city, and the nation’s leaders warned residents that Russia wanted to “bring the capital to its knees.”

The moves to defend Kyiv escalated on the second day of a Russian military incursion. The fighting came as western governments imposed new sanctions, including on Russian President Vladimir Putin, tens of thousands of refugees fled the country, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appeared in a video warning that Russian forces planned to make an all-out attack and “the fate of Ukraine is now being decided.”

Russia pressed its invasion of Ukraine to the outskirts of the capital Friday after unleashing airstrikes on cities and military bases and sending in troops and tanks from three sides in an attack that could rewrite the global post-Cold War security order.

Zelenskyy warned that Russian “sabotage groups” had entered the city with the aim of “destroying the head of state.”

A U.S. Defense Department official said the Russians were “not moving on Kyiv as fast as they anticipated it going” and that, significantly, “Ukrainian command and control is intact” to direct the defense of the country. But officials warned that as of Friday morning Russia had sent into Ukraine only 30% of the 150,000 to 190,000 troops it had massed at the border.

9:11 p.m. Just over 24 hours after Russia invaded Ukraine, the Ukrainian Canadian Congress (UCC) and Stand with Ukraine committee, held an emergency rally at the Ukrainian Consulate, Friday evening.

Toronto’s Ukrainian community and its supporters gathered at Lakeshore Boulevard West, chanting protest slogans and telling sympathizers how they can help.

Alexandra Chyczij, president of the UCC’s national branch told the Star, “since the bombing started, we have seen the devastation that has been wrought upon Ukraine from the sky .... And so we’re calling upon the western allies to create a no fly-zone over Ukraine.”

8:16 p.m. It was a bittersweet moment when Beka Lomadze and his older sister Anna got their visas to resettle in Canada from Ukraine in 2019, but the siblings were hopeful their parents and two younger brothers would follow suit in the near future.

Those family members have lived since 2012 in limbo in Ukraine, where they got stuck while en route to Belgium, in which they had intended to seek asylum from religious persecution by Orthodox Christians in their native Georgia.

With the tension between Russia and Ukraine rising in the region in recent months, Lomadze and his sister were praying that the rest of their family could join them in Toronto before war started.

8:14 p.m. Thousands of refugees have streamed across the border from Ukraine to escape the Russian invasion, while several countries in eastern Europe set up reception points, anticipating rising numbers as the attacks continued unabated.

More than 10,000 people entered Romania from Ukraine within 24 hours, Romanian Interior Minister Lucian Bode said on Friday. That is more than twice as many as immediately before the invasion, he said.

Of the 10,624 Ukrainians who entered, 3,660 have since traveled on, including to Bulgaria and Hungary, the minister added. Just 11 people applied for asylum in Romania.

Slovakia registered more than 7,000 border crossings from Ukraine on the first day after the Russian invasion.

7:37 p.m. Vladimir Putin has committed several heinous crimes in invading Ukraine. What we are not hearing is that all the posturing by Joe Biden, Justin Trudeau, and other Western leaders won’t change, indeed, is not designed to change, the reality of Russian occupation of a sovereign nation and its 43 million citizens.

Sanctions could possibly have been effective had they been imposed months earlier — along with the uprooting of dirty Russian money invested in real estate in London, New York and possibly Toronto. Or, better, by letting Ukraine join NATO when Putin was still weak.

Now the sanctions will be pinpricks for the Kremlin. And perhaps prove as ineffective as the American sanctions on Cuba for the last 60 years, on Iran for 41 years, on Saddam Hussein through the 1990s, and on the Afghan Taliban in the 1990s and again since last August when they reconquered Kabul. The ever-escalating penalties made little difference to the rulers — they helped entrench them — but squeezed and starved and displaced millions of ordinary Cubans, Iranians, Iraqis and Afghans.

7:34 p.m. If the battle for Ukraine boils down to missiles versus money, it must be said that Canada will have limited impact.

The prime minister said it himself, in fact. Amidst the name-calling and the threats from our cabinet ministers to severely punish Russian President Vladimir Putin for invading Ukraine, Justin Trudeau has flatly stated that there’s only so much a middle power like Canada can do.

So let’s focus on where Canada can actually help most effectively — not in punishing Putin, but in helping Ukrainians, especially if they’re fleeing and in need of a safe haven.

The Star’s Heather Scoffield has more.

7:30 p.m. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov justifies Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on behalf of Vladimir Putin.

His daughter, Lisa Peskova, opposes it.

At least, she did for a short while on Friday when her Instagram feed bore the words, in Cyrillic, “NO WAR” — the tag line of Russians denouncing the attack on their western neighbour.

Sofia Abramovich, the daughter of Russian oligarch and Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich, did the same. An attack on Ukraine, her social media post insisted, was Putin’s twisted desire, not that of ordinary Russians.

As a fuller scope emerges of the sanctions being imposed, the borders being closed and the means of contact and communication being cut in retribution for Russia’s attack on Ukraine, an unusual thing is occurring.

The Star’s Allan Woods writes from Moscow.

7:23 p.m. (UPDATED) Russia vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution on Friday demanding that Moscow immediately stop its attack on Ukraine and withdraw all troops, a defeat the United States and its supporters knew was inevitable but said would highlight Russia’s global isolation.

The vote was 11 in favor, with Russia voting no and China, India and the United Arab Emirates abstaining, which showed significant but not total opposition to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of his country's smaller and militarily weaker neighbor.

The resolution's failure paves the way for supporters to call for a quick vote on a similar resolution in the 193-member U.N. General Assembly, where there are no vetoes. There was no immediate word on a timetable for an assembly vote.

7:09 p.m. The Biden administration wants Congress to provide $6.4 billion to pay for an initial U.S. response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with much of it for military and humanitarian assistance in the region, two people familiar with the request said Friday.

The largest portions of the money would be for the Defense and State departments and for the U.S. Agency for International Development, which distributes civilian foreign aid, one of the people said. Smaller amounts would be for the Treasury and Commerce departments, whose chief roles in the Ukraine crisis will be to apply sanctions against Russia, its financial institutions and state-owned businesses and its leaders, including President Vladimir Putin.

The request, which White House and other administration officials described to congressional aides in a conference call, provides an early look at the costs American taxpayers could bear as a result of Russia’s attack on its western neighbor. Those assaults were in their second full day Friday as Russian forces pounded Kyiv, Ukraine's capital.

6:28 p.m. A man holding signs outside of a bus window with the words “War Stop.” A woman being led away by police while clasping balloons in the colours of the Ukrainian flag. Police wrestling a protester to the ground as bystanders watch cautiously.

These were the scenes circulating in photos and videos posted to social media Thursday as thousands of Russians took to the streets in opposition to the invasion of Ukraine, prompting some media pundits to ponder if Russian President Vladimir Putin had overestimated domestic support for a military operation.

For people like Mariya H., an ethnic Russian who grew up in Ukraine, there was a sense of being torn between two lands as she watched news of the invasion in Ukraine. (She asked to not use her last name because she’s worried it could be connected to family in Russia.)

5:50 p.m. Premier John Horgan says British Columbia supports the people of Ukraine in their battle to turn back Russian military forces and President Vladimir Putin.

He says B.C. is working with the federal government and will support whatever sanctions Canada can impose to help condemn Russian actions. Horgan says he hopes international pressure will convince Putin to turn back his troops.

Earlier this week, B.C.’s political leaders, including Shirley Bond of the Opposition B.C. Liberals and Green Leader Sonia Furstenau, delivered emotional statements of support for the Ukrainian people in the legislature.

The flag of Ukraine is flying at the B.C. legislature.

5:44 p.m. What are Canada’s sanctions against Russia and how do they stack up to other countries’?

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau outlined on Thursday moves to penalize 31 individuals and 27 banks and entities connected to Russia’s ruling elite; to curb about $750 million in Canadian exports to Russia, particularly in aerospace, IT and mineral shipments; and to bar any dealings with several Russian financial institutions.

Among the people blacklisted are members of the Russian elite, their families, and Vladimir Putin’s lieutenants on his government’s security council: Defence Minister Sergey Shoygu, Justice Minister Konstantin Chuychenko, and Finance Minister Anton Siluanov. (Missing are Putin’s top deputy Sergey Lavrov and Putin himself.)

The federal Liberal government and its other allies including the U.S. did not immediately move to cut Russia out of the SWIFT global financial transaction system, target Putin outright or Lavrov, or hit Moscow’s ability to raise money by banning Russian oil and gas exports — although Trudeau said all options are on the table.

5:36 p.m. In what is being considered Europe’s greatest security crisis in decades, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Thursday with its military attacking the country from three sides leaving desperate people to flee bombs and bullets, and seek refuge in makeshift bomb shelters. While countries including Canada are responding to the invasion with economic measures and sanctions, Russia continues to proceed into Ukraine with alarming speed.

5:25 p.m. “It is like a knife to the throat.” That’s how Vladimir Putin described the possibility of Ukraine joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in his lengthy address on Feb. 21, in which he laid out his reasons for invading Ukraine.

Putin mentioned NATO 40 times in the speech.

He views the 30-country military alliance, led by the United States, as an existential threat to Russia, particularly as its membership has expanded eastward and now includes several former Soviet countries.

5 p.m. Washington Capitals captain Alex Ovechkin asked for “no more war” Friday in his first media availability since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The Moscow native said he has “lots of friends in Russia and Ukraine” and hopes the attack will end soon.

“Please, no more war,“ Ovechkin said. ”It doesn’t matter who is in the war, Russia, Ukraine, different countries … We have to live in peace and a great world.”

Asked if he supported the invasion, Ovechkin replied: “I’m Russian, right? … It’s not in my hands.

4:46 p.m. (updated) The Canadian government is joining the United States and European partners in aiming punitive sanctions directly at Russian President Vladimir Putin as NATO bolstered defensive forces outside Ukraine’s border.

And Canada is throwing its support behind a growing call to evict Russia from the global financial transaction system, known as SWIFT, “to make it more difficult for Putin to finance his brutality.”

Government officials have said that Canada alone can’t effect a big impact on the SWIFT system but a co-ordinated response can.

4:45 p.m. A cybersecurity expert says Canadian businesses are at risk of being targeted for online attacks if Russia chooses to retaliate against government sanctions.

Karim Hijazi, founder and CEO of Texas-based cyberintelligence firm Prevailion, says that Canadian companies could be victims of bad actors trying to compromise critical infrastructure and government entities.

He says this could be the likely approach because government, critical infrastructure and the private sector are so intertwined and subject to easy access.

4:40 p.m. Among the various kinds of assistance Ukraine is asking of its international allies, such as weapons and economic sanctions, one measure on which the international community has not agreed is SWIFT.

That stands for Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, which tracks and provides security for trillions of dollars in international transactions daily. Without SWIFT, it is possible to transfer money internationally, but it is a lot slower.

A Russia cut off from SWIFT would be severely isolated. In 2014, when the U.S. considered removing Russia from access to SWIFT because of its annexation of Crimea, Russia’s then-prime minister said the move would be equivalent to a “declaration of war.”

That’s mostly because it would severely hamper Russia’s ability to profit from oil and gas exports, the driving force of the country’s economy.

Read the Star’s explainer: What is SWIFT and why haven’t countries expelled Russia from it yet?

4 p.m. The Biden administration announced Friday that it will move to freeze the assets of President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, following the European Union and Britain in directly sanctioning top Russian leadership.

The Treasury Department announced the sanctions shortly after the EU said it had also approved an asset freeze against Putin and Lavrov as part of a broader package of sanctions against Russia for the invasion of Ukraine. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson also told NATO leaders during a call Friday that Britain would move to impose sanctions against Putin and Lavrov.

It wasn’t immediately clear how impactful an asset freeze would be on Putin or Lavrov, but the direct action targeting the Russian president was meant to be seen as a warning to Putin that he could emerge as an international pariah if he doesn’t end the invasion of Ukraine.

3:51 p.m. Chad Martz has spent the last few days in a mountainous region of western Ukraine purchasing food and basic supplies for those who’ve fled their homes due to the Russian invasion of the country.

But the Canadian citizen, who has been in the country for months due to his work with a British Columbia aid organization, isn’t currently going anywhere himself.

“The area that I’m in ... hasn’t received any attacks, so it’s been staying relatively calm,” he said in a phone interview on Friday.

3:46 p.m. As Russia invades Ukraine, launching the largest attack on European soil since the Second World War, the Star is working to demystify the complex geopolitics behind the war by answering reader questions. Here, we look at: Does China support the Russian invasion of Ukraine?

Officially, China has tried to stay neutral on Vladimir Putin’s attack on Ukraine, but its sympathies are clearly with Russia. The Chinese government, led by President Xi Jinping, has neither condemned Russia nor described the war as an invasion at all, preferring obfuscating euphemisms such as “the situation in Ukraine.”

China’s regime has criticized economic sanctions against Putin’s, and said it “understands Russia’s legitimate security concerns” with regards to NATO’s eastward expansion. At the same time China has affirmed the “sovereignty and territorial integrity” of all countries, urged both sides to “exercise restraint” and encouraged negotiation.

3:35 p.m. Canadian phone companies are waiving long-distance and text charges for calls to Ukraine amid Russia’s assault on the country.

Bell Canada, Rogers Communications Inc., Telus Corp. and Shaw Communications Inc. have all announced customers will not be charged to help connect with loved ones in the embattled region.

Rogers and its mobile subsidiary Fido Solutions say long-distance and text charges will be set aside, as will roaming fees for clients in Ukraine until the end of March.

3:30 p.m. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has prompted a number of swift retaliatory measures from governments across the globe, but the disapproval of President Vladimir Putin’s aggressive actions in the region goes beyond politics and financial sanctions.

Various sporting and cultural events have already announced they would move or cancel events to take place in Russia or involve the country, with more to possibly come. Soccer’s UEFA was one of the first, announcing the Champions League final in May would move to Paris from St. Petersburg.

It’s not uncommon for repercussions, relocations and boycotts to happen on the cultural front during times of war, and this list will most likely continue to grow as tensions escalate between Russia and the West.

Here’s what’s changing and why, by the Star’s Justin Smirlies.

3:25 p.m. Ontario’s premier says he wants the federal government to fast-track Ukrainian refugees to his province.

Doug Ford says Ontario has jobs and settlement services available to people fleeing the country following Russia’s invasion.

He says he will be speaking with the federal government in the coming days to discuss how Ontario can help speed up the process for potential refugees.

2:52 p.m. (updated): The LCBO has been ordered to pull Russian spirits and other products from all liquor store shelves following the invasion of Ukraine by Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“The people of Ontario will always stand against tyranny and oppression. To that end, I am directing the LCBO to withdraw all products produced in Russia from store shelves,” Finance Minister Peter Bethlenfalvy said Friday.

His order followed a similar request of the LCBO from Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca earlier in the day, but Premier Doug Ford told reporters the measure had already been under discussion.

2:32 p.m. NATO leaders meeting virtually Friday “to discuss the gravest threat to Euro-Atlantic security in decades.”

NATO called on Russia “to stop this senseless war, immediately cease its assault, withdraw all its forces from Ukraine, and turn back to the path of dialogue and turn away from aggression,” said NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.

The organization said the long-planned attack on Ukraine “is brutal and wholly unprovoked and unjustified,” condemning the tragic loss of life and human suffering caused by Russia so far.

“The world will hold Russia, as well as Belarus, accountable for their actions. We call on all states to condemn this unconscionable attack unreservedly. No one should be fooled by the Russian government’s barrage of lies,” NATO’s statement reads.

2:26 p.m. Rallies took place around the world on Friday, including in Tbilisi, Georgia, where large crowds gathered in front of parliament to protest the war in Ukraine.

People were reportedly demanding that Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili step down after he said he would not introduce sanctions against Russia in response to its large-scale invasion of Ukraine that began on Thursday.

2:22 p.m. U.S. President Joe Biden and his NATO counterparts agreed Friday to send thousands of troops backed by air and naval support to protect allies near Russia and Ukraine in response to President Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade, the organization’s top civilian official said.

Speaking after chairing a NATO summit, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the 30-nation organization will send parts of the NATO Response Force and elements of a quickly deployable spearhead unit to the alliance’s eastern flank. It’s the first time the force has been used to defend NATO allies.

Stoltenberg did not say how many troops would be sent or where they might go, but he did confirm that the move would involve land, sea and air power.

In response to Europe’s biggest security crisis in decades, Stoltenberg said, “We are now deploying the NATO Response Force for the first time in a collective defense context. We speak about thousands of troops. We speak about air and maritime capabilities.”

“There must be no space for miscalculation or misunderstanding. We will do what it takes to protect and defend every ally, and every inch of NATO territory,” he said.

The NRF can number up to 40,000 troops, but Stoltenberg said that NATO would not be deploying the entire force. Parts of a spearhead unit known in NATO jargon as the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force, which is currently led by France, will also be sent.

The announcement came after NATO members, ranging from Russia’s neighbor Estonia in the north down around the west of conflict-hit Ukraine to Bulgaria on the Black Sea coast, triggered urgent consultations Thursday about their security amid concerns from the invasion.

12:41 p.m. China and India were organizing evacuation flights to collect citizens stranded and unable to fly home after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine threatened to generate a refugee crisis.

Other governments and United Nations officials were assessing how to extract people as Russian forces attacked Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv. The country’s airspace has been shut down due to safety concerns, leaving people to travel by land to surrounding countries as the only way to evacuate.

The conflict could generate as many as 4 million refugees if the Russian invasion now in its second day continues, the U.N. said Friday in Geneva. Its International Civil Aviation Organization, which promotes cooperation and diplomacy in global aviation, was to discuss the conflict at a previously scheduled meeting, spokesman Anthony Philbin said via phone. He declined to comment on the deliberations.

The proximity of the conflict and the availability of commercial flights from neighboring countries like Hungary, Romania and Poland have lessened the need for European governments to send dedicated aircraft to extract people. The U.K., for example, hasn’t yet decided to launch a charter operation, instead instructing citizens to leave the country as soon as possible using commercial flights.

Countries much further away were chartering jets to bridge gaps in commercial networks.

12:23 p.m. (updated) The Canadian Press has learned the federal government plans to match donations individuals make to the Canadian Red Cross to help bring humanitarian relief to Ukraine.

The campaign, which is to begin today and run until March 18, will see the government match donations by Canadians dollar for dollar to a maximum of $10 million, says a senior government official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss matters not yet public.

The head of Save the Children Canada is also urging Canadians to donate funds to help the humanitarian efforts on the ground as the fighting continues in Ukraine.

12:10 p.m. Europe is facing a massive new migration crisis because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Canada should prepare to provide asylum to those fleeing the violence, says a Canadian security expert.

“This would be a chance for Canada to really, really step up to the plate,” said Michael Bociurkiw, a Canadian in Ukraine who served as the spokesman for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe during the height of tensions following Russia’s annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014.

“Telling Ukrainians: you are welcome in Canada. And, you know, easing of visa rules, temporary stays, that sort of thing.”

Canada has promised to prioritize immigration applications from Ukraine to bring people fleeing the country to safety as quickly as possible.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also announced the creation of a new hotline Thursday, “for anyone at home or abroad with urgent Ukraine-related immigration questions.”

11:55 a.m. Russian authorities on Friday announced the “partial restriction” of access to Facebook after the social media network limited the accounts of several Kremlin-backed media over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.

Russian state communications watchdog Roskomnadzor said Friday it demanded that Facebook lift the restrictions it placed Thursday on state news agency RIA Novosti, state TV channel Zvezda, and pro-Kremlin news sites Lenta.Ru and Gazeta.Ru. The agency said Facebook didn't reinstate the media outlets.

The restrictions on the accounts, according to Roskomnadzor, included marking their content as unreliable and imposing technical restrictions on the search results to reduce the publications’ audiences on Facebook.

Roskomnadzor said its “partial restriction” on Facebook takes effect Friday, without clarifying what exactly the move means.

In its official statement, Roskomnadzor cast its action as ’“measures to protect Russian media.” It said Russia’s Foreign Ministry and the Prosecutor General’s office found Facebook “complicit in violation of fundamental human rights and freedoms, as well as the rights and freedoms of Russian nationals.”

11:41 a.m. Just say “nyet” to Russian vodka.

Ontario’s liquor retailer has been asked by Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca to pull bottles of Russian vodka from its store shelves over the invasion of Ukraine.

As a Crown corporation, the Liquor Control Board of Ontario should remove the products “to show support for an independent Ukraine by halting all commerce with Russia until their troops are withdrawn,” Del Duca wrote Friday to LCBO president George Soleas.

The letter was sent a day after all parties in the legislature condemned the invasion and Premier Doug Ford branded Russian President Vladimir Putin a “thug” before announcing a $300,000 donation from the province to the Canada-Ukraine Foundation for medical aid, food and shelter as Ukraine is racked by combat. The federal government has also announced sanctions against Russia.

11:27 a.m. Russian troops bore down on Ukraine’s capital Friday, with gunfire and explosions resonating ever closer to the government quarter, in an invasion of a democratic country that has fueled fears of wider war in Europe and triggered worldwide efforts to make Russia stop.

With reports of hundreds of casualties from the warfare — including shelling that sliced through a Kyiv apartment building and pummeled bridges and schools — there also were growing signs that Vladimir Putin’s Russia may be seeking to overthrow Ukraine’s government in his boldest effort yet to redraw the world map and revive Moscow’s Cold War-era influence.

In the fog of war, it was unclear how much of Ukraine remains under Ukrainian control and how much Russian forces have seized. The Kremlin accepted Kyiv’s offer to hold talks, but with Russia in the driver’s seat, it appeared to be an effort to squeeze concessions out of Ukraine’s embattled president instead of a gesture toward a diplomatic solution.

11:15 a.m. The Council of Europe has suspended Russia from the continent's human rights organization because of its invasion of Ukraine.

The 47-nation council announced Friday that Russia was suspended with “immediate effect” from the organization's Committee of Ministers and parliamentary assembly on Friday “as a result of the Russian Federation’s armed attack on Ukraine.”

The Strasbourg-based organization, which was founded in 1949, said Russia remained a member and continued to be bound by relevant human rights conventions.

11:09 a.m. Now that Russian President Vladimir Putin has invaded Ukraine and foreclosed his other options, certain aspects of the near future have become clear. So have some aspects of the longer run. Here are 10 predictions, made with varying degrees of confidence.

1. Ukraine’s organized military forces won’t be able to fight for long. Its armed forces are smaller and less well-equipped than the Russian invasion force, they are being attacked simultaneously from the north, east and south, and above all they lack air cover.

Russian cruise missiles have already struck most Ukrainian airbases and command centres, and Ukranian forces in the field will be cut up into small groups, surrounded and overwhelmed. Arming civilians won’t help; it will just get them killed. Organized combat will probably be over in a week, although fighting in the cities could last a little longer.

2. There will be an underground resistance movement at least for a while, but don’t imagine Ukrainians are going to be the new Viet Cong. This is an urban society, and the resistance will rely on ambushes, assassinations and IEDs. The Russians will call it “terrorism.”

3. Putin says “We do not intend to occupy Ukraine,” but of course Russia will. The only question is whether they will stop at Dnieper River (plus Kyiv, on the west bank), or take the western half of the country too.

Resistance will be stronger in the west, where Ukrainian nationalism has deeper roots. However, Putin’s denial of the legitimacy of the Ukrainian state — and indeed of a separate Ukrainian identity — means he can’t really leave the west out. The logic of his argument is that all the people on this “ancient Russian land” must be resubmerged in a greater Russian identity.

10:57 a.m. Even the smallest act of defiance in Russia takes a giant dose of courage.

That is the way it was in Soviet times. And that is the way it was the day that Russia invaded Ukraine.

A day that began before the sun rose with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s paranoid justification for war: an attack by the West against Russia was a certainty unless Russia brought to bloody completion the brutal military buildup on Ukraine’s borders.

“You and I,” he said, “simply have not been left with any other opportunity to protect Russia, our people, except for the one that we will be forced to use today.”

As a journalist who’s been observing the bobbing and weaving between Moscow, Washington, Brussels and Kyiv, Putin’s words brought a horrible certainty that had been absent in the many frantic days leading up to it.

At long last, there was no question in the morning about how the day would end.

10:52 a.m. The pandemic, mass shootings, natural disasters, terror attacks. There’s been plenty of tragedy and anxiety for parents to sort through with their kids. Add Russia’s escalating invasion of Ukraine to the list.

With events rapidly unfolding on TV and across social media, child development experts urge parents to check in with children of all ages but not to worry if those conversations are brief.

“For children under the age of 7, it might just be acknowledging that something is happening between Ukraine and Russia and ask, ‘Have you heard anything?’ Take the child’s lead,“ said Janine Domingues, a clinical psychologist at the nonprofit Child Mind Institute in New York.

For all ages, honesty is paramount, she and others said.

“Overall, just provide reassurance, that this is what we know right now. Let them know you don’t know all the answers but here are some places we can go,” Domingues said.

Around the globe, from the U.S. to Western Europe, Japan to South Korea and Australia, c ountries immediately denounced the Kremlin as Thursday’s fighting raised fear, sending stocks tumbling and oil prices surging. President Joe Biden slapped Russia with some of the broadest and toughest financial penalties the world’s largest economy can muster.

10:41 a.m. Chinese state media left Russia’s invasion of Ukraine off their front pages Friday as Beijing weighed its response, even as the outbreak of war in Europe dominated conversations on Chinese social media.

People’s Daily, the mouthpiece of the Communist Party, put the war on the bottom of page three on Friday, carrying a small piece on Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s call with his Russian counterpart and criticism of the U.S. for “hyping” a military offensive that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called the biggest conflict in Europe since 1945.

The official Xinhua News Agency’s website on Friday morning relegated the crisis, which Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said “struck at the very core foundation of our international order,” to a bullet on the site. In its media section, it showed people in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, going about daily life. While state broadcaster CCTV had some on-the-ground coverage, the front page of its app didn’t mention Ukraine. A story by state-backed news site Jiemian, titled “The most difficult day for Ukrainians,” was censored within hours.

Beijing is struggling to articulate a position on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that allows it to join hands with Moscow in opposing U.S. hegemony while still furthering its goal to be seen a responsible global power. President Xi Jinping has yet to comment on his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin’s invasion, which comes weeks after China and Russia released a joint statement declaring their friendship had “no limits.”

“This has happened before when Beijing leaders are themselves following a tricky breaking story and trying to figure out which side to land on,” said Sarah Cook, research director for China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan at Freedom House, a U.S.-based advocacy group. “They are buying time and in a few days, when conditions on the ground in Ukraine become clearer, we may see a more outspoken, consistent message.”

There are still some 6,000 Chinese citizens in Ukraine. Beijing has to work out an evacuation plan, said Maria Repnikova, an assistant professor in global communication at Georgia State University. “We should watch out for what assistance, if any, China would provide to Russia as the sanctions hit,” she added.

At a tense Foreign Ministry press briefing Thursday, spokeswoman Hua Chunying repeatedly sidestepped questions about whether Beijing considered Moscow’s military incursion into Ukrainian territory an invasion. China “didn’t wish to see what happened in Ukraine,” she said, adding that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries must be protected.

Chinese state media has followed suit, largely avoiding language such as “invade” to describe Russia’s attacks, instead calling them a “special military operation.” The state-backed Beijing News earlier this week asked reporters to avoid criticizing Russia or carrying pro-Western voices, according to editorial guidance posted on its social media accounts that was later deleted.

That caution stands in contrast to Chinese social media, where nine out of ten top trending topics on the Twitter-like Weibo were related to the Ukraine crisis Friday morning. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s remarks that he’d been “left alone” by the West topped the trending list, with as many as 490 million views.

Many users replied saying the U.S. wasn’t trustworthy, and called on Taiwanese people to abandon the idea Washington would defend the self-governed island in the wake of an invasion by China, which deems it part of its sovereign territory. One user wrote: “Taiwan compatriots please keep your eyes wide open.”

10:09 a.m. As Russian troops continue their invasion of Ukraine, the question of allyship is repeatedly in debate.

While most countries have condemned Russia for invading Ukraine and threatening its sovereignty, others remain in support of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s actions.

Putin issued a now infamous warning to those standing against him on Thursday, saying consequences for intervening in his invasion of Ukraine would be “greater than any you have faced in history.”

Refusing to back down, U.S. President Joe Biden condemned Russia’s allies and issued his own warning, saying any country in support would be “stained by association.”

Here is a list of countries choosing to support Russia:

10:03 a.m. The International Olympic Committee urged sports bodies Friday to cancel or move all events they plan to hold in Russia and Belarus, and stop using the countries' flags and national anthems.

The request from the Olympic body came after UEFA moved the Champions League final from St. Petersburg to suburban Paris, and after the governing body of skiing and Formula One pulled upcoming races from Russia.

Volleyball and shooting both have world championships scheduled to be held in Russia. There is also a World Cup qualifying playoff match against Poland scheduled for March 24 in Moscow.

Russia breached the Olympic Truce by invading Ukraine on Thursday, only four days after the closing ceremony of the Winter Games in Beijing. Some of the Russian troops entered Ukraine from Belarus, Russia's ally.

9:32 a.m. Popular English-language Ukrainian news outlet, the Kyiv Post, tweeted Thursday that its site has been “under constant cyber attack today from the moment Russia launched its military offensive against Ukraine.”

As Russian bombs and cruise missiles rocked cities across Ukraine early Thursday morning, another front in the long-simmering conflict was erupting. The internet quickly became a battlefield in its own right, with propaganda and disinformation threatening to muddy the water for Americans following the crisis from afar.

Digital disinformation has long been a favorite tactic of the Kremlin’s — as Americans learned via the proliferation of “fake news” during the 2016 presidential election — and the Ukraine crisis is proving to be no exception. Over the last few days, researchers have warned that President Vladimir Putin’s regime is pushing, and will continue to push, false narratives aimed at justifying its aggression.

At least some of those narratives are finding purchase among an American public divided by previous waves of disinformation, said Graham Brookie, senior director of the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab. “What we see … is not an insignificant amount of organic audience engagement from U.S. citizens that are predisposed to have their previously held beliefs reinforced by Russian disinformation.”

For instance, he said, anti-vaccine groups that are already skeptical of the U.S. government are now primed to disbelieve the official U.S. government narrative around Ukraine.

9:20 a.m. Pope Francis visited the Russian Embassy on Friday to personally “express his concern about the war,” the Vatican said, in an extraordinary, hands-on papal gesture that has no recent precedent.

Usually, popes receive ambassadors and heads of state in the Vatican, and diplomatic protocol would have called for the Vatican foreign minister to summon the ambassador. For Francis, the Vatican head of state, the decision to leave the walled city state and travel a short distance to the Russian embassy to the Holy See was a sign of his anger at Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine and his willingness to appeal personally for an end to it.

Vatican officials said they knew of no such previous papal initiative.

Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni confirmed the visit, and the Vatican said Francis travelled to and from the embassy in a small white car.

“The Holy See press office confirms that the pope went to the Russian Embassy to the Holy See on Via della Conciliazione, clearly to express his concern about the war. He was there for just over a half-hour,” Bruni said.

9:03 a.m. Luxembourg’s foreign minister said Friday that the 27-nation European Union was “very close to agreement” to freezing the assets of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

Jean Asselborn said before a meeting of EU foreign ministers to discuss Russian sanctions that “I think we are very close to an agreement, that we will find an agreement here,” for sanctions on the two.

“There will be a discussion but I think we agree that Putin and Lavrov, as far as the freezing of assets is concerned, that we will find a consensus here,” he said.

Asselborn said Russia would be hurt by the banks measures.

“We can’t talk everything on this, talk everything down because we don’t have SWIFT on the list at this moment. Once again: the debate about SWIFT is not off the table, it will continue.""

EU leaders largely agreed it was too soon to impose a travel ban on Putin and Lavrov because negotiating channels needed to be kept open.

9 a.m. The Kremlin says Russia is ready to send a delegation to Belarus for talks with Ukrainian officials.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that Russian President Vladimir Putin is ready to send the delegation in response to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's offer to discuss a non-aligned status for Ukraine.

That indicates Zelenskyy would be willing to negotiate dropping his country’s bid to join NATO, as Russia has demanded.

Before the invasion, the West had rejected the demand. Putin claimed the refusal to discuss keeping Ukraine out of NATO prompted him to order a military action in Ukraine to “demilitarize” it.

8:09 a.m. The Russian military says it has taken control of a strategic airport just outside the Ukrainian capital and cut Kyiv off from the west. The airport in Hostomel has a long runway capable of accommodating heavy transport planes.

7:55 a.m. The Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, was under bombardment on Friday morning, with missile strikes and a rocket crashing into a residential building as the second day of Russia’s military offensive pressed closer to the heart of the government.

Ukrainian forces were battling Russian troops on the outskirts of Kyiv, a city of 2.8 million people, where President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned in a television address that he was “target No. 1” of the Russian advance.

By midmorning, Ukraine’s Defense Ministry said that Russian forces had entered the Obolon district, a few miles north of central Kyiv, and urged people in the capital to stay indoors. In a sign of the potentially chaotic fight that could unfold, the ministry said on Facebook that Kyiv residents should “prepare Molotov cocktails” to deter “the occupier.”

Zelenskyy said that 137 Ukrainians, military and civilian, had been killed in the Russian invasion that began Thursday morning, and that Russian “sabotage groups” had entered the capital with the aim of decapitating Ukraine’s government “by destroying the head of the state.”

7:12 a.m.: Formula One says it's ""impossible to hold"" Russian Grand Prix in September considering the situation in Ukraine.

7:11 a.m.: U.S. President Joe Biden and his NATO counterparts will seek Friday to reassure member countries on the alliance’s eastern flank that their security is guaranteed as Russia’s large-scale invasion of Ukraine closes in on the capital Kyiv.

With Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appealing for help, NATO members ranging from Russia’s neighbor Estonia in the north down around the west of conflict-hit Ukraine to Bulgaria on the Black Sea coast triggered urgent consultations about their security. Only Hungary refrained.

The leaders, meeting via videoconference, plan to take stock of NATO’s own military buildup. The world’s biggest security organization previously had around 5,000 troops stationed in the Baltic countries – Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania – and Poland, but has significantly beefed up its defenses over the last three months.

“Make no mistake, we will defend every ally against any attack on every inch of NATO territory,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, who will chair the summit, told reporters Thursday. “An attack on one ally will trigger a response from the whole alliance.”

6:30 a.m.: Earliier, the Ukrainian Interior Ministry posted details of how to create a molotov cocktail on their official Facebook page.

The post features an image of the bottle, with directions of what to add in, the volume of the container, and where to light the rag inside it.

6:04 a.m.: Russia’s Civil Aviation Authority has banned U.K. flights to and over Russia in retaliation to the British ban on Aeroflot flights.

Rosaviatsiya said that all flights by the U.K. carriers to Russia as well as transit flights are banned starting Friday.

It said the measure was taken in response to the “unfriendly decisions” by the British authorities who banned flights to the U.K. by the Russian flag carrier Aeroflot as part of sanctions over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

6:03 a.m.: Europe is facing a massive new migration crisis because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Canada should prepare to provide asylum to those fleeing the violence, says a Canadian security expert.

“This would be a chance for Canada to really, really step up to the plate,” said Michael Bociurkiw, a Canadian in Ukraine who served as the spokesman for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe during the height of tensions following Russia’s annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014.

“Telling Ukrainians: you are welcome in Canada. And, you know, easing of visa rules, temporary stays, that sort of thing.”

Canada has promised to prioritize immigration applications from Ukraine to bring people fleeing the country to safety as quickly as possible.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also announced the creation of a new hotline Thursday, “for anyone at home or abroad with urgent Ukraine-related immigration questions.”

6:01 a.m.: Russia was stripped of hosting the Champions League final by UEFA on Friday with St. Petersburg replaced by Paris after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The men’s final will still be held on May 28 but now at the 80,000-seat Stade de France after the decision by UEFA’s executive committee.

“UEFA wishes to express its thanks and appreciation to French Republic President Emmanuel Macron for his personal support and commitment to have European club football’s most prestigious game moved to France at a time of unparalleled crisis,” European football’s governing body said in a statement. “Together with the French government, UEFA will fully support multi-stakeholder efforts to ensure the provision of rescue for football players and their families in Ukraine who face dire human suffering, destruction and displacement.”

The meeting also decided that Russian and Ukrainian clubs and national teams in UEFA competitions will have to play at neutral venues until further notice.

6 a.m.: Russia pressed its invasion of Ukraine to the outskirts of the capital Friday after unleashing airstrikes on cities and military bases and sending in troops and tanks from three sides in an attack that could rewrite the global post-Cold War security order.

Explosions sounded before dawn in Kyiv and gunfire was later heard near the government quarter as Western leaders scheduled an emergency meeting and Ukraine’s president pleaded for international help to fend off an attack that could topple his democratically elected government, cause massive casualties and ripple out damage to the global economy.

Among the signs that the Ukrainian capital was increasingly threatened, the military said Friday that a group of Russian spies and saboteurs was seen in a district of Kyiv about 5 kilometres (3 miles) north of the city centre. Earlier, the military said that Russian forces had seized two Ukrainian military vehicles and some uniforms and were heading toward the city to try to infiltrate under the guise of being locals.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Kyiv “could well be under siege” in what U.S. officials believe is a brazen attempt by Russian President Vladimir Putin to install his own regime.

5:58 a.m.: Twenty million dollars in U.N. humanitarian funds for Ukraine. A raft of new, stronger sanctions against Russia from Japan, Australia, Taiwan and others. And a cascade of condemnation from the highest levels.

As Russian bombs and troops pounded Ukraine during the invasion’s first full day, world leaders began to fine-tune a response meant to punish the Russian economy and its leaders, including President Vladimir Putin’s inner circle.

While there’s an acute awareness that a military intervention isn’t possible, for now, the strength, unity and speed of the financial sanctions — with the striking exception of China, a strong Russian supporter — signal a growing global determination to make Moscow reconsider its attack.

“Japan must clearly show its position that we will never tolerate any attempt to change the status quo by force,” Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters Friday while announcing new punitive measures that included freezing the visas and assets of Russian groups, banks and individuals, and the suspension of shipments of semiconductors and other restricted goods to Russian military-linked organizations.

“Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is an extremely grave development that affects the international order, not only for Europe but also for Asia,” Kishida said.

Countries in Asia and the Pacific have joined the United States, the 27-nation European Union and others in the West in piling on punitive measures against Russian banks and leading companies. The nations have also set up export controls aimed at starving Russia’s industries and military of semiconductors and other high-tech products.

5:56 a.m.: For months, the White House made highly unusual releases of intelligence findings about Russian President Vladimir Putin’s plans to attack Ukraine. Hoping to pre-empt an invasion, it released details of Russian troop buildups and warned repeatedly that a major assault was imminent.

In the end, Putin attacked anyway.

5:56 a.m.: Russia’s expanding invasion of Ukraine has opened a new and perilous chapter in Joe Biden’s presidency, testing his aspirations to defend democracy on a global level and thrusting him into a long-term struggle to restore European security.

It’s a far different trajectory than he imagined when his administration began last year with the goals of countering China’s growing influence in the world and reinvesting at home as the United States tried to turn the page on a deadly pandemic.

Biden talked about forging a “stable and predictable” relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a description that implied America’s focus could then be directed toward other, more pressing challenges.

Now he is confronted with the outbreak of the worst fighting in Europe since World War II. Although U.S. forces are not directly involved, the conflict is testing the limits of American power and Biden’s campaign assurances that he was well positioned to lead the country on the international stage.

Friday 5:51 a.m.: It has been a long time since the threat of using nuclear weapons has been brandished so openly by a world leader, but Vladimir Putin has just done it, warning in a speech that he has the weapons available if anyone dares to military means to try to stop Russia’s takeover of Ukraine.

The threat may have been empty, a mere baring of fangs by the Russian president, but it was noticed. It kindled visions of a nightmarish outcome in which Putin’s ambitions in Ukraine could lead to a nuclear war through accident or miscalculation.

“As for military affairs, even after the dissolution of the USSR and losing a considerable part of its capabilities, today’s Russia remains one of the most powerful nuclear states,” Putin said, in his preinvasion address early Thursday.

“Moreover, it has a certain advantage in several cutting-edge weapons. In this context, there should be no doubt for anyone that any potential aggressor will face defeat and ominous consequences should it directly attack our country.”

By merely suggesting a nuclear response, Putin put into play the disturbing possibility that the current fighting in Ukraine might eventually veer into an atomic confrontation between Russia and the United States.
