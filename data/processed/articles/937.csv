A spokeswoman for Mr. Chubais declined to comment.

His departure would be the most striking example of discord in Russia’s ruling elite over Mr. Putin’s invasion, which appears to have taken even many senior officials by surprise.

Anatoly Chubais left his role as Russia's envoy to international organizations and sustainable development of his own accord, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, according to the Interfax news agency.

The news was first reported by Bloomberg, which cited two people familiar with the situation saying Chubais had left Russia over his opposition to the war. Reuters also cited two anonymous sources saying he had left the country.

Chubais hung up the phone when contacted by Reuters. NBC News has been unable to reach him for comment and has not confirmed his reasons for resigning or whether he has left the country.

Chubais was one of the principal architects of former Russian President Boris Yeltsin’s economic reforms of the 1990s and held senior business and political roles under Putin. He had been Putin’s special envoy to international organizations since 2020, acting as the climate envoy in the role.

His resignation comes amid strong global backlash to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. There has also been some domestic opposition inside Russia as international sanctions and boycotts hit the economy, though Putin has met this with a crackdown on dissent.

Chubais' resignation would be the first sign of public discord within the country's ruling elite.

Last week, a former deputy prime minister, Arkady Dvorkovich, quit his role as the chair of the prestigious tech-focused Skolkovo Foundation, having previously criticized Putin’s invasion. Furthermore, several Russian oligarchs — billionaires with alleged ties to the Kremlin — have broken rank to criticize the war after Western governments began to sanction them and seize their assets.

Putin spoke out against the “scum and traitors” inside Russia who opposed the war, and called for a “necessary self-detoxification of society” in comments last week. Some experts took that as a threat to Russian elites who may be privately against the invasion.

John Lough, an associate fellow at London’s Chatham House think tank, told NBC News at the time that Putin was essentially saying: “Don’t think about having second thoughts. We’re all in this together, and if I go down, you go down.”",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/putin-envoy-chubais-quits-kremlin-role-russia-ukraine-invasion-rcna21170

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed that Chubais, 66, had resigned, but declined to comment on reports he had left Russia. ""Whether or not he's left the country — that's a personal matter,"" Peskov said, according to state news agency RIA Novosti.

News of Chubais' resignation was first reported by Bloomberg and confirmed by TASS, another Russian state news agency. Newspaper Kommersant published a blurry photo of Chubais in Istanbul withdrawing money from an ATM. He hung up on a reporter for Forbes Russia who called him for comment.

The red-headed reformer was a top aide to Boris Yeltsin, Russia's first democratically elected president, and was a major architect of reforms that created a private sector following seven decades of Soviet communism.

He also lined up Putin's first job in the Kremlin, bringing in the former KGB officer who had made a second career in St. Petersburg city hall. Putin went on to become head of Russia's spy agency and prime minister, before succeeding Yeltsin as president in 2000.

Chubais remained a key figure in the Putin era, leading an overhaul of the country's power sector, running a high-tech investment fund and becoming Moscow's climate envoy in 2020.

Russian opposition figures were unimpressed. Commenting on the news, a spokesperson for jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny dismissed suggestions that Chubais had resigned in protest at the war.

Why it matters: Chubais, who became a prominent economic reformer after the fall of the Soviet Union, resigned and fled in protest over Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, becoming the most senior Russian official to do so, Bloomberg first reported.

In the 1990s, Chubais oversaw the privatization of the Soviet Union's assets, giving rise to Russia’s class of ultrarich oligarchs, according to the Washington Post.

In December 2020, Putin appointed Chubais as special envoy for relations with international organizations for purposes of reaching sustainable development.

What they're saying: Peskov said Chubais resigned ""of his own free will,"" but did not speculate on the reasons behind his resignation.

""This is his own business,"" Peskov told the Interfax news agency.

The big picture: Chubais resignation and departure came roughly a week after Putin gave a venomous warning to those who oppose the invasion, describing them as ""traitors"" and ""scum"" and calling on Russians ""to spit them out like a midge that accidentally flew into their mouths,"" according to Reuters.

Russia's Kommersant newspaper published a photo of Chubais recently withdrawing money from an ATM in Istanbul.

Anatoly Chubais, the Kremlin’s special envoy for relations with international organisations for sustainable development, was confirmed on Wednesday to have left the government.

Chubais’ resignation was motivated by his “opposition to President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine”, two people familiar with the situation told Bloomberg News, which first reported the story.

Chubais is now reportedly in Turkey, where the newspaper Kommersant published a photograph of a man resembling the former Kremlin official at a cashpoint. Chubais was allegedly sighted in Istanbul as early as last week.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitri Peskov confirmed that Chubais had resigned from the government on Wednesday but did not say whether or not he had left the country.

“Yes. Chubais has resigned voluntarily. And it is up to him whether to leave or not,” Peskov said during a daily press briefing, according to the Interfax news agency.

Chubais is not a particularly influential member of the government and has no say in security affairs, but his resignation will create headlines in a country where most Russians know his name.

Chubais is best known as the architect of Russia’s controversial privatisation scheme in the 1990s, which helped create the country’s market economy but also concentrated immense wealth in the hands of a group of wealthy oligarchs.

A former chief of staff under Boris Yeltsin, Chubais recommended Putin for his first Kremlin position as deputy chief of the presidential staff in 1997, several years before he emerged as Yeltsin’s successor.

The former economist held a number of government roles during the 2000s, including the head of the state-run Rusnano firm. He was named Putin’s climate envoy in 2020.

In his years in government, Chubais established himself as a consummate political survivor, maintaining a role in Russia’s government despite his liberal credentials and the lingering anger over the pain of the Yeltsin government’s economic reforms.

Yet after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began last month, he began to air signs of discontent, posting images of the slain opposition politician Boris Nemtsov and that of the liberal economist Yegor Gaidar, who had warned of the dangers of imperial ambitions under Putin.

“In our arguments about Russia’s future I didn’t always agree with him,” Chubais wrote. “But it appears that Gaidar understood strategic risk better than I, and that I was wrong.”

Very few current or former Kremlin officials have spoken out against the war. Arkady Dvorkovich, a former chief economic adviser to Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy chair of the Russian security council and former president, condemned the war in an interview with Mother Jones magazine last week, saying: “Wars are the worst things one might face in life … My thoughts are with Ukrainian civilians.” He was promptly fired from his remaining government positions.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/putin-adviser-anatoly-chubais-quits-leaves-russia-invasion-ukraine

One of Russian President Vladimir Putin's high-ranking advisors has reportedly stepped down and left the country, according to Russian state media outlet TASS.

Anatoly Chubais, who served as Putin's climate change envoy and gave Putin his first government job in the 90s, quit in protest over the war in Ukraine, Bloomberg reported.

Chubais has been an influential reformer in Russia's government since the fall of the Soviet Union. The oligarch is the highest-level Kremlin official to break ties with Russia after Putin launched a full-scale invasion against Ukraine, according to Bloomberg.

Last week, Arkady Dvorkovich, who formerly served as former deputy prime minister under Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, resigned from his position as chairman of the Skolkovo Foundation, and openly denounced the war against Ukraine, which has resulted in thousands of fatalities.

""My thoughts are with Ukrainian civilians,"" Dvorkovich said in an interview with Mother Jones. ""Wars do not just kill priceless lives. Wars kill hopes and aspirations, freeze or destroy relationships and connections

During a televised speech last week, Putin lambasted citizens who don't support Russia in Ukraine, according to Aljazeera.

Russians, he said, ""will always be able to distinguish true patriots from scum and traitors and will simply spit them out like a gnat that accidentally flew into their mouths.""

""I am convinced that such a natural and necessary self-purification of society will only strengthen our country,"" he added, according to the report.",https://www.businessinsider.com/putins-longtime-advisor-Anatoly-Chubais-resigns-ukraine-war-2022-3

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.
