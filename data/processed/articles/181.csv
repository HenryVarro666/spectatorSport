0,09c50098-ff4c-48cc-9f30-0f65db654c99,"['Deutsche Welle', 'Www.Dw.Com']",,"Imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny on Wednesday called on Russians to protest, urging them not to be afraid of going to prison.

Navalny led the biggest protests in Russia against Putin and survived a poisoning with Novichok nerve agent in 2020. He is now serving a prison sentence on old fraud charges.

The plea comes on the seventh day of Russia's onslaught in Ukraine, amid growing concern about civilian casualties and Moscow's increasingly indiscriminate tactics.

What did Navalny say?

""I am urging everyone to take to the streets and fight for peace,"" the 45-year-old said in a statement posted on Facebook.

""If, to prevent war, we need to fill up the jails and police vans, we will fill up the jails and police vans.""

""We, Russia, want to be a nation of peace. Alas, few would call us such now.""

""But let us at least not become a nation of frightened silence. Cowards who pretend not to notice the war of aggression unleashed by our obviously insane czar against Ukraine.""

Navalny urged the people of both Russia and Belarus — which allowed Moscow's troops passage to attack Ukraine — to demonstrate in main city squares at 7 p.m. every weekday and at 2 p.m. on weekends and during holidays.

""You cannot wait another day,"" he said. ""Wherever you are. In Russia, Belarus, or on the other side of the planet.""

Thousands of Russians have protested against the invasion, according to OVD-Info, an independent monitor, and more than 6,800 demonstrators have been arrested. Although free assembly is nominally enshrined in Russia's constitution, demonstrations require approval from authorities since the introduction of a contentious law in 2014, the same year Russia annexed Crimea.

""Putin is not Russia,"" said Navalny. ""And if there is anything in Russia right now that you can be most proud of, it is those 6,835 people who were detained because — without any call — they took to the streets with placards saying 'No War.'""

Navalny accused Putin of using ""pseudo-historic nonsense"" to justify Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

'Theft from Russian citizens'

In a video published last week, Putin said the war ""was unleashed to cover up the theft from Russian citizens and divert their attention from problems that exist inside the country.""

Putin last Thursday ordered troops to invade Ukraine last week, but has faced stiff resistance from the Ukrainian military and civilians.

Ukraine says more than 350 civilians, including 14 children, have been killed in the conflict and the International Criminal Court has opened a war crimes investigation against Russia.

Putin invaded Ukraine amid a crackdown on opposition within Russia, where Navalny's political organizations are banned.

After Navalny's imprisonment, many of his closest allies left Russia after facing multiple criminal charges, and his Foundation for Fighting Corruption and a network of nearly 40 regional offices were outlawed as ""extremist.""

Earlier this year, Russian officials added Navalny and a number of his associates to a state registry of ""extremists and terrorists.""

Jailed Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny has urged Russians to stage daily protests against Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, saying the country should not be a “nation of frightened cowards” and calling Russian President Vladimir Putin “an insane little tsar”.

“I am urging everyone to take to the streets and fight for peace,” he said in statements posted on Facebook and Twitter on Wednesday, calling on Russians not to be afraid of going to prison.

“If, to prevent war, we need to fill up the jails and police vans, we will fill up the jails and police vans.”

“Everything has a price and now, in the spring of 2022, we should pay that price.”

The 45-year-old, who has led the biggest protests in Russia against Putin in recent years and survived a poisoning with Novichok nerve agent in 2020, is now serving a prison sentence on old fraud charges.

Navalny’s movement had previously called for a campaign of civil disobedience to protest against Russia’s invasion of its western neighbour.

Several rounds of anti-war protests have already taken place in cities across Russia. More than 6,800 people have been arrested for taking part in the demonstrations, according to independent protest monitoring group OVD-Info.

“Putin is not Russia. And if there is anything in Russia right now that you can be most proud of, it is those 6,824 people who were detained because – without any call – they took to the streets with placards saying “No War”, Navalny wrote on Twitter.

Navalny urged the people of Russia and Belarus – which allowed Russian troops passage to attack Ukraine – to demonstrate in main squares at 7pm every weekday and at 2pm on weekends and during holidays. Those who live abroad should gather at Russian embassies to protest, he said.

“You cannot wait another day,” he said, adding that Russia should not become a “nation of frightened cowards” who are pretending not to see an “aggressive war unleashed by our clearly insane little tsar”.

Navalny’s spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh also reiterated his call to protest on Twitter.

“The most important [thing]: to spread information. If you are afraid of reposting (although it’s late for fear) – at least spread it among your acquaintances by word of mouth… No war,” Yarmysh said.

Navalny, the most prominent opponent of President Putin, was jailed last year after he returned to Russia from Germany following his recovery from what Western laboratory tests established was an attempt to poison him with a nerve agent in Siberia. Russia denied carrying out such an attack.

Since then, authorities have clamped down even more tightly on his movement, and key figures have fled into exile after being designated by the authorities as “foreign agents”.

On Wednesday Novaya Gazeta, Russia’s leading independent newspaper, reported that children were detained by Russian police for laying flowers and anti-war signs at the Ukrainian embassy in Moscow.

“In the Presnensky police department, children and their parents are left overnight,” the newspaper tweeted in Russian, alongside a photo of the children and their parents.

“The police detained them when they laid flowers at the Ukrainian embassy,” it added.

Al Jazeera was unable to independently verify Novaya Gazeta’s reporting.

Putin last Thursday ordered troops to invade pro-Western Ukraine to “de-militarise” and “denazify” the country amid a historic crackdown on opposition at home.

Navalny, whose political organisations remain banned, accused Putin of using “pseudo-historic nonsense” to justify the invasion of Ukraine.

“I cannot, do not want and will not remain silent, watching how pseudo-historical nonsense about the events from 100 years ago has become an excuse for Russians to kill Ukrainians, and for Ukrainians to kill Russians while defending themselves,” he said.

“Putin is not Russia.”

Ukraine says more than 350 civilians, including 14 children, have been killed in the conflict and the International Criminal Court has opened a war crimes investigation against Russia.

Navalny called for protests across the country and abroad to signal that not all Russians support the war and show solidarity with the thousands of people detained in anti-war protests in Russia since last week’s invasion.

“We cannot wait even a day longer. Wherever you are. In Russia, Belarus or on the other side of the planet. Go out onto the main square of your city every weekday at 19.00 and at 14.00 at weekends and on holidays,” he said in a statement published on Twitter by his spokesperson.

Navalny said Russia wanted to be a nation of peace but few people would call it that now.

“Let’s at least not become a nation of frightened silent people. Of cowards who pretend not to notice the aggressive war against Ukraine unleashed by our obviously insane tsar,” he said.

“I am from the USSR. I was born there. And the main phrase from there — from my childhood — was ‘fight for peace.’ I call on everyone to come out on to the streets and fight for peace. … Putin is not Russia.”

Navalny, the most prominent of Putin’s opponents, was jailed last year after his return from Germany following treatment for what Western laboratory tests showed was an attempt to poison him with a nerve agent in Siberia. He said he was sentenced on trumped-up charges.

Russia denied carrying out such an attack and dismisses suggestions that Navalny’s treatment was politically motivated. It describes its actions in Ukraine as a “special military operation.”

Crackdown

Navalny’s activist movement had already called for a campaign of civil disobedience to protest against Russia’s invasion, but police have cracked down on demonstrations.

Some 6,840 people have been detained at anti-war protests since the invasion began on Feb. 24, according to the OVD-Info protest-monitoring group.

Navalny, 45, has been the biggest thorn in the Kremlin’s side for over a decade, persistently detailing what he says is high-level corruption and mobilizing crowds of young protesters in a country where the opposition has no meaningful power.

But his appeal to Russians outside big cities appears limited and the opposition’s ability to challenge Putin has been hampered by the authorities’ moves to stifle dissent in the past few years and by the state’s tight grip on the media.

Many opposition figures are now in exile after being designated by the authorities as “foreign agents,” a legal designation used for what authorities say are foreign-funded organizations engaged in political activity.

Opposition unity has often been undermined by internal policy differences and squabbling among factions, including during mass protests in 2011-12 that brought Navalny to prominence but faded after a police crackdown.",https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2022/03/02/world/navalny-anti-war-protests/

“Let’s at least not become a nation of frightened silent people. Of cowards who pretend not to notice the aggressive war against Ukraine unleashed by our obviously insane tsar,” the statement said.

Navalny noted that protests from within Russia would signal to the world that not all Russians support Putin’s attacks.

“We cannot wait any longer. Wherever you are, in Russia, Belarus or on the other side of the planet, go to the main square of your city every weekday and at 2 pm on weekends and holidays,” he added.

Navalny was imprisoned last year after returning to Russia from Germany, where he received treatment after being poisoned with the nerve agent Novichok in August 2020. Though the Kremlin has denied involvement with the incident, the U.S. and other nations have blamed Russia for Navalny’s poisoning.

Russia's jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny urged the global community to protest against Russia's brutal war in Ukraine.

""We cannot wait any longer,"" Navalny wrote in a tweet on Wednesday. ""Wherever you are, in Russia, Belarus or on the other side of the planet, go to the main square of your city every weekday and at 2 pm on weekends and holidays.""

He urged people overseas to go to a Russian embassy to protest and organize demonstrations on weekends.

""We must, gritting our teeth and overcoming fear, come out and demand an end to the war,"" he said.

Navalny's calls come at some personal risk. He was poisoned in August 2020 with a Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok, and flown to Germany for treatment. Upon his return to Moscow, he was sentenced to two and a half years in prison over parole violation claims stemming from a 2014 fraud conviction.

Authorities recently moved to extend Navalny's sentence by 15 years.

Russians took to the streets in large protests across the country in April 2021 after Navalny's arrest and his hunger strike, with estimates that authorities arrested more than 1,700 protestors.

In his Twitter thread, he acknowledged that his call for global demonstrations against Russian President Vladimir Putin's war comes as he sits behind bars.

""They say that someone who cannot attend a rally and does not risk being arrested for it cannot call for it,"" he said. ""I'm already in prison, so I think I can.""

Navalny has been one of Russia's most vocal critics of corruption and was arrested after he publicized an investigation into a $1 billion mansion on the Black Sea he said was secrety controlled by Putin. Russian officials ordered news sites to scrub any reference to Navalny's investigation afterwards.

Since Russia launched its attack last week, protests have erupted in cities around the world as people rally behind Ukraine's resistance.

Anti-war demonstrations within Russia have been staged in dozens of cities across the country — including Putin's hometown of St. Petersburg.

Thousands, however, have been detained over the last few days for their participation in the protests.

Russia's Investigative Committee warned citizens in a statement on Thursday not to take part in the ""unauthorized"" protests ""associated with the tense foreign political situation.""

Navalny called on Russians and Belarusians to protest every weekday and at 2 p.m. on weekends at their city’s main square. He also urged people everywhere to protest in front of Russian embassies across the world.

Rallies in support of Ukraine drawing thousands have taken already place in major cities in democratic countries in the past week.

Putin’s fiercest critic broadcast his message via his team from behind bars, where is serving a two-year and eight-month sentence for charges rights groups have criticized as politically motivated. He made similar calls in a video in Russian posted on his official Youtube channel on Wednesday.

“Let’s not ‘be against the war.’ Let’s fight against the war,” he urged.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine entered its seventh day Wednesday, with heavy attacks on the cities of Kharkiv and Kherson.

As civilian areas, including the capital Kyiv, came under increasingly intense shelling, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of “state terrorism.”

Meanwhile, Ukrainians continued to defend their cities, with residents of Enerhodar, home to a major nuclear power plant, taking to the streets in a bid to block Russian forces.

During his State of the Union address Tuesday night, President Joe Biden said Russian President Vladimir Putin was “now isolated from the world more than ever” as Russia’s economy continued to reel amid crippling sanctions.

Inside Russia, Putin appeared to broaden his crackdown on dissent with a top radio station critical of the Kremlin taken off the air as authorities moved to limit coverage of the invasion.
