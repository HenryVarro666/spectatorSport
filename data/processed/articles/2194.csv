I condemned this unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces. I briefed him on the steps we are taking to rally international condemnation, including tonight at the United Nations Security Council. He asked me to call on the leaders of the world to speak out clearly against President Putin‚Äôs flagrant aggression, and to stand with the people of Ukraine. Tomorrow, I will be meeting with the Leaders of the G7, and the United States and our Allies and partners will be imposing severe sanctions on Russia.

1,e002432f-4d86-4e4c-89ad-048fceda5966,[],2022-02-25 00:00:00,"Today I met with fellow leaders from our NATO Allies to discuss our shared commitment to collective defense and Transatlantic security. As President Putin threatens the very foundations of international peace and security, NATO is once again demonstrating that it stands for freedom and democracy.

As I said yesterday, the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory. Our commitment to Article 5 is ironclad. I have ordered the deployment of additional forces to augment our capabilities in Europe to support our NATO Allies. And I strongly welcome the decision to activate NATO‚Äôs defensive plans and elements of the NATO Response Force to strengthen our collective posture, as well as the commitments by our Allies to deploy additional land and air forces to the eastern flank and maritime forces from the High North to the Mediterranean.

We were joined today by our close partners Sweden, Finland, and the European Union. President Putin has failed in his goal of dividing the West. NATO is as united and resolute as it‚Äôs ever been, and NATO will maintain its Open Door to those European states who share our values and who one day may seek to join our Alliance. As we navigate this crisis, we pledged to work even more closely together in our defense of freedom and the democratic values that imbue our Alliance with purpose and power.

Immediately after the NATO Summit, I spoke with President Zelenskyy of Ukraine. I commended the brave actions of the Ukrainian people who were fighting to defend their country. I also conveyed ongoing economic, humanitarian, and security support being provided by the United States as well as our continued efforts to rally other countries to provide similar assistance.

Details: Biden promised Ukraine President Zelensky in a phone call additional U.S. support and that ""our allies and partners will be imposing severe sanctions on Russia,"" according to a White House readout.

""The prayers of the entire world are with the people of Ukraine tonight as they suffer an unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces,"" Biden said.

""President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering,"" he added.

""Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way. The world will hold Russia accountable.""

‚Äî President Biden

What to expect: Biden said he would be monitoring the situation in Ukraine from the White House on Wednesday night and would continue to get regular updates from his national security team.

He will meet with other G7 leaders on Wednesday morning and ""then speak to the American people to announce the further consequences the United States and our Allies and partners will impose on Russia for this needless act of aggression against Ukraine and global peace and security,"" Biden continued.

""We will also coordinate with our NATO allies to ensure a strong, united response that deters any aggression against the alliance. Tonight, Jill and I are praying for the brave and proud people of Ukraine,"" he added.

What they're saying:

House Intelligence Chair Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said in a statement the U.S. would ""always stand with"" the people of Ukraine. ""This begins by moving swiftly beyond the significant sanctions already announced by the Biden administration to fully cutting off Russia‚Äôs leading financial institutions from the global economy and ending Europe‚Äôs dependence on Russian oil for good,"" he said.

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Europe, said in a statement: ""Every option must be placed on the table to stop Putin's malevolence that not only threatens Ukraine and Eastern Europe, but the security of all liberal democracies around the globe. Putin chose a path to war, and he must now suffer the consequences. ... Our response to Putin must be in lockstep with our allies.""

The top Republicans on the House Armed Services, Foreign Affairs and Intelligence committees said in a joint statement they ""stand resolute with the Ukrainian people"" and that the attack had ""laid bare for the world to witness the true evil that is Vladimir Putin.""

""Every drop of Ukrainian and Russian blood spilled in this conflict is on Putin‚Äôs hands, and his alone,"" said Reps. Mike Turner (R-Ohio), Mike Rogers (R-Ala.) and Michael McCaul (R-Texas).

""In response, we are committed to enacting the strongest possible sanctions and export controls to cripple Russia‚Äôs ability to make war, punish its barbarity and relegate the Putin regime to the status of an international pariah. We cannot respond like we did in 2008 or 2014. The world must never forget or forgive this heinous act.""

‚Äî Reps. Turner, Rogers and McCaul

Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a statement, ""The Biden administration needs to quickly and significantly ramp up sanctions on Russia, and they need to hurt.""

Biden said in a readout shortly after midnight EST that Zelensky had reached out to him.

‚ÄúI condemned this unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces,‚Äù he said in a statement.

‚ÄúHe asked me to call on the leaders of the world to speak out clearly against President Putin‚Äôs flagrant aggression, and to stand with the people of Ukraine,‚Äù Biden added, noting that he plans to impose ‚Äúsevere sanctions‚Äù on Russia after meeting with G7 leaders on Thursday.

Biden spoke to Zelensky on the phone just before midnight EST, per NBC.

‚ÄúI spoke with President Biden,‚Äù Zelensky said afterwards in a video posted online early Thursday in Kyiv. ‚ÄúThe USA is preparing international support.‚Äù

The call comes shortly after Biden released a blistering statement promising ‚Äúfurther consequences‚Äù for Russia‚Äôs escalating violence.

‚ÄúPresident Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering,‚Äù Biden wrote.

‚ÄúTomorrow, I will meet with my G7 counterparts in the morning and then speak to the American people to announce the further consequences the United States and our Allies and partners will impose on Russia for this needless act of aggression against Ukraine and global peace and security,‚Äù he added.

A White House official said to expect those remarks in the early afternoon.

Secretary of State Anthony Blinken also spoke on the phone with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.

‚ÄúThe Secretary and the Secretary General also discussed further steps to ensure the security of Allied territory, especially on NATO‚Äôs Eastern Flank,‚Äù State Department spokesperson Ned Price said in a statement. ‚ÄúSecretary Blinken stressed that the U.S. commitment to NATO‚Äôs Article 5 is ironclad.‚Äù

Biden reiterated his early threat of ""strong economic and other measures in the event of military escalation,"" saying this time that the U.S. and its allies would ""respond decisively and impose swift and severe costs on Russia.""

Stronger still was the implication that Biden was prepared to send materiel or even troops to Ukraine. ""While the United States remains prepared to engage in diplomacy,"" reads the briefing, ""we are equally prepared for other scenarios.""

Putin had begun amassing troops on the Ukrainian border just as, or just before, the two leaders spoke in December. CBS News, for example, reported on the movement of well over 100,00 Russian troops only two days after the call on December 9. However, unlike the February call, the December call covered more than just Ukraine. The two men discussed ransomware, an endemic problem in Russia (per Dark Reading), and the two countries' Iran policy.",https://www.grunge.com/780340/what-was-the-result-of-joe-bidens-latest-meeting-with-vladimir-putin/

Each time, the Chinese officials, including the foreign minister and the ambassador to the United States, rebuffed the Americans, saying they did not think an invasion was in the works. After one diplomatic exchange in December, U.S. officials got intelligence showing Beijing had shared the information with Moscow, telling the Russians that the United States was trying to sow discord ‚Äî and that China would not try to impede Russian plans and actions, the officials said.

The previously unreported talks between American and Chinese officials show how the Biden administration tried to use intelligence findings and diplomacy to persuade a superpower it views as a growing adversary to stop the invasion of Ukraine, and how that nation, led by President Xi Jinping, persistently sided with Russia even as the evidence of Moscow‚Äôs plans for a military offensive grew over the winter.

This account is based on interviews with senior administration officials with knowledge of the conversations who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the diplomacy. The Chinese Embassy spokesman, Liu Pengyu, answered an earlier request for comment a half-day after this article was posted online, saying, ‚ÄúFor some time, China has actively promoted the political settlement process of the Ukraine issue.‚Äù",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/25/us/politics/us-china-russia-ukraine.html
