MOSCOW. March 2 (Interfax) - Russia's telecommunications watchdog Roskomnadzor has demanded that an article on the events in Ukraine in which the Prosecutor General's Office found fake information be deleted from Wikipedia, the agency told Interfax.

""On the basis of the requirement issued by the Russian Prosecutor General's Office on March 1, Roskomnadzor sent a notification to the management of the aforementioned Internet resource about the need to delete false information dealing with the special military operation in Ukraine. It involves the website's use of false content aimed to misinform Russian users,"" the agency said in response to Interfax's request.

""The failure to delete unlawful information as demanded by Roskomnadzor is an administrative offense punishable by a fine of up to 4 million rubles for legal entities,"" it said.",https://interfax.com/newsroom/top-stories/75109/

3,fee6c067-417e-4a12-bb44-8dff9658aedf,[],2022-03-02 15:53:10+00:00,"Moscow has threatened to block access to Wikipedia’s Russian-language site over an article about Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.

Amid widespread reports that Russia’s war is not going to plan, Moscow further tightened its grip on the information available to its populace on Tuesday and attacked Google and Meta as “foreign instigators of war”, after they also clamped down on Kremlin-backed media outlets.

Having ordered independent media outlets last week to remove references to Russia’s “assault, invasion, or declaration of war” or face being blocked and fined, the Russian media watchdog – Roskomnadzor – has now issued a similar threat to Wikipedia.

Citing a request from the office of Russia’s prosecutor general, the communications regulator issued a notice threatening that Russian telecommunications companies could block access to Wikipedia over an article it said violated the law, titled: “Russian invasion of Ukraine (2022).”

In its complaint, the regulator pointed to references on the Wikipedia page relating to numerous casualties among the Russian military – and among civilians and children in Ukraine – as well as Russian citizens’ panicked attempts to withdraw their money from banks in response to western sanctions.

Ukraine on Wednesday said that more than 2,000 of its civilians have been killed during the first week of the Russian invasion, and claims to have killed nearly 6,000 Russian troops.

It took Moscow until Sunday – the fourth day of Mr Putin’s invasion – to acknowledge that “there are dead and wounded” Russian troops. No estimates of the death toll have yet been given by the Kremlin, but it has claimed its losses have been far lower than those of Ukrainian troops.

During Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, The New York Times notes that Mr Putin arrested journalists who attempted to report on soldiers’ funerals in a bid to bury casualty figures.

Wikimedia Russia confirmed to The Independent on Wednesday that it had received the threat from Moscow’s communications regulator, which was published on the former’s website.

But its executive director, Stanislav Kozlovskiy, said that so far it was “not very clear” which parts of the article Moscow officials had taken issue with.

The article on Russia’s invasion is “written simultaneously by a huge number of people”, Mr Kozlovskiy said in an email, adding: “Every minute, day and night, numerous corrections and additions are made to it. Thousands of people with very different views on what is happening very carefully ensure that all the information in the article is as reliable as possible, and is also presented as neutrally as possible.

“Every edit is checked. All dubious, unverified, contradictory statements from the article are promptly removed. Similarly, emotional assessments, incorrect or ambiguous phrases etc are removed from the article,” he told The Independent.

Mr Kozlovskiy added: “Now the entire Wikipedia community is carefully studying this article and double-checking all sources even more carefully. So far, the claims are not very clear. It is possible that the prosecutors looked at some older version of the article.”

While the Kremlin has threatened Wikipedia over a number of articles in the past, it is only possible for it to block access to the entire website, as opposed to individual pages.

The regulator did so in 2015, over a page giving information about charas, a hashish type of cannabis – but the decision was later reversed.

Mr Kozlovskiy said: “The basic principle of Wikipedia is that information is deleted only if it is doubtful, unreliable, erroneous, not supported by the source or the source is not authoritative etc. Not by order. The article is now carefully reviewed by the Wikipedia community.”

Follow live updates on Russia’s war on Ukraine.

Adding that Wikipedia aims “to give people reliable and neutral information about the world”, he added: “This principle is observed in all articles.”

The wider Wikimedia Foundation pointed The Independent to a statement published on Tuesday, saying it “is actively working with affected communities to identify potential threats to information on Wikimedia projects, and supporting volunteer editors and administrators who serve as a first line of defence against manipulation of facts and knowledge”.

It follows a similar warning last week from Roskomnadzor – also citing the prosecutor general’s office – that news sites including broadcaster Dozhd, newspaper Novaya Gazeta, and radio station Echo of Moscow would be blocked and fined unless they removed “unreliable socially significant untrue information” about Russia’s attack on Ukraine.

And on Tuesday, days after having partially restricted Facebook access, the Russian media regulator reimposed a slowdown of Twitter’s loading speed – a measure lifted last May – and accused the company of failing to take down what it said were fake posts about Russia’s “special operation”.

It came as Google banned the YouTube channels of Russia Today and Sputnik in Europe, with Facebook’s owner Meta also announcing that it would restrict access to the pages of the media companies across the EU.

Meanwhile, the French satellite which broadcasts Russia Today in both the UK and EU is to be switched off, meaning it will no longer be available on Sky, culture secretary Nadine Dorries said in a triumphant tweet on Tuesday night – despite foreign secretary Liz Truss having warned that moves against the broadcaster could lead to repercussions against the BBC in Russia.

4,fee6c067-417e-4a12-bb44-8dff9658aedf,[],2022-03-04 10:31:03,"Russia’s media watchdog is threatening to block access to the online encyclopedia Wikipedia because of its entry on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This is the latest in a series of crackdowns on free media coverage since the war broke out. EURACTIV Germany reports.

Since the start of the war in Ukraine, the Russian leadership has tried to keep the flow of information about the war in check.

Russian media, for example, have been obliged to follow the Kremlin’s official line in their reporting, as they could otherwise face heavy fines or be shut down. The authorities have already closed down the several who refused to comply with the Kremlin’s “control of the narrative”.

Wikipedia is now in the sights of Russian media authority, Roskomnadzor, because Wikipedia’s Russian-language article on the war deviates from the Kremlin’s official account.

Wikipedia’s entry meticulously traces the course of the conflict and contains over 500 sources, some of which differ from Russia’s stance. Furthermore, the Wikipedia entry speaks of an “invasion” by Russia, while the Kremlin’s official line refers to a “military operation” for “peaceful purposes”.

The number of casualties cited in the entry also deviates from Moscow’s official account of the conflict because figures from the Ukrainian defence ministry, far higher than the Kremlin’s official figures, are also listed.

Featuring at the top of the Russian Wikipedia page with around three million hits, the entry of the Ukraine war appears quite irritating for Moscow.

According to the office of the Prosecutor General, this amounts to a violation that could ultimately lead to the blocking of Wikipedia.

Wikipedia’s response

Wikipedia has already defended itself against the threat of an impending shutdown and made the letter from the supervisory authority public.

The online encyclopaedia also announced it would take legal action against the threatened shutdown, although its chances of success in Russian courts, which are close to the state, are slim.

For this reason, Wikipedia has already published tips on how to circumvent the block.

Russia, meanwhile, is increasingly tightening its grip on freedom of expression.

According to the Moscow Times, the State Duma is preparing a draft law that aims to criminalise the dissemination of “false” information about the Ukrainian war, punishable by up to 15 years in prison.

According to the draft, the “purpose, role and tasks” of the Russian army may not be falsified, nor may figures on Russian military losses be published that do not come from the Kremlin itself.

Russia wages war against independent media As the war in Ukraine continues, Russia has stepped up efforts to restrict the availability of information, targeting independent reporting on both sides of the border.

Those who lied will be punished - Duma chairman

Russia limits access to BBC and other news sites

BBC: access to accurate information is human right

Russia says it is fighing an information war

MOSCOW, March 4 (Reuters) - Russia's parliament on Friday passed a law imposing a jail term of up to 15 years for spreading intentionally ""fake"" news about the military, stepping up the information war over the conflict in Ukraine.

Russian officials have repeatedly said that false information has been spread by Russia's enemies such as the United States and its Western European allies in an attempt to sow discord among the Russian people.

Lawmakers passed amendments to the criminal code making the spread of ""fake"" information an offence punishable with fines or jail terms. They also imposed fines for public calls for sanctions against Russia.

""If the fakes lead to serious consequences then imprisonment of up to 15 years threatens,"" the lower house of parliament, known as the Duma in Russian, said in a statement.

The Duma outlined a scale of punishments for anyone deemed to have discredited the armed forces, with stiffer penalties for those who intentionally spread fake information or called for unsanctioned public action.

The amendments, which could not be viewed by Reuters on the Duma website, appear to give the Russian state much stronger powers to crack down.

""Literally by tomorrow, this law will force punishment - and very tough punishment - on those who lied and made statements which discredited our armed forces,"" Duma chairman Vyacheslav Volodin said.

President Vladimir Putin said the ""special military operation"" was essential to ensure Russian security after the United States enlarged the NATO military alliance to Russia's borders and supported pro-Western leaders in Kyiv.

Russian officials do not use the word ""invasion"" and say Western media have failed to report on what they cast as the ""genocide"" of Russian-speaking people in Ukraine.

The amendments have to be approved by the upper house of parliament before going to Putin to be signed into law.

'TOUGH PUNISHMENT'

Russian opposition leaders have warned that the Kremlin could crack down on dissent after Putin ordered the operation.

Russia's communications watchdog also cut access to several foreign news organisations' websites, including the BBC and Deutsche Welle, for spreading what it alleged was false information about its war in Ukraine.

""Access has been restricted to a host of information resources owned by foreigners,"" the watchdog, known as Roskomnadzor, said in a statement. read more

Russia has repeatedly complained that Western media organisations offer a partial - and often anti-Russian - view of the world while failing to hold their own leaders to account for foreign wars such as Iraq and corruption.

Britain's BBC said access to accurate information was a fundamental human right and it would continue its efforts to make its news available in Russia.

7,fee6c067-417e-4a12-bb44-8dff9658aedf,['Current Time'],,"Russia's Defense Ministry warned on April 15 that it will intensify attacks on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, after accusing Ukraine of targeting Russian border towns.

The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making “the most important decision of their life -- to fight.”

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.”

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the major developments on Russia's invasion, how Kyiv is fighting back, the plight of civilians, and Western reaction. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.

Zelenskiy noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.”

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.
