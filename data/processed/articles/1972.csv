""We will have a short meeting with the delegations tomorrow morning,"" Erdogan said at a press conference after a cabinet meeting.



Turkey is ""almost the only country that makes sincere efforts to resolve the ongoing crisis between Ukraine and Russia through dialogue,"" he said.



Erdogan emphasized that his talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky are ""progressing positively.""



He also suggested that some circles were trying to make Turkey a side of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia.



""One will not be able to prevent Turkey, which has fair and sincere stance, from becoming a bridge of peace, tranquility and trust in its region and the world,"" Erdogan said, without naming any party or country.



""We know that those who work to make our country a side of the war in the Russia-Ukraine crisis are watching the bridge of peace we have built with a squeeze of heart,"" he added.



In a phone call on Sunday, Erdogan and Putin agreed to hold the next round of Ukrainian and Russian talks in Istanbul.



The delegations will hold the face-to-face negotiations on March 29-30, Vladimir Medinsky, head of Russia's negotiation team, said on Sunday.



Since Feb. 28, Russia and Ukraine have held three rounds of face-to-face peace talks and then a series of online discussions but have failed to reach a major agreement.

They did so over a white tablecloth at a long table inside a 19th-century Ottoman palace on the banks of the Bosporus, welcomed personally by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who greeted them in English with “good morning.”

After more than a month of talks — first in person in Belarus, then in recent weeks by video link — the diplomacy between Ukraine and Russia running in parallel to their war entered a new phase on Tuesday. The fact that the negotiations had become more serious was reflected in the setting, the palace where Mr. Erdogan — who has maintained ties with both Moscow and Kyiv — often holds major government events when in Istanbul.

“As the members of the delegations, you have shouldered a historic responsibility,” Mr. Erdogan told the delegates, addressing them from a podium before an artwork showing birds drifting over Istanbul landmarks. “All the world is expecting good news from you.”

David Arakhamia, the head of the nine-person Ukrainian delegation, said that holding the talks in Turkey was a “victory” in itself, because Turkey “is our friend and partner.” The earlier in-person rounds of talks had been held in Belarus, Russia’s closest ally.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/29/world/europe/russia-ukraine-peace-talks-istanbul.html

ISTANBUL, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Russian and Ukrainian delegations have arrived in Turkey's largest city Istanbul on Monday for a fresh round of face-to-face peace talks, aiming to achieve substantial progress to end the crisis.

The Russian delegation has settled in the Ciragan Palace Kempinski hotel while the Ukrainian delegation has checked in the Shangri-La Bosphorus, both very close to each other in the Besiktas district.

Media reports said the arrival of the Ukrainian delegation had been postponed to evening hours due to the closure of Ukrainian airspace and some logistical problems. According to the NTV broadcaster, the Ukrainian delegates had to go to a neighboring country by road to fly to Istanbul.

Tuesday's negotiations will begin at 10:30 a.m. local time (0730 GMT) at the Dolmabahce Presidential Working Office in Besiktas.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is expected to address the delegations at the opening of the meeting.

""We will have a short meeting with the delegations tomorrow morning,"" Erdogan said at a press conference after a cabinet meeting in the Turkish capital Ankara on Monday.

So far, Russia and Ukraine have held three rounds of in-person talks in Belarus, and their fourth session was in a video conference format.

Turkey, meanwhile, has increasingly accelerated its diplomatic efforts on the international arena, reiterating its policy that it is ready to play a mediator role for lasting peace in the region.

In a phone call on Sunday, Erdogan told his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, that a ceasefire and peace between Moscow and Kiev must be achieved as soon as possible, and the humanitarian situation in the region should be improved.

Erdogan repeated that Turkey would continue to contribute in every possible way during this process.

The ""phone traffic"" that he has been conducting with Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is progressing in a positive direction, Erdogan said on Monday.

Turkey has been exerting significant efforts to resolve the crisis through agreement and dialogue, he said. ■

Abramovich's superyachts docked in Turkish resorts

ISTANBUL, March 29 (Reuters) - Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, who is sanctioned by the West over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, made a surprise appearance in Istanbul on Tuesday at the first direct peace talks in weeks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators.

The two teams sat facing each other at a long table in the presidential office on an Ottoman palace grounds. The Russian oligarch sat in the front row of observers wearing a blue suit, a Turkish presidential video showed.

In the most tangible sign yet of progress towards ending the war, Russia emerged from the talks promising to scale down military operations around Kyiv and the country's north, and Ukraine proposed adopting a neutral status. read more

For Abramovich, signals have emerged since the war began that he has sought to encourage negotiations, and he has travelled to Ukraine, Russia, Turkey and Israel in March. Two of his superyachts are docked at Turkish resorts.

His presence initially baffled at least one Ukrainian diplomat, while Moscow said he was not formally negotiating but rather there as a go-between and had approval from the Ukrainian side. read more

A spokesman for Abramovich did not respond to a request for comment. Abramovich showed no signs of a reported suspected poisoning early this month.

The Wall Street Journal and investigative outlet Bellingcat, citing people familiar with the matter, said Abramovich and Ukrainian negotiators suffered symptoms of suspected poisoning after a meeting in Kyiv. read more

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the poisoning reports as untrue and part of an ""information war"".

NATO member Turkey shares a maritime border with Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea, has good ties with both and has offered to mediate the conflict. While calling Moscow's invasion unacceptable, Ankara has also opposed the Western sanctions.

In a speech ahead of the talks by the Bosphorus strait, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan told the delegations the time had come for concrete results and that progress would pave the way for a meeting of the countries' two leaders.

""It is up to the sides to stop this tragedy. Achieving a ceasefire and peace as soon as possible is to the benefit of everyone,"" he said.

Footage released by Kyiv showed Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov being warmly greeted by his Turkish counterpart ahead of the talks at the Dolmabahce palace grounds.

Reznikov, who was not wearing a face mask, joked with Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar that Ukraine had scrapped COVID-19 precautions when Russia invaded.

Russian forces invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. Putin called it a ""special military operation"" to demilitarize Ukraine. Ukraine and the West say Putin launched an unprovoked war of aggression.

SUPERYACHTS IN TURKEY

Commenting on Abramovich's presence, Ukrainian ambassador to Britain Vadym Prystaiko told the BBC: ""I have no idea what Mr Abramovich is claiming or doing. He is not a part of the negotiation team.""

Peskov told reporters on a conference call Abramovich was not an official member of the Russian delegation at the talks, but acknowledged his presence there to ""enable certain contacts"" between sides. read more

The Kremlin has said he played an early role in talks but the process was now up to negotiating teams. TV video showed he sat next to Erdogan's spokesman and adjusted his headphones to listen to the president's speech. read more

The West has imposed heavy sanctions on Abramovich and other Russian billionaires, Russian companies and officials, in a bid to force Putin to withdraw from Ukraine.

Abramovich had sought to sell his English soccer club Chelsea, a process that was taken out of his hands by the British government when it blacklisted him.

Superyachts linked to him, together worth an estimated $1.2 billion, have been docked at Bodrum and Marmaris in southwest Turkey since last week. Sources have said he and other wealthy Russians were looking to invest in Turkey given sanctions elsewhere. read more

Its potential as a safe haven for Russian investment raises risks for Turkey's government, banks and businesses that could face penalties if the United States and others pressure Moscow with broader ""secondary"" sanctions. read more

Speaking after a Cabinet meeting at Ankara's Presidential Complex, Erdoğan also said phone talks with his Ukrainian and Russian counterparts are continuing in a ""favorable direction"" amid the Russia-Ukraine war.

""I can express that the phone calls we've maintained with (Russian President) Mr. (Vladimir) Putin and (Ukrainian President) Mr. (Volodymyr) Zelenskyy are heading in a favorable direction,"" Erdoğan said at a news conference after a Cabinet meeting at the presidential complex in the Turkish capital Ankara.

Before a fresh round of peace talks between Ukraine and Russia is set to take place in Istanbul on Tuesday, Turkish officials will sit down with both sides for a ""short meeting,"" Erdoğan noted.

""Today, we are the country that is making sincere efforts toward peace, and the only country which both sides trust in its fairness, sincerity, and friendship,"" he said.

""The world is bigger than five,"" Erdoğan said, reiterating his signature statement, and added that Turkey also expressed its objections ""to the global governance and justice system before the United Nations Security Council.""

""While we were expressing our stance against oppression, occupation, and tyranny by saying 'one minute' (in the 2009 World Economic Forum) in Davos, our concern was peace, tranquility, and respect for human life,"" he continued.

Turkey has not deviated from the same line despite all the pain it has suffered, the injustice it has been subjected to and the price it has paid in its nearly 40-year history of fighting against terrorism, Erdoğan stressed.

""We have carried out our cross-border political, diplomatic, and security struggle in this entire region from the Balkans to the Caucasus, from Syria to Libya, with this understanding,"" he added.

The Russia-Ukraine war, which started on Feb. 24, has met international outrage with the EU, the U.S., and the U.K., among others, implementing tough financial sanctions on Moscow.

At least 1,151 civilians have been killed in Ukraine and 1,842 injured, according to estimates by the U.N., which cautioned that the true figure is likely far higher.

More than 3.87 million Ukrainians have also fled to several European countries, with millions more internally displaced, according to the U.N. refugee agency.

Erdoğan has repeatedly said that Turkey will not abandon its relations with Russia or Ukraine, underlining that Ankara's ability to speak to both sides is an asset.

Ukrainian negotiator David Arakhamia announced Sunday that the next round of one-on-one talks between Kyiv and Moscow will take place in Turkey on March 28-30.

Arakhamia made the announcement on social media.

Ukraine described previous talks with Russia, launched after Russia unleashed an invasion last month, as ""very difficult.""

Ankara hosted the foreign ministers of Russia and Ukraine in Antalya earlier this month. Foreign Ministers Sergey Lavrov of Russia and Dmytro Kuleba of Ukraine met for talks in the Turkish resort town of Antalya, which Çavuşoğlu also attended. The talks were largely inconclusive, but Ankara considers the fact that they took place at all a success.

Maintaining its neutral and balanced stance, Turkey continues its diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the Ukraine conflict, urging all sides to exercise restraint. While Ankara has opposed international sanctions designed to isolate Moscow, it also closed its straits to prevent some Russian vessels from crossing through them.

ANKARA

Russian and Ukrainian delegations will hold the second round of face-to-face negotiations in Turkey’s Istanbul in a bid to reach a ceasefire.

Peace talks between Ukraine and Russia will be hosted by Turkey, the Turkish Presidential Communications Directorate announced on March 27 following a phone conversation between President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin.

The Turkish president told his Russian counterpart that a ceasefire and better humanitarian conditions were needed.

“Erdoğan noted the importance of a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine, the implementation of peace and the improvement of humanitarian conditions in the region,” the statement said.

Erdoğan told Putin that Turkey would continue to contribute in every possible way during this process, according to the statement.

Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu held phone talks with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, on March 27 and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on March 28 and discussed the situation in Ukraine and the planned negotiations.

Çavuşoğlu, meanwhile, said Turkey acknowledges its responsibility for efforts to resolve the Russia-Ukrainian conflict.

“Upon the initiative of Erdoğan, the negotiation delegations of Russia and Ukraine will meet in Turkey. We are aware of the responsibility stemming from the trust vested in Turkey by both sides. We hope the meetings will result in a lasting ceasefire and enable peace,” Çavuşoğlu tweeted.

Davyd Arakhamia, a Ukrainian delegate in talks with Russia on ending the war, said in a Facebook post the countries would meet in Turkey beginning March 28. However, the Russians then announced the talks would start on March 29. The sides have met previously with no deal reached.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky hailed the resumption of over-the-table talks, saying they must bring peace “without delay” and signaling a willingness to compromise on the most sensitive topics.

The fate of Russian-occupied Donbas and Crimea, as well as fundamental disagreements about Kiev’s alignment with the West, are again set to be the focus of negotiations. “Our goal is obvious -- peace and the restoration of normal life in our native state as soon as possible,” Zelensky said in a late-night video message that also set out his negotiating red lines.

“Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are beyond doubt. Effective security guarantees for our state are mandatory,” he said. Zelensky had previously indicated he is “carefully” considering a Russian demand of Ukrainian “neutrality” and indicated that he was willing to negotiate the future of Donbas at a later date. “We understand that it is impossible to liberate all territory by force, that would mean World War III, I fully understand and realize that,” he said.

For his part, Putin has avoided clearly defining the goals of his invasion, stating only that he wants to “demilitarise and denazify” but not occupy Ukraine.

The Kremlin said that the talks between Russia and Ukraine may get under way in Turkey on March 29. “While we cannot and will not speak about progress at the talks, the fact that they continuing to take place in person is important, of course,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters.

“We are adhering to a policy of not disclosing any information about the talks, which we think could only hurt the negotiation process,” he said.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said a meeting between Putin and Zelensky would be counterproductive if it were held now. “A meeting between Putin and Zelenskiy is needed as soon as we will be close to resolving all key issues,” Lavrov said in an interview with Serbian media.

Some context: While Turkey is a NATO member and Erdogan characterized the invasion as ""unacceptable"" at its onset, the president has tried to position himself as a potential broker for peace between Russia and Ukraine.

Erdogan told reporters Friday that Ukraine and Russia seem to have reached ""an understanding"" on four out of six topics discussed during negotiations, including Ukraine staying out of NATO as well as the acceptance of Russian as an official language.
