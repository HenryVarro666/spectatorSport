Economic Crime Bill coming into force next week will allow UK Government to move further and faster than ever on sanctions

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has today (Thursday 10 March) announced a full asset freeze and travel ban on seven of Russia’s wealthiest and most influential oligarchs, whose business empires, wealth and connections are closely associated with the Kremlin.

As part of the UK’s leading efforts to isolate Putin and those around him, these oligarchs – who have a collective net worth of around £15 billion – will have their assets in the UK frozen, they are banned from travelling here and no UK citizen or company may do business with them.

Those newly-sanctioned by the UK include Roman Abramovich, owner of Chelsea Football Club, worth more than £9 billion; leading industrialist Oleg Deripaska worth £2 billion, and Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin. A further group of Russia-based oligarchs close to Putin have also been placed under sanction. Those sanctioned today are:

Roman Abramovich owner of Chelsea FC and has stakes in steel giant Evraz and Norilsk Nickel

Oleg Deripaska has stakes in En+ Group

Igor Sechin is the Chief Executive of Rosneft

Andrey Kostin is Chairman of VTB bank

Alexei Miller is CEO of energy company Gazprom

Nikolai Tokarev is president of the Russia state-owned pipeline company Transneft

Dmitri Lebedev is Chairman of the Board of Directors of Bank Rossiya

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:

There can be no safe havens for those who have supported Putin’s vicious assault on Ukraine. Today’s sanctions are the latest step in the UK’s unwavering support for the Ukrainian people. We will be ruthless in pursuing those who enable the killing of civilians, destruction of hospitals and illegal occupation of sovereign allies.

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said:

Today’s sanctions show once again that oligarchs and kleptocrats have no place in our economy or society. With their close links to Putin they are complicit in his aggression. The blood of the Ukrainian people is on their hands. They should hang their heads in shame. Our support for Ukraine will not waver. We will not stop in this mission to ramp up the pressure on the Putin regime and choke off funds to his brutal war machine.

These sanctions are the latest step in the UK’s response to Putin’s illegal and unprovoked invasion, designed to ensure he fails in Ukraine by crippling Russia’s economy supporting his war machine. The UK has been at the forefront of this effort, shutting out large proportions of whole sectors of the Russian economy, such as its defence industry, its financial institutions and its transport sector. The UK has already sanctioned more than 200 of Russia’s most significant and high-value individuals, entities and subsidiaries since the invasion, with over 500 of them now covered by the UK’s sanctions list.

The Economic Crime Bill coming into force next week will also significantly simplify the process of imposing sanctions, allow the UK to more easily sanction individuals, stop oligarchs threatening the UK with multi-million pound lawsuits for damages at the taxpayer’s expense and also allow the UK to mirror allies’ designations. The UK will keep going further, faster and deeper to punish Putin’s regime for this callous war.

The UK will continue to lead global efforts to provide Ukraine with economic, diplomatic, humanitarian and defensive support.

Given the significant impact that today’s sanctions would have on Chelsea football club and the potential knock on effects of this, the Government has this morning published a licence which authorises a number of football-related activities to continue at Chelsea. This includes permissions for the club to continue playing matches and other football related activity which will in turn protect the Premier League, the wider football pyramid, loyal fans and other clubs. This licence will only allow certain explicitly named actions to ensure the designated individual is not able to circumvent UK sanctions. The licence will be kept under constant review and we will work closely with the football authorities.

Background

Asset freeze

An asset freeze prevents any UK citizen, or any business in the UK, from dealing with any funds or economic resources which are owned, held or controlled by the designated person and which are held in the UK. It will also prevent funds or economic resources being provided to or for the benefit of the designated person.

Travel ban

A travel ban means that the designated person must be refused leave to enter or to remain in the United Kingdom, providing the individual to be an excluded person under section 8B of the Immigration Act 1971.

Transport sanctions

Recently introduced powers make it a criminal offence for any Russian aircraft to fly or land in the UK, and give the Government powers to remove aircraft belonging to designated Russian individuals and entities from the UK aircraft register, even if the sanctioned individual is not on board. Russian ships are also banned from UK ports.

Sanctioned oligarchs

Roman Abramovich has stakes in steel giant Evraz, Norilsk Nickel and owns Chelsea FC. He sold a 73% stake in Russian oil firm Sibneft to state-owned gas titan Gazprom for £9.87 billion in 2005. His net worth is an estimated £9.4 billion. He is one of the few oligarchs from the 1990s to maintain prominence under Putin. None of our allies have yet sanctioned Abramovich. Oleg Deripaska has stakes in En+ Group, a major extractives and energy company which owns UC Rusal, one of the world’s major aluminium producers. He has a multi-million pound property portfolio in the UK. His net worth is an estimated £2 billion. The US designated Deripaska in 2018. Igor Sechin is the Chief Executive of Rosneft, a Russian state oil company and particularly close and influential ally of Putin. Sechin has been sanctioned by the US and EU. Andrey Kostin is Chairman of VTB bank, the second largest bank in Russia. VTB Bank was designated by the UK on 24 February 2022. Kostin is a close associate of Putin, and has long supported Kremlin objectives through VTB Bank. His net worth is an estimated £379 million. Kostin has been sanctioned by the US and EU. Alexei Miller is CEO of energy company Gazprom, making him one of the most important executives supporting the Russian Government. Miller served under Putin in the 1990s when Putin was deputy mayor in St Petersburg. Miller has been sanctioned by the US. Nikolai Tokarev is president of the Russia state-owned pipeline company Transneft. He first met Putin, when both served as KGB officers in Dresden in East Germany in the 1980s. They have remained closely associated ever since. Tokarev has been sanctioned by the US and EU. Dmitri Lebedev is Chairman of the Board of Directors of Bank Rossiya. The UK designated Bank Rossiya, widely considered to be the Kremlin’s private bank, on 22 February 2022. Lebedev was sanctioned by the US in 2016.

1,e465c25b-a746-4137-b856-3d09a252c908,"['Aubrey Allegretti', 'Jasper Jolly', 'Peter Walker']",2022-03-10 00:00:00,"The Chelsea football club owner, Roman Abramovich, is among seven of Russia’s wealthiest and most influential oligarchs who have been hit with sanctions by the UK, in an effort to further punish allies of Vladimir Putin over the invasion of Ukraine.

Abramovich was found by the UK government to have “received preferential treatment and concessions” from the Kremlin and through his business links been “involved in destabilising Ukraine, and undermining and threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty, and independence” of the eastern European country.

The Foreign Office said he was implicated through the steel manufacturing and mining company Evraz plc, in which he had a significant shareholding and over which he exercised effective control. It said the firm may have supplied steel to the Russian military for the production of tanks.

Abramovich’s assets have been frozen, and he will be prohibited from making any transactions in the UK, as well as being subject to a travel ban.

The share price of Evraz, a firm which is incorporated in London but with mostly Russian assets, fell by as much as 13% on Thursday morning after the announcement. Abramovich’s stake was worth £1.4bn at the end of 2021, but had fallen to £320m on Wednesday evening.

It is the first time Abramovich has been subjected to sanctions by the UK or any of its allies. The other Russian oligarchs hit with sanctions on Thursday morning were Igor Sechin, Oleg Deripaska, Andrey Kostin, Alexei Miller, Nikolai Tokarev and Dmitri Lebedev.

Deripaska was Abramovich’s one-time business partner, Sechin was said by the Foreign Office to have been Putin’s “right-hand man”, and Kostin, Miller, Tokarev and Lebedev were labelled as part of the Russian president’s “inner circle”.

Deripaska owns 45% of London-listed mining company En+ Group, whose executive chair until Monday was the Conservative peer Greg Barker. Deripaska’s stake was worth £1.6bn on Wednesday evening.

Sechin is the chief executive of state-owned oil company Rosneft and a former deputy prime minister of Russia. France last week seized a superyacht it said belonged to Sechin, although Rosneft has denied he owns it.

Kostin is chair of the management board of Russia’s second-largest bank, VTB Bank. The bank, which was traded on the London Stock Exchange before the invasion, has also had sanctions imposed on it.

Miller is the chair of the management committee of Gazprom, the state-controlled gas producer that was formerly a major sponsor of European football.

Tokarev is chair of Transneft, a large oil and gas company.

Lebedev is the chair of the board of Bank Rossiya, said by the EU to be the “personal bank of senior officials of the Russian Federation”.

Boris Johnson said the move was a demonstration of the UK’s “unwavering support for the Ukrainian people”. The prime minister added: “We will be ruthless in pursuing those who enable the killing of civilians, destruction of hospitals and illegal occupation of sovereign allies.”

The sanctions against Abramovich have huge repercussions for Chelsea football club, which he was in the process of trying to sell. Ministers have effectively blocked that process.

A government source said it would consider an application for a licence to allow sale of the club – but that the licence would not be granted if the sale benefited Abramovich while he was subject to sanctions.

Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary, said a special licence had been issued to allow games to be played, staff to be paid and existing ticket holders to attend matches but that Abramovich would be deprived of benefiting from his ownership of the club.

“I know this brings some uncertainty, but the government will work with the league and clubs to keep football being played while ensuring sanctions hit those intended,” she added.

Before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Abramovich’s lawyers had argued that he did not fit the criteria for sanctions, and said: “It would be ludicrous to suggest that our client has any responsibility or influence over the behaviour of the Russian state.”

David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, said the action taken against Abramovich was the right decision but overdue.

“Too few oligarchs linked to Putin’s rogue regime have so far faced sanctions from the UK government,” he said. “We are lagging far behind allies in the EU and the US.

“It is right that, under pressure from Labour, the government U-turned to strengthen sanctions legislation. Ministers must now move faster to continue to close the sanctions gap.”

Liz Truss, the UK foreign secretary, told CNN on a visit to the US: “There can be nowhere to hide for these individuals, and we cannot carry on with business as usual as we have been doing for the past 20 years.”

She added: “If Putin doesn’t stop now, and isn’t stopped in Ukraine, the consequences will be even more damaging for European security, but also for global security.”

So far, the UK has hit 18 oligarchs with sanctions since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. They are barred from conducting any financial transaction in the UK. This means that for individuals with UK properties, such as Abramovich, they will no longer be able to employ staff such as cleaners, housekeepers or gardeners, or even to have contracts for utilities such as electricity.

There is no suggestion yet that such homes could be seized by the UK, with all assets deemed to be frozen.

The government has been criticised for being too slow to impose sanctions, given Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began just over two weeks ago.

Critics said that those oligarchs fearing they could have their assets frozen would have speedily worked to move these out of the country.

UK officials stressed that taking action against oligarchs was complex, that cases had to be legally watertight and that there were even more complications with Abramovich given his stake in such a public institution as Chelsea. But they rejected the idea that action was delayed, or slow.

The plan is for what is described as a “clear ratcheting up” of sanctions. This includes the passing of the economic crime bill next week, after it goes through the House of Lords, allowing more action, for example, with unexplained wealth orders and over foreign-owned properties in the UK.

In a fresh embarrassment for the Foreign Office, it was forced to delete a tweet that announced sanctions against Lebedev using a picture of Dmitri Medvedev – a former prime minister of Russia. A spokesperson for the department said it was an “administrative error which was quickly spotted and rectified”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/10/uk-freezes-assets-of-russian-oligarchs-including-roman-abramovich

What do the sanctions entail and what do they mean for the individuals involved?

– What has been announced?

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has announced a full asset freeze and travel ban on seven men deemed to be “Russia’s wealthiest and most influential oligarchs”, according to the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), as part of the UK’s sanctions regime against Moscow following the invasion of Ukraine.

In Thursday’s announcement, officials said those slapped with sanctions have business empires, wealth and connections that are closely associated with the Kremlin.

They are said to have a collective net worth of around £15 billion.

– Who are they?

– Roman Abramovich, owner of Chelsea FC– Oleg Deripaska, who has stakes in energy and metals company En+ Group– Igor Sechin, chief executive of Russian oil company Rosneft– Andrey Kostin, chairman of VTB bank, Russia’s second largest bank– Alexei Miller, chief executive of energy giant Gazprom– Nikolai Tokarev, president of Russian state-owned pipeline company Transneft– Dmitri Lebedev, chairman of the board of directors at Bank Rossiya

– Why act now?

The Prime Minister last week promised to publish a list of Russian elites who are said to have links to President Vladimir Putin’s regime, with officials saying work was being undertaken to build the legal case for further sanctions on individuals.

Boris Johnson’s administration has faced criticism for failing to target oligarchs and their assets in the same way the European Union has done, with Brussels seizing super yachts owned by wealthy figures in recent days.

Ms Truss said Thursday’s announcement targeting the influential Russians was designed to “ramp up the pressure” on Mr Putin and “choke off funds” for his invasion of Ukraine while accusing those placed on the sanctions list of having the “blood of the Ukrainian people on their hands”.

Officials said the Government has a “hit list” of other individuals which it is currently working on sanction cases for, with ministers understood to be intent on going further.

– Why has Roman Abramovich been personally targeted?

The UK Government had deemed that Mr Abramovich has obtained “a financial benefit or other material benefit from Putin and the government of Russia”.

Those benefits including “tax breaks received by companies linked to him, buying and selling shares from and to the state at favourable rates, and the contracts received in the run-up to the Fifa 2018 World Cup”.

He has also been targeted for his associations through “close business relationships and mutual assistance” with already-sanctioned Igor Shuvalov, a former Russian deputy prime minister and general director of Russian gas giant Gazprom.

The Foreign Office also concluded that Mr Abramovich “is or has been involved in destabilising Ukraine” via Evraz plc, a steel manufacturing and mining company in which he has “a significant shareholding and … exercises effective control”.

The department said the firm has been involved in “potentially supplying steel to the Russian military which may have been used in the production of tanks”.

– What does this mean for Chelsea FC?

The Culture Secretary confirmed that a special licence will be issued to the Premier League club to allow it to continue operating after its owner was sanctioned.

Nadine Dorries said it will allow fixtures to be fulfilled, staff to be paid and existing season ticket holders to attend matches.

Non-season ticket holders will not be permitted to purchase future tickets for games, including away fans.

The club and Mr Abramovich are banned from profiting from club merchandise sales, meaning the west London outfit will be forced to shutter its club shop.

Transfers and loan deals for players are also prohibited.

Costs of travel to games cannot exceed £20,000 – a stipulation the first team will have to meet when they travel to Lille in France on Wednesday for their Champions League last 16 tie.

Mr Abramovich announced last week that he was putting the club up for sale, a process that will now be stalled but could still go through provided the Government issues a licence.

The owner would have to prove he would not benefit from the sale to meet conditions of any potential licence.

– Will there be any personal implications for Roman Abramovich?

The travel ban means the Russian-Israeli billionaire, who is worth about £9.4 billion and also has stakes in mining firm Norilsk Nickel, will not be permitted to enter the UK.

Jets and yachts owned or chartered by Mr Abramovich can be detained, the sanctions say.

– How did Roman Abramovich make his wealth?

He sold a 73% stake in Russian oil firm Sibneft to state-owned gas titan Gazprom for £9.87 billion in 2005.

The FCDO said he is one of the few oligarchs from the 1990s to maintain prominence under Mr Putin.

No ally of the UK has yet sanctioned the businessman.

– Are any of the other sanctioned oligarchs well known in Britain?

Oleg Deripaska, an industrialist worth £2 billion who has a multimillion-pound property portfolio in Britain, has had close links with the UK political establishment.

In 2008, he was embroiled in a row involving Labour grandee Lord Mandelson and then-shadow chancellor George Osborne.

Both men met Mr Deripaska on his yacht, while Mr Osborne reportedly attempted to solicit a donation for the Conservative Party from the oligarch – something he denied at the time.

Elsewhere, Igor Sechin, chief executive of state oil firm Rosneft, is regarded as Mr Putin’s “right-hand man”.

– What does it mean to freeze an asset?

The implications on frozen assets are that no financial transaction can be made on them at any time, according to UK officials.

The impact of this ranges from blocking any sale, all the way to preventing someone from being paid to clean a property or provide security.

A sale can be granted, however, should the Treasury choose to provide a licence to allow an exemption.",https://www.independent.co.uk/business/what-the-sanctions-on-roman-abramovich-and-six-other-russian-oligarchs-entail-b2032836.html

LONDON — Britain on Thursday froze the assets of seven prominent Russian business executives, including Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich, rapidly shedding its reputation as a place where rich Russians with connections to President Vladimir Putin were welcome to live, invest and donate. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight As calls for his sanctioning mounted, Abramovich announced last week that he was putting his West London soccer club up for sale. But now that his name has been added to the list, that planned sale has been blocked. The team can still play games, but it cannot sell any tickets or merchandise or sign players.

In response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and under international and domestic pressure, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government has been keen to show it’s taking action against Russian elites and Putin allies. The government is pushing through legislation that will make it more difficult for wealthy individuals to hide their wealth in London. Since the invasion, it has also targeted 18 Russian oligarchs with sanctions — fewer than the numbers targeted by the United States or European Union, but a dramatic change from the stance of previous British governments.

“Today’s sanctions show once again that oligarchs and kleptocrats have no place in our economy or society,” British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Thursday. “With their close links to Putin, they are complicit in his aggression.”

The best known of the wealthy Russians with assets in Britain is Abramovich, owner of one of world’s top sports franchises. Like other oligarchs, he built a fortune by gaining control of vast stores of resources, including oil and aluminum, that had been owned by the state before the Soviet Union’s collapse. He has stakes in steel giant Evraz and Norilsk Nickel.

In its sanctions rationale, the British government said Abramovich is “one of the few oligarchs from the 1990s to maintain prominence under Putin.” The government estimated his net worth at more than $12 billion.

Abramovich has previously denied having a close relationship with Putin.

When announcing that he wanted to sell the Chelsea club, Abramovich said proceeds would go to a foundation to benefit “all victims of the war in Ukraine.” Authorities in Moscow have banned the description of any deployment involving Russian armed forces as “war.”

Abramovich has also confirmed reports that he was contacted by Ukraine to help facilitate peace talks with Moscow. It is not clear what role he has played.

The others on the British sanctions list announced Thursday were Oleg Deripaska, a former business partner of Abramovich with stakes in En+ Group; Rosneft chief executive Igor Sechin; Gazprom chief executive Alexei Miller; Nikolai Tokarev, president of state-owned pipeline company Transneft; VTB Bank Chairman Andrey Kostin; and Bank Rossiya Chairman Dmitri Lebedev.

With its sanctions announcement, Britain’s foreign office tweeted — and then deleted — a picture of a different Dmitri — Dmitry Medvedev, the former Russian president.

Together, the seven Russians have a collective net worth of about $19.8 billion, the British government said. All are banned from travel to Britain and from doing business with British citizens or companies. Abramovich is the only one who has not also been sanctioned by the United States.

Anti-corruption activists said they would be watching closely to see whether the sanctions were enforced.

“It’s real progress, but we’re playing catch-up,” said Charlie Loudon, an international legal adviser at Redress, a human rights organization that is tracking sanctions. He added that while it’s “all well and good to put people on the sanctions list,” many activists are concerned about follow-through from the government and legal challenges from oligarchs with teams of lawyers. “You need to have lawyers and government officials to investigate their assets and make sure that these sanctions are being complied with,” he said.

Chelsea said Thursday that it would seek changes to the new operating rules.

“I know this brings some uncertainty,” Sports Secretary Nadine Dorries said. “But the government will work with the league and clubs to keep football being played while ensuring sanctions hit those intended.”

Abramovich bought Chelsea in 2003 for about $185 million and transformed the club. During his tenure as owner, Chelsea won five Premier League trophies, five FA Cups and the 2012 and 2021 UEFA Champions League titles, the biggest prize in global club soccer. Last month, Chelsea won the FIFA Club World Cup for the first time; among its top players is American Christian Pulisic, a star on the U.S. national team.

A handful of Premier League teams are owned or partly owned by Americans — Arsenal, Manchester United, Leeds United, Fulham — and a number of American names have been floated as potential buyers of Chelsea.

Billionaire Todd Boehly, a part-owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, Lakers and Sparks, quickly surfaced as a possible buyer, as did Robert “Woody” Johnson, owner of the New York Jets and the U.S. ambassador to Britain during the Trump administration.

The Chelsea Supporters’ Trust, a fan group, implored the government “to conduct a swift process to minimize the uncertainty over Chelsea’s future.” It also called for supporters “to be given a golden share as part of a sale of the club.”

Law360, London (March 10, 2022, 11:30 AM GMT) -- The British government ordered on Thursday that the assets of seven of Russia's wealthiest oligarchs should be frozen, including Roman Abramovich's Chelsea Football Club, as Britain steps up moves to sanction individuals close to Russian President Vladimir Putin.Foreign Secretary Liz Truss announced a full asset freeze and travel ban on influential oligarchs who have close connections with the Kremlin.

Abramovich’s one time business partner, leading industrialist Oleg Deripaska, also sanctioned with the same measures.

Putin’s right-hand man Igor Sechin and four more of Putin’s inner circle targeted with asset freeze and travel ban.

Economic Crime Bill coming into force next week will allow UK Government to move further and faster than ever on sanctions.

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has today (Thursday 10 March) announced a full asset freeze and travel ban on seven of Russia’s wealthiest and most influential oligarchs, whose business empires, wealth and connections are closely associated with the Kremlin.

As part of the UK’s leading efforts to isolate Putin and those around him, these oligarchs – who have a collective net worth of around £15bn – will have their assets in the UK frozen, they are banned from travelling here and no UK citizen or company may do business with them.

Those newly-sanctioned by the UK include Roman Abramovich, owner of Chelsea Football Club, worth more than £9 billion; leading industrialist Oleg Deripaska worth £2 billion, and Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin. A further group of Russia-based oligarchs close to Putin have also been placed under sanction. Those sanctioned today are:

Roman Abramovich owner of Chelsea FC and has stakes in steel giant Evraz and Norilsk Nickel

Oleg Deripaska has stakes in En+ Group

Igor Sechin is the Chief Executive of Rosneft

Andrey Kostin is Chairman of VTB bank

Alexei Miller is CEO of energy company Gazprom

Nikolai Tokarev is president of the Russia state-owned pipeline company Transneft

Dmitri Lebedev is Chairman of the Board of Directors of Bank Rossiya

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:

There can be no safe havens for those who have supported Putin’s vicious assault on Ukraine. Today’s sanctions are the latest step in the UK’s unwavering support for the Ukrainian people. We will be ruthless in pursuing those who enable the killing of civilians, destruction of hospitals and illegal occupation of sovereign allies.

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said:

Today’s sanctions show once again that oligarchs and kleptocrats have no place in our economy or society. With their close links to Putin they are complicit in his aggression. The blood of the Ukrainian people is on their hands. They should hang their heads in shame. Our support for Ukraine will not waver. We will not stop in this mission to ramp up the pressure on the Putin regime and choke off funds to his brutal war machine.

These sanctions are the latest step in the UK’s response to Putin’s illegal and unprovoked invasion, designed to ensure he fails in Ukraine by crippling Russia’s economy supporting his war machine. The UK has been at the forefront of this effort, shutting out large proportions of whole sectors of the Russian economy, such as its defence industry, its financial institutions and its transport sector. The UK has already sanctioned more than 200 of Russia’s most significant and high-value individuals, entities and subsidiaries since the invasion, with over 500 of them now covered by the UK’s sanctions list.

The Economic Crime Bill coming into force next week will also significantly simplify the process of imposing sanctions, allow the UK to more easily sanction individuals, stop oligarchs threatening the UK with multi-million pound lawsuits for damages at the taxpayer’s expense and also allow the UK to mirror allies’ designations. The UK will keep going further, faster and deeper to punish Putin’s regime for this callous war.

The UK will continue to lead global efforts to provide Ukraine with economic, diplomatic, humanitarian and defensive support.

Given the significant impact that today’s sanctions would have on Chelsea football club and the potential knock on effects of this, the Government has this morning published a licence which authorises a number of football-related activities to continue at Chelsea. This includes permissions for the club to continue playing matches and other football related activity which will in turn protect the Premier League, the wider football pyramid, loyal fans and other clubs. This licence will only allow certain explicitly named actions to ensure the designated individual is not able to circumvent UK sanctions. The licence will be kept under constant review and we will work closely with the football authorities.

Notes

Asset freeze: an asset freeze prevents any UK citizen, or any business in the UK, from dealing with any funds or economic resources which are owned, held or controlled by the designated person and which are held in the UK. It will also prevent funds or economic resources being provided to or for the benefit of the designated person.

Travel ban: a travel ban means that the designated person must be refused leave to enter or to remain in the United Kingdom, providing the individual to be an excluded person under section 8B of the Immigration Act 1971.

Transport sanctions: recently introduced powers make it a criminal offence for any Russian aircraft to fly or land in the UK, and give the Government powers to remove aircraft belonging to designated Russian individuals and entities from the UK aircraft register, even if the sanctioned individual is not on board. Russian ships are also banned from UK ports.

Roman Abramovich has stakes in steel giant Evraz, Norilsk Nickel and owns Chelsea FC. He sold a 73% stake in Russian oil firm Sibneft to state-owned gas titan Gazprom for £9.87 billion in 2005. His net worth is an estimated £9.4 billion. He is one of the few oligarchs from the 1990s to maintain prominence under Putin. None of our allies have yet sanctioned Abramovich. Oleg Deripaska has stakes in En+ Group, a major extractives and energy company which owns UC Rusal, one of the world’s major aluminium producers. He has a multi-million pound property portfolio in the UK. His net worth is an estimated £2 billion. The US designated Deripaska in 2018. Igor Sechin is the Chief Executive of Rosneft, a Russian state oil company and particularly close and influential ally of Putin. Sechin has been sanctioned by the US and EU. Andrey Kostin is Chairman of VTB bank, the second largest bank in Russia. VTB Bank was designated by the UK on 24 February 2022. Kostin is a close associate of Putin, and has long supported Kremlin objectives through VTB Bank. His net worth is an estimated £379 million. Kostin has been sanctioned by the US and EU. Alexei Miller is CEO of energy company Gazprom, making him one of the most important executives supporting the Russian Government. Miller served under Putin in the 1990s when Putin was deputy mayor in St Petersburg. Miller has been sanctioned by the US. Nikolai Tokarev is president of the Russia state-owned pipeline company Transneft. He first met Putin, when both served as KGB officers in Dresden in East Germany in the 1980s. They have remained closely associated ever since. Tokarev has been sanctioned by the US and EU. Dmitri Lebedev is Chairman of the Board of Directors of Bank Rossiya. The UK designated Bank Rossiya, widely considered to be the Kremlin’s private bank, on 22 February 2022. Lebedev was sanctioned by the US in 2016.
