Russian military forces have invaded Ukraine.

The wide-scale incursion began on Thursday, Feb. 24. Ukraine's military has claimed that Russia has faced steep casualties as a result of fierce fighting; the Russian Defense Ministry acknowledged Wednesday, March 2, that 498 Russian troops had been killed and another 1,597 injured in the ""special military operation.""

Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine began, an estimated 1 million have fled to neighboring E.U. states, according to the United Nations. Tens of thousands have also enlisted in the military in the week since Russia's invasion began. Ukraine's defense ministry reported Thursday, March 3, that they'd get help from roughly 16,000 military volunteers, too.

Russian and Ukrainian leaders held cease-fire negotiations on Monday, Feb. 28, but they ended with no breakthrough to end the fighting. A second round of talks Thursday, March 3, ended with an agreement to hold a third round ""very soon.""

The head of Russia's delegation said the countries had agreed to establish humanitarian corridors for the evacuation of civilians and agreed on the ""possibility"" of a temporary ceasefire during humanitarian operations.

U.S. officials had said for weeks that a Russian invasion of Ukraine was imminent, a warning that Russia, in turn, dismissed as scaremongering. U.S. President Joe Biden warned of a ""catastrophic loss of life and human suffering.""

The U.S. has joined international partners in levying heavy new sanctions against Russia's military and economy in the days since the invasion began. President Biden has said that Russian President Vladimir Putin and his country would bear the costs of the attack.

Why would Russia want to take Chernobyl? Few places conjure more foreboding than Chernobyl, the site of the deadly 1986 nuclear disaster. So alarm bells rang in the West when Russian forces seized the decommissioned power plant in the early hours of their invasion of Ukraine on Thursday. Why would Russia make a radioactive wasteland one of its very first targets in Ukraine? While the full answer may be known only to top officials in Moscow, the site happens to lie along one of the most direct paths to Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital. “The location is important because of where it sits,” retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, former commanding general of U.S. Army Europe, said in an interview. ""If Russian forces were attacking Kyiv from the north, Chernobyl is right there on the way, almost in the way."" Chernobyl is less than 10 miles from Ukraine's border with Belarus, a Russian ally where Moscow has been massing troops in preparation for its attack on Ukraine. From there, it's a relatively straight shot of about 80 miles south to Kyiv. Read the full story here. Share this -







Russia sanctions are a ‘big deal,’ experts say. But effects could take years. The flurry of sanctions the U.S. announced this week against Russia are some of the hardest-hitting that Moscow has ever faced, but the slow pain they inflict may not be enough to deter Putin from escalating his invasion of Ukraine, experts said. Biden and several U.S. allies, including the European Union, the United Kingdom and Japan, have vowed to review further restrictions on Moscow as punishment for the invasion. The sanctions that have already been announced are significant in size and scope, said former Treasury and State Department officials who handled U.S. sanctions in the past, but the longtime U.S. reliance on the national security tool has left the U.S. with few other options if Putin and Russia do not respond. Nevertheless, the Russian economy is already feeling the effects of war, and the sanctions could over time further cause the Russian stock market to falter, deflate the value of the ruble — which hit an all-time low Thursday — and make doing business in Russia increasingly difficult. “We’re counting a lot on sanctions, and the ones the Biden administration have put together are really pretty tough,” said Daniel Fried, a longtime diplomat and former ambassador to Poland who helped lead the West’s 2014 response to Moscow’s aggression against Ukraine as the State Department coordinator for sanctions policy. He called the recent sanctions ""a big deal."" Read the full story here. Share this -







Russia says it will support banks under sanctions Russia said its central bank will support banks affected by the sanctions the U.S. and other countries imposed this week. Leaders in Europe, Canada and the U.S. announced Thursday that they are committed to issuing severe economic sanctions following Putin's decision to attack Ukraine. Biden took aim at Putin by mounting pressure through Russia's economy, including the two largest majority state-owned institutions, Sberbank and VTB. Russia issued a statement through its central bank assuring that the state has a plan to remain functioning regardless of the sanctions. ""All operations of banks in rubles will be carried out, and the corresponding services will be provided to all customers as usual,"" the statement said. ""All customer funds in foreign currencies are also held and can be withdrawn in the account currency. The Bank of Russia is ready to support banks with funds in rubles and foreign currency."" A majority of the bank's balance at each bank is measured in rubles, the statement insists, and ""maintain a high margin of stability."" Share this -







Some Russians share black squares on social media to indicate anti-war stance Some well-known Russians have posted black squares on social media to publicly indicate their opposition to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Black squares were shared to show solidarity with the protests in the U.S. after the death of George Floyd nearly two years ago. And Thursday, many Russians appeared to use the same tactic to show their support for the country's anti-war movement. Television host and comedian Ivan Urgant posted “Fear and pain. NO to war"" on Instagram, alongside a black square, for his 9.9 million followers. Maxim Galkin, a Russian singer and comedian, posted the same black square for his 9.4 million Instagram followers, writing: ""There can be no justification for war! No War!"" Two-time Olympic figure skating silver medalist Evgenia Medvedevа wrote over a black background on her Instagram story, ""I hope this all ends as soon as possible, like a bad dream,"" placing a white dove emoji below the text for her 1.3 million followers. Former television host Xenia Sobchak, whose father was a mentor to Putin, posted the black square to Instagram for her millions of followers. ""We are all now locked in this situation. No exit. We, the Russians, will be dealing with the consequences of today for many years to come,"" she wrote. Share this -

Conductor Valery Gergiev, a Putin supporter, replaced ahead of Carnegie Hall performance Russian conductor Valery Gergiev, a known friend and supporter of Putin’s, will no longer lead a series of concerts this weekend at Carnegie Hall. Carnegie Hall and the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra announced Thursday that the Canadian conductor Yannick Nézet-Séguin will step in for Gergiev, leading the orchestra in three concerts at Carnegie Hall from Friday through Sunday. No reason was cited for Gergiev’s removal from the program; his relationship with Putin reflects the global denunciation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Daniel Froschauer, the orchestra’s chairman, called Gergiev a gifted artist and said he would take the podium for the Carnegie dates. “He’s going as a performer, not a politician,” Froschauer said. Carnegie Hall and the orchestra also said the Russian pianist Denis Matsuev, who had been scheduled to perform with Gergiev and the orchestra Friday, would not appear. Share this -







Russian forces have moved closer to Kyiv, fired more than 160 missiles, says U.S. defense official Russia has launched more than 160 missiles since it began striking Ukraine, a senior U.S. defense official said. Russian troops, meanwhile, have moved closer to Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, the official said Thursday, adding that the country has also sent additional airborne troops to Kharkiv, where fighting is ongoing. As part of its response to Russia's aggression and in support of its NATO allies, the U.S will deploy 7,000 more troops to Germany from Fort Carson, Colorado, the Defense Department said.

U.S. sanctions also target Belarus for supporting Russia The new round of sanctions against Russia that Biden unveiled Thursday also targets another country: Belarus. The measures take aim at Belarusian state-owned banks and the country's defense and security industries, as well as a number of its ""regime-connected officials and elites,"" for their support of Russia's invasion, according to the Treasury Department. The White House said in a statement, ""We call on Belarus to withdraw its support for Russian aggression in Ukraine."" Biden announced the latest round of sanctions just hours after the United Kingdom slapped similar sanctions on Belarus, as well as Russia. Other U.S. allies are expected to follow suit. Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus and a close ally of Putin's, said Thursday that troops from his country could be used in further Russian military operations in Ukraine if necessary, local media reported.

U.S. expels No. 2 ranking Russian diplomat The second-highest ranking Russian diplomat is being expelled from the U.S. in retaliation for a similar move made by Russia earlier this month, a senior State Department official told NBC News Thursday. Sergey Trepelkov is the second-highest ranking diplomat at the Russian Embassy in Washington, D.C., under Ambassador Antoly Antonov. The move is not a response to the Ukraine invasion, the State Department official said, but is instead a counter to Russia ousting U.S. Deputy Chief of Mission Bart Gorman earlier this month. Gorman had not completed his three-year diplomatic tour before being told to leave Russia. “We believe it is critical that our countries have the necessary diplomatic personnel in place to facilitate communication between our governments,” the official said. “However, we will not let actions like this go without a response and today, we have announced our response.” Share this -

Putin using false 'Nazi' narrative in attack on Ukraine, experts say Putin peddled accusations of Nazi elements within Ukraine on Thursday to justify the Russian attack, a move that experts slammed as slanderous and false. In announcing he had launched Russian forces against key Ukrainian military and logistics posts, Putin said he's striving for ""the demilitarization and denazification"" of the sovereign democracy in Kyiv. David Harris, the CEO of the American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group, said he's confident that Putin's Nazi narrative ""won't work."" ""First, Ukraine is led by a Jewish president, who was overwhelmingly chosen by voters in a democratic election. It reflects today's Ukrainian mindset and outlook, a far cry from the past,"" Harris said. ""And second, the ones behaving like Nazis are, let's be clear, Putin and his regime. Brazenly invading another country, invoking fake grievances, lying incessantly and denying another nation's right to chart its own destiny are all, yes, taken from the Nazi playbook.""

European leaders not interested in pulling Russia out of SWIFT, Biden says Pulling Russia out of the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or SWIFT, is not an option European leaders are currently pursuing, Biden told reporters on Thursday. ""The sanctions that were proposed on all their banks have equal consequence — maybe more consequences — than SWIFT number one,"" Biden said. ""Number two, it is always an option. But right now, that's not the position that the rest of Europe wishes to take."" SWIFT is a secure messaging system that links more than 11,000 financial institutions in over 200 countries and territories. Removing Russia from the coalition would prevent the country from making most international transactions but could also hurt other economies. Share this -

Biden announces stronger round of sanctions against Russia Biden on Thursday announced a new, stronger round of sanctions against Russia in response to the nation’s invasion of Ukraine that he said are designed to “maximize the long-term impact” on the country. “Putin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war. And now he and his country will bear the consequences,” Biden said during a speech from the White House. The sanctions, undertaken in conjunction with U.S. allies, will “stunt the ability to grow and finance” the Russian military and will include new limits on what can be exported to Russia. 'Putin is the aggressor': Biden announces sanctions in response to Russian attacks on Ukraine Feb. 24, 2022 04:23 The new round of sanctions will target four additional major Russian Banks, including VTB, a state-owned bank in Russia and the second-largest bank in Russia. The measures will not include removing Russian from SWIFT, Biden said. Biden added that the U.S. and its allies would add names to the list of Russian elites and their family members” who have already been targeted individually with sanctions. Share this -

On TikTok, livestreams show protests — and attract scams Livestreams on TikTok are bringing a first-person view of the conflict from all over Europe — but some of the streams purporting to come from Ukraine appeared to be fake. Some of the livestreams appear to be authentic, showing crowds gathered in major cities to protest Russian aggression. But other TikTok users are pretending to be in Ukraine, using doctored or dubbed footage of other places in an attempt to solicit followers and monetary donations. One account, which called for donations through TikTok, featured a livestream of a line of houses in a residential area as the sounds of gunshots, sirens and people screaming for help could be heard in the background. But that account hours earlier had posted a different angle of the same street in which cars with U.K. license plates were visible. Other videos posted to TikTok appear to be recycling old video and passing it off as coming from Ukraine. In one video viewed almost 20 million times on TikTok and posted about two hours after the first reports of shellings in Ukraine, a soldier is seen parachuting out of an airplane. “Bro is recording an invasion,” the top comment reads. The video is from a training exercise, first posted to an Instagram account by a user with the same username on April 6, 2016. The user on TikTok was seen later on Tuesday livestreaming on his couch.

U.S. defense official: Russians fired more than 100 missiles in opening phase of invasion A senior defense official, as part of operational update in the situation in Ukraine, told NBC News that the initial phase of Russia's invasion of Ukraine began around 9:30 p.m. ET, with sea- and land-based missile launches. More than 100 Russian missiles – including short range ballistic missiles, medium range ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, surface to air missiles and sea missiles launched from the Black Sea – were fired in the initial salvo, the official said. Targets have so far been military and air defenses, barracks, ammunition depots, and 10 airfields, the official said, adding that there is no clear understanding of the level of casualties on either side.

Russia will also use cruise missile strikes to target government buildings, including in civilian population centers, the official said, citing the U.S. assessment of Russia’s next moves.

Ukraine invasion jeopardizes U.S.-Russia space cooperation Russia's invasion of Ukraine is already causing tension in the space community, one of the few global arenas in which the U.S. and Russia still cooperate.

Rogozin also tweeted “Glory to Russia!” on Monday, after Russian President Vladimir Putin gave a televised speech with misleading claims that Ukraine is “historically Russian land” and false claims the country has fallen into the hands of neo-Nazis and corrupt “puppets” controlled by the West. NASA said in a statement that the agency is carrying out spaceflight operations as normal: “NASA continues working with Roscosmos and our other international partners in Canada, Europe, and Japan to maintain safe and continuous International Space Station operations.” Share this -

Russian disinformation, propaganda ramp up as conflict in Ukraine grows Russia’s effort to spread disinformation and propaganda across the internet and through foreign and domestic media about its invasion of Ukraine started weeks ago — and it’s expected to ramp up now that the conflict has begun. Disinformation experts say that they have seen a concerted effort from Russian leaders and state-backed media to push a false narrative around the reasons for invading Ukraine, and that they expect that to continue as both international pressure and even some domestic Russian resistance to war grows. “We’re going to see a huge onslaught,” said Jane Lytvynenko, senior research fellow at Harvard University’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy. “And we need to be prepared for that.” Lytvynenko said people should be prepared for a wide variety of disinformation and propaganda, including the use of authentic images and video to push false narratives.

Russia isolated as 'Iron Curtain' falls down, Zelenskyy says Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy offered citizens details of military resistance in his latest update on Thursday, while continuing to urge Russian citizens to push back in protest against Putin. Zelenskyy praised the work of Ukrainian forces at the Russian border while calling the fight in the southern part of the nation ""complicated"" in remarks posted on Telegram. He also expressed optimism in his country's defense. ""The sounds that we hear today are not only missile strikes, explosions and rockets — it’s the sound of the Iron Curtain falling down and closing Russia from the other civilized world,"" Zelenskyy said. He renewed calls for Ukrainian citizens to aid territorial defense forces, asking anyone with military experience to offer themselves in the effort. Switching to Russian, Zelenskyy spoke of the sanctions he has asked for from world leaders in retaliation to Putin's military operation. He urged Russians to voice their dissent and called the suggested sanctions ""the most powerful"" in world history.

U.S. defense official: Russians 'making a move' on Kyiv The Russian invasion of Ukraine has so far focused on three main axes of assault – all of which have been assessed to have the intention of taking key population centers – and Putin's forces are ""making a move on Kyiv,"" a senior defense official told NBC News. The first axis is a south-to-north approach from Crimea to Kherson; the second axis is a north-central to south approach from Belarus to Kyiv; and the third axis is a northeast to south approach occurring around Kharkiv, where the heaviest fighting is currently occurring, the official said. The official disclosed the information as part of an operational update on the situation in Ukraine. Russia is “making a move on Kyiv,” the official said, adding that the the U.S. assessment of Putin’s actions indicate that Russia has “every intention of basically decapitating the government and installing their own method of governance.” “We have not been surprised so far with what we have seen them do,” the official said. “It is very much in line with what was expected.” Russia’s actions so far indicate that its invasion is still only in its initial phase, the official said. Russia’s military operation will include multiple phases, but the U.S. does not currently know how many phases the invasion will include – or how long the phases will take. Share this -







SWIFT banking system could be used as sanction against Russia. What is it? In recent weeks, President Joe Biden has threatened Russian President Vladimir Putin with ""severe economic consequences"" and sanctions like ""he's never seen"" if Russia invades Ukraine. Now, with Putin taking military action against Ukraine, Biden and U.S. allies may consider imposing one of the harshest financial penalties against Russia: kicking it out of the SWIFT banking system. But doing so, which some financial analysts have likened to a ""nuclear option,"" would be an unprecedented move against one of the world's largest economies. The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or SWIFT, is a cooperative of financial institutions formed in 1973 and headquartered in Belgium.

Explosions, sirens heard in Kyiv as Russia launches attacks on key Ukrainian cities Russia launched attacks on multiple cities in Ukraine on Wednesday evening, a decisive escalation after months of military buildup that stirred dire warnings from the United States and its allies. NBC News reporters in the central capital of Kyiv and the northeast city of Kharkiv reported hearing loud explosions or thuds just minutes after Putin said in a public address that he had authorized a military action against Ukraine. Journalists in other cities also reported hearing explosions. Putin said he was taking action to “demilitarize” Ukraine because the West had pushed too far in trying to draw the country into the NATO alliance and had threatened Russian-speakers in eastern Ukraine. “I urge you to immediately lay down your weapons and go home,” Putin said, speaking to Ukrainian soldiers during a special televised address.

Sen. Mitt Romney slams Russia, past U.S. foreign policy Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, slammed Russia and past U.S. foreign policy under both Democratic and Republican presidents in a statement late Wednesday night. ""Putin's Ukraine invasion is the first time in 80 years that a great power has moved to conquer a sovereign nation. It is without justification, without provocation and without honor,"" he said.

""And when you listen, when you read the news coming through the Ukrainian officials, they are talking about airfields that have been hit command and control centers that have been hit.""

Putin says he is fighting a resurgence of Nazism. That's not true. Putin's rationalization for invading Ukraine includes a claim that he is fighting neo-Nazism. ""It is not surprising that Ukrainian society was faced with the rise of far-right nationalism, which rapidly developed into aggressive Russophobia and neo-Nazism,"" Putin said Monday, suggesting that NATO countries are backing neo-Nazis. While it's true that the Ukrainian National Guard is home to the Azov Battalion — a force populated by neo-Nazis — there is no evidence to suggest widespread support for such extreme-right nationalism in the government, military or electorate. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is Jewish; three of his family members were killed in the Holocaust. In the most recent Ukrainian parliamentary elections in 2019, a coalition of ultranationalist right-wing parties failed to win even a single seat in the Rada, the country's 450-member legislature. And for several years, U.S. appropriations laws have included a provision banning spending in support of the Azov Battalion. But in accusing Ukraine of pro-Nazi sentiment, Putin is playing to generations-old scars from World War II, when his country was allied with the U.S., Britain and other countries in defeating the Axis powers. According to the World War II museum in New Orleans, an estimated 24 million Russians died in that war. Share this -

He has absolutely no right to invade Ukraine’s sovereign borders and impose Russia’s will on the freedom-loving people of Ukraine,"" Cramer said in a statement. “We needed sanctions months ago to ward off exactly this type of action. Now that Putin has taken these steps we must implement strong, primary and secondary sanctions immediately,” he added. “Our response here is greater than Russia and Ukraine; what we choose to do will also send a message to China on Taiwan.” Share this -

'Not thinking about the stock market': Why sanctions are unlikely to stop Putin After months of threats, the United States and its allies moved swiftly to sanction Russia after President Vladimir Putin ordered troops into eastern Ukraine, a move President Joe Biden said amounted to “the beginning of a Russian invasion.” The question now is whether those measures will do anything to damage — or deter — the Russian leader, who has taken Europe to the brink of a devastating new conflict. The first salvo of Western sanctions targeted large Russian banks, oligarchs with close ties to the Kremlin, a key gas pipeline and a host of other individuals. The European Union is set to unveil its own, with reports suggesting they may go even further. But while leaders in Washington, Europe and Asia were able to present a united front against Moscow's aggression, officials and analysts say it's unlikely the sanctions will do anything to deter Putin from pursuing a large-scale invasion of Ukraine.

5,a5b73751-70ae-4265-b7eb-a8e6891e62d2,"['About The Author', '...View Detail']",2022-02-24 12:48:10+05:30,"Russia launched a 'military operation' against Ukraine - effectively an invasion - early Thursday morning, triggering global fears of a major multi-national armed conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the attack in a televised address, which follows his declaration that a 2015 peace deal agreed to stop fighting over breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk - is invalid.

What followed was reports of explosions and missile strikes at key Ukraine cities, including capital Kyiv and in rebel areas of Donetsk and Luhansk.

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenksy has claimed Russia had massed nearly 200,000 troops on his country's borders.

So far, Russia has claimed the destruction of airbases and air defences, while Ukrainian military says it has shot down six Russian aircraft in Luhansk.

Ukraine has also claimed that it has killed ‘at least 50 Russian occupiers’. Over 40 Ukrainian soldiers and 10 civilians are believed to have also died so far.

Russia's actions have been condemned by almost all major nations, including the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Canada. UN chief Antonio Guterres has urged Putin to stop the war ‘in the name of humanity’, warning of devastating consequences for Ukraine and the world.

Why has Russia attacked Ukraine?

Russia believes Ukraine is moving closer and closer to the West via both the NATO, or North Atlantic Treaty Alliance, and the European Union.

Ukraine is not a member of NATO but has cooperated with the alliance and frequently expressed its intention to sign up.

Putin, however, is aware Ukraine joining NATO significantly increases the difficulty of bringing Donetsk and Luhansk within his control. He has also frequently accused Ukraine of being a 'puppet' in the hands of the West.

The removal of pro-Russian Viktor Yanukovych as President of Ukraine - he was voted out by the Ukrainian parliament in February 2014 - triggered Russia's annexation of the strategically valuable Crimea peninsula eight years ago.

A former member of the Soviet Republic - it gained independence only in 1991 - Ukraine still has deep social, historical, cultural, and political ties to Russia, but relations have been strained since 2014.

Fearing it could be surrounded by what it sees as hostile forces if Ukraine joins NATO, or moves any closer to the West, the Kremlin has demanded guarantees NATO will not accept it or other former members of the Soviet Republic.

Western countries, and NATO, have dismissed such fears, but Putin is clearly not buying their statements.

Russia's defiance in the face of sanctions

The US, the European Union, the UK and other countries have all slapped sanctions on Russia, targeting its banks (to cut funding to operations in rebel regions) and the lawmakers who approved the use of force.

Read: Canada imposes sanctions on Russia, says Trudeau

Putin, however, seems unconcerned.

Earlier this week Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov brushed off the threat of sanctions, saying, ""We're used to it. We know that sanctions will be imposed anyway, in any case. With or without reason.""

""They are already threatening us with all manner of sanctions or, as they say now, 'the mother of all sanctions',"" he said.

Read: What are sanctions and how could Western countries target Russia

Putin is also possibly secure in the knowledge that the US and other western nations will think twice (and maybe thrice) before deploying troops themselves, and risk turning this conflict into a potentially global one.

The threat of a prolonged military operation is something Putin can sustain almost indefinitely, if he is willing to pay the cost of keeping a large number of troops and equipment in the field, according to two retired US military commanders quoted in a report by Bloomberg.

As he launched the ‘military operation’, Putin said: “Whoever tries to interfere with us, and even more so to create threats for our country… Russia's response will lead you to consequences you have never experienced in your history.”

While diplomats at U.N. headquarters were making pleas for Russia to back off — “Give peace a chance,” Secretary-General Antonio Guterres implored — Russian President Vladimir Putin went on television in his homeland to announce a military operation that he said was intended to protect civilians in Ukraine.

Putin warned other countries that any effort to interfere with the Russian operation would lead to “consequences they have never seen.”

The council, where Russia holds the rotating presidency this month, gathered Wednesday night hours after Russia said rebels in eastern Ukraine had asked Moscow for military assistance. Fears that Russia was laying the groundwork for war bore out about a half hour later.

“It's too late, my dear colleagues, to speak about de-escalation,” Ukrainian Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya told the council. “I call on every one of you to do everything possible to stop the war.”

Follow full coverage of Russia-Ukraine crisis here

In a spontaneous exchange not often seen in the council chamber, Kyslytsya challenged his Russian counterpart to say that his country wasn't at that very moment bombing and shelling Ukraine or moving troops into it.

“You have a smartphone. You can call” officials in Moscow, Kyslytsya said.

“I have already said all I know at this point,"" Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia responded.

He added that he didn't plan to wake up Russia's foreign minister — and said that what was happening was not a war but a “special military operation.”

Kyslytsya dismissed that description outside the meeting as “lunatic sematics.”

At the council's second emergency meeting this week on Ukraine, members found themselves delivering prepared speeches that were instantly outdated. Some ultimately reacted in a second round of hastily added remarks.

“At the exact time as we are gathered in the council seeking peace, Putin delivered a message of war, in total disdain for the responsibility of this council,” U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said.

She added that a draft resolution would be put circulated to the council Thursday.

The resolution would declare that Russia is violating the U.N. Charter, international law and a 2015 council resolution on Ukraine, a European diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the discussions were private. The resolution would urge Russia to come back into compliance immediately, the diplomat said.

Earlier Wednesday, diplomats from dozens of countries took the floor at the U.N. General Assembly to deplore Russia’s actions toward Ukraine and plead for dialogue, while Russia and ally Syria defended Moscow's moves.

Echoing a narrative being broadcast to Russians at home, Nebenzia portrayed his country as responding to the plight of beleaguered people in the breakaway areas. Russia claims Ukraine is engaging in violence and oppression, which Ukraine denies.

“The root of today’s crisis around Ukraine is the actions of Ukraine itself,” he told the council Wednesday.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba implored countries to use tough economic sanctions, strong messages and “active diplomacy” to get Russia to back off. A lackluster response would jeopardize not only Ukraine but the concept of international law and global security, he warned.

Meeting a day after Western powers and some other countries imposed new sanctions on Russia, the 193-member General Assembly didn't take any collective action. But the comments from nearly 70 nations, with more scheduled for Monday, represented the broadest forum of global sentiment since the crisis dramatically escalated this week.

Russia seized Ukraine's Crimea Peninsula in 2014, and pro-Russia rebels have since been fighting Ukrainian forces in the eastern areas of Donetsk and Luhansk. More than 14,000 people have been killed in the conflict.

After weeks of rising tension as Moscow massed over 150,000 troops on Ukraine's borders, Putin on Monday recognized the two regions' independence and ordered Russian forces there for what he called “peacekeeping.""

Guterres disputed that, saying the troops were entering another country without its consent.

By the end of the night Wednesday, as explosions were heard in Kyiv and other cities across Ukraine, Guterres' appeal to “give peace a chance” had become a darker and more desperate plea.

“President Putin, in the name of humanity, bring your troops back to Russia,"" the secretary-general said in remarks to reporters. ""In the name of humanity, do not allow to start in Europe what could be the worst war since the beginning of this century.”",https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/its-too-late-unusual-exchange-at-un-meet-as-russia-decides-to-attack-ukraine-101645680345921.html

A draft statement seen by the Guardian, to be finalised by EU leaders meeting later on Thursday night, condemns “the involvement of Belarus in this aggression against Ukraine” and calls on Minsk to abide by its international obligations. The document states: The European Council [of EU leaders] calls for the swift preparation of a further sanctions package that will also cover Belarus. Belarus is already subject to EU sanctions, targeting individuals and sectors of its economy, following President Alexander Lukashenko’s brutal crackdown on peaceful protesters in 2020. The draft text repeats EU warnings that Russia will be hit with further sanctions that “impose massive and severe consequences” - but does not spell out what those measures are. That has to agreed by the EU’s 27 leaders meeting in Brussels on Thursday evening.

24 Feb 2022 07.25 Johnson says UK and its allies will ‘hobble Russian economy’ with sanctions The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, has said the UK will respond with “a massive package of sanctions” that will “hobble the Russian economy”. Ukraine is a country that for decades has enjoyed freedom and democracy and the right to choose its own destiny. We and the world cannot allow that freedom just to be snuffed out. We cannot and will not just look away ... Today, in concert with our allies, we will agree a massive package of economic sanctions designed in time to hobble the Russian economy. And to that end, we must also collectively cease the dependence on Russian oil and gas that for too long has given Putin his grip on western politics. Our mission is clear; diplomatically politically, economically, and eventually, military, this hideous and barbaric venture of Vladimir Putin must end in failure.

24 Feb 2022 07.12 Russia invading on multiple fronts, says former Ukrainian defence minister Luke Harding Our correspondent Luke Harding, who is in Kyiv, has spoken to Andriy Zagorodnyuk, Ukraine’s former defence minister. Zagorodnyuk describes multiple ground invasions on several fronts. The situation is extremely tense, obviously. The first shock this morning was when there were missile attacks, rocket strikes and drone strikes. Some of the buildings in our armed forces are simply destroyed. All of them are military infrastructure. They [the Russians] are trying to break the border and to enter into the country with their ground forces. Ukrainian armed forces are trying to stop them. The city of Mariupol is pretty quiet. There is no breakthrough attempt. At the joint forces operation line [between Ukrainian and separatist forces] there is lots of artillery but no attempt to break through. He adds: There are thrusts taking place. They are quite close to the city of Kherson now. The situation is really critical there. They are also trying to surround Kharkiv. It seems like Kharkiv at the moment is the main target. They also try to get to Kyiv using one battlefield group. The group went from Belarus and it was stopped. There’s quite a bad road [to Kyiv]. It was strange that they sent such a small group on such a road. Clearly it was miscalculation on their side for the moment. There were some Russian losses and on our side. Ukrainian armed forces are fighting quite seriously. There is no panic. There are attempts to resist and in many directions it’s working out.

24 Feb 2022 06.37 EU vows 'massive' sanctions on Russia The European Union has pledged to impose “massive” sanctions that have severe consequences on Russia. A statement just issued by the European Council, ahead of emergency talks between the EU’s 27 leaders on Thursday night, said: We condemn in the strongest possible terms Russia’s unprecedented military aggression against Ukraine. By its unprovoked and unjustified military actions, Russia is grossly violating international law and undermining European and global security and stability. We also condemn the involvement of Belarus in this aggression against Ukraine and call on it to abide by its international obligations. We demand that Russia immediately ceases military actions, unconditionally withdraws all forces and military equipment from the entire territory of Ukraine and fully respects Ukraine’s territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence. Such use of force and coercion has no place in the 21st century. We will meet later today to discuss this blatant aggression and agree in principle on further restrictive measures that will impose massive and severe consequences on Russia for its action, in close coordination with our transatlantic partners. The EU also said it stood “firmly by Ukraine and its people as they face this war”, with promises of further political, financial and humanitarian assistance. 01:59 'Among the darkest hours for Europe': EU reacts as Russia invades Ukraine – video

24 Feb 2022 05.56 Ukraine urges Turkey to close Russian access to Bosphorus Ruth Michaelson Ukraine has requested that Turkey close the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits to Russian warships, which use the passages to enter the Black Sea, reports the Guardian’s Ruth Michaelson. Turkey alone controls the straits according to the 1936 Montreux Convention, which stipulates that warships belonging to nations bordering the Black Sea may pass through, while others may pass for a limited time only if they satisfy certain conditions mostly based on tonnage. According to Turkish outlet Hurriyet, Ukraine’s Ambassador to Ankara Vasyl Bodnar reiterated the request to halt Russian access to the straits at a press conference this morning: “We conveyed our official request to the Turkish side regarding the closure of the airspace, the Dardanelles [Strait] and Bosphorus [Strait] for Russian ships,” he said, adding that Ukraine is also requesting that Turkey sanction Russian business and a wider request for Turkish support. He added: We call on you to prevent the aggression in question. Today, Ukraine is protecting your security. Turkey, a Nato member and ally of both Ukraine and Russia as well as a major recipient of Russian natural gas, is attempting to appease both sides of the conflict despite recently strengthening ties with Ukraine including through weapons sales.

Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has repeatedly proposed a trilateral summit between Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Turkey, including during a visit to Kiev earlier this month. Turkey has also sold Ukraine its Bayraktar TB2 drones. Baykar, the Turkish company which produces Bayraktar drones, last year began plans to build training and maintenance centres for existing drones in Ukraine as well as factories to jointly produce new drones, a deal which risked angering Moscow.

Erdoğan and Putin spoke by phone yesterday, where Erdoğan told Putin that Turkey would “not recognise any step against Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.” According to AFP, Erdoğan told journalists on a return flight from Africa yesterday that Turkey would seek to maintain its alliances with both Ukraine and Russia. It is not possible for us to give up on both. We have political and military relations with Russia. We also have political, military and economic ties with Ukraine. We want this issue to be resolved without us having to choose between the two.
