According to the Kremlin, the Russian president spoke from “extrajudicial killings of opponents”from “civilian hostages” and their “use as human shields”as well as the “deployment of heavy weapons in residential areas, near hospitals, schools and kindergartens”.

These assertions, however, are “lies”, reacted the Elysée at the end of this 75-minute discussion, the second in three days. The exchange took place “focused” at the request of Paris and Berlin to“an immediate ceasefire and the beginning of a diplomatic solution”, separately specified the French presidency and the German chancellery. Before this call, Emmanuel Macron and Olaf Scholz had each had an interview with Ukrainian President Voldymyr Zelensky, who asked them to intervene with Vladimir Putin so that the fighting immediately ceased. The situation has become critical in Mariupol, a strategic port in southeastern Ukraine that has been besieged for 12 days, and several medical establishments have been hit by shelling in the past few hours.

The French president told his Russian counterpart that “the exactions of the Russian army had to stop” and that the “violations” of “the worst way” could be, “within the meaning of international law and subject to the ongoing investigation”, “classified as war crimes”.

Paris: Moscow's accusations of violations of humanitarian law ""lies"" by Kiev

The French presidency considered that Russian President Vladimir Putin's accusation of Ukrainian forces of violating humanitarian law is nothing more than ""lies"", following a phone call Saturday between the Russian President, his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

The Elysee said that during this call, which lasted for an hour and a quarter, the French president and the German chancellor renewed Russia's call for an ""immediate ceasefire and the start of a diplomatic solution.""

Prior to this call, Macron and Schulze spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who asked them to intervene with President Putin to immediately stop the fighting as the Russian military tightens its noose around Kyiv and continues to bomb other cities.

Zelensky also asked them to help release the mayor of the Ukrainian city of Melitopol, who was kidnapped by the Russians on Friday, according to Kyiv.

The Elysee also noted that ""the situation is very difficult and unsustainable in humanitarian terms"" in the strategic port city of Mariupol, which has been besieged for nearly two weeks, and ""the only decision that President Putin has to take is to lift the siege.""

As for Paris, Putin repeated ""lies"" when he spoke on the call of ""blatant violations"" of human rights committed by the Ukrainian military, which uses civilians as ""human shields"".

Emmanuel Macron responded that the Russian army's ""excesses must stop"" and that its ""abuses"" could ""constitute war crimes... under international law.""

At the end of this conversation, which was described as ""very frank and difficult"" and comes at a ""tragic moment"", Emmanuel Macron said that he was ""determined to use all the possibilities of diplomacy, specifically the very difficult dialogue"" with Vladimir Putin, but also sanctions ""which are of a historical nature"".

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday slammed what he said was the ""flagrant violation"" of international humanitarian law by Ukraine's forces as he held phone talks with the leaders of France and Germany, the Kremlin said.

""Putin informed (them) about the real state of affairs"" in Ukraine, his office said in a statement. ""In particular, numerous examples of the flagrant violation of the norms of international humanitarian law by Ukrainian security forces were cited,"" the statement said.

Putin accused the Ukrainian army of ""extrajudicial executions of dissenters"" and ""taking hostages and using civilians as human shields"", the Kremlin said.

He also claimed that the Ukrainian army were deploying heavy weapons near hospitals, schools, and kindergartens.

""At the same time, nationalist battalions are systematically disrupting operations to rescue the population, intimidating civilians during evacuation attempts,"" the Kremlin said.

Putin urged France's Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Olaf Scholz to pressure Kyiv authorities into halting these ""criminal activities,"" the Kremlin said.

The Russian president also informed Macron and Scholz about talks between Russian and Ukrainians negotiators.

""In this connection the leaders of the three countries addressed some issues related to the agreements being worked out on the implementation of well-known Russian demands,"" the Kremlin said without providing any details.

The source said that since the three leaders last spoke on Thursday, Putin seemed to still be ""determined to achieve his objectives in Ukraine,"" but that the fact that he continues to speak to the French and German leaders suggests that ""he does not exclude the possibility of a diplomatic solution altogether.”

A source close to Macron and familiar with the conversation told CNN's Jim Acosta that Macron was disappointed with Putin's ""insincerity"" during the call, but that the French president remains committed to diplomatic solutions to end the conflict, including coordinated sanctions, banning Russia from activity within the international community, and a “continued firm and denuding dialogue.”

Earlier Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asked Macron to press Putin for a ceasefire and to raise the issue of the detention of the mayor of Melitopol. The source said Macron and Scholz had done so.

""We pleaded for an immediate ceasefire,"" the source said, ""and for the start of negotiations on three points: the questions relative to security, those that relate to Ukrainian sovereignty and third, those issues raised by both Ukraine and Russia recently.""

Further sanctions are being planned by both the G7 and the European Union, the source said. The fresh European sanctions will be discussed next week in Brussels and will be aimed at sanctioning recent actions by Russian troops in Ukraine, the siege of Mariupol and the advance of Russian troops along the Dniepr River.

Asked about the possibility of European sanctions on Russian energy exports, the source repeated what Macron had said at the leader's summit in Versailles on Friday that nothing was ""taboo,"" with no option off the table.

Last February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a special military operation to Ukraine with the objective of demilitarization and denazification. The Kremlin demanded that Kiev have a non-aligned and non-nuclear status and recognize Crimea as part of Russia.

The Russian special military operation was launched responding to the request made by the heads of the self-proclaimed Lugansk and Donetsk People's Republic. Earlier, on February 21, Moscow announced that it recognized the independence and sovereignty of the LPR and DPR.",https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/Putin-Macron-and-Scholzs-Phone-Talks-on-Ukraine-20220312-0007.html

In a video address posted on social media late Saturday night, President Volodymyr Zelensky said nevertheless the Russians did not have the strength or spirit to conquer Ukraine.

""The Russian invaders cannot conquer us. They do not have such strength. They do not have such spirit. They are holding only on violence. Only on terror. Only on weapons, which they have a lot,"" he said.

A convoy of humanitarian aid headed for Mariupol had been blocked at a Russian checkpoint, but it was hoped it could reach the city Sunday, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said.

The strategic port, in particular, is facing what Ukraine says is a ""humanitarian catastrophe"", with more than 1,500 civilians killed.

Attempts to evacuate hundreds of thousands of civilians have repeatedly failed.

""Mariupol is still surrounded, that which they cannot have by war, (the Russians) want to have by hunger and despair. Since they cannot bring down the Ukrainian army, they target the population,"" a French military source said.

A top Russian officer described the situation in stark language.

""Unfortunately, the humanitarian situation in Ukraine is continuing to deteriorate rapidly, and in some cities, it has reached catastrophic proportions,"" said the head of the Russian National Defence Control Centre, Mikhail Mizintsev.

In his video address, Zelensky appealed for more aid.

""I keep reiterating to our allies and friends abroad; they have to keep doing more for our country, for Ukrainians and Ukraine. Because it is not only for Ukraine, but it is for all of Europe,"" he said.

City under siege

The Russians have advanced far enough to raise fears of Kyiv becoming encircled imminently.

Other cities have already fallen or been surrounded since Russia invaded its neighbour on February 24, with civilians targeted in what the United Nations warned could amount to war crimes.

The key southern port of Odessa was preparing for an offensive by Russian troops, who were concentrating about a hundred kilometres (60 miles) to the east in the city of Mykolaiv.

Mykolaiv, which lies on the road to the strategic port city, has been under attack for days, and an AFP reporter said a hospital there came under fire.

Zelensky said ""about 1,300"" Ukrainian soldiers had been killed since February 24, giving his country's first official toll.

He claimed Russia had lost about 12,000 troops while Moscow, for its part, has only given a toll of 498 dead, released on March 2.

At least 579 civilians have been killed, according to a tally Saturday by the United Nations, which stressed that its figures were probably much lower than reality.

The United Nations estimates that almost 2.6 million people have fled Ukraine since the invasion, most of them to Poland, in Europe's worst refugee crisis since World War II.

In Kyiv, only the roads to the south remain open and the city is preparing to mount a ""relentless defence"", according to the Ukrainian presidency.

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said the capital, described by a senior Ukrainian official Friday as a ""city under siege"", was reinforcing defences and stockpiling food and medicine.

Britain's ministry of defence estimated that Russian forces were about 25 kilometres from the capital on Saturday and that a column north of the city had dispersed, reinforcing the indication of an attempt to encircle it.

However, the Russians are encountering resistance from the Ukrainian army to both the east and west of the capital, according to AFP journalists on the spot.

Ukrainian soldiers said they believe the Russians have overestimated their resources, in terms of troops and equipment, and underestimated those of their opponent.

""They have to camp in villages in temperatures of nearly minus 10 Celsius at night. They lack provisions and have to raid houses,"" said one soldier, Ilya Berezenko, 27.

Glimmer of hope

Intense efforts at diplomacy continued, with the leaders of France and Germany, Emmanuel Macron and Olaf Scholz, urging Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin during a three-way phone conversation on Saturday to end the deadly blockade, Paris said.

Facing growing international condemnation, Putin sought to turn the tables, slamming Kyiv for what he described as the ""flagrant violation"" of international humanitarian law and accusing Ukraine's army of executing dissenters and using civilians as hostages.

The French presidency denounced his accusations, made during the talks with Macron and Scholz, as ""lies"".

But in a small glimmer of hope, Zelensky said Saturday that Russia -- after appearing unbudging for days -- had adopted a ""fundamentally different approach"" in the latest talks to end the conflict.

He told reporters he was ""happy to have a signal from Russia"" after Putin spoke of ""some positive shifts"" in a near-daily dialogue.

As Russia widens its bombardment, Zelensky's pleas for help have grown increasingly desperate.

Washington and its EU allies have sent funds and military aid to Ukraine and taken action against Russia's economy and oligarchs. A cultural and sporting boycott has further isolated Moscow.

In the Kyiv suburb of Irpin on Saturday, a Ukrainian soldier who gave his name only as Viktor showed off his British anti-tank missile system and the twisted remains of a Russian vehicle it destroyed.

""I want to say a big thank you to our British comrades helping us,"" he said.

As international sanctions against Moscow have steadily tightened, crippling Russia's economy, the country's space agency Roscosmos warned Saturday that the International Space Station could crash if Russian spacecraft serving it are affected.

But Washington on Friday added still more layers of sanctions, this time ending normal trade relations and announcing a ban on Russian vodka, seafood and diamonds.

And on Saturday, US President Joe Biden authorised up to $200 million in new weapons and other aid to Ukraine.

But he has ruled out direct action against nuclear-armed Russia, warning that it would lead to ""World War III"".

'Cinders in his lungs'

The situation in Mariupol remains ""desperate"", according to Doctors Without Borders, with no water or heating -- and food supplies dwindling.

""Hundreds of thousands of people... are for all intents and purposes besieged,"" Stephen Cornish, one of those heading the medical charity's Ukraine operation, told AFP.

He called sieges ""a medieval practice"" long outlawed.

In Kharkiv, in the east, doctors at a hospital described spending two days pumping ash from the stomach of an eight-year-old boy whose home was struck by a Russian missile.

""He still has cinders in his lungs,"" Dima Kasyanov's doctor told AFP.

Foreign combatants have entered the conflict on both sides, and on Friday, the Kremlin ramped up efforts to bring in reinforcements, particularly from Syria.

He called on Macron and Scholz to help secure Ivan Fedorov's release, which he said opened a ""new stage of terror"".
