The Stugna-P (Scythian), also known as Skif in export modification, is a Ukrainian anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) system developed by the Luch Design Bureau. Its guidance device is developed and manufactured by Belarusian design bureau Peleng based in Minsk. Stugna-P developed by Kyiv-based LUCH design bureau to destroy manpower and stationary and mobile modern armored targets with combined, carried, or monolithic armor including ERA (explosive reactive armor) and also pinpoint targets like weapon emplacements, lightly armored objects and hovered helicopters at any time of day or night.

Ka-52 Alligator is an all-weather attack helicopter operated by the Russian Air Force. Developed by Kamov Design Bureau (part of Russian Helicopters), Ka-52 is a twin-seat variant of the Ka-50 attack helicopter. The starboard side of the fuselage is fitted with a NPPU-80 movable gun mount installed with 2A42 30mm automatic gun. The six wing-mounted external hardpoints can be attached with different combinations of weapons. The hardpoints can carry VIKHR anti-tank guided missiles (ATGM), ATAKA missiles with laser guidance system and B8V-20 rocket launchers for 80mm unguided S-8 rockets. VIKHR anti-tank missile has a range of eight to ten kilometres. The first Ka-52 helicopter was rolled out in December 1996. The helicopter completed its first flight in June 1997. The serial production of Ka-52 began in 2008 at Progress Arsenyev Aviation plant in the Primorye region of Russia.

The Skif consists of a tripod, missile container, PDU-215 remote control panel, guidance device and thermal imager. The laser-guided system has a range of 5800 meters and can penetrate armor up to 1100 millimeters thickness. The PDU-215 control panel is a briefcase-like laptop with a control panel, containing a small joystick and a flat-screen display to assist the missile’s guidance. Two firing modes are available: manual, and fire-and-forget. Fire-and-forget provides automatic control of the missile flight using a targeting laser beam. The PDU-215 allows the control of the unit from up to 50 meters away (with a wire channel). A three to four-person team is optimal for deploying the Skif, operators require specially-made backpacks. Once the missile is fired, the operator controls the Skif and corrects the aim when necessary, by using the joystick on the remote control.

The system comes complete with 130mm and 152mm caliber missiles in transport and launching containers. 130mm missiles with RK-2S and RK-2OF warheads. Tandem charge HEAT RK-2S warheads might be able to counter medium weight main battle tanks such as the T-90A with penetration of 800mm behind ERA. RK-2M-K warheads might be able to counter heavy main battle tanks such as M1 Abrams with their penetration of 1100mm behind ERA. The system also includes HE-fragmentation RK-2OF and RK-2O-OF warheads to attack infantry positions and light armored vehicles. This or a very similar version is fielded in the Ukrainian armed forces as the Stugna-P. The system can use all four types of missiles without requiring modification. The system has a thermal imager for use during night operations.",https://militaryleak.com/2022/04/05/ukrainian-stugna-p-anti-tank-guided-missile-shoots-down-russian-ka-52-attack-helicopter/

Yet the seemingly unconventional use of the ATGM is nothing new in the context of modern warfare.

Originally posted on Twitter by vocal military commentator and serviceman Yuriy Kochevenko on April 5, the footage shows a distant Russian Aerospace Forces, or VKS, Ka-52 helicopter gunship hovering above Ukrainian woodland for a few seconds before its destruction by a Stugna-P ATGM. Readers can view the video clip below:

The video appears to be a mobile phone video of the remote-control terminal of the Stugna-P missile system, operated by personnel from Ukraine's 95th Air Assault Brigade. In the footage, we see the Russian helicopter hovering in the distance––putting its crew in an extremely vulnerable position––as the missile operator prepares to fire.

Originally designed in Ukraine by the Kyiv-based Luch Design Bureau in the mid-2000s, the Stugna-P system consists of a launch unit that can be mounted on a tripod or integrated into a vehicle-mounted remote weapon station. The complete system features a television surveillance and aiming system, laser rangefinder, beam-riding laser guidance system, thermal imager, and missile axis control system.

Specifications for the Ukrainian-built Stugna-P., Telemart.ua

Stugna-P can launch a variety of 130mm and 152mm guided missiles and has a maximum range of up to 5.5 kilometers (3.41 miles) depending on what exactly it is firing. These missiles can be guided manually or in semi-automatic command to line of sight (SACLOS) beam-riding mode, allowing for control of the missile’s trajectory via a laser beam aimed at the taget. The missiles themselves come equipped with different warheads depending on the specific type, including tandem types designed to bust through explosive reactive armor, as well as high-explosive-fragmentation and thermobaric payloads.

A typical tripod-mounted Stugna-P system has a crew of between three and four personnel, with the option to operate the launcher remotely from safer positions of up to 50 meters (164 feet) via the television surveillance and aiming system. A demonstration of one of these weapon systems by the Ukrainian military can be seen below.

In the Ka-52 shootdown footage, the operator at the Stugna-P’s controls can be seen correcting the course of the missile by readjusting the target controls to pinpoint the helicopter post-launch. As the missile's total flight time to a target at the maximum engagement distance is known to be around 14.3 seconds, the fact that it only takes some 12 from launch to impact indicates that the Ukrainian team was approximately 5 kilometers (3.12 miles) from the helicopter.

While man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS) have received significant attention in recent weeks, the footage shows that guided weaponry of other kinds can be used effectively against low and very slow-flying helicopters under particular circumstances, especially when helicopters are executing terminal operations (landing or taking off) or are slowly moving around at low altitudes. ATGM teams can even set up ambushes where they believe the helicopters will appear or sneak close to forward bases of operation to pick them off at a distance while they are coming and going.

The Stugna-P is significantly cheaper than premium MANPADS, particularly weapons like the British-supplied Starstreak high-velocity missiles, as well as many rival ATGM models. Stugna-P unit cost is just a fraction of that of the U.S.-made Javelin for example. As a domestic ATGM model, it also has operational advantages for Ukrainian soldiers already familiar with the technology. Using lower-cost ATGMs to attack slow-flying helicopters, under certain circumstances, allows for less plentiful, and more advanced missiles to be saved for other targets that might demand their specific capabilities.

Many modern combat helicopters feature laser-warning equipment as part of their defensive suites to make their crews aware of the threat of some MANPADS and other anti-aircraft weaponry, as well as ATGMs, that use some form of laser guidance. Although the reason for the Russian helicopter's low altitude hovering seen in the video is unclear, it would seem at least likely that it was cueing a target for one of its own missiles. Generally, helicopter operations at low levels are necessary for survival over the Ukrainian battlefield. Operating higher makes for a juicy target for MANPADS and for longer-range radar-guided SAM systems. The threat posed by ATGMs to Russian aircraft in Ukraine is especially significant in urban environments, which is increasingly where the fighting is occurring.

Yet despite the ingenuity of Ukraine's 95th Air Assault Brigade, the use of ATGM against enemy helicopters is by no means a novel concept in the context of modern warfare. Anti-tank missiles, in general, have proved a particularly effective tool for under-resourced forces when engaging superior militaries. The conflict in Syria, in particular, has underlined ATGM's secondary anti-helicopter capabilities. In that war, insurgent-rebel groups, such as 'Sham Legion,' used ATGM capabilities when targeting Syrian military helicopters.

More recently, Taliban fighters had used ATGMs to down Afghan National Defense and Security Forces helicopters fueling fears about the flow of Russian and Iranian ATGM weaponry into Afghanistan. Concerns have also been raised that growing numbers of U.S.-made anti-tank missiles have ended up in the hands of extremist-terrorist organizations, such as ISIS.

Some anti-tank weapons even have secondary surface-to-air capabilities that are anything but improvised. The Javelin, with its fire-and-forget capabilities, is capable of being used to shoot down slow and low flying aircraft by design. Russia has even tested anti-tank guided missiles in the air-to-air realm for contingency uses. The AGM-114 Hellfire anti-tank missiles fired from Apache attack helicopters have also proved reliable at taking out aerial drones and even a ground-launched version is now deployed in the anti-air role. Basically, the concept goes back deep into the Cold War and many of these systems were developed with a secondary anti-helicopter capability in mind.

Time will tell how many more Russian helicopters are destroyed by Ukrainian ATGM, but the capability certainly is there, as the video of the Ukrainian unit employing the Stugna-P proves.

Correction: The original version of this story stated that the Stugna-P system has a laser-homing guidance mode. It actually uses a laser beam-riding guidance system.

4,4084cf53-2396-4d20-96b9-9f54916b8984,[],,"Kyiv: Russian troops responsible for Bucha massacre returning to Ukraine Tuesday, April 5, 2022 10:00:56 AM

The Russian soldiers, who committed atrocities in Bucha, are coming back to Ukraine, reported the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry (GUR).

""The 64th Motor Rifle Brigade of the 35th Combined Arms Army of the Russian Federation, the servicemen of which committed mass murders and torture of civilians in Bucha, will be sent back to the territory of Ukraine. The Russian command will not rotate personnel in this unit and will again deploy it to the front line, "" the report reads.

It is noted that as of April 4, this unit was withdrawn from Ukraine to Belarus and was stationed near the city of Mozyr. By April 6, the personnel will be transported by rail to the Russian City of Belgorod.

After a two-day rest, they will be sent to one of the ""hottest"" areas of Ukraine. Tentatively, they can be transferred to the Kharkiv direction. The Ukrainian Intelligence clarified that, as a rule, Russian units leaving the combat zone get more time to recover and rest.

“Such a schedule indicates that the 64th Brigade is tasked with ""special assignments."" The first of them is the intimidation of residents of Ukrainian settlements. The perpetrators of genocide in Bucha may repeat this again in other places,” the Ukrainian Intelligence says.

Another goal of the quick deployment of this brigade to the territory of Ukraine is “to allow the Russian authorities to quickly get rid of unnecessary witnesses who can testify in future trials”. They are being deployed to the areas from where they will have no chance of getting out alive.

The Ukrainian Intelligence says that the soldiers of the unit, seeing the public outcry over the Bucha massacre and understanding the responsibility for these crimes, massively oppose being deployed to Ukraine again. However, the Russian commanders ignore this and threaten them with military tribunal in case of refusal to continue taking part in the war. Dismissal requests are not being accepted.

The Ukrainian Defense Ministry added that Ukrainian and international investigators are now documenting numerous war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by the Russian troops.

Can Russia take Eastern Ukraine? I have no idea. From my perspective, it's going to depend on whether Ukraine can keep contesting the air space and give its ground troops free ability to roam the countryside.



Moar MANPADS, please. And I understand fighters are harder to transfer, but by god, get on that!



Also, fun statistic: Germany has transferred $35B to Russia in exchange for gas. It has given Ukraine $1B in military aid.



Can they at least get their head out of their ass and equalize those numbers somehow?

I am not sure manpads are in short supply. The problem is they are relatively low performance. Once Russia defeats the last of the Ukrainian airforce (who we refuse to resupply) it can just switch to heavier bombers flying high and above the range of manpads. Accuracy will be poor using dumb bombs from altitude but if you are just flattening cities to murder everyone in it do you really need accuracy.

I'm more thinking MANPADS to deal with this kind of CAS for convoys:



But yes, things will start to look much worse once Russia gains full air superiority.



Quote: Ukraine needs aircraft or high performance sams to prevent Russian air supremacy. The Ukrainians are running out of planes. Pilots are putting aircraft that really should be grounded in the air simply because there is no other choice. Meanwhile the US is worried about escalating things.



Agreed.



I'd really like to hear what people think will happen if Russia manages to defeat the Ukrainian army (or at least fight it to a standstill around Dnipro). Do they really think Putin will just stop his expansion? That Ukrainians in those areas will be anything but exterminated?

In an alternate world, absolutely anything could happen. You can write that novel.



In the real world, there's no mechanism that allows Russia to win in Ukraine without a general mobilization and outright genocide, and whether they can even pull that off is doubtful. But let's say they pull it off. Then maybe he can take Moldova too. After that it's all EU countries, all but one of them in NATO, in an army that sucks at fighting and an Air Force that was seriously hampered by light infantry with MANPADs backed by a few soviet-era SAMs. If NATO fights, Russia loses.

Question for you: do you think that all air-sorties can be prevented by MANPADS, or do you think that the Ukrainian air force can indefinitely contest Ukrainian air space? From what comes out of the Ukrainian government, its air force is on a countdown, and I don't see how MANPADS help with missile strikes and high-altitude bombing runs.



Furthermore, there are several scenarios where material support from EU flags, which would mean very difficult times for Ukrainian resistance.



Quote: The only scary thing Russia has is nukes. It's still the case that Russia loses but so does the West, and everyone else worldwide.



Well yes. The assumption here is that Putin isn't suicidal and won't want to sacrifice all of Russia just to get Moldova. My question though is how European countries respond to Putin's nuclear blackmail? How do they respond to genocide?



To me, the outcome in Ukraine depends less on Putin, and much more on what kind of support the EU and US gives now and in the future to the Ukraine. There are several scenarios I can see where the support either is or becomes inadequate.



See for example France: lukewarm support could easily (though somewhat improbably) switch to outright support of Russia.

What are you even worried about anymore?



The outcome in Ukraine depends entirely on Ukrainians. They decided to fight.

What are you even worried about anymore?The outcome in Ukraine depends entirely on Ukrainians. They decided to fight.

And they would have lost had they not gotten a near limitless supply of AT weapons. The will to fight is step 1. The material to fight is step 2. They can't produce their own material anymore and are highly % dependent on outside support for replacing stuff they're losing. This includes service parts and service material.



I'm not sure why you're discounting the assistance the Ukrainians are getting when assessing their ability to fight back.



Quote: So Russia loses. That's done. That was the pre-invasion assessment and everything we've learned since is that it's going even worse than expected for Russia. The only way Russia can hold that territory is to murder everyone worse than they murdered people in Chechnya, but it's 20x more people to kill, so that's not particularly likely.





Russia has lost the battle for Kyiv. It is is still winning the battle for Mariupol, Donbas, and for a land bridge to Crimea. I'd be happy to hear they're losing there too, but I'm not seeing any evidence for it. Feel free to share it if you have it.



Quote: A full WW2-scale mobilization might succeed. Putin might get overthrown if he tries though.



There's talk (as in pictures of command papers on official letter head) of conscripting what is essentially the ROTC/youth branch of the Russian army. Russia is going full mobilization. What do you think the propaganda is for? Haven't you noticed how hard the entire population is being shoved towards considering the war in Ukraine are response to an existential threat?



Quote: Now we're quibbling about the details of Russia's loss. The more help Ukraine gets, the faster and harder Russia loses and the fewer Ukrainians die, until you get to where Russia goes bonkers and starts nuking.





Agreed on the help part. Not sure where the line is where Russia starts nuking things. I don't think anyone knows for sure, which is a problem.



Quote: Worrying about dominoes is just weird. In the counterfactual where Ukraine dissolved and accepted Russia as overlords, and Trump was president and allowed NATO to dissolve (and gave it a push), then there might be dominoes to worry about, but that's not the real world.



What dominoes? I'm talking about future developments that are probable and their impacts on the war in Ukraine. Feel free to discuss where I'm off in my assessment of probabilities.
