NATO leaders to bolster eastern forces

NATO leaders agreed Friday to send thousands of troops, backed by air and naval support, to protect allies near Russia and Ukraine in response to Moscow's invasion of its neighbor.

Speaking after chairing an emergency NATO summit in Brussels, Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said parts of the NATO Response Force would be sent to the alliance's eastern flank, along with elements of a quickly deployable spearhead unit.

Stoltenberg did not say how many troops would be sent or where they might go, but he did confirm that the move would involve land, sea and air power.

DPA news agency reported that ground troops could be sent to Romania.

The announcement came after NATO members, ranging from Estonia to Bulgaria triggered urgent consultations Thursday about their security.

NATO previously had around 5,000 troops stationed in the Baltic countries — Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, along with Poland, but has significantly beefed up its defenses over the past three months.

Some of NATO's 30 member countries are supplying arms, ammunition and other equipment to Ukraine, but NATO as an organization isn't.

It won't launch any military action in support of Ukraine, which is a close partner but has no prospect of joining.

Germany said Friday that it plans to deploy troops and a Patriot anti-missile system to Slovakia.

US, UK join EU in freezing Putin's assets

The United States and Britain followed the EU in announcing sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that a travel ban would be part of the US sanctions. The Treasury Department is expected to release more details later Friday.

Psaki also said that any moves by Russia ""going after"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who alongside key aides has vowed to stay and defend Kyiv, would be a ""horrific act.""

The UK Treasury issued a financial sanctions notice against the two Russian politicans, adding them to a list of Russian oligarchs who have already had their property and bank accounts in the UK frozen.

The move suggests that Western powers are acting in concert to try to force Putin to stop the invasion of Ukraine.

In comments to NATO leaders, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson called again for Russia's exclusion from the SWIFT system of financial transactions. European nations have faced criticism for failing to cut Russia off from the global bank payments network.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said it would impose sanctions on Putin and ""his fellow architects of this barbaric war."" Trudeau also expressed support for barring Russia from SWIFT.

Also Friday, Switzerland told banks to freeze the assets of people and entities on an EU sanctions blacklist that the neutral country has adopted.

The financial regulator did not specify how much money would be frozen, but Russians held nearly 10.4 billion Swiss francs ($11.21 billion, €9.95 billion) in Switzerland in 2020, Swiss National Bank data show.

Meanwhile, Serbia defied EU and US calls to join sanctions against Russia, although its autocratic president said that Moscow's assault against Ukraine broke international law.

Despite formally seeking EU membership, Serbia has been strengthening ties with its traditional Slavic ally Russia.

Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya: Belarus does not want to fight Ukraine

Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said Friday that the citizens of her country do not want to fight Ukraine.

""We didn't expect this war would happen. We didn't believe in this… Putin partnered with [Alexander Lukashenko] and attacked Ukraine. And this is the price Lukashenko is paying for the Kremlin's support in 2020, which allowed Lukashenko to stay in power,"" Tsikhanouskaya told DW.

""I really want to express solidarity with all Ukrainians because some people don't want to fight, especially they don't want to fight against Ukraine, our neighbor, people we love. And we want to be friends, of course, with them,"" she added.

She said the vast majority of Belarusians are against Russia's actions: ""Only 12% believe that Belarus must send its soldiers and only 13% are in support of the Russian campaign.""

Zelenskyy video rejects rumors he had fled Ukraine

After rumors spread that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had either fled the country or was hiding in a bunker, the Ukrainian leader posted a video to Facebook showing him and his political colleagues outside the president's office in Kyiv.

""We are all here,"" Zelenskyy said, referring to Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal as well as the heads of the presidential office and the Ukrainian parliament.

The video was published as Russian troops bore down on Ukraine's capital, with gunfire and explosions resonating ever closer to the government quarter.

""Our troops are here, citizens are here,'' Zelenskyy continued, adding that ""all of us are here protecting our independence of our country. And it will continue to be this way. Glory to our defenders, Glory to Ukraine, Glory to Heroes.""

Zelenskyy's whereabouts had been kept secret after he told European leaders in a call Thursday night that he was Russia's No. 1 target and that they might not see him again alive.

Anti-Russia protests in Turkey

Across Turkey, Ukrainian citizens have gathered to protest Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. A video published on DW's Turkish Twitter account shows footage of the protests.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has condemned the Russian attack as a ""heavy blow to regional peace and stability."" At the same time, he has refused to close off the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits to Russian warships.

Eurasia Group's Ian Bremmer says Ukraine unlikely to fend off Russia

Ian Bremmer, the president of the Eurasia Group political risk consultancy, told DW Friday that Ukraine is unlikely to fend off Russia's attack, as it is not a member of NATO.

""I mean, fundamentally the issue is Ukraine matters a lot more to Putin than it does to Germany, the United States or any of the rest of the alliance,"" Bremmer said. ""And President Zelenskyy, as courageous as he is and I saw him speak live at Munich last week, is facing the ultimate sacrifice right now.""

Bremmer said Russia's intention is ""regime change"" and removing Zelenskyy from office.

""And the only reason they're being attacked, the only sin that the Ukrainians have committed is the audacity to want to elect their own leaders and determine their own future,"" Bremmer said. ""And that is unacceptable to the vastly more powerful Russian Federation and particularly to President Putin.""

Russia to 'partially restrict' Facebook, citing censorship

Russia's media regulator said it was limiting access to Facebook, accusing the US tech giant of censorship.

The regulator, Roskomnadzor, said Facebook had restricted access to the official accounts of RIA news agency, the defense ministry's Zvezda TV and news websites gazeta.ru and lenta.ru.

The regulator said it had asked Facebook parent Meta to lift the curbs and explain why they were imposed.

In the statement, the regulator also accused the social media firm of 23 similar instances of ""censorship"" since October 2020.

Roskomnadzor did not specify what the Russian measures would be. Last year, Moscow slowed down the speed of Twitter in a punitive move.

In December, Facebook was fined 2 billion roubles ($24.27 million, €21.58 million) for what the regulator described as a repeated failure to delete illegal content.

DW's Moscow Correspondent Emily Sherwin, who is now in Berlin after Russia revoked media accreditation for DW employees in January, said the restrictions could also affect the WhatsApp messenger platform and Instagram.

Russia has also increased pressure on domestic media, threatening to block reports that contain what it describes as ""false information"" regarding its military operation in Ukraine.

Latvia: EU imposes asset freeze on Putin, Lavrov

EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the bloc has adopted new sanctions on Russia, specifically targeting President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

Putin and his foreign minister will be subject to an asset freeze as part of a massive package agreed on at an emergency EU summit in Brussels.

The new sanctions come on top of asset freezes and travel bans already imposed on senior Kremlin officials involved in Russia's decision to recognize Ukraine's breakaway provinces as independent states.

The latest curbs also target Russia's energy, finance and transport sectors as well as banning the export of critical technologies and software from Europe to Russia.

Visa restrictions are also to be introduced.

Reuters news agency cited an EU official as saying that a third round of sanctions may target ""many more"" Russian oligarchs and would be discussed next week.

Latvia's foreign ministry quoted Foreign Minister Edgard Rinkevics as saying he believed a third round ""which also includes the exclusion of Russia from SWIFT"" was necessary.

However, Borrell said a third round was unlikely to come soon:

""Don't expect a third package in the next days or hours because this is not the idea. The idea is, if it's necessary to do more and we identify actions on the Russian side, if we have identified consensus around more measures, they will be taken.""

Germany stepping up military support to NATO

Germany is to provide NATO with more soldiers and weapons systems to protect its allies, German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht said on Friday.

""We have a fleet service boat deployed in the Baltic Sea. We will also provide a frigate and a corvette and we are preparing more,"" the politician from the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) told the German dpa news agency. ""We will provide more troops. We will also get involved with air surveillance and air defense.""

Germany has been criticized for refusing to send weapons to Ukraine to help the country defend itself from Russia. Berlin received further negative press when it approved the sending of 5,000 helmets to the Ukrainian army following criticism of its refusal to send defensive weapons.

Germany does not to send weaponry to active conflict zones on principle in most cases. The current coalition government, which took office in December, had pledged a more restrictive arms export policy in light of deliveries to countries involved in conflicts in Yemen, Libya and elsewhere.

Lambrecht stressed that Germany was a reliable partner in the military alliance, adding that the country was the ""largest troop contributor in NATO after the US,"" with 13,000 soldiers in the NATO Response Force alone.

The defense minister also warned Russian President Vladimir Putin after he appeared to threaten the use of nuclear weapons in his invasion speech. She said that NATO was not intimidated and would show its resolve through unity and deterrence.

""An attack on one ally would be an attack on all of us, with terrible consequences for Russia,"" Lambrecht said, adding: ""Putin knows that too.""

NATO's Stoltenberg says Russia 'bears sole responsibility'

NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg has told an emergency summit of the military alliance that Russia has ""shattered peace on the European continent"" by invading Ukraine.

Speaking in Brussels, he said Moscow ""bears sole responsibility for the deliberate, cold-blooded and long-planned invasion,” adding that NATO members “call on Russia to immediately cease its military action.""

""We stand with the brave people of Ukraine. We fully support Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, its right to self-defense and its right to choose its own path,"" Stoltenberg added.

Watch video 00:57 Stoltenberg: 'We stand with the brave people of Ukraine'

The talks took place virtually with US President Joe Biden joining from the Situation Room at the White House.

Ukraine's desire to join NATO and the European Union is partly what prompted Moscow's decision to attack; with Russia seeking Western assurances before invading that Ukraine would never be allowed into NATO.

Biden has repeatedly said that Kyiv is nowhere near being able to join the military alliance and is also firm that US troops will not go there to help push back Russia. However, the US and NATO also refused to categorically rule out ever accepting Ukraine, saying Russia should not be able influence such a decision.

Ahead of the summit, DW's NATO correspondent Teri Schulz said NATO leaders were likely to agree to send reinforcements to the eastern flank.

""Any expectations that these troops would be able to leave the Baltic States and Poland anytime soon has certainly been thrown out of the window,"" she said.

Russia barred from taking part in Eurovision

Russia will be prohibited from taking part in this year's Eurovision Song Contest, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) said.

The EBU said the appearance of a Russian act in the contest would ""bring the competition into disrepute.""

Ukraine and other countries have previously called for Russia to be expelled from the contest. Finland said it would not send an act if Russia were allowed to participate.

The competition will take place in May in Turin, Italy.

Council of Europe suspends Russia

The Council of Europe has suspended Russia's membership due to the Kremlin-backed invasion of Ukraine, the committee of ministers decided.

The 47-member body is the continent's foremost human rights organization.

Permanent representatives of the member states ""agreed to suspend the Russian federation from its rights of representation in the Council of Europe"" by invoking Article 8 of its statute, according to a statement.

Although the Council of Europe suspended Russia's right to representation, the Eastern European country will still remain a member of the body. The Council has only invoked Article 8 one other time in its history, against Greece's military junta in 1969.

The Council was founded in 1949, and is based in Strasbourg, France.

Kremlin 'ready' for peace talks with Ukraine, venue one sticking point?

Russia is willing to send a delegation to the Belarusian capital Minsk for peace talks with Ukraine, according to Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov.

""In response to Zelenskyy's proposal, Vladimir Putin is ready to send a delegation at the level of representatives of Defense Ministry, Foreign Ministry and presidential administration to Minsk for negotiations with the Ukrainian delegation,"" Peskov said.

Russian President Putin has reportedly spoken with Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko about the option of setting up a secure location for the talks.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has twice offered to meet with Putin for talks.

Peskov later said Ukraine proposed Warsaw, the capital of NATO member Poland, as a venue for talks instead of Moscow ally Minsk. He added that Kyiv then halted further communication.

Protest outside German chancellery for tougher sanctions

Dozens of people gathered outside the German chancellery to demand tougher sanctions on Russia, including cutting Moscow off from the SWIFT banking system. DW correspondent Thomas Sparrow was there.

The German government has so far opposed excluding Russia from the SWIFT system altogether, citing possible consequences for Germany, which uses the system to pay for Russian gas.

The protesters gathered on Friday waved Ukrainian flags and called for further support for Ukraine.

On Thursday, several demonstrators protested in Berlin against the Russian war on Ukraine, and more protests are planned for the weekend.

Police expect 20,000 people to join a protest at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate on Sunday under the motto, ""Stop the war. Peace for Ukraine and all of Europe.""

Putin calls on Ukraine army to overthrow leadership

Russian President Vladimir Putin called on the Ukrainian military to seize power in their country from the current leadership, which he described as ""terrorists.""

""It seems like it will be easier for us to agree with you than this gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis,"" he said in a televised address, referring to leadership in Kyiv led by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Russia has repeatedly sought to label the Ukrainian government as ""neo-Nazi,"" based on what the Kremlin says is persecution against the country's Russian-speaking population.

In announcing the military operation in Ukraine, Putin claimed that its aim was the ""denazification"" and ""demilitarization"" of Ukraine.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is both a Russian-speaker and Jewish.

Ukraine accuses Russia of war crimes

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has alleged Russian air strikes hit a Kindergarten and an orphanage, calling the attacks ""war crimes"" in a post on Twitter.

Kuleba said that Ukrainian prosecutors were collecting evidence of the incidents to send to the International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Hague.

ICC prosecutor Karim Khan said on Thursday that they had been observing developments in Ukraine ""with concern"" adding that people who commit order, incite or contribute to any war crimes ""may be liable to prosecution before the Court.""

Russia never ratified its membership of the Rome Statute which underpins most prosecutions at the ICC, and it even withdrew its unratified signature to the agreement in 2016, when the court deemed that Russia's annexation of Crimea qualified as an armed conflict.

Pope Francis visits Russian embassy

Pope Francis decided to visit Russia's embassy at the Holy See as tensions continue to escalate, according to the Vatican press office. The 85-year-old Catholic leader visited the embassy ""to express his concern for the war.""

He reportedly spent over half an hour at the embassy. A Vatican spokesperson said the pope spoke to Russia's ambassador, but no readout of the meeting has been released so far.

Francis previously said on Wednesday, ahead of the invasion, that the idea of war in Ukraine causes ""great pain in my heart."" He also criticized actions ""destabilizing coexistence among nations and discrediting international law.""

Kremlin ready for peace talks with Ukraine in Minsk

Russia is willing to send a delegation to the Belarusian capital Minsk for peace talks with Ukraine, according to Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov.

Zelenskyy urges Europeans with 'combat experience' to defend Ukraine

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday called on Europeans with ""combat experience"" to join the fight of defending Ukraine against Russian forces.

""If you have combat experience in Europe and do not want to look at the indecision of politicians, you can come to our country and join us in defending Europe, where it is very necessary now,"" Zelenskyy said.

The Ukrainian leader also demanded that the West act quickly and ""without delay.""

""State institutions in Europe are not in a hurry with really strong decisions,"" he said.

As Western countries held off excluding Russia from the SWIFT international payments system, Zelenskyy urged that all options be considered.

""Europe has enough strength to stop this aggression,"" he said.

""Cancellation of visas for Russians? Disconnect from SWIFT? Complete isolation of Russia? Recall of ambassadors? Oil embargo? Closing the sky? Today, all this must be on the table.""

EU prepares sanctions against Putin, Lavrov

The European Union could impose another round of sanctions against Russia following the most recent measures that were agreed on Thursday night, news agencies Reuters and dpa both reported on Friday, citing insiders.

The new sanctions would target assets belonging to President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. The sanctions would also hit Russia's financial and energy sectors that were already targeted in the previous round.

Further sanctions that have not yet been enacted are still on the table, such as targeting other Russian oligarchs, ending coal imports from the Russia-occupied Donbas region and cutting Russia off from the SWIFT banking system.

Steinmeier also praised people who took to the street in solidarity with Ukraine. ""It is good that the people in our countries are expressing this on the streets in their demonstrations. Let us show the people in Ukraine that we feel their situation,"" he said.

Formula 1 cancels Russian Grand Prix

The Formula One racing organization has called off its planned Russian Grand Prix, set to take place in Sochi in September.

""We are watching the developments in Ukraine with sadness and shock and hope for a swift and peaceful resolution to the present situation,"" F1 said in a statement Friday.

""Formula 1, [governing body] the FIA, and the teams discussed the position of our sport, and the conclusion is, including the view of all relevant stakeholders, that it is impossible to hold the Russian Grand Prix in the current circumstances,"" the statement said.

The cancellation follows a similar move to cancel the men's soccer Champion's League final in Saint Petersburg and hold it instead in Paris.

Are negotiations possible?

In a call with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that Moscow was open to ""high level negotiations"" with Ukraine after China said that it supported a negotiated solution between Russia and Ukraine.

Russia has also defended its invasion of Ukraine against widespread international condemnation.

At the same time, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that an offer for talks from Kyiv over a possible neutral status of Ukraine was a ""move in the right direction.""

Peskov told Russian news agencies Russia was willing to send a delegation including officials from the Foreign and Defense ministries.

Earlier in the day, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that the offer of neutrality was a lie.

Peskov went on to say that it recognizes Volodymyr Zelenskyy as the president of Ukraine, but he did not go into whether or how the two sides would open communication.

Tusk slams Germany, Hungary, Italy over weak sanctions

Former European Council President Donald Tusk has berated Germany, Hungary and Italy for opposing tougher sanctions against Russia at an emergency EU summit this week.

""In this war everything is real: Putin's madness and cruelty, Ukrainian victims, bombs falling on Kyiv. Only your sanctions are pretended. Those EU [governments that] blocked tough decisions ([among others] Germany, Hungary, Italy) have disgraced themselves,"" he wrote in a tweet.

Tusk, who presided over the European Council from 2014 to 2019, is a former Polish prime minister who is now president of the European People's Party, the largest party in the European Parliament.

'No chance' that Russia invades NATO member

Andras Racz, an associate fellow with the German Council on Foreign Relations, told DW, ""There is no chance right now that the Russian Federation would launch any kind of attack against any of Ukraine's neighboring NATO countries.""

Asked whether Moscow will stop at Ukraine's borders, for Racz ""the answer is a definite 'yes.'""

According to the foreign relations expert, there is a pattern to what he called Russian ""imperialism."" First, they take control of a region ""then they sit on it, they wait for a few years, stabilize their power, stabilize their position.""

He said he doubted sanctions would be able to stop the invasion.

""It's highly unlikely that any economic sanctions or other non-military costs would be able to stop this military logic from functioning,"" Racz told DW. ""Unless Ukraine can be defeated or surrenders, Russia will keep pushing.

""Ukrainian forces are resisting, but gradually losing ground on the southern front line,"" he said.

As for Moscow's intentions, according to the foreign policy expert they to: ""defeat Ukraine militarily, occupy Kyiv and change the government.""

But ""it still remains to be seen if they are up for the large-scale, slow and bloody urban combat that the siege and conquest of Kyiv would mean,"" Racz said.

Russia's Lavrov meets separatist officials

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov held talks with senior officials of the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk ""republics.""

Lavrov reiterated that Moscow saw the attack on Ukraine as ""necessary"" to free the Russian-backed separatists of what he called Ukrainian ""oppression.""

The Russian top diplomat refused to recognize Kyiv's democratic government, claiming it ""oppresses and uses genocidal methods against its own people.""

There is no evidence of Ukraine's democratically elected government committing genocide against its people.

According to the Interfax news agency, Lavrov said that the population in rebel areas in eastern Ukraine were subjected to ""shelling by the Kyiv regime.""

Fighting has happened on both sides of the line of contact in eastern Ukraine since 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea.

Lavrov was speaking in Moscow alongside Sergey Peresada, a deputy foreign minister of the self-proclaimed ""Donetsk People's Republic,"" and Vladislav Deinego, so-called foreign minister of the self-proclaimed ""Luhansk People's Republic.""

UN says millions of Ukrainians might flee abroad

At least 100,000 people in Ukraine are internally displaced and thousands have already crossed into neighboring countries amid Russia's invasion, a number that could reach 4 million, the UNHCR has said.

UN aid agencies said in Geneva that shortages of fuel, cash and medical supplies were helping drive the exodus to countries such as Moldova, Romania and Poland.

UN human rights office spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said that there were reports of at least 127 civilian casualties in Ukraine from the current fighting, including 25 killed and 102 injured.

She said the true figures were likely very much higher.

Loud blasts heard in Kharkiv

Explosions were heard in Ukraine's second-largest city Kharkiv, which lies close to Ukraine's eastern border with Russia, on Friday with the mayor telling residents to seek shelter from Russian missiles in subway stations, basements and bomb shelters, Reuters news agency reported.

Russia claims aim is to demilitarize Ukraine

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Friday that Russia wanted to ""liberate Ukrainians from oppression,"" adding that the invading force is not planning to occupy Ukraine, Reuters reported.

The aim of the invasion, according to Lavrov, is to demilitarize Ukraine. He went on to say that Russia wants the Ukrainian people to be independent and determine their own destiny.

Lavrov added that Moscow would engage in talks with Kyiv, but only after the Ukrainian military laid down its weapons.

The Kremlin on Friday also pledged to retaliate to Western sanctions. It acknowledged that sanctions would be damaging, but that the problems they may cause would be solvable.

""It goes without saying that retaliatory measures will follow,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.

""Just how symmetrical or asymmetrical they will be depends on the analysis, the restrictions have yet to be analysed,"" he added.

The comments from the Kremlin came as the EU announced that it was preparing further emergency sanctions against Russia.

EU foreign ministers, NATO to meet on Ukraine

European Union foreign ministers are set to hold an urgent meeting on Friday afternoon to discuss further response options to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Diplomats said the ministers would debate ways of giving Ukraine more support and plan strategies for the bloc's future dealings with Russia.

The meeting comes after EU leaders on Thursday night agreed on a massive new set of sanctions targeting Russia's energy, finance and transport sectors.

NATO heads of state and government are also to discuss the Ukraine crisis on Friday afternoon at an extraordinary virtual summit chaired by NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg.

Stoltenberg is due to give a press briefing at NATO headquarters in Brussels after the conference.

Fighting reported in Kyiv

Gunfire has been heard close to the government quarter in Kyiv after explosions hit the Ukrainian capital earlier in the morning, the Associated Press has reported.

The Ukrainian military also said that Russian spies and saboteurs had been spotted within the city, some 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the city center.

Russian tanks and troops have already reached the outskirts of the city after entering the country from Belarus to the north.

Social media videos showed what appeared to be Russian tanks in an area just north of Kyiv's city center.

Ukraine's military called on residents of Kyiv to track the movements of Russian forces in the city. It also told people to stay home and to make Molotov cocktails — a makeshift weapon that can be constructed from household items.

For its part, Russia has denied firing missile strikes on Kyiv and blamed explosions there on Ukrainian defense forces shooting down their own aircraft.

Radiation warnings at Chernobyl

Ukraine's nuclear agency warned of increased radiation levels coming out of Chernobyl on Friday, a day after Russian forces took control of the facility.

The infamous power plant has been decommissioned since 1986 when one of its nuclear reactors exploded, sending a radioactive cloud across Europe.

The agency reported detecting higher levels of gamma radiation which it attributed to a ""disturbance of the topsoil due to the movement of a large amount of heavy military equipment through the exclusion zone and the release of contaminated radioactive dust into the air.''

Russia has denied the reports of an increase in radiation. It said troops had taken control of the area to protect it and prevent ""provocations"" from Kyiv.

Russian gas still transiting Ukraine

The war in Ukraine has not stopped Russian gas exports to Europe through pipelines crossing Ukrainian territory, Russian gas firm Gazprom has said.

""Gazprom is delivering Russian gas for transit through the region of Ukraine in regular mode and in line with the demands of European consumers,"" said Sergey Kupriyanov, the company's official representative, in comments reported by the Russian Interfax news agency.

That will have amounted to 103.8 million cubic meters (366.6 million cubic feet) of gas on Friday, he added.

European dependence on Russian gas has been one factor complicating the Western response to Russia's aggression against Ukraine.

Russia bans UK airlines

Russia has banned airplanes registered in the UK from landing or crossing its airspace, its state civil aviation regulator said on Friday.

British Defense Minister Ben Wallace said that the restrictions were a ""retaliation"" for the British move Thursday to ban Russian airline Aeroflot from flying into the UK. ""That's their tit-for-tat response,"" he said on ITV's Good Morning Britain.

Lavrov to hold talks with Donbas officials

Germany, France haven't ruled out Russian SWIFT exclusion

German Finance Minister Christian Lindner said that ""all options are on the table"" when it comes to imposing sanctions against Moscow, including cutting Russia's access to the SWIFT international banking system.

""The first sanctions have been placed on Russia and they harm the Russian people and will block the Russian economy seriously,"" Lindner said before a meeting with other finance ministers from the euro group in Paris.

US President Joe Biden said on Thursday Washington and the EU had decided against cutting Russia off from the SWIFT payments system.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Germany was opposed to cutting off Russia's access to SWIFT for the time being but said the step could be taken at a later stage.

Lindner said he was ""open"" to the measure if it was ""desired"" by Germany's allies. But he warned of a possible end to Russian gas supplies to Germany. ""Further steps are possible, but their impact must be considered,"" he said.

French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire also said that cutting off Russia from the SWIFT global interbank payments system was still a possibility, but said he viewed the measure as a ""last resort.""

Chinese Foreign Ministry says sanctions harm more than help

The Chinese Foreign Ministry has responded to new Western sanctions imposed on Russia for its war against Ukraine by saying that such measures had never been an effective way of solving problems but instead created problems for involved countries and regions.

The ministry said China opposed all illegal, unilateral sanctions and hoped relevant parties would deal with issues related to China in a way that would not harm China.

The ministry also hit back at a comment by US President Joe Biden that seemed to be aimed at China after Beijing failed to call Russia's attack on Ukraine an invasion and instead urged restraint.

Biden said countries that supported Russia's invasion would be ""stained by association.""

China responded to the veiled criticism by saying that it was countries who interfered in others' domestic affairs that would see their reputations stained.

France: Putin wants to 'take Ukraine off the map of nations'

French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian on Friday said that Russian President Vladimir Putin was trying to destroy Ukraine's statehood.

""This is total war. Putin has decided ... to take Ukraine off the map of nations,"" Le Drian said in an interview to France Inter radio.

He also warned that the security of Ukrainian President Zelenskyy was at risk.

Le Drian said France is ""worried"" about a possible Russian military offensive against the two other post-Soviet nations of Moldova and Georgia.

UK says Russia wants 'whole of Ukraine'

British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said on Friday that his country believes Russia wants to conquer Ukraine in its entirety but that the Russian army had not fulfilled its aims on the first day of its invasion.

""It's definitely our view that the Russians intend to invade the whole of Ukraine,"" Wallace told broadcaster Sky.

He went on to contradict claims by Russia's Defense Ministry that the Russian army had fulfilled all its objectives on the first day of the military operation.

""Contrary to great Russian claims, and indeed President Putin's sort of vision that somehow the Ukrainians would be liberated and would be flocking to his cause, he's got that completely wrong, and the Russian army has failed to deliver, on day one, its main objective,"" Wallace said.

Zelenskyy calls for eastern European defense assistance

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he had spoken with Polish counterpart Andrzej Duda on Friday to seek defense assistance from eastern European NATO members in the so-called Bucharest Nine organization.

""Together we have to put [Russia] at the negotiating table. We need (an) anti-war coalition,"" Zelenskyy wrote on Twitter.

The Bucharest Nine is an organization founded in 2015 by states that were either in the Soviet Union or within its sphere of influence in response to Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and later intervention in eastern Ukraine.

Its members, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia, are scheduled to meet later on Friday.

Ukraine fears imminent attack on Kyiv

Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Malyar has warned that Russian forces are poised to enter areas just outside the capital, Kyiv, on Friday

A government adviser, Anton Herashchenko, said the Russian troops planned to break through into the capital using tanks but that Ukrainian forces were ready to counter the attack with anti-tank missiles supplied by foreign allies.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had earlier said the government had information that ""subversive groups"" were moving on the city.

This comes after a night of reported air raids in the city that were said by a DW correspondent to have set some residential buildings on fire. Many Kyiv residents have taken shelter in underground metro stations.

'The hardest day will be today'

The Ukrainian general staff of the armed forces said Ukrainian troops were firmly resisting what he called ""Russian occupiers"" in the Kyiv area.

Ukrainian airborne assault troops were reported in a statement to have stopped ""overwhelming enemy forces"" at the Teteriv River near the settlements of Dymer and Ivankiv.

Dymer is around 45 kilometers (28 miles) north of Kyiv, while Ivankiv is around 60 kilometers northwest of the capital.

The military's statement said a bridge over the river was destroyed.

""The hardest day will be today. The enemy's plan is to break through with tank columns from the side of Ivankiv and Chernihiv to Kyiv,'' Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko said on Telegram.

Macron speaks after phone call with Putin

Russian President Vladimir Putin is seeking a return to the age of empires and confrontations, French President Emmanuel Macron said after speaking to Putin on the phone.

Macron said he had called his Russian counterpart on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's request. Zelenskyy said he tried to call Putin but failed to reach him.

Macron added that EU sanctions will be followed by French sanctions against Russia. He said that Europe is not just a ""market of consumers,"" but must be a power with ""energy and defense sovereignty.""

The French president announced €300 million ($336 million) of aid to Ukraine, as well as military equipment.

Macron accused Putin of ""duplicity"" in earlier talks between the two leaders.

""Yes, there was duplicity, yes there was a deliberate, conscious choice to launch war when we could still negotiate peace,"" Macron said.

Nonetheless, Macron said that it is useful to ""leave a path open"" for dialogue with Putin.

Von der Leyen announces details of Russia sanctions

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said sanctions agreed at an emergency EU summit would target 70% of the Russian banking market and key state-owned companies, including in defense.

An export ban would ""hit the oil sector by making it impossible for Russia to upgrade its refineries,"" von der Leyen said. The EU was also banning the sale of aircraft and equipment to Russian airlines, she added.

Visa restrictions will see diplomats and business people no longer having privileged access to the European Union.

The invasion of Ukraine marked the start of a ""new era,"" she said. ""Putin is trying to subjugate a friendly European country. He is trying to redraw the map of Europe. He must and he will fail.""

UN Security Council to vote on condemning Russia

The UN Security Council will vote Friday on a resolution that would condemn Russia's military attack on Ukraine.

It would also demand an immediate halt to the aggression and withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine.

Russia is a permanent member of the security council and thus will be able to veto the vote.

Although Russia is expected to veto the resolution, a senior US administration said that the council is a ""critical venue in which Russia must be force to explain itself.""

A similar resolution condemning Crimea's independence referendum was vetoed by Russia in 2014. 13 countries voted in favor, and China abstained.

Ukraine orders general mobilization

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has signed a decree on the general mobilization of the population in the wake of Russia's invasion.

""We have been left alone to defend our state,"" Zelenskyy said in a video address to the nation after midnight.

""Who is ready to fight alongside us? I don't see anyone. Who is ready to give Ukraine a guarantee of NATO membership? Everyone is afraid,"" he added.

The Ukrainian leader vowed to continue fighting, saying that ""a new iron curtain"" was falling between Russia and the West.

Ukraine's border guard said that males aged 18-60 are not allowed to leave the country in a statement posted on its Facebook account.

The restriction will last for the duration of the period of martial law in Ukraine.

Biden: Russia to keep access to SWIFT

The United States and European Union have decided for the time being not to cut Russia off from the SWIFT global interbank payments system, US President Joe Biden said.

When asked about the reason for this decision, Biden said that sanctions imposed against Russian banks exceeded the impact of excluding Russia from SWIFT and there wasn't unanimity within the EU on taking the additional step.

""It is always an option,"" Biden said. ""But right now, that's not the position that the rest of Europe wishes to take.""

Zelensky called war a “terrible misfortune.” He said he was ready to continue diplomatic talks with Russia and argued that Ukraine does not pose a threat to Russia.

“They say that Ukraine may pose a threat to Russia. This wasn’t a case in the past, nor is it now, and won’t be in the future,” he said. ""Our main goal is to maintain peace in Ukraine and keep Ukrainian citizens safe. For this we are prepared to hold discussions with everyone, including you [Russia], in whatever format you like at whatever venue.""

“Russian TV will surely not show this video, but the Russian people must watch it. The truth must be known. And that truth is that this all needs to stop now, before it's too late,” Zelensky said.

“If the leadership of Russia does not want to sit at the table with us to make peace, perhaps it will sit at the table with you. Does Russia want a war? I would very much like an answer to this question. But that answer depends only on you, citizens of the Russian Federation,"" he said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky vowed on Friday to stay in Kyiv as his troops battled Russian invaders who are advancing toward the capital in the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two.

Russia launched its invasion by land, air and sea on Thursday following a declaration of war by President Vladimir Putin. An estimated 100,000 people fled as explosions and gunfire rocked major cities. Dozens have been reported killed.

U.S. and Ukrainian officials say Russia aims to capture Kyiv and topple the government. Russia on Thursday seized the Chernobyl former nuclear power plant north of Kyiv, along the shortest route to the capital from Belarus, where Moscow has staged troops.

""(The) enemy has marked me down as the number one target,"" Zelensky warned in a video message. ""My family is the number two target. They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state.""

""I will stay in the capital. My family is also in Ukraine.""

Putin says Russia is carrying out ""a special military operation"" to protect people, including Russian citizens, subjected to ""genocide"" in Ukraine - an accusation the West calls baseless propaganda.

Asked if he was worried about Zelensky's safety, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told CBS: ""To the best of my knowledge, President Zelensky remains in Ukraine at his post, and of course we're concerned for the safety of all of our friends in Ukraine - government officials and others.""

Sanctions, military advances

A democratic nation of 44 million people, Ukraine is Europe's biggest country by area after Russia itself. It voted for independence at the fall of the Soviet Union and has recently stepped up efforts to join the NATO military alliance and the European Union, aspirations that infuriate Moscow.

Putin denied for months that he was planning an invasion, even as the United States warned an attack was looming and shared satellite images of Russian forces massing on Ukraine's borders.

The United States, Britain, Japan, Canada, Australia and the European Union on Thursday unveiled more sanctions on Russia on top of those imposed earlier this week, aiming to freeze the country's banks, government and elite out of the global financial system.

Russia is one of the world's biggest energy producers, and both it and Ukraine are among the top exporters of grain. War and sanctions will disrupt economies around the world already facing a crisis as they emerge from the coronavirus pandemic.

Washington and other NATO members have sent military aid to Ukraine but there is no move to send troops to fight alongside Ukrainian forces for fear of sparking a wider European conflict.

Zelensky said on Friday that 137 military personnel and civilians had been killed in the fighting so far, with hundreds of others injured. Ukrainian officials had earlier reported at least 70 people killed.

Some 90 km (60 miles) north of Kyiv, Chernobyl has been taken over by armed forces without identifying marks who disarmed a Ukrainian military unit guarding the station, Ukraine's state nuclear regulator said.

The regulator said there had been no casualties, that nothing had been destroyed and that radiation levels were unchanged. It informed the International Atomic Energy Agency that it had lost control of the plant, it added.

With heavy fighting being reported on multiple fronts, the United Nations Security Council will vote on Friday on a draft resolution that would condemn Russia's invasion and require Moscow's immediate withdrawal.

However, Moscow can veto the measure, and it was unclear how China, which has rejected calling Russia's move an invasion, would vote.

The invasion has drawn protests in the United States, Europe and within Russia itself, where authorities detained hundreds of demonstrators who took to the streets on Thursday.

Dmitry Muratov, a Russian newspaper editor who won the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize, told the BBC in an interview that Feb. 24, the day of the invasion, would go down as the day ""Russia's future was taken away from it"".

""Our peace-loving Russian people will now feel the hatred of the world because we are starting a third world war in the centre of Europe.""

[music]

I think if there’s one sound of Kyiv this morning so far, just after 10 o’clock in the morning, it’s the sound of wheelie bags being dragged over cobblestones and pavement.

michael barbaro

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily. As Russia’s full-scale assault on Ukraine enters its second day, the people of Ukraine are starting to come to terms with the reality that the unthinkable has actually happened. Today, my colleague Anton Troianovski explains the significance of this moment. And Sabrina Tavernise, Lynsea Garrison, and Michael Schwirtz speak to Ukrainians about the agonizing decisions that they now must make.

[music]

It’s Friday, February 25. Anton, we are talking to you on Thursday night in Moscow. We are coming to the end of day one of this invasion. Help us wrap our heads around what’s happening and the significance of what we’re all witnessing. Because even if we’ve been hearing warnings about this for weeks, it’s hard to believe that we’re now experiencing a full scale attack on Ukraine by Russia.

anton troianovski

Yeah. It is really hard to believe. It’s the biggest attack of one nation on another nation in Europe since World War II. It is really kind of the worst case scenario of all those scenarios of a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine that have been discussed. It’s something that I’ve spent just about every day writing about this crisis for the last two months or so. And honestly, even until yesterday I didn’t think that this could actually happen. It’s Europe’s most powerful military, bearing, basically, its entire firepower, much of its firepower against the neighboring country. So since about 5:00 AM, we have seen cruise missile, ballistic missile strikes against infrastructure targets, military targets in Ukraine. Then during the day, today, we started seeing footage coming in of helicopter assaults, of paratroopers landing, of tanks rolling across the border. And this is happening from 3 sides, from the North, Belarus, from the East, Russia, from the South, from the Black Sea in Crimea. It started, what, like 18 hours ago or so, and it’s still very hard to just wrap our heads around the magnitude of what’s happening.

michael barbaro

And what do we understand to be the end goal here at this point?

anton troianovski

Well, Putin laid it out quite clearly in his early morning speech. He said, our goal is to demilitarize and de-Nazify, in his words, Ukraine.

michael barbaro

And just explain that because—

anton troianovski

Yeah.

michael barbaro

De-nazification is not a familiar phrase in 2022.

anton troianovski

Exactly. And I mean, I will say, until recently, it hasn’t been a familiar phrase in Russia either. But the Kremlin in their propaganda they consider the democratically elected government of Ukraine a Nazi regime. They claim falsely that it has perpetrated a genocide on Russian speakers in Eastern Ukraine. And so Putin is trying to claim the moral high ground here. He is saying he’s going in to remove this evil regime. And what that means is this is a full scale military assault to topple the government, most likely, of another country. This is just a massive undertaking that we’re only seeing the beginnings of.

michael barbaro

So we’re talking about a sovereign nation in Europe being attacked by another European nation. And its democratically elected leadership being, by what you just described, deposed. And these are developments that are unheard of in modern Europe. So how should we think about that?

anton troianovski

Yeah. I think it’s really the end of a certain post-Cold War order in Europe. It’s the end of 30 years of Russia trying to find a place in that kind of Western led order. It’s the end of 20 years of Putin trying to use diplomacy as well as his kind of hybrid warfare tactics to try to further his interests in Europe. That’s all gone now. We’re in a new reality now, where Russia is showing it is prepared to fight a large land war in Europe to achieve what it describes to be its aims. It’s just a totally different world that we’re in now.

michael barbaro

Well, so let’s talk about the consequences of that for all involved.

anton troianovski

Yeah. I mean, I would break it up into a few different parts, the consequences for Ukraine, for Russia, for Europe, and the U.S., and the rest of the world. So starting with Ukraine. This is just the beginning, I fear. If this continues, if this continues the way we think it’s going to, to Putin pursuing regime change, it could get much more bloody. So we don’t know yet what happens to the cities. There is a fight for territory going on in Eastern Ukraine, where those separatist regions are. But the big question is, will they go into Kyiv?

michael barbaro

Right.

anton troianovski

Very scarily, it looks like they may well.

michael barbaro

OK. So what about Russia, where you are based? What are the consequences you are seeing and expecting there?

anton troianovski

Well, so people are expecting a new crackdown on civil liberties, on freedom of speech, freedom of the press, even on business. The reason being that whenever we’ve had crackdowns here in Russia, the justification has always been that the Kremlin is hunting down internal enemies, who are serving some kind of foreign agenda to destabilize the country. So that’s certainly one thing to watch over the coming days and weeks is how much of an additional crackdown is there.

protesters [CHANTING]

anton troianovski

Tonight, we had pretty significant anti-war protests—

protesters [CHANTING]

anton troianovski

—in Moscow, and St. Petersburg, and in a number of cities in Siberia all told several thousand people were in the streets and there were more than 1,500 arrests. So—

michael barbaro

Wow.

anton troianovski

—one thing that’s very important to point out is, there has been next to no outpouring of support for this. And there is a lot of anger, disbelief, fear to see your country inflicting so much suffering on a neighboring country is awful, and this narrative for why it was necessary to do it. It really does fall apart quite quickly upon inspection. Why— How does Ukraine actually threaten Russia? Can it really be true that the Ukrainians were planning an invasion of these pro-Russian separatist areas in the East just as 150,000 plus troops were surrounding Ukraine on three sides? There’s just so much in the Kremlin propaganda narrative that doesn’t hold up, that I think a lot of people aren’t buying that story.

michael barbaro

OK. Finally, let’s talk about the consequences for the United States and for the rest of the world.

anton troianovski

So President Biden and the E.U. announced major sanctions today against Russia. And Russia has promised to respond potentially asymmetrically. So we might not see sanctions by Russia against the U.S., but we might see Russia take other actions that could cause harm and pain in the U.S. And they’re— We can really only speculate what that would be. Some folks are talking about the potential for cyber attacks here in Moscow. There’s been a lot of talk that Russia could base missiles or other military assets in Latin America, to more directly threaten the United States. Russia, obviously, is one of the world’s biggest energy suppliers, especially to Europe. If it were to turn that spigot, that could cause incredible problems for Europeans. So there is so much uncertainty here still, not just in Ukraine, not just in Russia, but really about how this crisis plays out and what it means for the rest of the world.

michael barbaro

And Anton, as you’re preparing to sign-off for the night, I want to return to Ukraine and where this situation leaves its people at this moment.

anton troianovski

I mean, it’s a horrible situation. These are people who— I think there was so little expectation that Russia could actually go ahead with this kind of invasion. And now they are making choices they would never thought they would have to make. Do they stay in Kyiv? Do they try to flee West? Do they try to get out of the country? Do you sleep in the basement? It’s really an unimaginable situation for millions and millions of people right now.

[music]

michael barbaro

Well, Anton, thank you. We’ll talk again soon. Stay safe.

anton troianovski

Thank you.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

[music]

All day yesterday, my colleagues in Ukraine and back in the U.S. we’re speaking with Ukrainians around the country about their experiences of the past 24 hours.

denis surkov

Hello.

lynsea garrison

Hi. How are you?

denis surkov

Hi, Lynsey. Not good.

lynsea garrison

Not good.

denis surkov

It’s not the same.

michael barbaro

Lynsea Garrison got on the phone with Denis Surkov, who lives in a city called Dnipro in Eastern Ukraine.

denis surkov

I am doctor, Chief of Dnipro Regional Children’s Hospital.

lynsea garrison

You’re a doctor at Dnipro Regional Children’s Hospital.

denis surkov

Yep.

lynsea garrison

OK.

denis surkov

And I am Chief of NICU and I.C.U.

lynsea garrison

Chief of NICU?

denis surkov

Exactly.

lynsea garrison

Got it. Can you just tell me a little bit about what the past 24 hours have been like for you?

denis surkov

So in the morning, we wake up and we have heard, first, rocket explosions near Dnipro Airport. So I was in my hospital. We were nervous. We were confused. Everybody was near their laptops or iPhones.

lynsea garrison

Yeah.

denis surkov

And checked the news. And the news were and are dramatic.

lynsea garrison

Dramatic. How were you understanding this? Did you think that this would happen?

denis surkov

Honestly, no. We were expected for the beginning of the attack, but we didn’t know that it could be so, so fast, so right now. And now, the borders between Ukrainian regions are closed. We had some possibilities and some efforts to go last week.

lynsea garrison

OK.

denis surkov

I can’t explain, but something stopped us. We hoped that finally everything will resolve. But now, honestly, I don’t know exactly what to do.

lynsea garrison

What do you think stopped you?

denis surkov

My family didn’t want to leave Ukraine because we love Ukraine, and we wanted to live here happy and in peace, and so on. So I said, OK, maybe everything will be not so bad. Let’s wait. So my main question for myself is, if I made a very, very big mistake not to move from Ukraine when I had an opportunity to do this.

lynsea garrison

That’s a heavy question.

denis surkov

Yes. If there was a big mistake or not so big, and I have no answer. I can ask you, do you want to wake up in the morning and understand you should go forever, not for one day, not for two days, forever? Can you make such a decision in— I don’t know, in 10 minutes? My question to you.

lynsea garrison

Yeah.

denis surkov

To bring just a bit of water, just a bit of food, single cloth, documents, money, and go outside your home forever, can you make such a decision? Just imagine.

lynsea garrison

Yeah.

denis surkov

So this was my family feeling last week. Even though yesterday in the evening, I told to my wife that this is the last calm day we can evacuate. In the morning, we realized that war came to Ukraine, not conflict, not disturbs, war, conventional war.

lynsea garrison

What are your children asking you? Like, how are you talking about this with them?

denis surkov

I say to my children, everything will be OK, your father will care about you.

lynsea garrison

How old are they?

denis surkov

My elder daughter is 30 and she lives abroad. And my younger daughter, she is 14. She’s with me.

lynsea garrison

How is she doing?

denis surkov

She believed me.

lynsea garrison

That you’ll protect her? And how does that make you feel that she believes you?

denis surkov

I will do all I can to protect her. I don’t know exactly what, but I will do everything, everything can.

lynsea garrison

Are you worried it won’t be enough?

denis surkov

I am worried. Everything could be changed, I don’t know, next few hours or even next few maybe minutes.

sabrina tavernise It’s 3:30 and we’re driving in Central Kyiv, and this is just a closed town right now. The day is still very gray. The sky is very low. Feels sort of raw, and cold, and wet. The air has a kind of bitter smell of ordinance. It’s the smell of the air after an air strike. Someone carrying a gun and some body armor down the street. A very sweet little bakery, I’m going to come in. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] speaker 10 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] sabrina tavernise Yeah. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] The New York Times. speaker 10 Yeah. sabrina tavernise [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Sabrina. Yeah. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] I’m saying I’m a journalist from The New York Times and I would like sweets, but also her opinion. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] speaker 10 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] sabrina tavernise Today, there’s panic, people are panicking very strongly. speaker 10 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] sabrina tavernise You can see that they’ve bought me a lot of bread. So I’m doing a bit of panic buying myself, two large bags of cookies, three candy bars, 10 quiches, and a bunch of almond croissants. speaker 10 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] sabrina tavernise [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] speaker 10 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] sabrina tavernise [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] I’m asking her if she plans to leave.

[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

speaker 10 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

[music]

sabrina tavernise OK. Back to the hotel. Everything is closed now. It’s almost as if it was nighttime. A few cars are still going by, but almost no pedestrians. It’s very central. The street is just completely deserted.

[music]

It does feel ominous.

michael schwirtz Day one of the war it’s been a very long day. The town I’m in, Slovyansk, kind of continued on as normal. There were bits of panic that could be evident. There were lines at the A.T.M.s. And people were stocking up on medications. But overall, the mood was pretty calm and collected, probably because these people have been through this before, the town came under heavy attack in 2014 when Ukrainian forces clashed with Russian backed rebels who had come in from the East. And so when I’m walking around town, people are telling me that this is just part of their lives. Very few people I met around town today said that they had any intention of leaving even though rocket attacks hit an airport nearby and Russian forces were fighting with the Ukrainian military just a few dozen kilometers away. lera alekseevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] lera alekseevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz I met a woman named Lera Alekseevna, who was in the courtyard near my hotel. Oh, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] lera alekseevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz And she had stuffed her pet hairless cat in her jacket and it was shivering. lera alekseevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] And she was telling me how she was planning on going to work at a company that sells cash registers and bringing her animals with her, so that they wouldn’t have to be alone. So if she had to make a quick dash for it, she could be with her animals. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] lera alekseevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz But she said she had no intention of leaving, mostly out of fear that she would be forced to leave behind her pets. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] lera alekseevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz Outside a blood bank in Slovyansk, I met a young man named Bogdan Kravchenko,

[non-english singing]

who was just sitting in his car listening to the Ukrainian national anthem cranked up on high volume.

bogdan kravchenko [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] He had just gone and donated blood. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] bogdan kravchenko [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz And he said he wasn’t panicked, but he said that he was acting according to the situation and that things had only just begun. bogdan kravchenko [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] I walked up to a base of the National Guard Unit here in Slovyansk. And out front there were a few couples, men dressed in drab green uniforms, and women— all of them were being sent off. The men, they were all being sent off somewhere. Some of them said they couldn’t tell me where they were being sent. Some of them admitted that they didn’t even know. I met one couple, Yelena and Eugenia. Yelena had brought Eugenia, her husband, some clothes that he was going to take with him on his deployment wherever he was headed. Another couple just held each other for what seemed like 15, 20, 30 minutes, just held each other on the street in the sun ahead of whatever deployment this young man was being sent on. speaker 11 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] speaker 12 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz You both [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] speaker 11 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] speaker 11 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] speaker 11 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] And then, I met Lyubov Vasilyevna, a 75-year-old pensioner, she was carrying a bag filled with newly purchased loaves of bread. And she said she had spent her last bit of cash on. And was waiting in line at an A.T.M., it would appear that there was no cash left. lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz All she wanted, she said, was to live in peace in her native Donbass, which is what this Eastern region is called. lyubov vasilavna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz And then, she paused and recited a poem that she said she wrote 2 years ago. It was supposed to be evocative, the piece that she was looking for. lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz And I’ll read that poem that I translated from the Russian into English. I’m so looking forward to peace, but it is coming to us so slowly. lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz We still have a little patience. Peace is close at hand, and we’re waiting for it to arrive without gunfire, without blood. Enough has been spilled in Donbass. lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz Let the sun smile, and the sky brighten, and the children smile. Let it go in a black moment. There will be peace for all. And people will say, god hurt us. lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz Let all stormy skies leave us. lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Donbass [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz And hail Donbass and the city of Slovyansk. lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

sabrina tavernise It’s 11:30 AM on Friday in Kyiv. Last night, in the city there were a lot of airstrikes and it seems like they’re getting closer. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] speaker 13 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] sabrina tavernise [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

[music]

The airstrikes are beginning again. You can hear the siren. We’re trying to decide whether to leave. Our colleagues, a few of them drove out this morning because it’s really unclear what’s going to happen. Will there be a big fight with the Ukrainian military? Or will the Russians just come in? What will happen if they take the city? And it seems like that is imminent. So we’re trying to make arrangements. Our hotel doesn’t have a generator, which means we would be out of power if the power gets cut off in the city, which is a pretty good chance. Yeah. We’re trying to figure it out. I guess, like a lot of people here, we’re trying to make that decision. Should we leave or should we stay?

michael barbaro

As of Friday afternoon in Kyiv, Ukrainian officials were bracing for an attack on the capital city as Russia’s military offenses pressed closer to the heart of the government.

volodymyr zelensky

[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

michael barbaro

In a televised address, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said that at least 137 Ukrainians, military and civilians, had already been killed. And he called on Ukrainians to defend themselves against Russian forces, saying that nobody else would come to their rescue.

volodymyr zelensky

[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

michael barbaro

Zelensky, who was unshaven and in a t-shirt said that he himself was now Russia’s number one target. Followed, he said, by his own family.

7,7d441ad0-c105-4f0a-af3f-ae7bda5340d3,['Valerie Hopkins'],2022-02-24 00:00:00,"“We are different,” he said, “but that is not a reason to be enemies. We want to determine, build our future ourselves, peacefully, calmly and honestly.”

Ukraine’s Parliament declared a state of military emergency, and the government announced it would give arms to anyone with combat experience who was ready to defend the country and urged people to donate blood for wounded veterans.

“The future of our Ukrainian people depends on every citizen,” Mr. Zelensky said on Thursday.

“The enemy has suffered heavy losses,” he added. “The losses of the enemy will be even greater. They came to our land. Ukraine is under attack from the north, east and south. Attacked from the air. Protection works. Today, the army and national solidarity are the mainstay of Ukrainian statehood.” It was a hopeful statement considering how much Russian firepower his soldiers are up against.

Mr. Zelensky’s path mirrors that of his country, which has been at war with Russia-backed separatists for eight years. The past decade has seen Ukrainian national pride and use of the Ukrainian language dramatically rise, in tandem with trust in democracy and a pro-Western orientation. Trust in Russia, and respect for Mr. Putin’s authoritarian government, has dwindled.

“He made a transformation because basically, Ukrainian society made this transformation,” said Volodymyr Yermolenko, a philosopher who edits Ukraine World magazine.

The president was “a person from eastern Ukraine, a Russian speaker, who made his business in Russian,” he said, referring to Mr. Zelensky’s television channel, Kvartal 95. “Russians would have expected pro-Russian policies on his part, but he understands that Russians want to make everything on their terms and push Ukraine around, and deny Ukraine’s existence. Of course he gradually became a typical Ukrainian patriot.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/24/world/europe/ukraine-zelensky-speech.html

“Today I initiated a phone call with the president of the Russian federation. The result was silence. Though the silence should be in Donbass. That’s why I want to address today the people of Russia. I am addressing you not as a president, I am addressing you as a citizen of Ukraine. More than 2,000 km of the common border is dividing us. Along this border your troops are stationed, almost 200,000 soldiers, thousands of military vehicles. Your leaders approved them to make a step forward, to the territory of another country. And this step can be the beginning of a big war on European continent.

We know for sure that we don’t need the war. Not a Cold War, not a hot war. Not a hybrid one. But if we’ll be attacked by the [enemy] troops, if they try to take our country away from us, our freedom, our lives, the lives of our children, we will defend ourselves. Not attack, but defend ourselves. And when you will be attacking us, you will see our faces, not our backs, but our faces.

The war is a big disaster, and this disaster has a high price. With every meaning of this word. People lose money, reputation, quality of life, they lose freedom. But the main thing is that people lose their loved ones, they lose themselves.

They told you that Ukraine is posing a threat to Russia. It was not the case in the past, not in the present, it’s not going to be in the future. You are demanding security guarantees from NATO, but we also demand security guarantees. Security for Ukraine from you, from Russia and other guarantees of the Budapest memorandum.

But our main goal is peace in Ukraine and the safety of our people, Ukrainians. For that we are ready to have talks with anybody, including you, in any format, on any platform. The war will deprive [security] guarantees from everybody — nobody will have guarantees of security anymore. Who will suffer the most from it? The people. Who doesn’t want it the most? The people! Who can stop it? The people. But are there those people among you? I am sure.

I know that they [the Russian state] won’t show my address on Russian TV, but Russian people have to see it. They need to know the truth, and the truth is that it is time to stop now, before it is too late.
