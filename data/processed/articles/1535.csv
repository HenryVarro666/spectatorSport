Various media reports also say Britain will send anti-ship missiles, including the venerable Harpoon system. Here we consider how realistic that may be and other options to hold the Russian navy at risk in the Black Sea.



Ukraine’s southern flank continues to be menaced by the Russian Navy which is able to operate almost with impunity. Their naval forces can launch cruise missiles at their leisure and provide continuous threat of amphibious attack, tying down precious defensive resources. A few indiscriminate attacks on merchant vessels by the Russian navy early in the war shut down commercial shipping, chocking the Ukrainian economy and closing off a potential resupply route. The Russians are also using the Black Sea and Sea of Azov to provide logistic support to their forces ashore, so far only losing a single elderly landing ship to unknown causes.

Ukraine’s tiny navy was never able to get into the fight and land-based solutions to destroy, or at least deter, the aggressor are needed. On 4th April, Ukrainian military sources claimed they had struck the Russian frigate RFS Admiral Essen but this is impossible to verify and the Russians will never admit this if it were true. It has been speculated that a domestically-produced RK-360MC Neptune anti-ship missile was used but the availability and effectiveness of this weapon is uncertain. Whatever the actual capability, if the Russians come to believe there is a credible shore-based anti-ship missile threat then it will complicate their planning and further deter any amphibious operations.

As an island nation and a world naval power, for most casual observers it would be reasonable to expect that the UK possesses a large stock of modern anti-ship missiles. There are many tasks and competing priorities, but the ability to sink adversaries’ warships is, after all, core business for any navy. Mainly due to budget cuts and a degree of institutional complacency, the only heavyweight AShM are the RN’s small stock of obsolete US-made Harpoons which were due to leave service in 2018 (although extended until 2023). The UK does possess more modern lightweight weapons but these are intended to counter vessels of corvette size or smaller.

The antique collection

In 2020 the RN issued an exploratory request to the industry for bids to extend the life of its Harpoons Block 1C Anti-Ship missiles to 2027. Ultimately Babcock (Devonport) was awarded a contract in early 2021 to extend support for another year. Current weapon stocks are mostly life-expired. Even if well looked after and maintained by the Defence Munitions organisation, the explosives and propellants in a missile degrade over time. These elements need to be replaced and the weapons re-certified or they can become at best unreliable or even dangerously unsafe. Unless there has been a crash program to rapidly re-certify UK Harpoon stocks, there are probably only a handful of usable weapons left. The lack of missiles was indicated by the fact that for the Carrier Strike deployment in 2021, which included operations in the contested environment of the South China Sea, only one of the four RN escorts (HMS Kent) was fitted with Harpoon.

Four of the Type 45 Destroyers were fitted with the Harpoon equipment removed from the decommissioned Type 22 batch IIIs frigates in the early 2010s but now no longer carry the missiles at all. Besides HMS Kent, only HMS Montrose, permanently deployed in the Persian Gulf carries Harpoon, just 16 missiles in total. There is also a declining number of RN personnel trained in operating and maintaining Harpoon.

The submarine-launched version was the first Harpoon to enter RN service, rushed into use just after the end of the Falklands conflict in 1982. The surface-launched Harpoon B1C was introduced by Boeing in 1985 and first saw RN service (As GWS60) with HMS Cornwall, commissioned in 1988. In the 1980s the RAF also purchased a small stock of air-launched Harpoons for its Nimrod Maritime Patrol Aircraft aircraft. It is assumed these were disposed of by the time Nimrod MRA4 was axed in 2010. The RAF says its new P8-A Poseidons will be armed with a newer Harpoon variant but it is unclear when these will be purchased, although the integration work has already be done by the US.

Navigation for the Block 1C is by inertial guidance and data provided by the launch platform. The missile can also be pre-programmed with waypoints to avoid a direct course of attack. In the terminal phase, guidance is by an active radar seeker. The missile is subsonic, susceptible to modern countermeasures and lacks a data link to provide mid-course corrections. Its inability to discriminate between targets in complex environments also makes it a potential liability that may slam into the first merchant ship detected in the terminal phase.

Let us imagine the UK is able to supply a few working Harpoons to Ukraine. They would need to be flown in, mounted on sturdy trailers so they are mobile and concealable to avoid detection by Russian Satellites and drones. The launch computers would require integration and re-programming for land-based operation. Before any attack can be mounted, the missiles would have to be fed with targeting data from a coastal radar or other real-time intelligence sources and competent people assigned to operate the system.

Other options

Assuming the UK does not just act as intermediary supplying missile stocks purchased from a third party, there are some smaller weapons available in the UK inventory. The MBDA Sea Venom is a new air-launched missile with a 30kg warhead designed to counter Fast Inshore Attack Craft or Corvettes. Range is officially 20km, although in practice probably significantly longer. It is being integrated on the RN’s Wildcat helicopter but has not yet declared full operating capability. A helicopter attack on the Russian fleet would be a high-risk activity at the best of times. Integrating Sea Venom with remaining any Ukrainian attack helicopters would be extremely challenging.

The RAF has a significant stock of air-launched Brimstone light stand-off missiles designed originally to destroy armoured vehicles and used successfully in Afghanistan and Syria. Brimstone is exceptionally accurate and has a range of around 20-25km. In 2013 MBDA demonstrated a maritime Brimstone variant branded “Sea Spear”. It is guided by an inertial navigation systesm, high-resolution millimeter-wave radar and semi-active laser homing, carrying a much larger (16kg) warhead than the air-launched variety. Sea Spear could be launched from fixed mounts ashore or from small warships and is intended to counter small craft. Sea Spear is not in production but potentially stocks of air-launched weapons might be adapted in a hurry. Deployed in large numbers, Sea Spear would be ideal to repel an amphibious assault but of limited use against larger naval units deployed further away from the coast in the Black Sea.

It would be foolish to say “it could never be done” as war is the mother of improvisation but it looks highly unlikely the UK will supply Harpoons to Ukraine and has limited alternative options. Other nations allied to Ukraine have modern, operational land-based heavyweight anti-ship missiles that would provide much greater punch than anything the UK can offer.",https://www.navylookout.com/can-the-uk-supply-anti-ship-missiles-to-ukraine/

According to information accessed by Republic TV, Britain's shipment of new weapons support is aimed to bog down the Russian Black Sea fleet blockading Ukraine's coasts. The announcement of the Harpoon missile systems to Ukraine comes after UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson met with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy in embattled Kyiv on Saturday (April 9).

Today I met my friend President @ZelenskyyUa in Kyiv as a show of our unwavering support for the people of Ukraine.

What are Harpoon missiles?

A Harpoon anti-ship missile system is developed and manufactured by McDonnell Douglas, which is now the Boeing Defence, Spade, and Security). The interceptor is an all-weather, over-the-horizon and anti-ship type, which has the capability to blitz warships at a range of more than 80 miles.

First deployed in 1977, a Harpoon has a low-level, sea-skimming cruise and uses an active radar terminal homing and flies just above the water to evade defences. Considered as one of the world's most successful anti-ship missiles, it is in service with the armed forces of more than 30 countries.

UK pledges new military aid to Ukraine

The latest 'lethal' military shipment to Ukraine is also said to include 120 armoured vehicles, including tracked armoured personnel carriers known as Spartans. The vehicles were first entered into service in 1978.

Shortly after PM Boris Johnson's surprise in-person visit in a ""show of unwavering support for the people"", the UK government on Saturday pledged new military assistance for Kyiv. Downing Street on Saturday announced that Britain would provide armoured vehicles and anti-ship missile systems ""in addition to the £100 million worth of high-grade military equipment announced on Friday.""

In a statement following the announcement, the British government informed, ""The new support will include more anti-tank missiles and air defence systems, as well as loitering munitions and non-lethal aid like helmets, body armour, and night-vision goggles.""

Other important military equipment supplies would include:

More than 800 more NLAW anti-tank missiles

Additional Javelin anti-tank systems

Additional loitering munitions

Additional Starstreak air defence systems

Additional non-lethal aid including ballistic helmets, body armour and night-vision goggles

Boris Johnson during his meeting with Zelenskyy vowed to bolster defensive aid to ensure 'Putin's failure'. The package comes atop £350 million in military aid and around £400 million in economic and humanitarian support that the UK has already provided to Ukraine.

The latest assistance has been designed in consultation with Ukraine Armed Forces aimed to meet the military needs amid the all-out Russian assault.

The UK will send the Harpoon missiles in a bid to break the Russian navy’s siege of Black Sea ports.

Fitted with a 500lb high explosive blast warhead, the system is carried by 600 Nato warships and 180 submarines around the world.

The 15ft missiles are accurate to a range of 80 miles.

And giving Ukraine access to these missiles means the US and its allies wont have to send more secretive weaponry, with concerns they might fall into the hands of Russia.

Black Sea blockade

Russia has blockaded crucial seaports in Ukraine with warships.

Up to 300 ships have been stopped by Russian forces from departing the Black Sea, leaving one of the key global trade routes for grain virtually blocked.

The fertile region is known as “the world’s breadbasket.”

British newspaper The Guardian reported that several other ships have been struck since the invasion began on February 24, including from Bangladesh and Estonia, which killed one person.

“We are confident of a smooth substitution over the next years,” a Navy officer said. “The effort covers all combat ships in our inventory.”

An official from state-controlled missile-maker Roketsan, a co-producer of Atmaca (which translates to “Hawk” in English), said that the weapon will replace more than 350 Harpoons in the next two to three years, starting with ships under maintenance and upgrade programs.

Both officials spoke on the condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to speak to the press.

Roketsan won the development contract from the Turkish government in 2009. In 2018, Roketsan teamed up with military-electronics specialist Aselsan, Turkey’s largest defense firm, to jointly manufacture Atmaca, which incorporates features of the Harpoon and French Exocet missiles.

In 2019, Atmaca was fitted aboard Turkey’s fourth Ada-class corvette, the TCG Kinaliada. It was successfully tested in July 2020.

The Roketsan official said Turkey aims to save up to $500 million from the Atmaca replacement program, as the homemade missile comes in at around half the price of a Harpoon.

Defense News asked Harpoon manufacturer Boeing about the financial impact of Turkey’s decision, but the company referred questions to the U.S. government and the international customer.

Atmaca is a subsonic, sea-skimming anti-ship missile with a range exceeding 220 kilometers. It features a 250-kilogram-class high-explosive fragmentation warhead. It reportedly has a high resistance to countermeasures and features all-weather capabilities, a target updating and mission termination facility, and a comprehensive mission planning system with 3D routing.

The missile is effective against sea targets in open or coastal waters, as well as against shore-based targets. During tests, Atmaca cruised at an altitude as low as 3 meters.

It will be fitted aboard the Ada-class corvettes, the Istanbul-class frigates and the TF2000-class anti-air warfare destroyers.

And 120 armoured vehicles including tracked armoured personnel carriers known as Spartans will also be donated.

The vehicles first entered service in 1978 and were due to be retired.

Other vehicles Mastiff, Husky and Wolfhound armoured personnel carriers were designed to protect troops from Improvised Explosive Devices in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The Prime Minister called Zelensky a lion and said Ukraine had defied the odds in fighting Russia and insisted the UK stands unwaveringly with them.

Yesterday he pledged £100million worth of further UK military assistance, including anti-tank and anti-aircraft weaponry and so-called “suicide drones”, which loiter over the battlefield before attacking their target.

And today he met President Zelensky in Kyiv in an unannounced visit for fresh talks on ending Russian tyrant Vladimir Putin’s war.

Boris Johnson vowed to give Ukraine the weapons, technology and intelligence to ensure that ""Putin must fail"".

He hailed the courage of ordinary Ukrainians, condemned Putin's regime for his ""war crimes"" and promised to ratchet up sanctions week-by-week until Russia was defeated.

Speaking in Kyiv he said: ""The world has found new heroes, and those heroes are the people of Ukraine. The Ukrainians have shown the courage of a lion.""

And he praised President Zelensky for providing the lion's roar.

He said Britain and allies would give Ukraine ""the equipment, the technology the know-how and the intelligence so that Ukraine will never be invaded again"".

""So Ukraine is so fortified and so protected that Ukraine can never be bullied again, never be blackmailed again,"" he added.

""Never be threatened in the same way again.""

He warned there was ""a huge amount to do to make sure that Ukraine is successful, that Ukraine wins and that Putin must fail"".

He added: ""What Putin has done in places like Bucha and Irpin, his war crimes have permanently polluted his reputation and the reputation of his of his government.

""We will continue to intensify week by week, the sanctions on Russia not just freezing assets in banks and sanctioning oligarchs moving away from our use of Russian hydrocarbons.

""And we will give you the support that you need economic support but also, of course, the defensive military support.""

Johnson and Zelensky were pictured alone in a room today with a British and Ukrainian flag beside them.

Deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential office Andriy Sybiha said: “The UK is the leader in defence support for Ukraine. The leader in the anti-war coalition. The leader in sanctions against the Russian aggressor.”

A No 10 spokesperson said the PM had travelled to Ukraine to meet Zelensky in person ""in a show of solidarity with the Ukrainian people"".

The surprise meeting comes as Russia unleashed a new wave of terror on Friday when it bombed the Kramatorsky railway station in eastern Ukraine.

At least 50 people were killed and more than 100 injured in the barbaric attack, that involved a missile that has ""for the children"" scribbled on its side.

President Zelensky slammed the attack in a social media post yesterday, saying: ""This is an evil that has no limits.""

""The occupiers hit the Kramatorsk railway station with a Point-U [missile], where thousands of peaceful Ukrainians were waiting to be evacuated,"" the Ukrainian leader wrote on Instagram before the death toll was updated.

""About 30 people died, about 100 people were injured to varying degrees. Police and rescuers are already on the scene. Russian non-humans do not abandon their methods.

""Lacking the strength and courage to stand up to us on the battlefield, they are cynically destroying the civilian population.

""This is an evil that has no limits. And if it is not punished, it will never stop.""

EU President Ursula von der Leyen visited Bucha - the site of the latest alleged Russian atrocities - on Friday.

Von der Leyen said she had witnessed the ""unthinkable"" in the devastated town, which was occupied by Russian troops days earlier.

She also presented Zelensky with an official membership questionnaire in at a historical joint press conference in Kyiv.

It comes as Britain has agreed to send 120 armoured cars - including Mastiffs - to Ukraine and more fighter jets to the Russian border in the fightback against Putin.

UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said Britain would step up arming the war-torn nation and vowed to do whatever he could to help back those fighting Putin's troops.

The vehicles were previously used in Afghanistan to withstand Taliban explosives - and can be shipped over via Europe.

They can carry up to eight troops plus another two crew - and can be armed with other weapons too.

The Sun understands that ministers want to send up to 200 of them over time.

Britain will also send another two typhoon jets out to Romania next week to help support the NATO forces out there - joining four already in the region.

SILVER SPRING and WASHINGTON—We are now clearly seeing a new phase of the Russia-Ukraine war. The bear has been unmasked, and nobody is impressed (it’s more like a rabid, angry cub with birth defects).

In fact, I could write a whole other article (and maybe I will!) about how challenging it is to find a situation where the ostensible number-two military power in the world or thereabouts (and let’s be honest, the ranking is now, far far lower) has done more to reduce its power and expose its military weakness against a far weaker foe in a mere six weeks, but without a doubt, we are witnessing one of the only—perhaps the only—example of something like this to this degree in history.

Rapidly Changing Dynamics

Yes, Russia’s insane, hubristic, careless “plan”—to commit forces to multiple fronts, dividing and weakening its forces over these many fronts, none of which individually succeeded in their main goals—is failing and suffered its greatest setbacks when its entire Kyiv front, itself consisting of multiple subfronts and lines of advance, and two other whole fronts in north-central Ukraine collapsed entirely, all Russian forces in the area having been destroyed, decimated, pushed back, or routed in disorder. As they have been thrown out of Ukraine, many Russian units are committing war crimes along their paths of retreat if they were not committing them there and elsewhere already.

This sudden collapse of the Russian positions on three nearby fronts has freed up a huge portion of Ukraine’s military to go and relieve other fronts to the east, and, indeed, this is already happening, as was the case with the Chernihiv and Sumy fronts right after the Kyiv front collapsed. Obviously, some forces will have to stay to keep Russian forces from reopening these fronts, but not too many: retreating forces are heavily demoralized and/or damaged, and will take significant time to rest, refit, and rebuild before approaching and serious level of combat effectiveness (however, abysmal Russian leadership is fairly likely to just throw their lives away in ill-planned, ill-timed offensives with troops not ready or prepared, as already happened earlier in the war over and over again under much better conditions for the Russians than they presently face; if so, Ukrainian forces will maul them again as they did before).

The way I see it (and I am in good company), the Russians will not only be lucky not to be routed from all their gains made since February 24, but are at serious risk of losing the Donbas—Luhansk and Donetsk—and Crimea, as well as having most of their current army destroyed. Talk of some sort of possible Grand New Russian Offensive in the east seem fantastical to me and others who put the big-picture together: with which troops, and of what quality (what elite unites haven’t sustained significant casualties?), and with what equipment? Will it be the remaining equipment that has already proven ineffective and easily destroyed especially by Ukraine’s western-supplied anti-tank and anti-air missiles? The units shattered and barely functional or not functional that managed to escape from Ukraine’s counteroffensives? Non-shattered but non-elite units that have also been deployed for months and are still exhausted? Conscripts almost finishing their terms? New conscripts who have never seen combat??

Yet as major Russian ground fronts have collapsed, attention is drawn away from an area where, with not much additional assistance from the West or perhaps even with aid already just now promised, Ukraine can easily achieve a resounding victory that would combine massive substantive defeats for the Russians with tremendous symbolism and loss of prestige for Russia in addition to greatly affecting the way ground combat plays out in the south and east.

I am talking about the near-annihilation of the Russian Navy presence in the Black Sea, including almost the entirety of the Black Sea Fleet.

Russia’s Big Ships Near Ukraine: Easy Targets…

Unlike armies, with thousands of soldiers, hundreds of units, and thousands of subunits, navies are mostly tied to a very finite number of vessels, almost always dozens or hundreds of vessels per navy at most.

Meaning: take out the ships, and the navy pretty much does not exist.

Russia has cannibalized its other three fleets (Northern Fleet, Baltic Fleet, and Pacific Fleet) and its one flotilla (the Caspian Flotilla) to reinforce the Black Sea Fleet and support its Ukraine effort, and, with Turkey closing the Bosporus and Dardanelles straits to the Mediterranean in early March to incoming military vessels under the 1936 Montreux Convention, that Caspian Flotilla is the only possible source of reinforcements to what is in the Black Sea, coming in though canal from the Caspian Sea, as other possible reinforcements coming in from the Mediterranean are now blocked.

As far as sizable surface ships in the Black Sea, by mid-March there were only twenty-one, according to a “senior defense official”: just twelve naval-combat-focused ships along with nine amphibious assault ships, accompanied by numerous far smaller patrol and support boats and, of course, submarines that are harder to track.

But that total was before the daring Ukrainian strike on the morning of March 24, which mysteriously destroyed a large Russian amphibious ship, the now sunk Alligator class Saratov,docked in the eastern Ukrainian Russian-occupied port of Berdyansk. Two other large amphibious ships, the Caesar Kunikov and Novocherkassk, were damaged and fled the port.

So scratch one, Russia is down now to just twenty major surface vessels.

That is not a large number.

…For the Right Weapons (and They Are Coming)

I had finished a version of this section before yesterday’s information that the UK and U.S. would be sending anti-ship missiles to Ukraine. But, for now, keep that low number of major Russian surface ships in mind when considering following:

For starters, as my old War Is Boring editor David Axe notes in detail, Ukraine has been developing its own anti-ship cruise missile, the Neptune, since 2013. It began testing in 2018, and has since tested successfully repeatedly. The system has a range of 174-180 miles (280-300 km) and operates as a sea-skimmer, flying low and close to the water to make it almost undetectable until just before it hits its target. It was scheduled to be deployed this month with a full division of six launchers, seventy-two cruise missiles (more than three for each remaining major Russian surface vessel), and accompanying radar systems. But Russia’s seems to have derailed this timetable, and it is unclear when it will be able to safely deploy its system and have it and its crews be operational. Details are few and far between as Ukraine obviously would want to keep Russia guessing.

Secondly, this must have been part of the discussion over the past month between Ukraine and NATO nations, and taking into account the issues with the Neptunes, NATO has been working to arm Ukraine with anti-ship missiles for weeks. Reports from early April indicated United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been keen to arm Ukraine with anti-ship missiles, that these would most likely be truck-mounted versions of its U.S.-supplied Harpoon missiles, its version having a range of 80 miles (128 km) and also capable of hitting land targets (Ukraine has actually been asking for these for some time).

Well, yesterday, when I took a nap after nearly finishing this article, Johnson met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv in a surprise visit and the UK announced it actually would be sending anti-ship missiles*, among other aid. Also reported yesterday was that the U.S., too, will apparently be sending Ukraine anti-ship missiles. Options besides the Harpoon missile from within NATO include Norway’s Naval Strike Missile (NSM), already in several NATO arsenals (including the U.S.) and with a range of 115 miles (185 km), and its Penguin anti-ship missile launched from helicopters with a range of 21-34 miles (34-55 km).

UK PM Boris Johnson with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv, April 9 (Ukrainian Presidential Press Service)

Russian Naval forces are hardly concentrating along the Turkish coast of the southern Black Sea: they are mostly, perhaps virtually all, off the coast of Ukraine to varying degrees in the northern half of the Black Sea or Sea of Azov, trying to offer support and, presumably, debating whether or not to launch amphibious assaults, particularly on Ukraine’s main port in its West, Odesa (the fact that they have not yet shows how confident they are in such an assault’s chances of success; Putin may not care much about throwing his soldiers’ lives away recklessly, but his larger naval vessels are expensive and take time to construct).

As the above map shows and implies, Ukraine would have excellent coverage with many of these systems. For most of these systems, many, perhaps even all, of Russia’s twenty remaining large warships in the region—including Russia’s most powerful naval ship, the Slava class cruiser Moskva—are well within striking range from Ukrainian-controlled territory. Even if Ukraine will receive only Harpoons, though they have much smaller range than the Neptunes, they should effectively prevent any Russian naval assaults if the Russians are smart (but they are not). After such Harpoons would arrive, they would still secure Ukrainian coastline and push Russian naval operating areas far from Ukrainian-controlled coastal territory (unless Russia is stupid and keeps its ships within range, inviting their destruction) all while, presumably, the Neptune rollout, training, and deployment finishes, possibly in just a few weeks if the invasion has not derailed Ukraine’s timetable.

At this crucial moment, when Russia is desperate to turn the tide in the face of its massive failures, the soon-to-arrive unspecified anti-ship missiles have effectively killed any realistic Russian hope of a successful naval assault on Odesa or elsewhere on the Crimea-to-Moldova (where Russia illegally has some military forces in another breakaway region, Transnistria) corridor. These missiles will either prevent any assault from happening or virtually doom any would-be assault. This new round of aid with these anti-ship missiles has, thus, basically closed the gap between the Russians collapsing on three fronts and the Neptunes’ presumed deployment.

If (and hopefully when) Neptunes can be eventually deployed, a large portion of the entire Black Sea, including both the west and east coasts of Russian-occupied Crimea—where many of Russia’s naval vessels are based and resupplied—as well as the Sea of Azov, would be vulnerable. And if Ukraine is able to push Russian forces back closer to Crimea, even missiles with shorter range could threaten Russia’s ability to dock its ships and even the southern coast of Crimea and beyond can be vulnerable.

Soon, Russia’s navy will almost certainly have to turn tail and run to the southern Black Sea, unable to offer meaningful support in the ground war, or even move to port back in Russia proper (as in, the non-illegally occupied/annexed parts of Ukraine) to avoid near-total destruction. If there will be any problems or delays deploying the Neptunes, NATO should ensure longer-range anti-ship missiles, including some of the Norwegian NSMs, are provided to Ukraine so they can either destroy Russia’s navy or render it irrelevant, putting more Russian ships under range or pushing them even further back than would be the case with just, say, Harpoon missiles.

We should not expect details of these upcoming transfers to be broadcast in detail publicly before they happen, as, ideally, NATO would get Ukraine these missiles quietly, so Russian naval vessels will still be well within range and not expecting their use. With a few coordinated deployments, and with open-source intelligence (OSINT), U.S. & other NATO satellite and other intelligence aiding the Ukrainians, most, perhaps all of Russia’s twenty remaining large surface vessels could be targeted and heavily damaged or destroyed with just twenty missiles, insurance only being forty or slightly more missiles.

Around forty missiles is hardly a large number, and it hardly needs to be as successful as one missile, one ship destroyed; even if we allot three missiles for each ship, that is just sixty missiles. The first volley could be fired in a few minutes and hit its targets in not much longer than that. It is also extremely unlikely these missiles, given their technology and Russian capabilities, can be countered, and insurance and, even, double-insurance to effectively damage and destroy a huge portion of the entire Russian Navy, including most of its heavy hitters, is, again, just sixty missiles. And even just arming Ukraine with the shortest-range missiles would make any naval assault suicidal for Russia, any competent use ensuring many or all of the amphibious landing ships would be sunk before reaching land and severe damage or destruction for any other major ships that would venture close to support if Russia would not be smart enough to withdraw its vulnerable ships far away from Ukraine, or, as stated, would ensure such assaults do not take place if Russia is behaving less stupidly than it has been for this entire war.

A True Game-Changer: “Bye-Bye Russian Navy!“

These anti-ship missiles will either annihilate the Russian Navy in the Black Sea or push it far away to near-irrelevance (other than its ability to affect commercial shipping). This will absolutely humiliate Putin and the Russians, crush Russian morale, severely hamper the entirety of the logistical situation for the Russians as well as overall Russian efforts in southern Ukraine and on its coast, allow far more supplies to reach Ukraine’s people and military far more easily, perhaps destroy any hope of building a land bridge for Russia to Crimea (let alone one to Moldova), and also severely hamper Russia’s efforts to secure the Donbas. It could even help precipitate the collapse of the entire Russian war effort and perhaps even mutiny and revolt in the Russian military.

If you scoff at such an idea, consider the last time Russia suffered such a humiliating naval defeat, in the 1904-1905 Russo-Japanese war, that defeat precipitated massive loss of prestige, unrest, military revolt, and revolution in 1905 and was a major nail in the coffin of Tsarist Russia; among the units that mutinied was the crew of the battleship Potemkin, stationed at—of all places—Odesa, an event immortalized in Sergei Eisenstein’s 1925 film.

Ukraine might very well be able to succeed without destroying the Russian Navy in the Black Sea or pushing it so far away it can only exert marginal influence on the war, but it would sure be a lot easier, happen a lot faster, and save a lot of Ukrainian lives to remove the Russian Navy from the picture. The easiest way to do this is the deployment of anti-ship missiles for the reasons outlined above. And the cost for the West and Ukraine would only be relatively inexpensive and cost-effective anti-ship missile systems, along with the logistics to get them safely to Ukrainians and ensure Ukrainians can operate them effectively. But the cost for Russia? The bulk of their navy or their ability to use it to significantly support the war.

With the introduction of a serious supply of anti-ship missiles on the side of Ukraine, the Russian Navy is doomed to near-irrelevance at best or a watery grave at the bottom of the Black Sea or Sea of Azov, whether it or Putin knows this or not.

*Correction appended: Yesterday, the Guardian article I cited specifically noted that Harpoon missiles (link is for archived version) were being sent by the UK:

The Guardian has since removed the word “Harpoon” (as shown above) from the current article. This was my basis for earlier citing that Harpoons were the missiles the UK was sending. My article has since been corrected. Proper journalistic practice, which The Guardian clearly did not fellow, would be for a correction to be issued, as is being done here. Instead, the article was stealth edited to make it appear as if there was never a mention of Harpoons at all. I call on The Guardian to issue a proper correction and to be more transparent with making corrections or being unable to confirm specific information, as should be standard practice (but sadly is not as standard as it should be).

Britain will send armoured vehicles to Ukraine for the first time as part of a new £100m package, as Mr Zelenskyy warned against ""any delay"" in offering further weapons.

Speaking in his nightly video after what he called a ""war crime"" near Kramatorsk station, he said a ""delay in providing weapons to Ukraine, any refusals, can only mean the politicians in question want to help the Russian leadership more than us"".

UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace told Sky News the Ukrainian military would get Mastiff heavily armoured patrol vehicles, which weigh 23 tonnes and carry eight troops and two crew.

It is understood they will be stripped of sensitive equipment and could help mount offensive operations close to Russian lines.

The Mastiff was designed to withstand Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) during the Afghan war.

Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles, 800 anti-tank missiles, helmets, and night vision goggles will be included in the consignment, in addition to 200,000 items already distributed.

Key developments:

• Ammo depot destroyed at air base in central Ukraine, says Russia's Interfax news agency

• General responsible for atrocities in Syria reportedly now in charge of Ukraine invasion.

• Curfew in Black Sea port of Odesa from Saturday night until Monday amid fears of attack

• More than 6,600 people evacuated through humanitarian corridors on Friday

• EU promises to ""accelerate"" Ukraine's membership

• Russia has lost 19,000 troops, Ukraine claims, after Kremlin admits 'significant' losses

Defence secretary says support will continue

Speaking at a NATO ceremony in Romania, Mr Wallace refused to be drawn on whether the UK would commit anti-ship missiles such as the Harpoon, as requested by President Zelenskyy.

Mr Zelenskyy says they will help prevent Russia from consolidating its control of Ukraine's Black Sea coast.

Mr Wallace said: ""I won't discuss different types of weapons systems. I don't want to flag to Russians any change until they have happened.""

He added: ""Our commitment is to support Ukraine to make sure they have as much help as possible to defend themselves. And if the tactics of the Russians change, what we give them will change as well.""

The defence secretary also called the Kremlin ""deluded"" after Sky News's interview with Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov.

Mr Peskov was accused of living in a ""parallel universe"" and peddling a ""catalogue of lies"" when he denied Russians had committed war crimes in Bucha.

Station attack is 'evil that has no limits'

The missile strike near Kramatorsk station has raised more claims of war crimes and was described by Ukraine's president as an act of ""evil that has no limits"".

Five children were among the at least 50 people killed. Up to 4,000 people, thought to be largely women and children, were at the station when the blast hit.

Sky's John Sparks, reporting from the scene, said that emblazoned on the side of the mangled missile was за детей, which translates from Russian as for - or on behalf of - the children.

The station had been packed as people tried to flee Ukraine, but the Russian defence ministry denied targeting the station.

Mr Peskov claimed that Russian armed forces had no missions scheduled for Kramatorsk.

""Like the massacres in Bucha, like many other Russian war crimes, the missile attack on Kramatorsk should be one of the charges at the tribunal that must be held,"" said President Zelenskyy on Friday night.

Sky News military analyst Professor Michael Clarke said pictures of the almost intact missile laying outside the town indicate it is a cluster bomb - illegal for use on civilian targets.

General responsible for Syria atrocities 'now in charge'

Ukraine's railway operator said on Saturday that services out of Kramatorsk were still disrupted but that evacuations would continue at other stations in the country's east.

The start to the weekend also saw Russia claim to have destroyed an ammunition depot at the Myrhorod Air Base in central Ukraine, according to the country's Interfax news agency.

The Black Sea port of Odesa also imposed a curfew from Saturday night until Monday morning amid fears of an attack on the city.

There are also unconfirmed reports that Alexander Dvornikov, a Russian general responsible for atrocities in Syria, has been put in charge of the Ukraine invasion.

Speaking to Sky News, former UK ambassador to Russia Sir Roderic Lyne appeared to confirm the news.

""They've appointed a new general with a pretty savage track record in Syria to try to at least gain some territory in Donetsk that Putin could present as a victory,"" he said.

Russian forces abandon tanks in 'hasty' withdrawal

As Russia withdraws forces from northern Ukraine, one Western official said the abandoned tanks, vehicles, and artillery could indicate ""the collapse of morale and the collapse of the will to fight"".

The official told reporters on Wednesday: ""We can confirm that there are no longer units in northern Ukraine.

""It has been a pretty hasty withdrawal by Russian forces and there's a lot of Russian equipment which has been abandoned in that hasty withdrawal and that's only going to exacerbate the challenge they have in terms of the refurbishment and reconstitution of their forces as they remove them both into Belarus and into Russia.""

'Little point' negotiating with Russia, says PM

Following talks in Downing Street with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Boris Johnson said he saw little prospect of success negotiating with Mr Putin directly - although he did not criticise those, such as the French president, who continue to do so.

""Negotiating with Putin does not seem to me to be full of promise. I don't feel that he can be trusted,"" he said.

""That is not to say I don't admire the efforts of people who try to find a way through. But my own view is that I am deeply, deeply sceptical and, I'm afraid, cynical now about his assurances.""

Meanwhile, Home Secretary Priti Patel apologised after being criticised for delays in accepting refugees as the latest figures show only around 12,000 Ukrainians have arrived in the UK, despite 40,900 visas being granted.",https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-uk-sending-armoured-vehicles-for-first-time-as-zelenskyy-demands-firm-response-to-railway-blast-12585798
