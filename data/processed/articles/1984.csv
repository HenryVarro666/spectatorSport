During NATO and G7 leaders' talks in Brussels, PM Boris Johnson commited 6,000 additional defensive missiles and £25 million in financial support for Ukraine's military troops, further pushing the UK's partners to guarantee that Ukrainians have the resources to continue to defend themselves against Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces.

According to an official press release from PM’s office, these measures will be more than double the amount of lethal defence help delivered so far and will come on top of the £400 million the UK has already pledged in humanitarian and economic relief to the situation.

Boris Johnson will outline the UK's commitment to improve Ukraine's defence capabilities

Furthermore, Johnson will outline the UK's commitment to collaborate with partners to improve Ukraine's defence capabilities, especially longer-range targeting as well as intelligence.

As part of a cross-government attempt to fight disinformation in Russia and Ukraine, the UK will also offer an additional £4.1 million to the BBC World Service, as well as fresh financial and policing assistance for the International Criminal Court's probe into war crimes.

One month into the Russia-Ukraine war, the Prime Minister would welcome NATO and the G7 for their united approach to Ukraine and collaborative action on economic, military, and diplomatic initiatives, as per the release.

""Vladimir Putin is already failing in Ukraine. The Ukrainian people have shown themselves to be extraordinarily brave and tenacious in defending their homeland, in the face of an unprovoked onslaught,"" UK PM Johnson said. Adding to this he said, ""We can keep the flame of freedom alive in Ukraine, or risk it being snuffed out across Europe and the world,"" according to the release.

In addition to this, more than 4,000 anti-tank weaponry, which includes Next-Generation Light Anti-Tank Weapons Systems (NLAWs,) and Javelin missiles, have already been delivered to Ukraine's armed forces. The British government is also distributing Starstreak high-velocity anti-air missiles, along with body armour, helmets, and combat boots, to enable Ukrainians to protect themselves against aircraft attacks.

It is worth noting that the Conflict, Stability and Security Fund's new non-ODA support of £25 million will assist to pay the wages of Ukrainian soldiers, pilots, and police officers, as well as guarantee that the armed forces are well-equipped with high-quality weapons.

Meanwhile, Dominic Raab, the UK Justice Secretary, will also lead a conference of Justice and Foreign Ministers today in The Hague to coordinate assistance for the International Criminal Court's war crimes investigations.

UK will provide 6,000 new defensive missiles and £25m for Ukraine’s armed forces

Leaders meeting in Brussels are expected to discuss longer-term military, diplomatic and humanitarian support for Ukraine and strengthening measures against Russia

The Prime Minister will announce a major new package of support for Ukraine today at the NATO and G7 leaders’ meetings, as he calls on the international community to stay the course on Ukraine and stand against tyranny.

The measures announced today include 6,000 missiles, consisting of anti-tank and high explosive weapons, and £25 million in financial backing for the Ukrainian military. This more than doubles the defensive lethal aid provided to date to more than 10,000 missiles, and comes on top of the £400 million the UK has committed in humanitarian and economic aid for the crisis. The Prime Minister will set out the UK’s intention to work with partners to bolster Ukraine’s defence capabilities, including longer-range targeting and intelligence, as the Ukrainian people face down an unprovoked invasion.

The UK will also provide an additional £4.1 million for the BBC World Service as part of a cross-government effort to tackle disinformation in Russia and Ukraine, as well as new financial and policing support for the International Criminal Court’s investigation into war crimes.

One month into the conflict, the Prime Minister will welcome NATO and the G7’s unified stance on Ukraine and collective action on economic, military and diplomatic measures. He will urge Allies and partners to step up a gear in response to Russia’s use of increasingly brutal tactics, including by providing enhanced defensive support to Ukraine and doubling down on economic sanctions against the Kremlin.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:

Vladimir Putin is already failing in Ukraine. The Ukrainian people have shown themselves to be extraordinarily brave and tenacious in defending their homeland, in the face of an unprovoked onslaught. But we cannot and will not stand by while Russia grinds Ukraine’s towns and cities into dust. The United Kingdom will work with our allies to step up military and economic support to Ukraine, strengthening their defences as they turn the tide in this fight. One month into this crisis, the international community faces a choice. We can keep the flame of freedom alive in Ukraine, or risk it being snuffed out across Europe and the world.

The UK has already provided over 4,000 anti-tank weapons to Ukraine’s armed forces, including Next-Generation Light Anti-Tank Weapons Systems, or NLAWs, and Javelin missiles. The Government is also supplying Starstreak high-velocity anti-air missiles to help Ukrainians defend themselves against aerial bombings, as well as body armour, helmets and combat boots.

The £25 million in new non-ODA funding from the Conflict, Stability and Security Fund will help to pay the salaries of Ukrainian soldiers, pilots and police and ensure the armed forces are well equipped with high-quality equipment. The UK has committed £400 million in humanitarian and economic support to date, complementing the huge generosity of the British public, and donated more than 4 million items of medical equipment and 500 mobile generators.

In further support announced today, the BBC World Service will receive an additional £4.1 million in emergency funding to support its Ukrainian and Russian language services in the region, and to help it create content to counter disinformation about the war in Ukraine. The funding has been provided by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport and FCDO.

The Justice Secretary, Dominic Raab, will also chair a meeting of justice and foreign ministers in the Hague today to coordinate support for the International Criminal Court’s war crimes investigations. The Deputy Prime Minister is expected to announce an additional £1 million in funding for the court, as well as new support from UK soldiers with expertise in intelligence gathering and the Met Police’s War Crimes Team.",https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-announces-major-new-military-support-package-for-ukraine-24-march-2022

NATO leaders convened a meeting in Brussels on Wednesday to discuss overhauling the military alliance's eastern defences, a month after Russia invaded Ukraine. US President Joe Biden also reiterated that NATO and its allies will continue to support Ukraine with security assistance.

Meanwhile, Johnson said that the UK will be providing an additional 6,000 missiles to Ukraine, in addition to the 4,000 NLAWs and Javelin missiles already supplied to help their cause. ""Lethal defensive military aid, including Starstreak high-velocity anti-air missiles, will help Ukrainians continue to defend themselves,"" said Johnson.

He also told about providing Pound 25 million in financial backing for the Ukrainian military, which is on top of the Pound 400 million committed in humanitarian and economic aid by the UK. ""The UK will also provide an additional Pound 4.1 million for the BBC World Service to tackle disinformation in Russia and Ukraine, as well as new financial and policing support for the International Criminal Court's investigation into war crimes,"" tweeted Johnson.

""The UK, working with our allies and partners, will continue to support Ukraine and stand against tyranny. We will win together,"" said Johnson.

Meanwhile, Britain has slapped sanctions on 59 Russian individuals and entities, as well as six Belarusian enterprises over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, targeting a shadowy mercenary firm and the world's largest diamond producer. ""These oligarchs, businesses and hired thugs are complicit in the murder of innocent civilians and it is right that they pay the price,"" said UK Foreign Secretary, Liz Truss.

However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Ukraine has already shown what it's capable of and how it can contribute to security in Europe and the world. [{391c5e80-2171-45e5-b779-0319f14dbc5a:intradmin/Zelenskyy.jpg}]

He said that the NATO alliance is yet to prove what it is ready to do to protect people. In a virtual address, Zelensky said, ""NATO has yet to show what the Alliance can do to save people. To show that this is truly the most powerful defence association in the world. And the world is waiting. And Ukraine is very much waiting, for real action.""

He said that NATO can still prevent the deaths of Ukrainians from Russian attacks. He said ""Ukraine is asking for only 1 per cent of NATO's jets and tanks to help it defend itself from Russian aggression. We can't just buy them. Such a supply directly depends only on NATO's decisions, on political decisions, by the way."" (ANI)

The PM said Kyiv can do more than merely delay Vladimir Putin's victory after Volodymyr Zelensky addressed a summit of the military alliance by video-link.

Mr Zelensky pleaded for the leaders - including Joe Biden - to send '1 per cent of all your planes, 1 per cent of all your tanks'.

Mr Johnson said Britain wanted to help, while conceding there were 'logistical problems' involved.

But Emmanuel Macron flatly ruled out the idea, saying it was a 'red line' amid fears NATO could be dragged into direct conflict with Russia.

Putin last month ordered Russia's nuclear forces to be put on high alert, and threatened the West with 'consequences greater than any you have faced in history' should they directly intervene in Ukraine.

The apparent split came as NATO leaders met to discuss its response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The organisation, which has already beefed up its eastern flank to 40,000 troops spread from the Baltic to the Black Sea, agreed to set up new combat units in Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia.

But NATO turned down pleas by Kyiv to defend Ukraine's skies by imposing a no-fly zone and said again it will not send troops to Ukraine for fear of being dragged into a full-on military confrontation with nuclear-armed Russia.

NATO leaders said in a joint statement they were 'united and resolute in our determination to oppose Russia's aggression, aid the government and the people of Ukraine, and defend the security of all allies.'

Mr Biden called for the expulsion of Russia from the G20 group, while America agreed to take in 100,000 Ukrainian refugees fleeing the war.

A NATO rift emerged overnight as Emmanuel Macron said supplying tanks and jets to Ukraine would cross a 'red line', after Boris Johnson called on allies to do so. Pictured: The pair speak prior to a NATO meeting to discuss the invasion of Ukraine on Thursday, March 24

Mr Johnson had arrived pledging extra missiles to Kyiv and troops to NATO's eastern borders, and slammed Vladimir Putin for trying to 'Groznify' Ukraine's cities.

At a press conference wrapping up the gathering, the PM acknowledged Zelensky's call for tanks, saying the president believed they could 'relieve Mariupol and help thousands of Ukrainian fighters in the city.

'To that end, he does need armour as he sees it. We're looking at what we can do but I've got to tell you, logistically at the moment it looks very difficult with both armour and jets,' Mr Johnson conceded.

Instead, he said, 'at the moment we're looking at the equipment we think is more immediately valuable', including the new package of 6,000 more missiles.

He also accused Vladimir Putin of not taking Ukraine peace talks seriously and of crossing a 'red line' with his 'barbaric' invasion of the country.

In an interview with BBC Newsnight later, Mr Johnson painted a bleak picture of the Russian despot's intentions, saying he wants to 'double down and to try to Groznyfy the great cities of Ukraine' - a reference to the capital of Chechnya that was razed by Moscow's forces in the 90s.

But he also struck an optimistic tone, saying that he was confident Ukraine could ultimately win the war and that further Western supplies of military equipment would strengthen 'the quills of the Ukrainian porcupine as to make it in future indigestible to the Russian invaders.'

'Everybody wants peace, including the United Kingdom. If this could be solved It would be fantastic,' The Prime Minister - who was today effectively labelled enemy number one among western leaders by the Kremlin - told the BBC.

'I've got to tell you that I'm not optimistic that Vladimir Putin really wants that. I think that he's decided to double down and to try to Groznyfy the great cities of Ukraine.

'We need to do more as the West, which involves intensifying the sanctions, sending more missiles as we announced today, 6,000 more missiles, toughening up our sanctions doing more to stop leakage of Russian gold, all the ways in which we can tighten the screw on him,' he said in the interview.

The strength of Ukraine's resistance has taken politicians and military experts around the world by surprise. As Thursday marked four weeks since Putin launched his invasion, Ukrainian forces showed sighs of pushing Moscow's armies back.

A NATO official on Wednesday estimated that up to 15,000 Russian troops have been killed in Ukraine so far and a total of up to 40,000 have been killed, wounded, taken prisoner or are missing.

On Ukraine's chances of repelling Putin's forces, Mr Johnson said: 'I think Ukraine can certainly win. I don't think it's going to be easy, I think that the situation for the Ukrainians is grim, miserable.

'I don't think that we've seen anything like it for 80 years in Europe and what (Vladimir) Putin is doing is unconscionable.

'But there's a sense in which Putin has already failed or lost because I think that he had literally no idea that the Ukrainians were going to mount the resistance that they are and he totally misunderstood what Ukraine is.

'And far from extinguishing Ukraine as a nation he is solidifying it.'

One of the demands Russia is insisting on in order for it to withdraw from Ukraine is for the possibility of its neighbour joining NATO to be ruled out.

But even if Ukraine never joins NATO, Mr Johnson said it is up to the West to create a deterrent to ensure Russia does not invade again in the future.

'Our job is to do whatever we can to give them the tools to protect themselves,' he said in the interview. 'Over time, you can imagine that even if you can't have an Article five guarantee for Ukraine - I mean, full membership of NATO, [...] you can imagine that Western sympathisers of Ukraine will provide so much by way of equipment, training, intelligence as to create a kind of deterrence.

'What I'm talking about is so fortifying, so strengthening the quills of the Ukrainian porcupine as to make it in future indigestible to the Russian invaders,' he added.

However, speaking earlier today, Mr Johnson conceded it would be a challenge to give his Ukrainian counterpart the tanks he has demanded to help repel the Russian invasion of his country.

The Prime Minister also hit back at the Kremlin after it effectively labelled him enemy number one among western leaders, having earlier warned Russian President Vladimir Putin that he had already crossed a 'red line' in his 'barbaric' invasion.

Speaking to LBC ahead of today's NATO summit, Mr Johnson suggested that the UK could next target Putin's gold reserves, accused the Kremlin of 'war crimes' and said that the Russian despot should appear before the International Criminal Court.

Awkward! PM is briefly left looking for company at NATO summit group family photo Boris Johnson was briefly left looking for company before the NATO family photo this morning at the summit to discuss the alliance's response to Putin's invasion of Ukraine. The Prime Minister, who had earlier called for NATO to act 'harder' against Russia as he arrived in Brussels ahead of the meeting, appeared to be left standing alone with his hands in his pocket. A clip widely shared on social media seemed to show leaders, including Emmanuel Macron, greeting each other enthusiastically while ignoring Mr Johnson. Critics were quick to claim the PM had been snubbed by Mr Macron and described the situation as 'embarrassing'. However, a fuller version of the video shows the PM being embraced by Mr Macron before his brief moment alone. Boris Johnson was briefly pictured looking around for company ahead of today's Nato photo Advertisement

Earlier in the day, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted by the state-owned RIA news agency as saying Mr Johnson is 'the most active participant in the race to be anti-Russian'.

Speaking at the press conference in Brussels, the Prime Minister said: 'Absolutely not, least of all me. I think I'm probably the only Prime Minister in UK history to be called Boris, I think I have that distinction, and I'm not remotely anti-Russian.

'But I think what we all agree is that what Vladimir Putin is doing, the way he's leading Russia at the moment, is utterly catastrophic, that his invasion of Ukraine is inhuman and barbaric.

'And the conduct of that invasion is now moving into the type of behaviour that, as I said before, we haven't seen in the continent of Europe for 80 years, and it's horrific.

'So you can be sympathetic towards ordinary Russians, who are being so badly led, but you can be deeply hostile to the decisions of Vladimir Putin.'

Mr Johnson warned the Russian president that he would be hit with 'very, very severe' consequences if he used chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine as allies fear.

'You have to have a bit of ambiguity about your response but I think it would be catastrophic for him if he were to do that,' the Prime Minister said.

After the meeting, US President Joe Biden said the use of chemical weapons would be met with a 'response in kind' depending on the 'nature of the use'.

A western official said that the use of such weapons would mark a 'fundamental change' in the Ukrainian conflict but said it was 'highly unlikely' it would be met with Nato troops in Ukraine.

Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg announced an agreement to provide assistance in the cyber-security sphere and equipment to protect against biological, chemical and nuclear threats.

And leaders approved the deployment of new Nato battle groups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia to shore up the defence alliance's eastern flank.

'The single most important thing is for us to stay unified and the world continue to focus on what a brute this guy is and all the innocent people's lives that are being lost and ruined,' Biden told a news conference, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. 'We have to stay fully, totally, thoroughly united.'

The United States promised to supply the EU with 15 billion cubic metres more of liquefied natural gas this year than had been planned before, sources told Reuters, as the European bloc seeks to quickly curb its reliance on Russian fossil fuels.

However, support pledges by leaders from countries representing more than half of the world's GDP fell short of satisfying Ukraine's pleas for much more arms and tighter sanctions, including an embargo on Russian energy.

Russia supplies 40% of the EU's gas needs and more than a quarter of its oil imports. Those most dependent on this supply - in particular Germany - are reluctant to take a step that would have a major economic impact.

Mr Johnson urged a targeting of Mr Putin's gold reserves to prevent him trying to get around sanctions as he announced a fresh wave of travel bans and asset freezes.

Among those targeted were the Wagner Group, a Russian paramilitary organisation accused of plotting to assassinate Mr Zelensky.

The Foreign Office said a total of 1,000 fresh sanctions have been handed out since the invasion began, with 65 more announced after Mr Johnson arrived in Belgium.

They included Russian billionaire Eugene Shvidler and Galina Danilchenko, who was installed by Moscow as the mayor of occupied Melitopol in south-east Ukraine.

Banks, a diamond producer and Polina Kovaleva, the stepdaughter of Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, were also among the newly targeted.

Britain has already sent more than 4,000 anti-tank weapons to Ukraine, including next-generation light anti-tank weapons systems (Nlaws) and Javelin missiles.

It is also supplying and training Ukrainian troops in the use of Starstreak high-velocity anti-air missiles as well as providing body armour, helmets and combat boots.

The Government will provide an additional £4.1 million to the BBC World Service to counter disinformation in Russia and Ukraine as well as new support for the International Criminal Court (ICC).

The month-long land, sea and air assault has hit residential areas, schools and hospitals in Ukrainian cities including Kharkiv and the beseiged port of Mariupol on the Sea of Azov. Russia denies targeting civilians.

Britain on Thursday imposed sanctions on another wave of Russia's lenders including Gazprombank and Alfa Bank, as well as a woman London said was the stepdaughter of Sergei Lavrov, Putin's veteran foreign minister.

'People talk about new red lines for chemical or biological, tactical nuclear weapons or whatever,' Mr Johnson said on LBC radio ahead of the NATO summit.

'For me, the red line already has been crossed. He's bombing indiscriminately civilian centres, he's causing huge numbers of causalities in wholly innocent populations.

The prime minister continued: 'I think it is certainly true — as Joe Biden has said — that the Russian war machine is already guilty of war crimes, and it is right Russia should now be before the International Court of Justice.

'President Putin should appear before the International Criminal Court. There is no question is what they are doing are war crimes.'

He added: 'The harder our sanctions ... the more we can do to help Ukraine ... the faster this thing can be over.'

Johnson said that one option was to see if more can be done to prevent the Russian president from accessing his gold reserves, which could stop people buying Russian gold to convert it into hard currency.

The resolve to punish Moscow with massive sanctions was underlined by an emergency meeting of the G7 advanced economies, which brought Japan into the room with six NATO members, also in Brussels on Thursday.

NATO as a whole promised Kyiv new military support and assigned more troops to the alliance's eastern flank during a trio of summits on Thursday aimed at showing Western unity against Russia's war in Ukraine.

NATO leaders meeting in Brussels agreed to help Ukraine protect itself against any chemical, biological or nuclear attacks, and a U.S. official said Washington and allies were also working to provide Kyiv with anti-ship missiles.

'The single most important thing is for us to stay unified and the world continue to focus on what a brute this guy is and all the innocent people's lives that are being lost and ruined,' U.S. President Joe Biden told a news conference in Brussels, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

'We have to stay fully, totally, thoroughly united.'

However, the support pledges by leaders from countries that represent more than half of the world's GDP fell short of satisfying Ukraine's pleas for tighter sanctions, including an embargo on Russian energy.

Russia supplies 40% of the EU's collective gas needs and more than a quarter of its oil imports, and countries most dependent on this supply - in particular Germany - are reluctant to take a step that would have a major economic impact.

In a move that made Europe's dilemma worse, Putin said on Wednesday that 'unfriendly' countries must start paying in roubles for oil and gas, which would mean paying Russia hard currency to buy the roubles.

Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jansa told reporters that 'nobody will pay in roubles,' while European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen rejected what she called blackmail.

Ukraine is a former Soviet republic whose aspirations to join the EU and NATO drew Moscow's ire.

Russian forces attacked Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what Putin calls a 'special military operation' aimed at destroying Ukraine's military capabilities and 'denazifying' it.

The invasion has killed thousands and driven a quarter of Ukraine's 44 million people from their homes.

The bombardment has hit residential areas, schools and hospitals in Ukrainian cities including Kharkiv and the besieged port of Mariupol on the Sea of Azov.

However, NATO again turned down pleas by Kyiv to defend Ukraine's skies by imposing a no-fly zone and said it will not send troops to Ukraine for fear of being dragged into a full-on military confrontation with nuclear-armed Russia.

'Allies do what they can to support Ukraine with weapons so Ukraine can defend itself,' NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said when asked about Ukraine's demands for more help, adding that the level of support was already 'unprecedented.'

NATO leaders said in a joint statement that they were 'united and resolute in our determination to oppose Russia's aggression, aid the government and the people of Ukraine, and defend the security of all allies.'

French President Emmanuel Macron said that the world faced an 'unprecedented food crisis' that will be even worse in 12 to 18 months as Ukraine, a major grower of wheat, barley, corn and sunflower, will not be able to sow crops.

Western powers were ready to ramp up sanctions against Russia if necessary as they continue to isolate Moscow and force a ceasefire in Ukraine, Macron said.

The United States announced that it was targeting dozens of Russian defence companies and members of the ruling class with sanctions.

The 27-nation EU has rolled out four waves of sanctions against Moscow over the past month, but energy flows are the biggest loophole in measures that have otherwise largely frozen Russia out of world commerce.

EU leaders are expected, however, to agree at their summit to jointly buy gas and agree a deal with U.S. President Joe Biden to secure additional U.S. liquefied natural gas supplies.

NATO, which has already beefed up its eastern flanks to 40,000 troops spread from the Baltic to the Black Sea, agreed to set up new combat units in Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia.

The alliance also warned that China should 'abstain from supporting Russia's war effort in any way, and to refrain from any action that helps Russia circumvent sanctions.'

Biden said that China understood its economic future was more closely tied to the West than to Russia, after warning Beijing it could face consequences for aiding Moscow's war in Ukraine.

NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg has accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of making a “big mistake” by invading Ukraine, as NATO, G7 and EU leaders gathered in first emergency meetings to discuss overhauling the alliance’s eastern defences.

Described as historic and one of the most important talks to date, leaders from US President Joe Biden, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron are in Brussels for a one day trio of meetings as the war in Ukraine faces its fifth week.

“President Putin has made a big mistake and that is to launch a war against an independent sovereign nation. He has underestimated the strength of the Ukrainian people, the bravery of the Ukrainian people and their armed forces,” Stoltenberg said ahead of the summit.

Stoltenberg said the leaders alliance of the US-led military would “address the need for a reset of our deterrence and defense in the longer term”, starting with agreeing to four new deployments of battle groups to eastern members Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Bulgaria .

NATO has already rushed tens of thousands of troops to its eastern flank in the wake of Russia’s invasion to counter the threat of any spillover from the conflict into alliance countries.

NATO leaders are vowing to bolster weapons deliveries to non-member Ukraine and supply protection against chemical and nuclear threats from Russia.

The United States and its NATO allies are also discussing sending anti-ship missiles to Ukraine, a senior US official said, after Russian vessels attacked Kyiv’s Black Sea ports.

“We have started consulting with allies on providing anti-ship missiles to Ukraine,” the official told reporters as a NATO summit got under way in Brussels.

“There may be some technical challenges with making that happen, but that is something that we are consulting with allies and starting to work on.”

Britain slapped sanctions on 59 more Russian individuals and entities, as well as six Belarusian enterprises over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, targeting a shadowy mercenary firm and the world’s largest diamond producer.

“Vladimir Putin has already crossed the red line into barbarism,” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in Brussels.

“The harder our sanctions, the tougher our economic vice around the Putin regime, the more we can do to help the Ukrainians, I think the faster that this thing can be over,” he said.

The latest measures, against a range of key strategic industries and people, takes to more than 1,000 the number of Russian and Belarusian individuals and businesses sanctioned by London in recent weeks.

Britain also targeted six more banks, Russian Railways, the defense company Kronshtadt — the main producer of Russian drones — and diamond giant Alrosa, according to the foreign ministry.

Mr Johnson says Britain will send 6,000 missiles and £25 million ($33 million) in financial aid to Ukraine’s army to help it fight Russian forces.

It will also send provide an additional 6,000 missiles in addition to the 4,000 NLAW’s and Javelin missiles already supplied. Lethal defensive military aid, including Starstreak high-velocity anti-air missiles, will “help Ukrainians continue to defend themselves,” Mr Johnson said.

“Vladimir Putin is already failing in Ukraine.”

Germany says it is sending 2,000 additional anti-tank weapons to Ukraine to help it the Russian invasion, a parliamentary source told AFP, confirming media reports.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urged NATO to provide Kyiv with unrestricted military aid, one month into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

“To save people and our cities, Ukraine needs military assistance without restrictions. In the same way that Russia is using its full arsenal without restrictions against us,” he told NATO representatives via video-link.

While thanking members of the Western military alliance for the defensive equipment provided so far, he appealed for offensive weapons.

Zelensky also accused Russia of deploying phosphorus weapons, which spread a powder that ignites when in contact with oxygen and causes severe burns.

“This morning, by the way, phosphorus bombs were used. Russian phosphorus bombs. Adults were killed again and children were killed again,” Zelensky said.

“The Alliance can once more prevent the death of Ukrainians from Russian strikes, from Russian occupation, by giving us all the weapons we need.”

“We need to do more, therefore we need to invest more and therefore there is a new sense of urgency,” Stoltenberg said.

“We are determined to continue to impose costs on Russia to bring about the end of this brutal war,” NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said.

“We have a responsibility to ensure that this conflict does not escalate beyond Ukraine that will cause even more suffering, even more death, even more destruction.”

But the alliance has rebuffed pleas from Kyiv to impose a no-fly zone to halt Russia’s onslaught for fear of getting dragged into a “full-fledged” conflict with Moscow.

“We have a responsibility to ensure that this conflict does not escalate beyond Ukraine that will cause even more suffering, even more death, even more destruction,” Stoltenberg said.

US President Joe Biden warned chemical before heading to Europe of a “real threat” that the Kremlin could use weapons in Ukraine.

Stoltenberg told journalists that “any use of chemical weapons would fundamentally change the nature of the conflict.”

“It will be a blatant violation of international law, and it will have widespread and severe consequences.”",https://boringbuzz.com/major-war-developments-during-nato-talks/

The UK will be providing more anti-tank and high-explosive weapons, doubling the total amount of missiles provided to 10,000. But not all of the new weapons will be the next-generation light anti-tank weapons (NLAWs). The UK has already sent over 4,200 NLAWS to Ukraine and they are said to have been a gamechanger for Ukraine.

The shoulder-mounted missile systems are designed to blast tanks on the battlefield. £25million from Foreign Office funds will also be given to the Ukrainian military and police forces. This comes as NATO countries have agreed to boost Ukraine’s defence against chemical weapons. Putin sparked fears when Russia’s foreign ministry made claimed, with little supporting evidence, that the US is developing biological and chemical materials in Ukraine to produce weapons. Conservative MP Tobias Elwood, also a former Army captain, called this claim a ""despicable pretext that Russia may use to justify their own chemical or biological attack in Ukraine"".

Mr Johnson will send 6,000 extra missiles to Ukraine

The UK has sent more than 4000 next-generation light anti-tank weapons (NLAWs).

The Institute for Policy studies describes chemical weapons as ""inanimate poisonous substances that incapacitate, injure, or kill through their toxic effects on the skin, eyes, lungs, blood, nerves, or other organs"". NATO Secretary-General Jen Stoltenberg has said that protective suits and gas masks are likely to be provided to protect against these horrific attacks. Mr Stoltenberg said on Wednesday that he expects leaders to agree on this measure in Brussels today as they meet for an emergency summit. Mr Stoltenberg said: ""I expect allies will agree to provide additional support, including cyber-security assistance as well as equipment to help Ukraine protect against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats.” READ MORE: Putin bowel cancer speculation fuelled by ‘Moon face’ fears

Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a chemical weapons expert and fellow at Magdalene College, Cambridge, told Express.co.uk that a Russian attack using chemical weapons would be “highly likely” if Putin’s army starts to struggle He said: “Chemical weapons broke the four-year siege of Aleppo in 13 days of chlorine barrel bombs in December 16 and I think this had a profound effect on the Russians. “If you have no morals or scruples you would use chemical weapons all the time as they are morbidly brilliant for fighting in towns and cities.” And Mr Johnson has signalled that Putin’s army is indeed starting to struggle.

Mr Johnson continued: “The Ukrainian people have shown themselves to be extraordinarily brave and tenacious in defending their homeland, in the face of an unprovoked onslaught. “But we cannot and will not stand by while Russia grinds Ukraine’s towns and cities into dust. “The United Kingdom will work with our allies to step up military and economic support to Ukraine, strengthening their defences as they turn the tide in this fight.
