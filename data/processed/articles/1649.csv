BERLIN — Poland is prepared to continue accepting Ukrainian refugees for as long as needed, its deputy prime minister said, but stressed that the main priority for both his country and the rest of the Western alliance should be to help Ukraine defend itself.

“We have the capacity and we are still ready to accept more refugees,” Deputy Prime Minister Piotr Gliński, who oversees Poland’s efforts to take in Ukrainian refugees, told POLITICO in an interview.

Over the past month, Poland has taken in 2.3 million refugees, Gliński said, more than any other European country. The number of arrivals has recently fallen off, but Warsaw is preparing for future waves. Echoing Ukrainian concerns, however, Gliński signaled that it was imperative for the West not to conflate humanitarian aid with helping the country battle the Russians.

“This is a very sensitive problem from the point of view of Ukraine because they are still defending their independence,” Gliński said.

The US has committed to provide $2 billion in military aid to Ukraine and the EU has pledged to extend assistance totaling €1 billion.

Poland’s size and geographic position on NATO’s eastern flank have made it the alliance’s logistic and political hub since the war started, the main gateway to safety for those fleeing the conflict as well as the primary corridor for Western arms deliveries into Ukraine. Poland’s new status was on full view over the weekend when US President Joe Biden visited the country to confer with its leaders and deliver a major address.

The crisis has helped Gliński’s Law and Justice party, a staunchly conservative political movement that controls the government, divert attention from its long-running disputes with the EU over what Brussels says is a systemic assault on democratic norms in the country, including by subjecting the judiciary to political influence and discriminating against the LGBTQ+ community.

While those issues remain unresolved, the Ukraine crisis and growing alarm over the acute threat Russia poses to European security have inevitably shifted the conversation.

Poland’s willingness to take in so many refugees, something it refused to do for war refugees from Syria and Afghanistan arriving in Europe, has also impressed many EU capitals.

Gliński attributed the difference in approach to the fact that about 1.5 million Ukrainians were already living and working in Poland before the war, as well as to the deep cultural ties between the neighboring countries.

“There is also a visible change in the Ukrainian approach to our values ​​… they are trying to be more European,” he said. “This is the result of the war.”

In contrast, refugees from mainly Muslim countries in the Middle East and Africa are harder to integrate, he argued.

“They can be absorbed, but only in a slow evolutionary process,” he said.",https://windobi.com/poland-ready-to-take-more-ukrainians-deputy-pm-says-politico/

Despite 2.3 million refugees who moved to Poland in March, the country will continue to accept Ukrainians for as long as it takes.

Poland is the most popular country for emigration during the war in Ukraine. At the beginning of martial law, at the border, people waited several days to get to the country. The State Border Service reported that Warsaw and Krakow were overcrowded due to the large number of migrants. But Poland is ready to accept refugees for as long as it takes. This was stated by Vice Prime Minister Petr Glinsky in an interview with Politico.

Piotr Glinski noted that Poland received 2.3 million refugees over the past month. More refugees moved to them than to any European country during the war. In recent days, the number of new emigrants has decreased, but Poland is preparing for the next “wave”.

We have the capacity and we are still ready accept more refugees– said Peter Glinsky.

In an interview, Piotr Glinsky noted that the priority not only for Poland, but also for other Western countries, should be assistance to Ukraine during the war started by Russia.

Volunteers will not be able to provide refugees with employment, income, stability, education, and sense of belonging. That is the job of the state.

Polish society received praise for its actions, and rightly so. However, this one-of-a-kind mobilization was fit exactly for this moment: providing a first response to an unprecedented crisis at its doorstep. Traumatized Ukrainian refugees were given care and warmth, but volunteers will not be able to provide them something of much greater importance: employment, income, stability, education, and sense of belonging. This is the job of the state, an actor that usually steps in when citizens’ goodwill has run its course.

In Poland, this seemingly obvious process has not materialized. That’s mostly because the Polish state for years pretended that migration, a truly global phenomenon, was not its problem—and worse still, the politicians who continue to run the country demonized migrants and refugees, seeing them only as existential threats to the nation.

Current deputy prime minister and leader of the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, stated that refugees “will not abide by the Polish law.” Former interior minister Joachim Brudzinski depicted them as “young, horny bulls called ‘refugees,’” and Polish President Andrzej Duda feared they will carry a risk of “possible epidemics.” Thus, the largest burden of accommodating evacuees from Europe’s biggest war in decades has fallen on the one state on the continent arguably least prepared and least willing to bear it.

Even though sudden refugee crises are not infrequent, Poland does not have any institutional memory of managing them. In 2015, when the European Union saw itself unprepared to solve the easy-to-foresee problem of millions of Middle Eastern and African migrants trying to enter, Poland refused to take part in the refugee relocation process. Not only did it cause a rift with other member states, but it prevented the Polish authorities from learning a lesson—valuable then and priceless today.

Since then, most countries on the continent used those experiences to usher in at least partial reforms of migration policies. Poland could not, as it had no point of reference. As a result, the present administration has no institutional memory of handling sudden large volumes of refugee applications. It is not exactly the fault of the current, populist-nationalist government. After all, in the summer of 2015, Poland was still under the control of then-European Council President Donald Tusk’s center-right Civic Platform party, and welcoming them would have come at a relatively low cost.

Accepting even several thousand refugees from Syria and Iraq would have neither affected the ethnic composition of Poland’s population of almost 38 million people nor created a noticeable drag on the state budget. It would have, however, been an opportunity to modernize scarce and obsolete migration-related units of the administration and create much-needed new ones.

Poland lacks some of the most basic institutions that could help ease refugee pressure today, from a dedicated ministry to state-sponsored language courses for foreigners.

In this respect, Poland has not changed much since even its pre-democratic times. Prior to the 1989 transition, its autocratic institutions were mostly concerned with keeping those desperate to flee inside the country. Later, it never faced the challenge of accommodating migrants because Poland was a country people migrated from, not to.

In the first few years after Warsaw’s EU accession, some 2 million to 2.5 million Polish citizens migrated westward, mostly to the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Germany. Even the gradual arrival of the first Ukrainian migrants to Poland after Russia’s 2014 aggression in Crimea and the Donbass, amounting to 1.3 million people in 2020, as well as a tacit policy of granting visas to tens of thousands of Vietnamese and Indian workers did not prompt the government to change its overarching approach.

As a result, Poland lacks some of the most basic institutions that could help ease refugee pressure today, from a dedicated ministry or state secretary for migration (something that exists, for instance, in the Netherlands), to state-sponsored, universalized courses on the Polish language for foreigners (a crucial element of Sweden’s relatively successful integration policy). The latter is proving particularly significant as more and more Ukrainian refugees begin job hunting; anecdotal evidence points that their inability to speak Polish is the biggest obstacle for employers.

The institution dedicated to handling incoming migration to Poland is a legacy structure called the Office for Foreigners. It is almost exclusively concerned with their legal status in the country, ignoring the crucial issue of subsequent integration into society. Yet the legality of Ukrainian refugees has already been sorted out by means of simply a handful of governmental decrees.

They have been accepted over the border without any formal conditions and given access to health care, social security, the possibility of full-time employment, and enrollment in public education. As a result, the Office for Foreigners, an institution already clogged with migrants’ petitions from before the war, has been rendered obsolete in a matter of weeks.

What Poland needs is something else: a government agency working on the basis of a long-term plan. This institution would be able to determine whether migrants meet the legal requirements to reside in Poland but also be capable of placing them on the right path for integration into society. It would not only sort out their papers but offer language courses, indicate where the labor market is falling short of manpower and where to seek additional professional qualifications, and perhaps even sponsor training. In short, Poland is in dire need of a foreigners’ office capable of carrying out a comprehensive migration strategy.

In the absence of these institutions—and civil servants trained in migration issues—the PiS government has offloaded the burden on local governments. In a move straight out of its populist playbook, it delegated the responsibilities but did not provide relevant resources. Within the framework of the Polish state, it is local governments that run education and health care. As it happens, many of them are also strongholds of liberal opposition. PiS has been starving them out for years, burdening them with the costly consequences of chaotic educational and tax reforms as well as the COVID-19 pandemic. Warsaw alone had been expected to conclude 2022 with a $407 million deficit, 9 percent of its annual income. And that was before the city accepted more than 300,000 refugees in a little over three weeks.

Local governments are neither equipped nor designed to accommodate refugees on their own. Warsaw’s mayor, Rafal Trzaskowski, who in 2020 narrowly lost the presidential bid to Duda, warned last week that to conclude the operation of assigning social security numbers to evacuees in weeks rather than months, he would require 400 additional staff members. In the long run, forcing him and opposition mayors to shoulder most of the burden of accommodating refugees will lead them to squeeze their already tight budgets even more and make some difficult financial calls—a scenario PiS will undoubtedly benefit from politically.

For years, Poles were told to fear migrants while politicians learned that it pays to keep refugees away rather than let them in and integrate them.

The central government is trying to patch those shortcomings—it co-organized a registration center at Warsaw’s National Stadium, together with the local authorities—but such initiatives are scarce and temporary. A mirrored strategy has been applied in education, where the ministry immediately issued a decree increasing the maximum number of students in primary schools.

So far, 70,000 Ukrainian pupils have been accommodated in public educational institutions, just 10 percent of the total expected number. Finding places where they can study is one problem. Hiring teachers qualified to instruct them is another. According to the estimations by the Association of Polish Teachers, Poland’s largest educational sector trade union, at least 40,000 new bilingual teachers will be needed to provide instruction for refugee students. Of course, among the refugees, there will be teachers just as there are students. But triangulating them with where they reside and where they are needed is a job only a central government can do.

And there is, finally, the issue of politics. A massive inflow of Ukrainians was likely since at least the fall of last year. Intelligence reports confirmed that the Polish government was familiar with this possibility already in November 2021. There was time to prepare. But investing in administrative capacities to handle refugees and migrants would have come at an extremely high political cost.

For a government that has long prided itself on being the last frontier of European Christianity and a heroic defender of its nation’s traditional values from moral decay brought by outsiders, creating new institutions and programs for incoming migrants would sound like a contradiction at best.

After all, Kaczynski recently argued that refugees will “bring about the downfall of the Latin civilization.” When Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said in an interview with Germany’s Bild last November that “we must do everything to protect our borders from immigration at the Mediterranean and in the east,” it became clear that the only policy his government knew how to implement was one consistent with the nationalist-populist ideological outlook he represents.

PiS came to power in 2015 also because it skillfully weaponized the refugee crisis. Its leaders threatened voters with migrants carrying diseases and warned of a total destruction of the state, as it claimed had happened everywhere refugees were welcomed with open arms (especially Sweden). None of this was true, but it tapped into the right sentiment among voters. Poles were told to fear migrants while politicians learned that it pays to keep refugees away rather than let them in and integrate them.

Now, when millions of them—not so different ethnically and culturally—came knocking, Polish society rushed to open the door. The Polish state is still standing on the sidelines, naively hoping it won’t have to get involved. In the event of an economic recession and a chaotic integration process, it will proudly declare, “I told you so,” proving that it was right to warn against migration all along. If, miraculously, Polish citizens and nonprofits do not run out of resources and goodwill to help refugees, PiS will go on an international victory lap, claiming credit and demanding that the EU (another demonic enterprise, according to their own narrative) chip in.

One way or another, the Polish government, will benefit from the presence of fleeing Ukrainians. Sadly, the ones set to lose are the refugees themselves.",https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/03/29/poland-demonized-refugees-now-its-struggling-to-integrate-them/

Europe is currently experiencing the largest mass exodus since the end of the World War II. Since Russia began its attack, more than 3.7 million people have left Ukraine. No country has taken in as many refugees as Poland. So far, 2.2 million people have found safety there, 10 times as many as in Germany. Poland seemed poorly prepared when the war began. The nationalist conservative government has allowed almost no refugees into the country in recent years. Since the autumn, they have been violently pushing back the Iraqis and Syrians at the border to Belarus, with most of the Polish population supported that tough approach.

But now, in the space of a few weeks, an astonishing welcoming culture has developed. An entire country is rising to the challenge, with volunteers providing what the government isn’t. However, it is unclear how long this can be sustained.

The man helping to manage Europe’s new refugee crisis has moved his office into the back room of a train station building. Wojciech Bakun, the mayor of Przemyśl, is sitting at a small table and typing on his laptop. He has swapped his suit for an olive-green uniform. He says he’ll be speaking by phone with the prime minister in just a moment. As a member of a small right-wing populist party, Bakun previously hadn’t made the impression of being particularly pro-refugee. But now he’s helping where he can. The strollers and COVID masks are piling up behind him. Right now, he’s looking for translators and psychologists.

Przemyśl had 60,000 inhabitants at the start of the war, but now more than 50,000 refugees are arriving here on some days. ""I don’t have any other choice but to send the people onward as fast as possible,"" says Bakun. The government in Warsaw is coordinating special trains and providing a bit of money, he says, but ""that’s it."" The People Are Helping, not the Government Bakun can rely on an army of volunteers. They took control of the former shopping center where Yulia arrived. The helpers are registering the new arrivals, cooking soup and setting up cots. They split the refugees up into small groups with a shared destination who are then picked up by volunteers driving small private cars and minibuses.

Twenty-one-year-old Natalia is helping to ensure that this all functions smoothly. She also asks that her last name not be published. She had begun learning Russian shortly before the start of the war. ""I suspected that Putin would invade,"" she says. Natalia believes Poland is next on the list. She says she is prepared to fight if that happens. Until then, she says she’ll help the refugees. The feeling that Poland might be the next victim of Russian imperialism has transformed the country into something like a giant NGO. On Facebook, a ""Grandmothers for Ukraine"" group is mobilizing Polish retirees. Even President Andrzej Duda is taking refugees in at his official government mansions. But there are few state accommodations that can house them for longer than just a short time.

The large Ukrainian immigrant population in Poland has thus far managed to make up for this through their willingness to help. Before the Russian invasion, more than a million Ukrainians lived in Poland, and most of them have now taken in fellow compatriots. But more and more newcomers have neither friends nor relatives in the country. They are heading for the already overcrowded big cities. In Warsaw, 10,000 refugees are sleeping in huge halls on the grounds of the convention center, with cots tightly packed. They want to move on after a few days, but nobody knows where.

WARSAW – Central European nations are bracing for a renewed influx of refugees from Ukraine that could test their capacity to house, school and find work for the rising numbers of mainly women and children escaping the war.

While the flow of people across the EU’s eastern borders has ebbed, aid workers say recent Russian missile strikes on military targets in Lviv may spur more people to leave the city just 60 km (40 miles) from the border with NATO-member Poland.

“We are getting news from Lviv…that there is likely a very large number of buses that has gathered that could come our way either tomorrow or the day after,” said Regina Slonicka, a former journalist now volunteering at Warsaw train station. “So again we will have a great need for help.”

Since Russia invaded its neighbour on Feb. 24 the fighting has displaced more than 10 million people and forced nearly 4 million to flee Ukraine in Europe’s biggest refugee crisis since the end of World War Two, according to the U.N. refugee agency.

More than half of the refugees arriving in the European Union have come via Poland, home the to region’s largest Ukrainian community of around 1.5 million people before the war. Others have come through Romania, Slovakia and Hungary.

At a refugee reception in Warsaw, the EU Commissioner for Employment and Social Affairs Nicolas Schmit praised Poland for absorbing so many refugees and pledged more support to aid the country’s efforts.

“Solidarity should have a concrete dimension,” Schmit said. “It should be based on the commitment of the whole of Europe to support, including financial support. Europe will not leave Poland alone in the face of this challenge.”

EU interior ministers were meeting in Brussels on Monday to discuss coordination for settlement of refugees, including financial and other support for member states taking them in.

‘COULD GETWORSEAGAIN‘

Though Ukraine and Russia were preparing for their first face-to-face peace talks in more than two weeks on Monday, on the ground there was no sign of respite for civilians in besieged cities, especially the devastated port of Mariupol.

Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special military operation” to disarm and “denazify” its neighbour. Kyiv and the West consider this a pretext for an unprovoked invasion.

Poland, which shares a 500-km (310-mile) border with Ukraine, has integrated children into schools and set up a grassroots network to provide housing.

It has also allowed Ukrainians to register for government IDs and benefits.

“We are still at the ready with the knowledge that the situation could get a lot worse again,” said Krzysztof Strzalkowski, mayor of the Wola neighbourhood in Warsaw. “We aren’t getting rid of the empty spots at the hostels we set up to be at the ready in case the situation in Ukraine worsens.”

Many refugees have also settled in the Czech Republic, often joining friends and family living there before the war. Czechs have issued more than 236,000 visas since the start of the war, but officials say the actual number of refugees is higher.

The government is extending a state of emergency due to the influx of Ukrainian refugees, and has adopted a law giving the new arrivals access to health insurance, the labour market and additional assistance.

“We honestly say that we will need a state of emergency until the end of May, then we will see what to do next,” Prime Minister Petr Fiala told a television show over the weekend.

About half of those arriving are children, and nearly all the adults are women.

MEDIA

* Russia’s Novaya Gazeta newspaper announced it is shutting down until the end of Russia’s war in Ukraine because of warnings from government censors.

For the latest developments of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, all times EDT:

11:30 p.m.: On Tuesday, the U.S. State Department issued a travel advisory warning U.S. citizens that they could be singled out, harassed and detained by Russian authorities if they travel to the country. The State Department has previously issued a Level 4 travel advisory warning citizens not to travel to the country and to depart immediately if there. The State Department also warned of its limited ability to assist U.S. citizens and widespread problems in Russia including an inability to use credit cards, cash shortages and the arbitrary enforcement of local law.

9:49 p.m.: David Beasley, executive director of the U.N. World Food Program, warned the U.N. Security Council Tuesday that the war in Ukraine has created “a catastrophe on top of a catastrophe.” He said the conflict will have a global impact “beyond anything we’ve seen since World War II” because farmers from the country which was the breadbasket of the world are on the front lines fighting Russia and already high food prices are skyrocketing, according to The Associated Press.

He said his agency, which was feeding 125 million people around the world before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, said rising food, fuel and shipping costs were forcing his agency to begin cutting rations, AP reported. In war-torn Yemen, he said, 8 million people just had their food allotment cut to 50% “and now we’re looking at going to zero rations.”

8:45 p.m.:

""Ukrainians are not naive people. Ukrainians have already learned during these 34 days of invasion, and over the past eight years of the war in Donbas, that the only thing they can trust is a concrete result.""

-- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about Russia's claims to de-escalate in attacks on Kyiv.

7:35 p.m.: On Tuesday, several European Union countries expelled dozens of Russian diplomats, some for alleged spying, in what the Irish prime minister said was a coordinated move.

The expulsions come as relations between Russia and the West have plunged into a deep freeze following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, The Associated Press reported.

The Netherlands said it was expelling 17 Russians who it described as intelligence officers masquerading as diplomats. Belgium said it was ejecting 21 Russians. The Czech Republic gave one Russian diplomat 72 hours to leave the country. Ireland told four senior Russian officials to leave the country because of activities deemed not “in accordance with international standards of diplomatic behaviour.""

5:53 p.m.: VOA U.N. correspondent Margaret Besheer reported reaction from Ukraine U.N. Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya, who spoke about the Istanbul peace talks: “Today’s negotiations in Istanbul have demonstrated that Russia may be ready to make steps forward, although it is still a long way to a sustainable cease-fire and comprehensive de-escalation. The parties will continue consultations to prepare and agree on provisions of a treaty on the security guarantees for Ukraine, a mechanism of implementation of the cease-fire, withdrawal of forces and other armed formations, opening and safe functioning of humanitarian corridors on a permanent basis, as well as on the exchange of fallen soldiers and the release of prisoners of war and civilians. Signing of the treaty on the security guarantees for Ukraine will only be possible after the withdrawal of all Russian armed units to locations as on 23 February 2022. The negotiation process which is underway by no means removes the need to provide to Ukraine additional assistance with weapons and to implement new sanctions imposed on the Russian Federation for the act of aggression committed.""

5:17 p.m.: A gaping hole was ripped into the regional administration building in Ukraine’s southern port city of Mykolayiv on Tuesday. “They hit my office. Most people have got out alive. It’s a miracle,” said regional Governor Vitaliy Kim on his popular social media channel. Mykhaylo Shtekel with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reports.

4:23 p.m.: Poland’s government has decided to block imports of coal from Russia, and it will impose financial penalties on any private entities importing Russian coal into Poland, government spokesman Piotr Mueller said Tuesday. He added that Poland could no longer wait for a decision from the whole 27-nation European Union to embrace the policy, according to The Associated Press. While Poland produces much of its own coal, it also relies on imports. Russian coal makes up 13% of the fuel used each year, according to the Institute for Structural Research in Warsaw.



4:10 p.m.: The United States and its allies plan new sanctions on more sectors of Russia's economy that are critical to sustaining its invasion of Ukraine, including military supply chains, Deputy U.S. Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said on Tuesday. Adeyemo, speaking in London on a European trip to consult with allies on strengthening and enforcing sanctions to punish Russia, said the broadening of those efforts was aimed at undermining ""the Kremlin's ability to operate its war machine,"" Reuters reports.

3:52 p.m.: “Finding comedy in the Ukraine situation serves several functions,” says Chad Nackers, editor in chief of The Onion, an American satirical website. “It is a powerful tool for exposing the folly and absurdity and human cruelty as well as providing some release from a stressful state of affairs and an endless cycle of misery,” he told The Associated Press. “Laughter,” he says, “can fill the hole created by a sense of hopelessness.”

3:34 p.m.: Russian media regulator Roskomnadzor has demanded the creators of a popular cartoon show remove the last episode posted on the Internet because it deals with Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Roskomnadzor said on Tuesday that the episode of the series Masyanya ""contains false information of social importance about the ongoing military operation to defend the Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics.""

Officials familiar with the intelligence picture said Tuesday that Moscow is reinforcing troops in the eastern Donbas region. Moscow has said gaining control of the Donbas is now its main military goal in Ukraine. The British government also expressed skepticism about Russia’s claims to be scaling back and its commitment to ending the war through talks. “We will judge (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and his regime by his actions, not by his words,” said Max Blain, spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

11:56 a.m.: The International Committee of the Red Cross reports a misinformation and disinformation campaign is being waged on social media to discredit its humanitarian work in Ukraine. For example, one claim that has no basis in truth, a spokesman said, is the agency’s alleged role in forced evacuations. “The ICRC has not been involved with any forced evacuation, forced transfers of civilians into Russia from Mariupol or any other Ukrainian city…The ICRC does not want to open an office in southern Russia to filter Ukrainians as many reports are alleging. So, that is absolutely false.,” said the spokesman for the ICRC. VOA’s Lisa Schlein has more.

Medinsky said Russia had made a second major de-escalatory step by agreeing to a possible meeting of the two countries’ presidents at the same moment that a peace agreement was initialed. “However, to prepare such an agreement on a mutually acceptable basis, we still have a long way to go,” he said.

Russia's military took control of waterways when it invaded Ukraine. Since then at least 100 foreign flagged ships with over 1,000 seafarers have been stuck inside Ukrainian ports with food supplies running low, shipping officials say. UN shipping agency the International Maritime Organization (IMO) said this month it would seek to create a safe maritime corridor to enable merchant ships and their crews to sail out of the Black Sea and Sea of Azov without the risk of being hit. ""The IMO Secretariat is working with both Ukraine and the Russian Federation to try and assist the safe departure of the ships and their crew,"" an IMO spokesperson said.

8:32 a.m.: Moved by footage of a father bidding a tearful farewell to his family, London taxi driver Matt Westfall felt compelled to do something to help those fleeing the conflict in Ukraine. ""I was watching the TV one night and I see a man in his mid-30s with his wife and child, and all three of them were sobbing. It really did grab my attention ... it quite upset me,"" Westfall, 52, told Reuters. ""I thought 'what can I do about it'?""

Westfall contacted one of his friends and they got together a group of fellow ""black cab"" drivers with the aim of ferrying escaping Ukrainians to where they needed to go. They also raised about 10,000 pounds for aid as donations flooded in from various taxi organizations and on the crowd funding service GoFundMe.

7:51 a.m.: The International Committee of the Red Cross exhorted Ukraine and Russia on Tuesday to agree on safe evacuation of civilians from the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol and other frontline areas, where vital supplies are running out. Asked about Ukrainian accusations of forced deportations of Mariupol residents to Russia, ICRC director-general Robert Mardini told Reuters his agency had no direct information and would not participate in such actions, as it violated the rules of war. ""People are caught and trapped in the line of fire. And it is happening unfortunately in many places today in Ukraine, not only in Mariupol,"" Mardini said at ICRC headquarters in Geneva.



7:33 a.m.: Ukraine’s State Emergency Service said at least 7 people were killed in a Russian attack on the town of Mykolaiv Tuesday, The Kyiv Independent reported.

7:08 a.m. : The U.N. nuclear watchdog’s director-general arrived in Ukraine on Tuesday for talks with senior government officials on delivering “urgent technical assistance” to ensure the safety of the country’s nuclear facilities, The Associated Press reported. The International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement that Rafael Mariano Grossi’s aim is “to initiate prompt safety and security support” for Ukraine’s nuclear sites. That will include sending IAEA experts to “prioritized facilities,” which it didn’t identify, and sending “vital safety and security supplies” including monitoring and emergency equipment. The IAEA chief has been pressing for weeks for an agreement with Ukraine and Russia on the safety of Ukrainian nuclear power plants.

7:00 a.m.: Billionaire Roman Abramovich is not an official member of the Russian team negotiating with Ukraine, but is present at the talks in Turkey to ""enable certain contacts"" between the two sides, the Kremlin said on Tuesday. Abramovich, who is sanctioned by the West over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine due to his ties with President Vladimir Putin, was present on Tuesday at the first direct peace talks in more than two weeks in Istanbul, Reuters reported.

6:41 a.m.: A new round of peace talks aimed at ending Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began Tuesday in Turkey as Ukrainian soldiers appear to have retaken more towns from Russian ground forces whose advances have stalled amid fierce opposition by Ukrainian fighters.

Addressing negotiators from Russia and Ukraine before the start of talks in Istanbul, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in a televised speech, it was up to both sides to reach a concrete agreement and “stop this tragedy.”

The Russian negotiating team included billionaire Roman Abramovich, who suffered symptoms of suspected poisoning, along with at least two senior members of the Ukrainian team, after a meeting in Kyiv earlier this month.

Speaking about the peace talks, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on national television Monday that “the minimum program will be humanitarian questions, and the maximum program is reaching an agreement on a cease-fire.”

During an interview Sunday in a call with Russian journalists, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukraine was open to adopting neutral status as part of a peace deal if it came with third-party guarantees and was put to a referendum

6:30 a.m.: Hours before the negotiations began, President Zelenskyy insisted that sanctions imposed by Western nations against Moscow need to be “effective and substantial” in order for them to have the intended effect on Russia’s economy.

Zelenskyy said if Russia manages to “circumvent” the sanctions, “it creates a dangerous illusion for the Russian leadership that they can continue to afford what they are doing now. And Ukrainians pay for it with their lives. Thousands of lives,” The New York Times reported.

5:45 a.m.: The International Committee of the Red Cross called on Ukraine and Russia Tuesday to reach a clear agreement for the safe evacuation of civilians from the besieged southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol and other places as vital supplies run out.

Robert Mardini, ICRC director-general, told Reuters that the neutral aid agency would not participate in any forced evacuations of civilians from Ukraine and it had no first-hand information that this is happening. He also said there was a “disinformation campaign” against the ICRC on social media.

“Our concern is that the very intensity of the fighting is putting civilians in harm’s way, the fact that in places like Mariupol civilians are not able to leave in safe conditions, there were no concrete agreements by parties to the conflict for safe evacuation of civilians, nor has there been a green light to get humanitarian aid in,” Mardini said.

Ukraine and Russia must allow the ICRC to visit captured prisoners of war, in line with the Geneva Conventions, and return the remains of people killed in the conflict, he said in an interview with Reuters at ICRC headquarters in Geneva.

5:30 a.m.: U.S. President Joe Biden’s whirlwind diplomatic tour of Europe might be most remembered by his words about Russian President Vladimir Putin: “This man cannot remain in power.” Two days after his utterance, Biden clarified that although he won’t back down from the sentiment, the U.S. did not plan to take Putin out of office. VOA’s Anita Powell reports, from the White House, on what this means as this Ukraine conflict enters a second month.

4:30 a.m.: The U.N. nuclear watchdog says its director-general has arrived in Ukraine for talks with senior government officials on delivering “urgent technical assistance” to ensure the safety of the country’s nuclear facilities, The Associated Press reported.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said Tuesday that Rafael Mariano Grossi’s aim is to “to initiate prompt safety and security support” for Ukraine’s nuclear sites. That will include sending IAEA experts to “prioritized facilities” and sending “vital safety and security supplies” including monitoring and emergency equipment.

3:30 a.m.: Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan called for an immediate cease-fire Tuesday and that the onus is on both sides in “stopping this tragedy.” Erdogan made the remark in a televised speech, ahead of talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators, Reuters reported.

3:00: a.m.: Another round of talks aimed at stopping the war in Ukraine is scheduled for Tuesday as the fighting looks increasingly like a stalemate on the ground, with the two sides trading control of a town in the east and a suburb of the capital, The Associated Press reported.

Ahead of the talks, to be held in Istanbul, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country is prepared to declare its neutrality, as Moscow has demanded, and is open to compromise on the fate of the Donbas, the contested region in the country’s east.

The Ukrainian delegation has checked in the Shangri-La Bosphorus while the Russian delegation has settled in the Ciragan Palace Kempinski hotel, both very close to each other in the Besiktas district.

2:30 a.m.: Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba urged in a Twitter post Tuesday “upon states around the world” for the criminalization of “the use of the ‘Z’ symbol as a way to publicly support Russia’s war.”

The letter Z has been used as a marking on Russian military vehicles taking part in the conflict and has been adopted by Russians supporting the war, with it being prominent on flags and at pro-Kremlin rallies, Reuters reported.

2:00 a.m.: The U.K.’s ministry of defense said Tuesday that Ukraine’s forces continued to conduct localized counterattacks in northwest of Kyiv, including Irpen, Bucha and Hostomel. The report confirms an earlier update released by the Ukrainian armed forces. Russian forces have been pushed back from a number of positions as a result, the report said. However, the daily intelligence report cautioned saying Russia continues to pose a threat to the city due to airstrikes. Russia has heavily bombarded Ukranian cities since the invasion started last month.

1:30 a.m.: In an operational report, Ukraine’s military said it had repelled seven Russian attacks on Monday. The Ukrainian report says its forces destroyed 12 Russian tanks and 10 combat vehicles and its air force hit 17 targets, according to a summary provided to U.K.’s newspaper The Guardian. The claims could not be confirmed.

The Ukrainian military said the country continues to be hit by Russian missile-bomb strikes and civilians are being “shot, kidnapped and held hostage,” in occupied areas.

1:05 a.m.: Russian and Ukrainian representatives arrived in Istanbul on Monday for another round of peace talks. The Russian delegation arrived at 4 p.m. local time while the Ukrainian delegation landed at 10 p.m. local time. Talks are set to begin on Tuesday at 10:30 a.m. local time and last for two days. The talks will take place at the office of the Turkish president known as the Dolmabahçe Palace.

Previous negotiations held in Belarus did not yield a breakthrough or a cessation of hostilities.

12:00 a.m.: Delegation members attending peace talks between Ukraine and Russia suffered symptoms of suspected poisoning after a meeting in Kyiv earlier this month, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. VOA has this story.

7,b1940f84-555d-44d4-8c54-eb721ff58227,[],2022-03-30 12:53:00-04:00,"Seeing images of the destruction in Ukraine reminds Paul Doyle of the damage inflicted on civilians during the Second World War. Witnessing Russia’s ongoing attack on Ukraine has inspired him to give back by offering to open his own home to some of the nearly four million refugees who have fled Ukraine.

Doyle and his wife, Maureen, who are both retired and live in Maple Ridge, B.C., are willing to open their home to a family for as long as it’s needed, he said, offering a spare bedroom with two bunk beds big enough for three children and two adults.

“We've got a decent-sized house on property, we’ve got our own playground in the backyard for kids if there's younger kids,” Doyle told CTVNews.ca in a phone interview on March 24. “We’re just going to do whatever we can to make them as comfortable as possible.”

Trying to connect with a family in need, Doyle has reached out to the Ridge Meadows Ukrainian Welcoming Committee. About a week after emailing the welcoming committee and having been assigned a co-ordinator, Doyle met with the organization virtually on March 27.

While Doyle anticipates he will be connected with a family soon, the Ridge Meadows Ukrainian Welcoming Committee is still waiting for direction on helping refugees locate a place to stay and get settled in.

“We're looking to the federal government, in this case, for guidance,” the welcoming committee’s marketing and liaison leader Ahmed Yousef told CTVNews.ca in a phone interview on March 28. “They are the ones who are mandated to handle our immigration policies and they are the ones that will be bringing people in under their program.”

The federal government is aware that provinces, territories, and community-based organizations are working to provide settlement services to Ukrainian refugees fleeing the conflict after they arrive in Canada, said the department of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).

“We remain in discussions with partners, including provinces and territories, the business community, the Ukrainian-Canadian community, and settlement organizations, on how best to support those arriving from Ukraine,” Peter Liang, communications adviser for the IRCC, wrote in a statement to CTVNews.ca on March 24. “We will continue to monitor the needs of the Ukrainian community closely and will take action as required.”

However, the national executive director of the Ukrainian Canadian Congress, Ihor Michalchyshyn, told The Canadian Press he is not aware of any registry that has been created to connect Ukrainian refugees with sponsors or community support after they land in Canada, raising concerns around a lack of plans to track these refugees.

Other Canadians moved by the events unfolding in Ukraine have been motivated to help too, by welcoming displaced Ukrainians into their own homes. But they are also finding it difficult. Dave Olivier, a 61-year-old based in Edmonton, said he and his family are also looking to support Ukrainian refugees by offering their home as a place to stay. Olivier said he emailed the Ukrainian Canadian Congress in Alberta a couple of weeks ago in search of ways to help, but hadn’t yet heard back.

Part of the problem is a lack of transparency around the possibility of providing aid, Olivier said. Though he understands the process is likely to take some time, there should be a greater focus on increasing communication from the top down so that humanitarian aid efforts can be coordinated on a local level, he added.

“People don't know how to do the right thing because the information isn't there,” Olivier said. “If we're going to take a refugee or if the possibility exists that we can, I’d like to start to get ready for it.”

ASSISTANCE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

The Canadian government announced the ‘Canada-Ukraine Authorization for Emergency Travel’ (CUAET) program on March 17. The program is designed to create a pathway for temporary residence within Canada and involves streamlining current visa and travel requirements, removing most fees, and providing expedited processing.

With the CUAET, Ukrainians and their family members can stay in Canada as temporary residents for three years. Those who arrive through this stream will also be eligible for an open work permit allowing employment with almost any employer in Canada for up to three years. The federal government is urging Canadian employers to register job offers with Job Bank’s Jobs for Ukraine webpage in order to hire displaced Ukrainians.

The federal government is also looking at providing economic support to Canadians who are willing to open their homes to displaced Ukrainians, according to Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Sean Fraser. The incentive could look similar to one in the United Kingdom, where households hosting Ukrainian refugees can get monthly payments.

Fraser also tweeted that the federal government’s settlement program will provide other “key services,” such as language training. Assistance will also be available at some airports receiving Ukrainian refugees in the near future, including providing arrival information in their language.

According to the IRCC, the Canadian government had received nearly 60,000 applications as of March 26. The minister had previously stated there will be no limit on the number of applications that will be accepted.

The government of Canada has said that the best ways to support those affected by a disaster abroad are to donate money to humanitarian organizations and reach out to organizations arranging community or fundraising events to provide support. People can also look to their province of residence for additional guidance on how to help Ukrainian refugees arriving in Canada.

HOW CANADIANS CAN HELP

According to British Columbia’s Ministry of Municipal Affairs, the department is collaborating with both the federal government and community partners to help Ukrainians get settled in Canada, including assisting them to secure housing. Those looking for more information on how to help are encouraged to reach out to the Ukrainian Canadian Congress’ British Columbia chapter, senior public affairs officer Alanah Connie said in a statement to CTVNews.ca on March 29.

In Alberta, organizations such as Catholic Social Services, the Ukrainian Canadian Congress, and Canada Ukraine Foundation are all working to arrange housing for Ukrainian refugees, said Roy Dallmann, press secretary to Alberta’s Minister of Labour and Immigration Kaycee Madu, in a statement to CTVNews.ca on March 29. Residents interested in opening their homes to displaced Ukrainians are encouraged to reach out to these organizations, he said. The provincial government has also created a website to help Ukrainians arriving in Canada obtain access to health care, education and jobs.

The government of Ontario is also offering support to connect Ukrainians with settlement services in the province, including those assisting with accommodation, said Harry Godfrey, senior manager of communications and media relations for Ontario’s Ministry of Labour, in a statement to CTVNews.ca on March 29. Updates on these initiatives will be delivered in the near future and can also be found on the government’s website.

Additionally, the government of Saskatchewan is “working with the Ukrainian Canadian Congress of Saskatchewan (UCC) to provide a central point of contact and co-ordination to help anyone arriving to the province from Ukraine to connect with the information, services and supports they need,” its website reads. Residents are encouraged to check back soon for more information on how to help. In the meantime, the government has provided resources for Canadians looking to make donations or offer employment, as well as other supports and services for Ukrainians fleeing the conflict.

The government of Manitoba is working with its own chapter of the Ukrainian Canadian Congress, as well as other organizations and businesses, to support those impacted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Residents are encouraged to sign up for digital updates in order to stay informed of opportunities to help. Newfoundland and Labrador has made a number of resources available for Ukrainian newcomers, and province-based non-profit organizations, including the Association for New Canadians, are actively looking for volunteers to assist with translation and community integration. Those in Quebec are encouraged to contact the province’s chapter of the Ukrainian Canadian Congress for opportunities to contribute to aid efforts.

The governments of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island are encouraging Canadians who wish to donate to visit the Canadian Red Cross’ website or do so through the National Bank of Ukraine. Providing donations and housing are just some of the many ways Canadians can effectively support those impacted by the crisis in Ukraine.

A GRASSROOTS APPROACH

Soon after the current crisis in Ukraine began to unfold, the Ridge Meadows Ukrainian Welcoming Committee put out calls for help in building a reservoir of aid for Ukrainian refugees in need, said Yousef. This includes job offers, donations, financial assistance in the form of airfare coverage, and accommodation. In the past three weeks, the organization has enlisted 200 local volunteers, said Richard Robinson, co-chair of the committee.

The organization continues to try to understand the legalities around those fleeing the crisis and arriving to Canada, Yousef said. While they may be refugees, their status upon arriving to Canada under the federal government’s program considers them visitors, he said. This therefore does not entitle them to some of the protection, funding and support usually offered to refugees.

“That's the gap, if you will, that we're trying to figure out with the government, and posing those questions to them as to how we can not only expedite the process, but have a correct and stable process to bring those that are in need [to Canada],” said Yousef.

The welcoming committee is also hoping for more collaboration between different levels of government and grassroots organizations such as itself on these types of issues in the future, Yousef said. Even something as simple as a page on the federal government’s website linking to similar organizations as a resource would be a good starting point, he said.

The organization's next step involves preparing volunteers for tasks once visitors start to arrive, said Robinson. According to the federal government, Canada could see thousands of Ukrainians touching Canadian soil over the next several weeks.

After more than four weeks of conflict, Russia has failed to seize any major Ukrainian city and signalled on Friday it was scaling back its ambitions to focus on securing the Donbas region, where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting the Ukrainian army for the past eight years.

Russia is trying to split Ukraine in two to create a Moscow-controlled region after failing to take over the whole country, the head of Ukrainian military intelligence said.

The Russian-backed eastern Ukrainian rebel region of Luhansk said it may hold a referendum on joining Russia, drawing a warning from Kyiv that any such vote would have no legal basis and trigger a strong international response.

Russia continued its ""full-scale armed aggression"", while Ukrainian forces had repulsed seven attacks in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, the General Staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said.

Ukraine's deputy prime minister said Russian forces were ""militarizing"" an exclusion zone around the occupied Chernobyl power station.

The next round of face to face talks between Ukraine and Russia will take place in Turkey on March 28-30, a Ukrainian negotiator said on social media.

Top American officials said the United States does not have a policy of regime change in Russia, ramping up efforts to clarify President Biden's statement that President Putin ""cannot remain in power"".

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

How you can help: Here are ways those in the U.S. can help support the Ukrainian people as well as what people around the world have been donating.
