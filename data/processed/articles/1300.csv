President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia has been beaten back by the 'powerful blows' of Ukrainian forces, with 16,000 of Putin's troops killed as the war entered its fifth week.

Zelensky's troops are preparing to take back the city of Kherson today, which was the first major city the invading forces took control of.

An adviser to the Ukrainian defence minister said he thought the city would be won back today.

Markian Lubkivskyi told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I believe that today the city will be fully under the control of Ukrainian armed forces.

'We have finished in the last two days the operation in the Kyiv region so other armed forces are now focused on the southern part trying to get free Kherson and some other Ukrainian cities.'

Zelensky also welcomed a delivery of 1,500 German anti-aircraft missiles, while alleged war criminal Putin was said to be scaling back his invasion aims to 'liberating' Ukraine's eastern Donbas region as he continued to shell civilians.

He made a surprise video appearance at Qatar's Doha Forum today, where he criticised Russia's war and called on the United Nations and world powers for more help.

Putin may have dialled back his war aims to focus on eastern Ukraine after failing to break the nation's resistance in a month of fighting and attacks on civilians that included up to 300 feared killed after Russia bombed a theatre.

However, Ukraine said Russia's suggestion it is retreating from Kyiv to focus on Donbas did not seem to be true.

Colonel Oleksandr Motuzyanyk, spokesman for the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine, said today: 'Take into account there is a huge amount of misinformation coming from the Russian Federation. We cannot trust them.'

He added: 'At the moment we don't see any withdrawal of Russian troops. We can't reduce the defence capacity of Kyiv.'

It came as a Western official reported that a seventh Russian general, Lieutenant General Yakov Rezanstev, had died in Ukraine and that a colonel had been 'deliberately' killed by his own demoralised men.

US President Joe Biden met in Poland with two Ukrainian ministers on Saturday in the first face-to-face meeting between the US president and top Kyiv officials since Russia's invasion began.

In an address last night Zelensky said: 'Over the past week, our heroic Armed Forces have dealt powerful blows to the enemy. Significant losses.'

'I am grateful to our defenders who showed the occupiers that the sea will not be calm for them even when there is no storm. Because there will be fire.

'By restraining Russia's actions, our defenders are leading the Russian leadership to a simple and logical idea: talk is necessary. Meaningful. Urgent. Fair. For the sake of the result, not for the sake of the delay.'

Zelensky said the devastation of Mariupol was getting worse, with tens of thousands trapped in the southeastern city without water, food or heating.

He said: 'The situation in the city remains tragic. Absolutely tragic. The Russian military does not allow any humanitarian aid into the city.'

The Kremlin has disputed that 16,000 Russian troops have been killed, claiming the figure is just 1,351.

Russia said it destroyed an ammunitions and weapons storage site with Kalibr cruise missiles on March 25 and in the same day had hit fuel depots and Ukrainian strongholds in a huge operation across the country.

Major General Igor Konashenkov claimed Russia had destroyed 1,618 Ukrainian tanks and 1,453 special military vehicles during the operation.

Ukraine's General Staff of the Armed Forces said its troops were continuing to fend off Russian attacks on Kyiv.

It said Russia has had trouble replacing its fighters after a series of hard-fought battles and that the Kremlin's equipment was in 'poor technical condition' because of 'negligent prior exploitation and prolonged storage'.

It said this meant Russia's capability in Ukraine was severely hindered. Other cities across Ukraine are holding against ongoing Russian attacks.

Chernihiv, which is north of Kyiv, is surrounded by Russian troops. The city's mayor, Vladyslav Atroshenko, said on Saturday the 'whole city is destroyed completely'.

He said: 'For us it's easier for us to count which buildings have not been damaged.

'Residential buildings, schools, hospitals, children's libraries have been bombed.

'There have been mass killings by mines or artillery that has hit a line of innocent civilians who are waiting in line to buy bread, to buy some food. What sort of military structure is that? It's just a food shop.'

He said he was collecting people's testimonies of the bombings to use against Russia in international courts.

'Russia has been consciously committing crimes,' he said. 'The Russians have been consciously shelling on peaceful civilians for several weeks. They have been killing peaceful citizens.'

He added Western countries that continued to buy Russian energy 'sponsor our shelling, they sponsor the killing of our population'.

Joe Biden met in Warsaw with Ukrainian ministers Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov this morning.

It was a possible sign of growing confidence in the fightback against Russian forces.

The officials discussed 'the United States' unwavering commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity,' State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters.

Blinken and Austin 'pledged continued support to meet Ukraine's humanitarian, security, and economic needs,' he added.

Biden last met Kuleba in Washington on February 22, two days before Russia began its assault. Since then, Kuleba has also met with Blinken in Poland next to the border with Ukraine on March 5.

The US President is on the second and final day of a visit to Poland after he met with EU and NATO leaders in Brussels earlier in the week.

After the meeting he said: 'We discussed our efforts to rally the world in support of Ukraine and the significant military and humanitarian assistance the United States is providing.'

He then visited Ukrainian refugees in Warsaw with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki. Biden said: 'You don’t need to speak the same language to feel the roller-coaster of emotions in their eyes.'

On Friday, the US president spoke to US soldiers stationed in Poland near the Ukrainian border and aid workers helping refugees fleeing the conflict.

He praised Ukrainians for showing 'backbone' against the Russian invasion and referred to Russian President Vladimir Putin as 'a man who, quite frankly, I think is a war criminal'.

'And I think we'll meet the legal definition of that as well,' he said.

Zelensky compared Russia's destruction of the port city of Mariupol to the Syrian and Russian destruction wrought on the city of Aleppo in the Syrian war.

He said: 'They are destroying our ports. The absence of exports from Ukraine will deal a blow to countries worldwide.'

He added: 'The future of Europe rests with your efforts.'

He called on countries to increase their exports of energy - something particularly important as Qatar is a world leader in the export of natural gas.

He criticised Russia for what he described as threatening the world with its nuclear weapons.

Although the number of Ukrainians fleeing their war-torn homeland and crossing into Poland jas fallen in recent days, the total number of people that have left is close to three million.

The number of people fleeing Ukraine for Poland has started to fall in recent days, with 30,500 crossing on Friday, down 6.4 per cent from the previous day.

The Polish Border Guard said only 30,500 people had made the border crossing on Friday. A 6.4 per cent decrease on the previous day.

By 6am on Saturday just 6,100 people had made the crossing, a figure down 11 per cent for the same time frame on Friday.

The UN said 3.7 million people have fled Ukraine as refugees of the war, which accounts for 8.5 per cent of the population.

'Russia is deliberating bragging they can destroy with nuclear weapons, not only a certain country but the entire planet,' Zelensky told Qatar's Doha Forum today.

UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss also said today that Britain will give £2million of food supplies to areas of Ukraine encircled by Russian forces in Putin's 'barbaric invasion'.

The announcement followed a direct request from the government of Ukraine.

Warehouses in Poland and Slovakia are being readied to supply goods to Ukraine from early next week.

Around 25 truckloads will be delivered by road and rail to the Ukrainian communities in greatest need.

It is estimated over 12 million people are currently in need of humanitarian assistance across Ukraine, with the actual figure likely to be much higher, the government said.

Foreign Secretary Truss said: 'This vital donation of food and supplies will help support the Ukrainian people in the face of Russia's barbaric invasion.

'Our teams are working day and night with our Polish and Slovakian friends and the government of Ukraine to ensure those at most risk get the essential supplies they so badly need.'

President Zelensky said more than 37,000 people had been evacuated from encircled cities after 18 humanitarian corridors were created this week.

A possible Russian backtrack came ahead of a planned meeting by US President Joe Biden with Ukrainian refugees in Poland and talks with his Polish counterpart Andrzej Duda in Warsaw before he gives a speech on the 'brutal war', the White House said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered the February invasion to destroy Ukraine's military and topple pro-Western President Volodymyr Zelensky, bringing the country under Russia's sway.

But Sergei Rudskoi, a senior general, suggested a considerably reduced 'main goal' of controlling Donbas, an eastern region already partly held by Russian proxies.

His surprise statement came as a Western official reported that a seventh Russian general, Lieutenant General Yakov Rezanstev, had died in Ukraine and that a colonel had been 'deliberately' killed by his own demoralised men.

Complicating Moscow's challenges, invasion troops were facing a counteroffensive in Kherson, the only major Ukrainian city under Russian control.

Visiting Rzeszow, about 80 kilometres (50 miles) from Ukraine, Biden praised Ukraine's 'incredible' resistance, comparing the conflict to a bigger version of communist China's 1989 crushing of protests in Tiananmen Square.

Biden told soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division that the struggle in eastern Europe represents a historic 'inflection point'.

'Are democracies going to prevail... or are autocracies going to prevail? And that's really what's at stake,' Biden said.

The US leader was briefed on the humanitarian situation, with more than 3.7 million refugees fleeing Ukraine, most of them into Poland.

Earlier, he ended a trip to Brussels for meetings with Western allies by announcing new measures to help the European Union shed dependence on imported Russian energy.

The plan is part of a sea change in the West, which for years has shrunk from direct confrontation with the Kremlin, but now seeks to make Putin a pariah.

EXCLUSIVE: 'I will kill to protect my city, my family, my country': Young Ukrainian mothers tell how they have joined up and taken up arms to defend Odesa from Putin's forces

BY NICK FAGGE IN ODESA, UKRAINE, FOR MAILONLINE

Two Ukrainian mothers of young children have told how they will kill and be killed to protect their beloved city of Odesa from Russian invaders.

Before the war Olena Lolesnyk and Kamila Suleymanova held down normal jobs and spent their free time taking their sons to the many beaches and parks of this picturesque resort town, known as the 'Pearl of the Black Sea'.

But after Russian warships threatened to mount a seaborne assault of ancient port, these fiercely protective women took up arms to defend Ukraine.

Now Olena, 30, and Kamila, 33, are part of a unit of Ukraine's 3014 Army that is the final line of defence for Odesa – a long-held prize of the Kremlin.

Mothers Olena Lolesnyk, 30, (left) and Kamila Suleymanova, 33, have taken up arms to defend Ukraine

The pair attended a military ceremony to honour Ukraine's National Guard in Odesa, southern Ukraine

'I am prepared to kill to protect my city, my family, my country,' blonde-haired Olena told MailOnline, after she collected a bravery award from the city mayor.

'I try not to think about whether I might die, but I am prepared to give my life to protect everything I love.'

Kamila added: 'My mother does not know that I have joined the army.

'But we have to defend our land. It is for our children.'

The pair were speaking after they attended a military ceremony to honour Ukraine's National Guard.

Dressed in khaki-green uniforms, body armour, tin hats, and carrying Kalashnikov assault rifles, they stood shoulder to shoulder with their male comrades, as a military band played the Last Post.

The parade was held next to a famous statue of Russian Tsarina Catherine the Great, who founded the city in 1794.

But now this symbol of the Russian Empire is covered in sand-bags and surrounded by Ukrainian military hardware to protect it from the Kremlin warships that threaten to reduce the historic port to rubble.

Tank traps, barbed-wire and machine gun emplacement now litter the tree-lined boulevards and pedestrian walkways throughout the city centre.

Formally the fourth most important city in the Russian Empire, and with huge strategic value as Ukraine's main sea port, Odesa is a major Kremlin goal.

Russian warships fired shells into the town last week wrecking buildings.

And the Ukrainian Army is on high-alert of a coordinated Normandy-style beach landing and parachute assault that could surround the city on three sides.

So ordinary citizens – like the two mothers – have taken up arms in their droves to defend their homes.

Back on parade, Olena revealed she does not know who will look after her nine-year-old son David if she is killed.

Her mother is dead and she split up from his father a long time ago.

But the 30-year-old, who usually works for a trade union, says she had no other choice than to help defend the city.

She said: 'This is my duty.

'At the moment I work in the army stores.

'But my unit is based here in the city of Odesa so if the Russians invade I will shoot them from the barricades.

Kamila, who used to work for the city council, said she felt she had no choice but to join the army.

She said: 'My son Daniel is 12 years old. I have to protect Odesa for him, for his future.

'I used to work in an office but now I go on patrol and man a post with my unit.'

Ukraine's northern city of Chernihiv where corpses in the street and smashed houses are now commonplace will become next Mariupol, locals say

BY CHRIS MATTHEWS FOR MAILONLINE

There are fears that the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, which has been holding out against Russian forces since the early days of the invasion, could become the next Mariupol.

People living in the city have no power, heating or drinking water and have faced heavy Russian bombardment.

Natalya Vakula, 44, and Nastya Kuzyk, 20, were both injured in the heavy strikes on Chernihiv but were able to flee to a hospital in Kyiv.

At pharmacies, the lists of medicines no longer available grow longer every day.

Ihar Kazmerchak, 38, a linguistics student in Chernihiv, said people were afraid the city could become the next Mariupol, which has been besieged by Russian troops for three weeks.

He said: 'Ravaged houses, fires, corpses in the street, [and] huge bombs are not surprising anyone any more.

He said he starts his day in long queues for drinking water, rationed to 10 litres per person.

On Wednesday, Russian bombs destroyed Chernihiv's main bridge over the Desna River on the road leading to Kyiv, Ukraine's capital.

On Friday, artillery shells rendered the remaining pedestrian bridge impassable, cutting off the last possible route for people to get out or for food and medical supplies to get in.

Refugees from Chernihiv who fled the encirclement and reached Poland this week spoke of broad and terrible destruction, with bombs flattening at least two schools in the city centre and strikes also hitting a stadium, museums, nursery schools and homes.

They said people are drinking water from the Desna River and air strikes were killing people while they wait in line for food.

Volodymyr Fedorovych, 77, said he narrowly escaped a bomb that fell on a queue of people waiting for bread.

He said the blast killed 16 people and injured dozens, blowing off people's arms and legs.

The siege is so intense some of those trapped cannot even muster the strength to be afraid anymore, Mr Kazmerchak said.

'People are simply tired of being scared and don't even go down to the basements,' he said.

Just over a month into the invasion, Russia's attack has slowed into a grinding war of attrition as its military tries to pound cities like Chernihiv into submission.

Bombings of hospitals and other non-military sites, such as the Mariupol theatre where Ukrainian officials said a Russian air strike is believed to have killed some 300 people last week, have given rise to war crime allegations.

Questions about the future direction of Russia's offensive surfaced on Friday when a high-ranking military official said the main objective of the first stage of the operation - reducing Ukraine's fighting capacity - had 'generally been accomplished'.

Donbas is a largely Russian-speaking region in eastern Ukraine where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces since 2014.

A spokesperson for Mariupol City Hall in a Telegram post said: 'From eyewitnesses, information appeared that about 300 people died in the Drama Theater of Mariupol'

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, appearing by video-link at Qatar's Doha Forum, compared the destruction of Mariupol to the Syrian and Russian destruction wrought on the city of Aleppo.

'They are destroying our ports,' Mr Zelensky said. 'The absence of exports from Ukraine will deal a blow to countries worldwide.'
