In Ukraine

More than 1,200,000 Ukrainians have left their homes and sought refuge abroad as a result of Russia’s 9-day war with Ukraine.

Ukraine has counted Russian casualties from the war: 9,166 people, 251 tanks, 33 planes, 37 helicopters, and 939 armored vehicles. Russia neither confirms nor denies these figures. For the third day, Russia has not updated the numbers of casualties among Russian soldiers.

Russian troops attacked the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe.

During the assault, three Ukrainian soldiers were killed and two more were wounded. A fire broke out on the territory of the plant. One of the auxiliary buildings, a training center at the plant site caught fire. Zaporizhzhya NPP is now under Russian control, but personnel control the operation of the power units.

Russian Grad was destroyed in Kharkiv. The same Grad, which yesterday shelled the North Saltivka area. According to the Ukrainian side, since the beginning of the war, about 500 pieces of equipment of the Russian troops have been destroyed in Kharkiv already.

The cities of Kherson and Melitopol can be considered occupied or partially occupied: Russian troops have entered the cities, but both local authorities and residents continue to protest the hostile aggression and takeover of their cities. Russian troops cut off Ukrainian mobile communications, and reports emerged of buses with Crimean residents planning to be involved in a “pro-Russian rally”. Russian television began broadcasting in these cities.

On March 4, Russian troops attempted to invade Mykolaiv, but the attack was repelled. The regional authorities, fearing an enemy attack, closed the waterways of two rivers.

On the same day, the Ukrainian military shot down two Russian aggressor aircraft – over Volnovakha and over Zatoka in Odesa.

In the village of Markhalivka (Fastivka district, Kyiv region), private houses were shelled, and at least 8 of them caught fire. Five people were killed.

A Belarusian volunteer, Ilya “Litsvin” was killed in the fighting for the town of Bucha (Kyiv region). He was a member of the Belarusian Azov company. Yesterday, during the battle, Ilya was wounded. He underwent surgery, but doctors could not save him.

Ukrainian volunteers have launched a website for Belarusians who may go to war. On the page of the site “Stay Home” they laid out the arguments why the Belarusian military should rather go to court-martial than go against Ukraine.

In Russia

Alexei Navalny’s team has announced a general rally against the war in Ukraine, scheduled for March 6 at 2 p.m. across the country.

The Kremlin rejected a conversation between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The Kremlin claims that the Russian Federation is also not giving up on the demands of the so-called “denazification.”

Russia has passed a law on criminal liability for “fakes” about the army’s actions. The responsibility for violation of the new law will be the following: fines up to 1.5 million rubles and imprisonment up to 15 years, depending on the severity of the so-called crime.

In the world

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that the Alliance is not going to close the sky over Ukraine. At the same time, NATO will continue to support Ukraine, but will not participate in the military conflict by providing ground troops. It is assumed that such steps may lead to further escalation of the conflict.

Rafael Mariano Grossi, head of the IAEA, said he wanted to visit Chernobyl to negotiate an end to further attacks on nuclear power plants.

Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II made a large donation to a fund to help Ukrainian refugees. The specific amount of the donation is not specified, but the money raised will go to provide Ukrainian refugees with food, water, medicine, clothing, and shelter.

Microsoft has suspended sales of goods and services in Russia. Network software maker Cisco Systems Inc ceased operations in Russia and Belarus.

A rally in support of Ukraine was held in front of the White House in Washington.

Ukraine was a country in agony Friday, with its capital hit by more missile strikes and multiple cities under a grinding Russian siege.

As Russian forces continued to surround or partly surround major centres such as Kyiv, Kharkiv, Mariupol and Chernihiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky lashed out at the NATO military alliance’s refusal to impose a no-fly zone over his country. “Today the alliance’s leadership gave a green light to the further bombardment of Ukrainian towns and villages, refusing to establish a no-fly zone,” he said in a video address. “Every person who dies from today will die because of you.”

Thousands of people have been killed and more than one million have fled Ukraine since the war began just over a week ago. In televised remarks Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the war was going “according to plan.”

At a children’s hospital in the northern city of Chernihiv, which is surrounded on all sides by Russian forces, the cancer ward has run out of painkillers and will soon run out of food.

“I need most to be in a secure place and to continue his treatment. It means to leave this city, which is being occupied every day, every hour, more and more,” said Yana, the mother of two-year-old Nikita, one of the 11 children trapped in the cancer ward, in a video shared with The Globe and Mail. “We want to be moved to a secure place. Just to continue our treatment. There’s nothing more I need.”

Yana and her two-year-old son Nikita are among the people trapped in the basement of the Chernihiv Regional Children’s Hospital. In a video shared with The Globe, Yana pleads for a safe place for her to continue treatment for Nikita's leukemia. The Globe and Mail

The video was filmed in the bomb shelter beneath the Chernihiv Regional Children’s Hospital. On Thursday alone, 47 people were killed in Russian air strikes on the city of 285,000, just 70 kilometres from the Belarusian border.

“Our morgue is full now,” said Serhiy Zosimenko, who works for a non-governmental organization that supports the cancer ward. “They destroyed two schools and two volunteer centres. Because they want to make a humanitarian catastrophe here in Chernihiv. They know that the volunteers help with food and medicine and medical supplies for civilians. That’s why they decided to kill them all.”

In Kyiv, more than a dozen explosions were heard Friday. It wasn’t immediately clear what had been targeted. A 65-kilometre-long line of Russian military vehicles – compared to a medieval siege convoy – has been stalled for several days on its way to the capital, apparently amid logistical issues and fierce resistance.

Air raid sirens wailed throughout the country Friday, though NATO countries continued to reject Mr. Zelensky’s plea for a no-fly zone. NATO has argued that sending warplanes into Ukraine’s skies would lead to an even wider war.

“Allies agree that we should not have NATO planes operating in Ukrainian airspace or NATO troops on Ukrainian territory,” Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said after a crisis meeting with foreign ministers from the military alliance’s 30 member countries in Brussels.

Mr. Putin, meanwhile, said Russia had “no ill intentions” toward its neighbours. “I would also advise them not to escalate the situation,” he added.

In the town of Volnovakha, on the front line in eastern Ukraine, local MP Dmytro Lubinets said the dead are too numerous to count.

“I can’t tell you figures at all – we can’t guess how many people left. There are definitely indeed bodies lying on the streets because we can’t get to them to deliver burials,” Mr. Lubinets said in a telephone interview. He said thousands of people were still stuck in the town, which had a pre-war population of 21,000, even though it was being pounded by relentless Russian shelling. “There are two schools we can’t reach and know there are huge basements used as shelters, but we can’t get there, so we don’t know the conditions.”

Footage provided by local Member of Parliament Dmytro Lubinets shows the destruction of Volnovakha, Ukraine on March 4.

Russian attack on Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant stirs fury, fear

More than a million Ukrainians flee country as Russia accused of war crimes

Marina Tsyplonok and her family escaped Volnovakha after a week of living first in a basement with 20 people, then a larger one with 37, as shells rained down and food and water ran out. On Thursday morning, a Ukrainian soldier came and told everyone they had five minutes to evacuate.

“To be honest, we’re confused about what day it is, because it was seven days of total hell living in the basement,” the 37-year-old mother of three said. “One of the children in the shelter had Asperger’s. He was screaming all night and asking to go home. Nobody could explain the situation to him.”

Russian troops briefly entered the Black Sea port of Mykolaiv on Friday but were repelled, Ukrainian officials said. In nearby Kherson, the first major city to fall under Russian control, Mayor Igor Kolykhaev told residents that under rules set by the Russian military, they could only go outside with just one other person and that cars should drive slowly. The dead, which the city said numbered 49, would be collected from the city’s main square, he said.

“For now, the flag flying above us is Ukrainian,” he said in a Facebook post. “And in order to stay that way, these requirements must be met. This is all I can offer for now.”

Mr. Kolykhaev later complained that Russian forces had prevented a humanitarian aid convoy from entering the city.

In places now under Russian occupation, fears of a different sort prevail. In Berdiansk, television service has been cut, leaving screens blank after Russian forces took control Feb. 27. The next day, hundreds of local residents protested, waving Ukrainian flags and singing hymns. Since then, an uneasy calm has descended, with Russian troops at checkpoints on roads leading into the city, and residents ordered to obey a 7 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew.

Fuel is in such short supply that city buses have reduced service. Only a few grocery stores and gas stations remain open. “We are pretty worried that we will run out of food, we will run out of water,” said Sophia Podkolzina, who works for a company providing social media services to international clients.

Mariupol, a city of 450,000 people on the Sea of Azov, is surrounded by Russian forces and cut off from the world. Phone lines have been disconnected for the past three days. There is no water or electricity service. Homes are without heat, with nighttime temperatures at freezing.

Pavlo Kyrylenko, the head of the Donetsk regional administration, likened it to the Second World War siege of Leningrad (today’s St. Petersburg) by the Nazis.

“This is a demonstration of the massacre of a city which has refused to surrender to the ‘Russian world,’” Mr. Kyrylenko wrote on Facebook, where he has maintained regular updates of destruction in the region.

On Friday, city workers began delivering water by tanker truck, Mr. Kyrylenko said, while attacks continued to strike neighbourhoods, a supermarket and a hospital. Shelling had cut electricity service in a number of nearby communities, and workers were scrambling to repair broken natural gas pipelines.

“The city is constantly being bombed and shot by artillery and guns,” said Dmitry Savenkoy, a Mariupol resident who is not currently in Ukraine. His last contact with the city was a brief call with a colleague three days ago. It is a “humanitarian catastrophe,” he said.

In Toretsk, a city of 31,000 about 200 kilometres north of Mariupol, the municipality’s 19 boilers have all run out of natural gas, leaving 400 residential buildings, eight schools, nine kindergartens and 10 medical institutions without heat.

Meanwhile, a huge fire at a facility adjacent to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant – the largest in Europe – was extinguished early Friday, hours after Russian forces had taken control of the facility.

Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Mr. Zelensky, said Russia was committing war crimes.

“Russia is fighting with a deliberate violation of all conventions, laws and rules of war, trying to cause maximum damage to Ukrainian critical infrastructure, civilian infrastructure and ordinary people. Trying to cause maximum panic moods and the refugee crisis,” he said in a statement released by the Ministry of Defence. “The Russian command could not help knowing what threatens Ukraine and, frankly, the whole of Europe, with a large-scale tank attack directed against the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. … The consequences, the risks, the amount of destruction – everything was thought out by the Russians in advance.”

Mr. Podolyak made the statement early Thursday, after a third round of negotiations failed to reach either a ceasefire or an agreement on humanitarian evacuation corridors.

In Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, with a population of 1.4 million, researcher Maria Avdeeva filmed herself standing in the city’s main square, days after the adjacent regional administration building was damaged in a cruise missile attack.

“We still have Ukrainian flags here. Because Ukraine and Kharkiv are fighting,” she said. “We are fighting back furiously and we will not surrender. We will stand here on our land, and in our city, for as long as it takes.”

The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting on Friday in response to Russia’s attack and capture of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, which caused worldwide alarm about the potential for a nuclear accident if the conflict in Ukraine is not contained.

The United States and its allies denounced Russia for the attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine, calling it a threat to civilians and a reckless escalation. They condemned the seizure of the plant and called for Russia to withdraw its troops from Zaporizhzhia and from the former Chernobyl nuclear plant in northern Ukraine.

“By the grace of God, the world narrowly averted a nuclear catastrophe last night,” said Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. “Mr. Putin must stop this madness, and he must stop it now. Cooler heads must prevail.”

Early on Friday, as fighting reached the vicinity of the Zaporizhzhia plant, a fire started at a training building. The fire was extinguished, and the plant appeared to be safe on Friday. Ukrainian officials and the International Atomic Energy Agency said the fire had been contained without damage to the reactors or other equipment, and that radiation levels had not increased.

“This is the first time that a state has attacked a fueled and functioning nuclear power plant,” said Britain’s U.N. ambassador, Barbara Woodward, who had called for the Security Council meeting. “It must not happen again.”

Russia’s ambassador, Vasily Nebenzya, told the council that the allegations that Russia had attacked the nuclear site were “lies” and part of an anti-Russian campaign. He said the emergency meeting had been called to “kindle artificial hysteria about what is taking place in Ukraine.”

Mr. Nebenzya offered a different account of the incident, saying that Russian troops patrolling the area of the nuclear facility had come under fire from Ukrainian forces inside the training building and had returned fire. He accused Ukrainians of setting the blaze.

“Our servicemen are not interfering with the work of the operators of the power plants and only working to ensure stability,” Mr. Nebenzya said, adding that Russia had experienced the 1986 Chernobyl disaster and did not want to see another nuclear accident.

The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, briefed the council from an airplane en route to Iran. Mr. Grossi said he had proposed to the Ukrainian and Russian authorities that he travel to Ukraine as soon as possible and visit both nuclear sites, Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhia, to establish a framework to protect them.

Mr. Grossi said his mission would not be political and would be restricted to ensuring “the safety and security of nuclear establishments of Ukraine, which, as facts have shown, are in constant danger of accidents.” He added that the Zaporizhzhia facility was operating normally, but said he had informed the I.A.E.A. board of governors that “there is no normalcy to the situation when there are military forces in charge of the site.”

Beyond the statements of diplomats, the Security Council cannot take significant action against Russia because the country has veto power over legally binding resolutions. Russia vetoed a resolution last week that condemned its invasion of Ukraine and called for the immediate withdrawal of its troops.

The U.N. General Assembly, a 193-member body, passed a resolution on Wednesday that condemned the invasion and called for humanitarian access and a diplomatic solution. That resolution, which was politically symbolic but not legally binding, passed with 141 countries voting in favor, demonstrating Russia’s isolation on the world stage, diplomats said.

Live updates: Netflix suspends service in Russia

By The Associated Press, undefined

The latest developments on the Russia-Ukraine war:

__

Netflix said Sunday that it's suspending its service in Russia.

A statement from the company cited ""circumstances on the ground"" for its decision to suspend its Russian service but didn't offer any additional details.

The announcement comes after TikTok said users on its platform in Russia have been blocked from posting and viewing videos shared from elsewhere in the world. American Express also announced earlier in the day it would suspend operations in Russia, as well as in Russian-allied Belarus.

NEW YORK — TikTok said Sunday that users won't be able to post new videos in Russia in response to the government's crackdown on social media.

""In light of Russia's new 'fake news' law, we have no choice but to suspend livestreaming and new content to our video service while we review the safety implications of this law,"" the company said in a statement on Twitter. ""Our in-app messaging service will not be affected.""

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday intensified a crackdown on media outlets and individuals who fail to hew to the Kremlin line on Russia's war in Ukraine, blocking Facebook and Twitter and signing into law a bill that criminalizes the intentional spreading of what Moscow deems to be ""fake"" reports.

TikTok is part of the larger Chinese tech company ByteDance.

__

NEW YORK — American Express announced Sunday it is suspending all operations in Russia and Belarus.

Globally issued American Express cards will no longer work at merchants or ATMs in Russia, the company said in a statement. AmEx cards issued locally in Russia by the country's banks will also no longer work outside of Russia.

The company previously halted its relationships with banks in Russia impacted by the

U.S. and international government sanctions, the company said.

JERUSALEM — Israel's prime minister spoke Sunday evening by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a day after his snap trip to Moscow to discuss the more than weeklong Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Naftali Bennett also spoke with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, whom he visited in Berlin on Saturday as well, and French President Emmanuel Macron, his office said.

Bennett has also spoken on the phone multiple times with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy — most recently Sunday morning — as part of his shuttle diplomacy to mediate between Ukraine and Russia after more than a week of fighting.

Additionally, Israeli foreign minister Yair Lapid will fly to Riga, Latvia, on Monday to meet with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the Foreign Ministry said.

While Israel has condemned Russia's invasion, it has also refrained from taking action that could anger Moscow, out of concern of jeopardizing military coordination in neighboring Syria.

__

VIENNA, Austria — The International Atomic Energy Agency has said Russian forces are tightening their grip on the Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant, Ukraine's largest, that they seized last week.

The director general of the agency, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said Sunday Ukrainian staff members are now required to seek approval for any operation, even maintenance, from the Russians, and that they have impeded normal communications by switching off some mobile networks and internet at the site.

Ukraine's regulatory authority said that phone lines, as well as e-mails and fax, are no longer working. Grossi said he is ""extremely concerned about these developments,"" adding that for the plant to operate safely, ""staff must be allowed to carry out their vital duties in stable conditions, without undue external interference or pressure.""

__

NEW YORK — The Russian military has warned Ukraine's neighboring countries from hosting its warplanes, saying Moscow may consider them a part of the conflict if Ukrainian aircraft fly combat missions from their territory.

Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov charged Sunday that some Ukrainian combat planes had redeployed to Romania and other Ukraine neighbors he didn't identify.

Konashenkov warned that if those warplanes attack the Russian forces from the territory of those nations, it ""could be considered as those countries' engagement in the military conflict.""

__

PARIS — The French presidency said the call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday focused primarily on the safety of Ukraine's nuclear plants.

The call was on request from Macron and lasted almost two hours, the Elysee said.

A French official said Macron insisted on the need to ensure the International Atomic Energy Agency's safety standards are respected at Chernobyl and in other nuclear plants. He told Putin these facilities must not be targeted by a Russian offensive or caught in the fighting.

Putin said he does not intend to attack nuclear plants and agreed on the principle of a ""dialogue"" between IAEA, Ukraine and Russia on this issue, according to the official, who spoke anonymously in line with the French presidency's practices. Potential talks are to be organized in the coming days, he said.

Macron reiterated his call for Russia to stop its military operations and insisted on the need to protect the civilians and allow access to humanitarian aid.

""The (humanitarian) situation is difficult"" including in Mariupol on Sunday, the official stressed. ""Our demands remain the same: we want Russia to respond to these demands... very quickly and clearly.""

PARIS — European Union leader Charles Michel said Sunday closing Ukraine's airspace could spark a world war.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly called on NATO countries to stop the Russian onslaught on his country by imposing a no-fly zone. Western leaders have refused for fear of triggering a wider war in Europe. Deploying fighter jets over Ukraine could ""in current circumstances"" be considered as ""NATO's entry into the war and therefore risk World War III,"" Michel said in an interview with the public broadcaster France Inter.

Michel denied that economic sanctions against Russia constitute ""a war of the EU or NATO against Russia."" Russian President Vladimir Putin has linked the West's economic punishment for his invasion of Ukraine to ""declaring war"" on Moscow.

Michel said European and American allies imposed sanctions ""to create pressure and hurt the (Russian) regime"", not the people.

JERUSALEM — A group of 100 Ukrainian Jewish orphans who were evacuated from the country after Russia invaded have landed in Israel.

The children arrived Sunday a few hours before two flights carrying around 300 other Ukrainian Jewish immigrants landed.

The children were evacuated from the central Ukrainian city of Zhytomyr and brought to Israel by the KKL-JNF organization.

The Jewish Agency for Israel, a quasigovernmental organization that manages immigration affairs, said that it had received 5,500 urgent requests by Ukrainian Jews to move to Israel since Russia attacked on Feb. 24.

WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken says the United States and its allies are having a ""very active discussion"" about banning the import of Russian oil and natural gas in the latest escalation of their sanctions in retaliation for its invasion of Ukraine.

Asked about oil and gas imports, Blinken told CNN on Sunday that President Joe Biden convened a meeting of his National Security Council on the subject the day before. Biden and Western allies have until now held off on sanctions against Russia's lucrative energy industry to avoid blowback on their own economies.

Meanwhile fighting between the Russian military and Ukrainian armed forces is continuing across Ukraine. (Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images) loading...

""We are now talking to our European partners and allies to look in a coordinated way at the prospect of banning the import of Russian oil while making sure that there is still an appropriate supply of oil on world market,"" said Blinken. ""That's a very active discussion as we speak.""

——

BERLIN -- The U.N. human rights office says it has confirmed the deaths of 364 civilians in Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on Feb. 24.

The Geneva-based office said that another 759 civilians had been injured as of midnight Saturday.

The rights office uses strict methodology and only reports casualties it has confirmed.

It says it believes the real figures are considerably higher, ""especially in government-controlled territory and especially in recent days."" That's because the flow of information has been delayed amid the fighting and many reports still need to be corroborated.

Ukrainian officials have presented far higher numbers.

NEW YORK — The Kremlin says President Vladimir Putin told his Turkish counterpart that Russia's military action in Ukraine could be halted ""only if Kyiv ceases hostilities and fulfills the well-known demands of Russia.""

Putin has listed ""demilitarization"" and ""denazification"" of Ukraine, recognition of Russian-annexed Crimea as part of Russia and separatist regions in eastern Ukraine as independent states as the Kremlin's main demands.

According to the readout of Sunday's call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, ""hope was expressed that during the planned next round of negotiations, the representatives of Ukraine would show a more constructive approach, fully taking into account the emerging realities.""

A third round of talks is scheduled for Monday.

MEDYKA, Poland -- The head of the United Nations' refugee agency says the international Red Cross and the U.N. are negotiating access to the cities in Ukraine most impacted by fighting since Russia invaded Feb. 24.

Filippo Grandi, the U.N. high commissioner for refugees, said Sunday that ""those discussions continue"" with hope for success, but didn't name specific cities. He said during a visit to Poland's border with Ukraine that ""these corridors are mainly to bring humanitarian goods basic goods to people that are really in desperate need and also to extract maybe the most vulnerable people.""

Grandi stressed that wide international assistance is needed for Poland and other countries receiving refugees from Ukraine. He said that ""predictions are difficult, hundreds of thousands are on the move inside Ukraine, and it is very likely that we will see a large influx continuing in the next few days."" Earlier Sunday, he said that more than 1.5 million people have already fled Ukraine for neighboring countries.

Grandi said that ""what is needed really is a ceasefire, is the end to hostilities because that's the only way to stop this tragedy.""

LVIV, Ukraine — A Ukrainian official says a second attempt to evacuate civilians from a southern city under siege for a week has failed due to continued Russian shelling.

Ukrainian military authorities said earlier Sunday that evacuations from the port city of Mariupol were scheduled to begin at noon local time (10 a.m. GMT) during a 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. local ceasefire.

Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko said the planned evacuations along designated humanitarian corridors were halted because of an ongoing assault.

He said on Telegram that ""there can be no 'green corridors' because only the sick brain of the Russians decides when to start shooting and at whom.""

A similar cease-fire planned for Mariupol and the nearby city of Volnovakha collapsed Saturday, trapping residents under more shelling and aerial bombardment by Russian forces.

——

ISTANBUL — Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's office says he has called for an urgent cease-fire in Ukraine in a telephone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

In a statement following Sunday's one-hour call, the Turkish presidency said Erdogan had urged a halt to fighting to ""address humanitarian concerns"" and ""seek a political solution"" to the conflict. The war is now in its 11th day.

Erdogan called for the opening of humanitarian corridors and a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine.

Turkey has extensive ties with both Russia and Ukraine and has sought to place itself as a mediator. It has invited both to a diplomatic forum in Antalya next week.

Erdogan's office said he told Putin that he was ""ready to make every contribution"" to resolving the crisis.

WARSAW, Poland — Poland's border guard agency says that over 922,000 refugees have crossed the border from Ukraine since Feb. 24, when Russia launched its invasion.

The agency said on Twitter that a record one-day number of over 129,000 crossed into Poland on Saturday, and almost 40,000 between midnight and 7 a.m. on Sunday.

A nation of some 38 million people, Poland is receiving the largest number of refugees among Ukraine's neighbors. Some who entered Poland have continued to other countries.

The head of the United Nations' refugee agency said Sunday that more than 1.5 million refugees have crossed from Ukraine into neighboring countries since Russia invaded.

——

SIRET, Romania — Romania's border police say more than 227,000 Ukrainian citizens have entered Romania in total since the crisis began and more than 155,000 of them have already left the country.

During a visit on Saturday to Romania's northern border at Siret, Romanian President Klaus Iohannis said that ""no Ukrainian will be denied entry into Romania.""

He said Romanian authorities believe that the situation ""will continue for a long time, and the complications will worsen."" The president added: ""We believe that this humanitarian catastrophe will spread, that a lot of help will be needed here, but also in Ukraine.""

——

VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis says he has dispatched two cardinals to Ukraine, a highly unusual move.

The pontiff said Sunday that ""the Holy See is willing to do everything to put itself in service for peace."" The papal almsgiver, Cardinal Konrad Krajewski, has been dispatched with aid, along with Cardinal Michael Czerny, who is head of the papal office that deals with migration, charity, justice and peace.

Francis did not say where exactly the cardinals had gone, but said they represented him and all Christian people with the message that ""war is madness.''

Referring to Ukraine as ""that martyred country,"" Francis called for a cessation of violence, the establishment of humanitarian corridors and a return to negotiations.

""In Ukraine, rivers of blood and tears are flowing. This is not just a military operation, but a war that sows death, destruction and misery,'' he said in his traditional Sunday blessing.

——

HELSINKI -- The top U.S. military officer says Ukrainian soldiers and civilians alike have put up an ""extraordinarily courageous"" fight since the Russian invasion.

Gen. Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, spoke Sunday during a visit to an air base in Amari, Estonia. He is visiting the three Baltic nations to pledge U.S. and NATO support to Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, former Soviet republics that border Russia.

Milley said that ""the will of the Ukrainian people, the importance of their national leadership and the fighting skills of the Ukrainian army has come through loud and clear.""

He said Ukrainians have put up ""an extraordinarily courageous and brave fight"" and ""they've been doing very, very well. But it's a little bit early to draw any definitive lessons.""

Milley said the U.S. currently has no indications that Moscow is planning to attack on the Baltic countries and ""we want to make sure it stays that way.""

——

LVIV, Ukraine — Ukrainian President Voldymyr Zelenskyy is pushing his call for foreign countries to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine.

Establishing a no-fly zone would risk escalating the conflict by involving foreign militaries directly. Although the United States and many Western countries have backed Ukraine with weapons shipments, they have sent no troops.

Zelenskyy said in a video address on Sunday that ""the world is strong enough to close our skies.""

NATO countries have ruled out policing a no-fly zone, which would bar all unauthorized aircraft from flying over Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Saturday that Moscow would consider any third-party declaration of a no-fly zone over Ukraine as ""participation in the armed conflict.""

——

TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel's prime minister says his country will continue to assist in finding a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine crisis, even if the chances for success are few.

Naftali Bennett spoke Sunday to a meeting of his Cabinet, hours after he returned from a surprise meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, where the two discussed the war with Ukraine. He then traveled to Germany where he met Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

Bennett revealed no details from his talks with Putin, but called the country's mediation efforts ""our moral duty."" Earlier, his office said he and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke by phone Sunday morning, the third such call between the two leaders over the past day.

Bennett also told his Cabinet Israel was readying for a wave of Jewish immigration from Ukraine. Israel is also preparing to allow entry to a small number of non-Jewish Ukrainians fleeing the conflict.

Israel is one of the few countries that has good working relations with both Russia and Ukraine.

——

LVIV, Ukraine — An official in one of Ukraine's pro-Russia separatist region says Russian forces will observe a temporary cease-fire Sunday in two Ukrainian cities. An agreement to allow civilians to evacuate collapsed a day earlier amid continued shelling and the flight of refugees to neighboring nations.

Eduard Basurin, a spokesman for the military in separatist-held Donetsk, said safe passage corridors for residents of the besieged port city of Mariupol and the city of Volnovakha would reopen Sunday. He did not say for how long nor whether a cease-fire would accompany the evacuation.

Ukrainian officials confirmed that evacuations from Mariupol would take place starting from 12 p.m. local time. Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of the Donetsk regional military administration, said a ceasefire would be in effect between 10 a.m. and 9 p.m.

——

BERLIN -- The head of the United Nations' refugee agency says that more than 1.5 million refugees have crossed from Ukraine into neighboring countries since Russia invaded.

Filippo Grandi, the U.N. high commissioner for refugees, tweeted on Sunday that it is ""the fastest growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II.""

His agency didn't immediately give a more precise update on the refugee figures. Grandi is visiting countries that border Ukraine.

PRAGUE — Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty says it has suspended its operations in Russia after Moscow intensified a crackdown on what it deems to be ""fake"" reports and tax authorities initiated bankruptcy proceedings against it.

The U.S.-funded, Prague-based broadcaster's president and chief executive, Jamie Fly, said ""this is not a decision that RFE/RL has taken of its own accord, but one that has

been forced upon us by the Putin regime's assault on the truth.""

The broadcaster, which has had a physical presence in Russia since 1991, plans to continue reporting on Russia and the war in Ukraine from abroad.

The announcement came after Russia on Friday passed a law foreseeing prison sentences of up to 15 years for spreading what is deemed to be fake information about its armed forces.

In addition, RFE/RL said that Russian authorities initiated bankruptcy proceedings on Friday. It said it is seeing ""the culmination of a years-long pressure campaign against RFE/RL.""

——

BERLIN — Austrian energy company OMV says it has decided not to pursue any future investments in Russia and is starting a ""strategic review"" of its stake in the Yuzhno Rosskoye gas and oil field, which could result in its exit.

OMV said in a statement late Saturday that ""Russia will no longer be a core region"" in its business. CEO Alfred Stern said that ""the war in Ukraine is a tragic and perilous situation that is causing great suffering for many and that we view with the utmost consternation.""

OMV holds a 24.99% stake in Yuzhno Rosskoye. It said that the review it has now launched ""comprises all options including possibilities to divest or exit."" It said that it expects to take costs of 500 million-800 million euros ($547 million-875 million).

It said it also will take a charge of 987 million euros related to financing for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, whose certification was suspended by Germany last month, which ""may be unrecoverable.""

The Austrian company has already ended negotiations with Russia's Gazprom about the potential purchase of a stake in the Urengoy gas field in Siberia.

CHISINAU, Moldova - U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in Moldova pledging America's support to the small Western-leaning former Soviet republic that is coping with an influx of refugees from Ukraine and warily watching Russia's intensifying war with its neighbor.

Blinken was meeting on Sunday with senior Moldovan officials who are appealing for international assistance in dealing with more than 120,000 refugees from Ukraine that it is now hosting while also seeking security reassurances against potential Russian aggression. More than 230,000 people have fled into Moldova from Ukraine since the war began 11 days ago.

Blinken said Moldova's welcoming of refugees is an inspiration to the world.

""We admire the generosity of hospitality, the willingness to be such good friends to people who are in distress, and, indeed, I want to do everything we can to help you deal with the burden that this has imposed,"" he said.

Russia already has troops in the country of 2.6 million that are stationed in the disputed territory of Transnistria and are being closely watched as Russian President Vladimir Putin presses ahead with the invasion of Ukraine. Although it has no plans to try to become a member of NATO, Moldova formally applied to join the European Union just three days ago in a fast-track bid to bolster its ties with the West.

LONDON — British military officials on Sunday compared Russia's tactics in Ukraine to those used in Chechnya and Syria, where cities were bombarded and heavily damaged after Russian forces faced unexpected resistance from their defenders.

The strength of Ukrainian resistance continues to surprise Russian forces and they have responded by targeting populated areas, including the cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Mariupol, Britain's Ministry of Defense said in its daily intelligence briefing.

""This is likely to represent an effort to break Ukrainian morale,"" the ministry said in a statement. ""Russia has used similar tactics in Chechnya in 1999 and Syria in 2016, employing both air and ground-based munitions.""

Russia's advance has been slowed by attacks on its supply lines, the ministry said. As a result, there is a ""realistic possibility"" that Russia is now trying to disguise fuel trucks to reduce losses.

___

TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel's prime minister has returned from a surprise trip to Russia where he met President Vladimir Putin and discussed the war in Ukraine.

Naftali Bennett flew to Moscow on Saturday, where he met the Russian leader for three hours. The trip was made ""in coordination and with the blessing"" of the Biden administration, according to Bennett's office.

Bennett spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy after his meeting with Putin. He then flew to Germany to meet Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

Bennett landed in Israel on Sunday morning and is expected to convene his Cabinet for its weekly meeting later in the day.

Bennett's trip was the latest attempt at diplomacy in the Russia-Ukraine crisis. Israel is one of the few countries that has good working relations with both Russia and Ukraine. Israel has delivered humanitarian aid to Ukraine, but also maintains ties with Moscow to make sure that Israeli and Russian warplanes do not come into conflict in neighboring Syria.

KYIV, Ukraine — A Ukrainian paramedic who was shot while on her way to evacuate injured people from the outskirts of Kyiv was buried in the country's capital on Saturday.

Valentyna Pushych was known locally as ""Romashka,"" which means ""Daisy."" A friend described her as a ""daredevil,"" who was never afraid to ""get under bullets.'

She was always ""running to the most dangerous places"" to rescue to the injured, Nataliia Voronkova said.

Pushych used to be a well-paid worker at a transport and logistic company. But in 2016, she joined the army as a paramedic in response to the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine.

Several women, including some dressed in camouflage jackets, cried as her body lay in a casket at a service. A portrait of Pushych was on a wall nearby.

At the cemetery, red roses were placed on Pushych's body. After she was buried, the dirt was covered with the flag of Ukraine.

Putin Warns Against Ukraine No-Fly Zone

By The Associated Press, undefined

The latest developments on the Russia-Ukraine war:

——

NEW YORK — Russian President Vladimir Putin says Moscow would consider any third-party declaration of a no-fly zone over Ukraine as ""participation in the armed conflict.""

Speaking at a meeting with female pilots on Saturday, Putin said Russia would view ""any move in this direction"" as an intervention that ""will pose a threat to our service members.""

""That very second, we will view them as participants of the military conflict, and it would not matter what members they are,"" the Russian president said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has pushed NATO to impose a no-fly zone over his country, warning that ""all the people who die from this day forward will also die because of you.""

NATO has said a no-fly zone, which would bar all unauthorized aircraft from flying over Ukraine, could provoke widespread war in Europe with nuclear-armed Russia.

HELSINKI, Finland — Finland and Sweden have pledged to further deepen defense cooperation, including with NATO. Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin says that ""Russia's war against a European nation puts the European security order at risk.""

Finland and neighboring Sweden for years have resisted joining NATO, but the Russian invasion of Ukraine is changing the dynamic. Recent polls in both countries show more than 50% of Finns and Swedes in support of NATO membership but their governments are more cautious.

""It's very understandable that the mindset of our citizens is changing due to Russia's attack against Ukraine,"" said Marin, but refused to comment on whether Finland would ask for a major non-NATO allied status, a designation given to countries with close strategic relationship with the U.S. military.

Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said cooperation with NATO is ""maybe closer than ever"" and that a rapprochement with NATO would be discussed.

NEW YORK — Aeroflot, Russia's flagship carrier, has announced that it will halt all international flights except to Belarus starting March 8.

The move by Russia's biggest state-owned airline comes after the country's aviation agency, Rosaviatsiya, recommended that all Russian airlines with foreign-leased planes halt both passenger and cargo flights abroad.

It cited a high risk of foreign-leased planes being impounded as part of Western sanctions that ban leasing of planes to Russia.

Rosaviatsiya's recommendation doesn't apply to Russian airlines that use Russian planes or foreign planes that aren't at risk of being impounded.

It also doesn't apply to foreign airlines from countries that have not imposed sanctions on Russia and have not shut down their airspace for Russian planes. Aeroflot's statement Saturday cited ""circumstances that hinder operating flights"" as a reason for its move.

Aeroflot said it would cancel return tickets for passengers who are scheduled to depart Russia after March 6 and travel back after March 8. Those with one-way tickets will be allowed to fly up until March 8. Earlier this week, S7, Russia's biggest private airline, announced that it was halting all international flights starting Saturday.

——

BERLIN -- German public broadcasters ARD and ZDF say they are suspending reporting from their Moscow studios after Russia passed a law foreseeing prison sentences of up to 15 years for spreading what is deemed to be fake information about its armed forces.

The measure was signed into law by President Vladimir Putin on Friday and already prompted some foreign media including the BBC and Bloomberg to say they were suspending operations within Russia.

ARD and ZDF said in a statement that they are examining the consequences of the new legislation and suspending reporting from the Moscow studios for now.

The passing of the law comes amid a broader crackdown on media outlets and social media in Russia.

——

LVIV, Ukraine — The Ukrainian president's office says civilian evacuations have halted in an area of the country where Russian defense officials had announced a cease-fire.

Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office, said the evacuation effort was stopped because the city of Mariupol remained under fire on Saturday.

""The Russian side is not holding to the ceasefire and has continued firing on Mariupol itself and on its surrounding area,"" he said. ""Talks with the Russian Federation are ongoing regarding setting up a ceasefire and ensuring a safe humanitarian corridor.""

The Russian Defense Ministry said earlier in a statement it had agreed on evacuation routes with Ukrainian forces for Mariupol, a strategic port in the southeast, and for the eastern city of Volnovakha.

But a city official reported that shelling continued in his area Saturday despite the deal, a sign of the fragility of efforts to stop fighting across the country.

——

RZESZOW, Poland — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is visiting southeastern Poland near the border with Ukraine as the war enters its 10th day. Blinken arrived in Rzeszow on Saturday for talks with top Polish officials and was to visit a frontier post to meet Ukrainian refugees later in the day.

Blinken was meeting Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau a day after attending a NATO foreign minister's meeting in Brussels at which the alliance pledged to step up support for eastern flank members like Poland to counter Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Although NATO has ruled out establishing a no-fly zone over non-member Ukraine, it has significantly boosted both military and humanitarian assistance. Rzeszow is about 80 km (50 miles) from the Ukrainian border and its airport has become a hub for flights carrying such aid.

——

MADRID — Spanish clothing giant Inditex has decided to ""temporarily suspend"" all its activity in Russia, including over 500 stores and its online sales.

In a statement to Spanish stock market regulator CNMV, the parent company of Zara, Massimo Dutti and other fashion chains says that ""under the current circumstances it cannot guarantee the continuity of its operations and the commercial conditions in the Russian Federation.""

It added that the company will focus on developing ""a special support plan"" for the more than 9,000 people it employs in Russia.

Inditex said that Russia accounts for 8.5% of the group's business. It said the move doesn't significantly impact its investment there because all its Russian shops operate on rented premises.

Major western companies, including H&M, Apple, Mercedes-Benz and BP, have halted their sales or operations in Russia since the country started its invasion of Ukraine.

——

NEW YORK — Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has defended Russia's adoption of a law setting out prison sentences of up to 15 years for spreading what is deemed to be fake information about its armed forces.

The measure was signed into law by President Vladimir Putin on Friday and prompted some foreign media including the BBC and Bloomberg to say they were suspending operations within Russia.

Peskov told reporters the measure was justified on the grounds of an ""information war which was unleashed against our country."" Asked how Russians could express opinions which don't match the official government position, Peskov said ""within the bounds of the law.""

The passing of the law comes amid a broader crackdown on media outlets and social media in Russia. Facebook and Twitter were both blocked Friday in Russia.

——

GENEVA -- The International Organization for Migration says the number of people who have left Ukraine since fighting began has now reached 1.45 million.

The U.N. migration agency, citing figures from government ministries in countries where they have arrived, said Saturday that 787,300 of them went to Poland. Some 228,700 fled to Moldova, 144,700 to Hungary, 132,600 to Romania and 100,500 to Slovakia.

The IOM said that nationals of 138 countries have crossed Ukraine's borders into neighboring nations.

——

ISTANBUL - Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's spokesman says the Turkish leader will speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday.

""This war must be stopped immediately and there must be a return to the negotiating table,"" Ibrahim Kalin told broadcaster NTV in Istanbul. He said Saturday that ""our president will talk to Putin tomorrow.""

NATO member Turkey has close ties to both Russia and Ukraine and has repeatedly offered to mediate between the two. It has invited the top diplomats of both countries to Turkey for talks next week.

Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Friday that Russian Foreign Minister Seygey Lavrov had confirmed his attendance at the Antalya Diplomacy Forum, to be held in the Mediterranean coastal city between March 11-13.

——

BERLIN -- The German government says the country's state-owned development bank has signed an agreement with Dutch gas company Gasunie and German energy company RWE to build a liquid natural gas import terminal.

The Economy Ministry said Saturday that the memorandum of understanding to build the LNG terminal in Brunsbuettel, on Germany's North Sea coast, was signed Friday. It didn't give financial details or a timeframe.

The terminal will be run by Gasunie, which is owned by the Dutch state, and Germany's KfW development bank will have a 50% stake. The ministry said that, in the long term, the plan is to re-equip the terminal to import green hydrogen derivatives.

Chancellor Olaf Scholz said last weekend that Germany will quickly build two LNG terminals, one in Brunsbuettel and the other in Wilhelmshaven. Germany wants to reduce its dependency on Russian gas following the attack on Ukraine.

——

ROME — Italian financial police have seized two Russian-owned superyachts moored in a Ligurian port after Italy's foreign minister announced plans to sequester 140 million euros ($154 million) from Russian billionaires in Italy.

Foreign Minister Luigio Di Maio told Italian state TV Friday evening that ""this is the only way to convince"" Putin ""to reason.''

Financial police in the port of Imperia immediately seized the 65-meter (215-foot) ""Lady M,"" with an estimated value of 65 million euros, owned by Alexei Mordashov, as well as the ""Lena,"" valued at 50 million euros and belonging to Gennady Timchenko. Other seizures were reportedly under way.

PARIS — The office of President Emmanuel Macron says France will soon propose concrete measures to ensure the safety and security of Ukraine's five main nuclear sites.

The safeguards will be drawn up on the basis of International Atomic Energy Agency criteria, a statement from the French presidency said Saturday.

A Russian attack on a nuclear plant sparked a fire on Friday and briefly raised worldwide fears of a catastrophe. The statement said Macron is ""extremely concerned about the risks to nuclear safety, security and the implementation of international safeguards resulting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine.""

Macron said Russia ""must immediately cease its illegal and dangerous military actions"" and allow Ukrainian authorities full control over all nuclear facilities within Ukraine's internationally recognized borders. He urged Russia to allow ""free, regular and unhindered access for facility personnel to ensure their continued safe operation.""

——-

KYIV, Ukraine — The Russian military will observe a ceasefire in two areas of Ukraine starting Saturday to allow civilians to evacuate, Russian state media reported, but there was no immediate confirmation from Ukraine. It would be the first breakthrough in allowing civilians to escape.

The Russian Defense Ministry statement carried by the RIA Novosti and Tass agencies said it has agreed on evacuation routes with Ukrainian forces to allow civilians to leave the strategic port of Mariupol in the southeast and the eastern town of Volnovakha ""from 10 a.m. Moscow time."" It was not immediately clear from the vaguely worded statement how long the routes would remain open.

The head of Ukraine's security council, Oleksiy Danilov, had called on Russia to create humanitarian corridors to allow children, women and the elderly to escape the fighting, calling such corridors ""question No. 1.""

TOKYO — Thousands of people marched in Tokyo on Saturday protesting Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The crowd shouted, ""Stop war. Protect lives."" Some held signs that read: ""We stand with Ukraine."" Others held images of Russian President Vladimir Putin with the words: ""Stop Putin.""

Russia's shelling of a nuclear plant in Ukraine on Friday and Putin's implied threat of nuclear war have struck a nerve in Japan, which suffered atomic attacks at the end of World War II in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as the worst nuclear catastrophe since Chernobyl in Fukushima in 2011.

""It's too terrible,"" said housewife Yukiko Asano, one of the protesters.

The protest, one of the largest in Tokyo in recent years, included people from Europe and spiraled through the fashionable Omotesando district, extending for blocks. Many wore yellow and blue, the colors of Ukraine's flag. Organizers said about 4,000 people took part.

""We need to stop Putin. We need to end the dictatorship,"" said a Russian software engineer, who asked to be identified only by his first name Egor to avoid backlash. ""This kind of situation is a way to nowhere.""

LOS ANGELES — SpaceX founder Elon Musk says the company's Starlink satellite internet service was ""told by some governments (not Ukraine) to block Russian news sources.""

""We will not do so unless at gunpoint. Sorry to be a free speech absolutist,"" Musk said in a post on Twitter.

Earlier this week, Ukraine's minister of digital transformation thanked Musk for providing equipment to Starlink.

Mykhailo Fedorov thanked SpaceX founder Elon Musk for the equipment in a Twitter post accompanied by a photo of boxes on the back of a truck. Federov had publicly requested the service.

Musk replied with his own tweet saying: ""You are most welcome.""

The tech billionaire has said Starlink was ""active"" in Ukraine and more equipment to use it was on the way.

Starlink is a satellite-based internet system that SpaceX has been building for years to bring internet access to underserved areas of the world. It markets itself as ""ideally suited"" for areas where internet service is unreliable or unavailable.

SINGAPORE — Singapore has announced sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, becoming one of the few governments in Southeast Asia to do so.

""The sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity of all countries, big and small, must be respected,"" said an announcement by the Foreign Ministry.

The tiny city-state imposed controls on exports or transshipments of military-related or dual use items considered ""strategic goods."" It said the sanctions were aimed at constraining Russia's ability to wage war and engage in ""cyber aggression.""

The regional commercial hub also said it would prohibit all financial institutions from doing business with four Russian banks: VTB Bank, Bank Rossiya, the Promsvyazbank Public Joint Stock Co., and the Corporation Bank for Development and Foreign Economic Affairs Vnesheconombank. Companies with existing dealings with the four must freeze their assets, it said.

The order also bans providing financial services or enabling financing for the Russian central bank, Russian government and entities owned or controlled by them.

Bitcoin donations to Come Back Alive Foundation

Founded in 2014, the Kyiv-based Come Back Alive Foundation is one of the largest charities in Ukraine, primarily fundraising for Ukraine’s military, to aid soldiers and volunteers with supplies, including equipment (thermographic cameras and night vision devices), drones, personal body protection and specialized software.

Co-organizer of the Invictus Games in Ukraine since 2019, Come Back Alive is a nongovernmental organization that also supports training, psychological assistance, medical help, and other projects. Its Facebook page shares stories, photos, and videos.

To contribute from abroad, the charity accepts secure money transfers, and crypto donations (Bitcoin), but the Patreon option has since been removed for violating the platform’s policies (read why here).

Similarly, Army SOS uses donated funds to support Ukrainian soldiers in various ways.

As detailed on its website and Facebook page, the Army SOS Citizen’s Initiative manages purchases of necessary ammunition, shields, intercommunication and reconnaissance facilities, uniforms and food supply.

“We deliver all goods directly to the unit’s emplacement and pass them right to the hands of our warriors,” the Army SOS website says.

Donations made to the Ukraine crisis support humanitarian work in the country.

The International Committee of the Red Cross and Ukrainian Red Cross Society support food-producing initiatives and infrastructure repair (including water-pumping stations), as well as rebuilding damaged homes, and providing aid to hospitals, schools, mental health facilities and community centers.

Money can be sent as a one-time donation or monthly contribution to the cause.

With a goal “to provide aid to the people of Ukraine, so that they may fulfill fundamental rights and freedoms,” RSU is a nonprofit whose programs are mostly focused on medical rehabilitation.

As outlined at its website and Facebook page, donations (through PayPal) assist severely injured soldiers by supporting medical help and rehabilitation; treat hospital patients wounded in conflict by supplying emergency medical aid and supplies; and satisfy housing needs to soldiers of Ukraine and their families, among other efforts.

Other Ukrainian charities

Razom for Ukraine and Sunflower of Peace are both recommended through a crowdsourced list of fundraisers and charities put together by Ukrainian journalists. Collected funds go toward purchasing and distributing first aid kits and medical supply packs to the doctors and volunteers who treat soldiers on the frontlines, and medical rehabilitation for those who are injured.

To help children affected by war, Voices of Children is a charitable foundation that provides psychological and psychosocial support to children, “to help them overcome the consequences of armed conflict,” per its website.

Donations, which can be made with a credit card or Google Pay account, go toward art therapy, psychologists to help children in boarding schools, family therapy, and more.
