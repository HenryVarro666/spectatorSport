1,2526de57-3597-4413-a769-0ae43387db32,"['Tyler Rogoway', 'Thomas Newdick']",2022-03-10 19:37:35,"When it comes to helping Ukraine continue to keep Russia from gaining air superiority over its skies — a miraculous achievement thus far in the conflict that is now in its third week — all the focus has been on providing the embattled country with a couple of dozen decades-old MiG-29 Fulcrums. This has been an unfortunate distraction. What Ukraine really needs more than anything else are ground-based air defense systems — surface-to-air missiles, or SAMs — especially the kind with medium or greater altitude engagement capabilities that are optimized for high mobility. And not just any SAM systems that fulfill the requirements, but Soviet-era systems that the Ukrainian military is fully trained on employing in combat and supporting in the field.

While providing additional fighters for Ukraine's air arm, which remains under great pressure from Russia's war machine, is one potential facet of bolstering its air defenses, it is far from the most important or convenient one. Fighters are the least of the Russian military's counter-air worries at the moment. The presence of medium to higher-tier SAM threats keeps Russia's combat aircraft from operating at medium altitudes or above, in effect pressing them right into the shoulder-fired surface-to-air missile (man-portable air defense systems or MANPADS) engagement envelope, which is roughly defined as anything under 15,000 feet. Thousands of MANPADS of different types have flooded into Ukraine and have been dispersed among troops across the country — and more are on the way. They have been brutally effective so far, but without the threat presented by more capable air defense systems, the opportunities to engage the enemy at lower altitudes will decline. In other words, the presence of one enables the other.

Highly unpredictable ground-mobile SAMs complicate the tactical threat picture even more for Russia. They are far more survivable than their less agile, largely static counterparts. They can appear out of virtually nowhere and then disappear before traditional counterattacks are possible. Leveraging radar guidance, they are also effective in any weather, day or night.

It has become abundantly clear in recent days that these more robust air defense assets remain a major issue for Russia, which you can read all about in this recent feature of ours. Regardless, according to the U.K. Ministry of Defense, a significant reduction in Russian air activity in recent days is likely due to this reason.

UK MOD

When it comes to fighters over SAMs, the U.S. government appears to have come to a similar conclusion. Speaking yesterday, John Kirby, the U.S. military’s top spokesperson, said that instead of the MiG-29s, the Ukrainian forces would benefit more from additional deliveries of ground-based air defense systems. While the Fulcrum became a signature weapon for the Ukrainian side early on in the conflict, and a rallying point for the country’s population, Kirby is right that transferring more of these jets would not necessarily have made the most sense from a military or a risk of escalation perspective. After all, while the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense has made big claims about the aerial kills achieved by its fighters, the country’s ground-based air defense systems have certainly played a far bigger role in depriving Russia of air superiority — a surprise for many analysts, who had expected Russian aerial dominance to quickly show through. They have also limited Russia's ability to supply close air support to its own troops, giving Ukraine an additional advantage.

The U.S. decision is not one made on the fly either. A specialized team was sent to Ukraine in the months leading up to the war to closely evaluate the country's air defense capabilities and its projected needs should an invasion occur. In other words, the U.S. has an intimate and up-to-date knowledge of how best to help Ukraine keep Russia's airpower at bay.

What's even stranger is that somehow, as part of the MiG transfer drama, some in the media and on Capitol Hill reimagined the utility of the decades-old MiG-29 variants in question. While these aircraft do have an austere ground attack capability, somehow they have morphed into being a pivotal air-to-ground platform capable of unilaterally wiping out massive columns of Russian heavy armor that sit under their own anti-air umbrella. This is pure fantasy that has been created by people who have no idea what the MiG-29's capabilities actually are and think it is just an analog to a late-block F-16. And even then, their understanding of what an F-16 is actually capable of would also have to be of Hollywood action film level and outright divorced from reality. So no, a MiG-29 armed with a couple of rocket pods or a few dumb bombs is not going to repulse Russia's northern advance to Kyiv. And any mission of that sort has a high probability of being a one-way trip, regardless.

Even in the air-to-air realm, the truth is the generation of MiG-29 in being discussed is at a great disadvantage against its Russian counterparts, especially as Russia learns and adapts to its own failings and further integrates A-50 radar planes and other force-multiplier capabilities into its counter-air battle plans. This era of MiG-29 is also largely airfield and ground radar dependent, some of which remain operational despite Russia's opening blows, but for how long remains a real question.

So, while ground-based air defenses are not as nearly as sexy of a topic as high-performance fighters flown by seemingly supernatural Ukrainian pilots, they are far more relevant to the pressing tactical realities facing the country today.

Once again, the major sticking point here is that Ukraine needs systems it can operate, employ successfully, and maintain in the field immediately, not western designs that will take months or even years to train on, field, and create a logistical train in a war zone to support. Hopefully, the U.S. government and its partners have learned from their abysmal mistakes in furnishing the Afghan Army with advanced western equipment it couldn't sustain on its own even after years of trying and will go another route with Ukraine.

With all this in mind, any additional and familiar air defense systems that could be supplied to Ukraine quickly so that they can continue to sustain and even broaden their successful anti-air campaign would likely have a significant effect on the course of the fighting and on the long-term fate of the country in general. The following rundown provides details of the SAM systems above the threshold of MANPADS that are currently used by the Ukrainian Armed Forces, and which would, therefore, be prime candidates to enhance their anti-air capacity in the ongoing air war.

The best candidates:

S-300P

On paper, among the most capable surface-to-air missiles in the Ukrainian inventory, at least before the outbreak of the war, is the S-300P (SA-10 Grumble), one of the earlier iterations of the Soviet-designed S-300 family of long-range SAM systems.

The earliest examples of this system that the Ukrainian military has operated are S-300PT variants, which first entered service in the late 1970s and use trailer-mounted erector launchers, radars, and command posts. Ukraine's armed forces have also fielded S-300PS systems, which were first introduced in the mid-1980s and integrated the various components onto 8x8 MAZ-7910 truck chassis for much-improved mobility.

It’s unclear how many examples of either of those systems were still in service or in storage in Ukraine before the outbreak of the current conflict, although previous assessments indicate that 250 launchers have remained in inventory.

The current organizational structure of Ukraine's S-300 units is also unknown, but a typical S-300PS battery may include three transporter erector launchers (TELs), two of which are also capable of acting as transloaders to be able to help reload each other, along with two other vehicles, one carrying a 5N63 or 30N6 Flap Lid phased array engagement radar and another configured as a mobile command post. As many as eight firing batteries, combined with other command and control nodes and radars, such as the 36D6 Tin Shield surveillance radar, comprise a single complete S-300PS system.

Though the S-300PS system can fire various different kinds of interceptors, the 5V55R missile, which features semi-active radar homing terminal guidance, is the main type available to Ukraine and has a stated maximum range of 56 miles and can hit targets at high altitudes.

The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense claims that a least some of its S-300PS systems are still operational. For instance, they reportedly contributed to the destruction of four Russian Su-25 attack aircraft and two helicopters, as well as two cruise missiles during the night of March 8/9. Some elements of these systems may have been destroyed by Russian forces, as well.

There are a number of potential sources of additional S-300s within NATO that might be available for transfer to Ukraine. Bulgaria has one complete S-300PMU system, while Slovakia inherited a single battery after the breakup of Czechoslovakia. Greece has 12 S-300PMU-1 systems, an improved version of the S-300PMU that, among other things, features an updated 30N6E radar and has the ability to fire 48N6 interceptors. The 48N6, variants of which have stated maximum ranges between 90 and 160 miles, uses a so-called track-via-missile (TVM) guidance system that blends radio command guidance with semi-active radar homing in the terminal phase of flight.

Experience with the original S-300P series could make it easier for the Ukrainian military to train personnel to operate examples of the S-300PMU. It’s not immediately clear how much additional instruction might be required for them to be able to use the PMU-1.

S-300V1

While the S-300PS was developed for the Soviet Union's Air Defense Forces, the S-300V1 (SA-12 Gladiator/Giant) is a related system that was instead tailored for use by Soviet ground forces, being carried on tracked transport-erector-launcher (TEL) vehicles, for improved cross-country mobility. Two primary types of missiles are provided as armament: the 9M83 (SA-12A Gladiator) with a maximum engagement range of around 47 miles and the 9M82 (SA-12B Giant) that can engage targets out to 62 miles. No NATO militaries use the S-300V family of systems, ruling out the possibility of transferring additional such weapons to Ukraine, which was thought to operate only a few examples of the SA-12A version prior to the Russian invasion.

S-125

The S-125 Pechora (SA-3 Goa) is a medium-altitude surface-to-air system that uses command-guided interceptors, the first version of which entered Soviet service in the early 1960s. The S-125 system evolved over time with the addition of new interceptors with improved capabilities and updated radars. In general, complete Pechora systems includes some number of truck-mounted or static launchers, along with an array of radars, including P-15 Flat Face/Squad Eye-series target acquisition types, SNR-125 ""Low Blow"" fire control models, and PRV-11 ""Side Nets"" for determinate the height at which targets are operating.

It's not clear how many Ukrainian S-125 systems were still in service when Russia's invasion began, but its examples utilize static launchers and therefore are not highly mobile. The country had previously retired its S-125s, but domestic companies continued to develop upgrades and provide support for the system, even testing an improved missile in 2018. Ukrainian troops were observed training with an S-125 system as recently as in 2020.

Within NATO, only Bulgaria and Poland still have some number of S-125 systems in active service. In both cases, these are modernized systems, with Poland having also developed new tracked launchers for the missiles and wheeled radar vehicles.

Buk-M1

The 9K37M1 Buk-M1 is an improved variant of the original 9K37 (SA-11 Gadfly) mobile medium-range SAM system developed toward the end of the Soviet era. Each of the tracked TEL vehicles carried four ready-to-fire missiles, as well as the fire control radar. The maximum engagement range of the missile is 22 miles. Apparently heavily utilized in the conflict so far by both Russian and Ukrainian forces, Ukraine entered the war with a reported 72 examples of the system available. Although not fielded by any NATO nations, the Buk system was previously operated by Finland, which has passed military materiel to Ukraine already. The Finnish examples have been in storage for some time now, but are reportedly still kept ready for possible wartime use.

The Buk's high mobility and independence of operation, as well as its ability to hit targets operating as high as 45,000 feet, make it among the most well-suited options to help Ukraine keep Russia from gaining air superiority over the country. It's also worth noting that a Russian SA-11 is what took down Malaysian Airlines flight 17 back in 2014.

9K330 Tor

The 9K330 Tor (SA-15 Gauntlet) is a highly mobile tracked short-range air defense system (SHORADS) that was originally developed as a replacement for the widely used wheeled 9K33 Osa. The system is in limited use with the Ukrainian Ground Forces, which had six of them active as of 2018 when they appeared in the Ukrainian Military Independence Day Parade, having been refurbished after several years out of service. Within NATO, Greece is the only operator of the Tor, with a reported 25 examples. As it stands, another potential option for Ukraine to increase its inventory of Tor systems might even be through the capture of Russian examples, several of which have been noted either abandoned or in Ukrainian hands.

Tor is a shorter-range air defense system that can hit targets up to around 20,000 feet. Its self-contained and highly-mobile nature makes it effective at shoot-and-scoot-like aerial ambushes.

9K33 Osa

The Cold War-era 9K33 Osa (SA-8 Gecko) is a SHORADS based on a fully amphibious six-wheeled BAZ-5937 transport vehicle. A variety of 9M33 series missiles are available for the Osa, the original variant having a range of 7.5 miles and all of which use radio command guidance. The number of these systems available to Ukraine prior to the start of hostilities is unclear, although various reports state that the particular version in use is the Osa-AKM, or SA-8B Gecko Mod-1, with 9M33M3 missiles with a maximum range of 9.3 miles and maximum altitude to of 40,000 feet. The Osa-AKM carries six missiles in box-type containers, rather than the four exposed missiles found on the original system.

Despite its age, the Osa remains effective and is in use with Bulgaria, Greece, Poland, and Romania. These nations could all potentially be willing to give up their Osa systems, especially if inventories were back-filled with more modern SHORADS systems.

Shorter-range systems that could still be useful:

9K35 Strela-10

The tracked 9K35 Strela-10 (SA-13 Gopher) was introduced in the 1970s as the successor to the wheeled 9K31 Strela-1 and fulfills the same low-level air defense role, also using a variant of the same missile used in the widespread Strela MANPADS. Unlike the Strela-1, the Strela-10 uses a more mobile, tracked MT-LB chassis. A variety of infrared-guided missiles, including the 9M37 and 9M333 families, are available and can engage targets out to a range of 3.1 miles. Prior to the start of the latest hostilities, Ukraine was thought to have at least 75 examples of the Strela-10 in service. The Strela-10 is also fairly widespread in NATO service, with examples still fielded by Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and North Macedonia, while there may still be stocks of retired systems held by both Poland and Slovakia.

9K31 Strela-1

The original highly mobile low-level air defense system fielded by the Soviet Union and provided to many of its allies was the 9K31 Strela-1 (SA-9 Gaskin), mounted on a variant of the BRDM-2 wheeled amphibious light armored vehicle and armed with two pairs of ready-to-fire infrared-guided 9M31 missiles, which have a range of around 2.6 miles. Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, and Romania are the NATO nations that still possess stocks of Strela-1 systems thought to be in frontline use, and other NATO members in Eastern Europe may still have stocks of retired Strela-1s.

2K22 Tunguska

The 2K22 Tunguska (SA-19 Grison) has been seen fairly frequently in the Ukrainian conflict, albeit mainly in Russian hands. Ukraine reportedly has around 70 of the tracked self-propelled systems, which combine 9M311 series surface-to-air missiles with twin 30mm cannons. There are no NATO operators of the system. Beyond Ukraine, Russia and Belarus are the only European countries with these systems in service, so restocking the Ukrainian Tunguska inventory looks unlikely.

These systems represent the most capable ground-based air defense assets available to the Ukrainian Armed Forces ahead of the Russian invasion, supplemented by much larger numbers of MANPADS, as well as anti-aircraft artillery.

Of course, the S-300V1 and the Tunguska are not part of the NATO inventories, so the transfer of additional examples to Ukraine may be more challenging. At the same time, however, NATO has many air defense systems that are not part of the Ukrainian inventory or have since been withdrawn from use by Ukraine. While these could potentially be reintroduced to service, hurdles may still exist in the form of finding qualified operators and maintaining them over time.

It's also worth noting that the United States does have limited stocks of pretty much all of these systems it has acquired via various means under foreign materiel exploitation (FME) programs. Today, operational versions of the S300, Tor, and other systems are used in training against allied forces during major exercises like Red Flag and for other training and developmental evolutions. In other words, the U.S. could potentially rush some of these systems to Ukraine from its own very limited stocks, but doing so would degrade a critical training capability and the Pentagon isn't always up to discussing its FME programs or capabilities. The same can be said for MiG-29s in the U.S. Department of Defense's hands, as we discussed in detail in this recent report.

Also, the question of missile availability for these systems is also relevant. While the U.S. possesses the systems themselves, they do not fire missiles in training, so stocks of actual SAMs for them are likely small if not non-existent. Still, even helping with extra parts to keep them supported in the field could be worthwhile. It's also worth noting that Ukraine itself has been a huge contributor to U.S. FME efforts, sending radars, jets, and other capabilities to the United States for study and training.

Regardless, the big question now is how fast the U.S. and its allies can gather up relevant systems and get them into Ukraine. This is a far simpler task than dealing with the MiG-29s, but the clock is ticking. With every day that goes by that this doesn't happen, Russia has more time to adapt to Ukraine's diminished capabilities and work to degrade them further. But hopefully with the fighter jet drama laid to rest, getting SAM systems that have commonality with those already in Ukrainian hands can become an objective all of NATO can focus on before it is too late.

Update, March 15: Following the publication of this article, it has come to our attention that the Buk-M1 systems previously operated by Finland, and which had been in storage for some years, have apparently now been scrapped. It seems that while there were plans to keep them in storage, the cost of maintaining them and having reserves trained to use them was ultimately judged not worth the effort.

The recent standoff between NATO and Russia over Ukraine has now escalated into a full-scale Russian invasion. To understand the significance of the Russian attack, it is important to remember that attacking Ukraine in a show of unprovoked aggression represents the Russians’ second worst outcome. Preferably, of course, NATO would have acquiesced to Russia’s demands regarding its near abroad. To achieve that outcome, Russia’s most dangerous courses of action were not those that would have rendered NATO incapable of responding to its provocations, but those that rendered it unwilling to do so. Prior to invading Ukraine on February 24, Russia tried to impose strategic paralysis within its perceived sphere of influence by convincing both political leaders and the publics they serve that they would be worse off if they resisted. Given the currently unresolved conflict, the United States, NATO, and its partners are still scrambling to devise an adequate response.

War is about one nation imposing its will on another; coercion is about one nation getting an adversary to accept its interests. To the extent the United States and NATO tried to shape conditions in Europe and avoid a war with Russia, they ultimately failed to convince Russia that invading Ukraine was not in its best interest. Changing minds depends largely on shaping the choices available to avoid conflict. Unlike war, where success depends on the destruction of enemy forces, coercion depends on balancing cooperation and confrontation to present an adversary with alternative courses of action that makes it worse off should it continue to challenge another state’s national interests.

Part of the problem, as Tami Davis Biddle points out, is that military practitioners fail to adequately distinguish between defeating enemies and coercing them. Military forces are designed to destroy enemy forces faster than that enemy can destroy friendly ones. When there are no enemy military forces to destroy, military forces may still have utility, but how to employ them is less clear. Clarity depends on recognizing that warfighting and coercion are two different kinds of activities, each with its own logic and grammar.

The Logic of Coercion: Imposing Wills versus Changing Minds

Carl von Clausewitz famously distinguished between war’s logic and its grammar, pointing out that while war shared a logic with politics, it had “a grammar of its own.” As Antulio Echevarria points out, logic is expressed in terms of imperatives, principles, or procedures that govern an activity while grammar refers to those principles, rules, or procedures that govern the use of force. Failing to align the two, Clausewitz further argues, is much like knowing enough of a language to say a few phrases but not understanding a language’s nuance and sometimes saying something unintended.

Because both war and coercion serve political ends, many assume they share a similar logic. However, there is a difference between the kinds of objectives pursued in war and the kinds pursued in competition. As political scientist Patricia Sullivan argues, “brute force” objectives and “compliance” objectives are different: in war, political and military objectives, while not identical, are closely linked and victory is achieved through brute force objectives, like the destruction of military forces or seizure of territory or resources. When the enemy’s army is destroyed, the war is won. Compliance objectives, on the other hand, are achieved by changing opponents’ minds about what is in their interests. Because compliance objectives involve changing others’ minds, the initiative belongs to those who are the target of the coercion, who gets to decide how much punishment they will bear.

Accepting another state’s interests, of course, does not entail agreement with those interests. The target nation only has to believe that opposition to its adversary’s interests is not the best alternative available. Viewed in this manner, successful coercion is not simply about imposing costs. Instead, it is about cornering an adversary into a position where it is forced to act and that its most rational option is the one that is most beneficial to the coercing state. The distinction between imposing will and accepting another’s will is important and is far from new. The Cold War scholar Thomas Schelling highlighted a similar distinction in his influential book, Arms and Influence, by pointing out the difference between brute force and coercion. As he observed, there is “a difference between taking what you want and making someone give it to you.” So rather than wielding power to destroy, coercion is about wielding power to harm.

Schelling continues by arguing that coercion comes in two forms: compellence and deterrence. Compellence is a nation’s efforts to compel an adversary to act in a specific manner while deterrence is a nation’s efforts to prevent an adversary from acting in the first place. The two terms are related and often hard to distinguish for two reasons. First, deterrence can look a lot like compellence. Threatening actors to deter any challenge to the status quo in effect compels them to accept the way things are. To the extent that the status quo works against the challenger’s interest, any deterrent action may be interpreted as provocation and therefore as an act of compellence. Second, compellent actions are often employed by a state, especially in a crisis, to enhance its deterrent posture. For example, President John F. Kennedy’s blockade of Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis had both deterrent and compellent effects. The blockade was intended to not only prevent more missiles from coming in, but also to demonstrate how seriously the US took the presence of missiles in Cuba and its demands for their removal. As Schelling argues, the difference between deterrence and compellence revolves around the timing and initiative determined by the first mover and the state whose initiative is tested.

The Grammar of Coercion: Compellence and Deterrence

Coercion, whether in the form of compellence or deterrence, depends on both a credible and capable threat. Credibility, however, depends less on reputation and much more on whether an adversary believes it would be better off by carrying out a threat than not. Capability depends less on the amount of pain states can inflict than on how much worse off adversaries believe they are should they try to inflict pain. Given these conditions, it is easy to see why NATO and Russia failed to resolve their differences over Ukraine. Stepping back in time to just before Russia initiated its invasion, NATO’s limited interest in bringing Ukraine into the alliance meant that going to war with Russia over Ukraine would likely leave NATO worse off, even if it won. Conversely, because a Russian invasion of Ukraine would not weaken the NATO alliance or make it worse off relative to conceding to Russia’s ultimatum, the Russian threat lacked capability.

Calibrating a threat so that it is both credible and capable, and therefore effective, requires a better understanding of how compellence and deterrence work.

Compellence

In adversarial competition, compellence typically begins when one actor demands something from another and threatens a punishment if its demands are not met. Interactions are zero-sum, in that a gain for the compeller represents a loss for the target and vice versa. Ultimately, compellers make a demand and the target must respond or suffer some consequence.

As political scientist Todd S. Sechser points out, it intuitively follows that the state with a military advantage should also have a compellence advantage. Coercive success is a function of the value of the demand, the probability the coercer would win if the interaction resulted in conflict, and the cost to either actor for engaging in military conflict. Therefore, in a situation where both actors value an interest equally, the more capable actor who is better able to absorb the cost of conflict should, in theory, succeed. However, the Militarized Compellent Threats data set, which contains 210 distinct cases of compellent threats from 1918 to 2001, shows that while 85 percent of threats surveyed were made by a major power to a minor power, full compliance was achieved in only eighty-seven cases, for a success rate of 41.4 percent.

Counterintuitive results appear most when future iterations of conflict are possible. Coercive success generally depends on accurately calibrating one’s demands: high demands are more likely to be rejected and low demands may not be adequate to realize one’s goals. Iterative engagements offer the stronger coercer the opportunity to assess the weaker state’s sensitivity to the human and financial costs of war. They can perform this assessment by means of separating strategies designed to differentiate sensitive from insensitive opponents. Such separating strategies requires the coercer to calibrate the demand so that strong actors reject the demand while weak actors concede. While doing so encourages coercers to open with higher demands, and thus risk a greater chance for failure, it can lead to bigger payoffs in subsequent rounds. Moreover, very strong actors may be incentivized to take bigger risks since they can better afford failure.

While high demands may reveal something about an adversary, they can incentivize weaker actors to be more resistant to conceding, even if it were rational to do so in the current round. Given a capable threat it is always rational to concede in a single-iteration interaction. However, in what Robert J. Art and Kelly M. Greenhill call the “capability-intention dilemma,” capability can be undermined if the target believes its adversary will continue to make demands. In fact, weaker actors are incentivized to resist up front to cause stronger coercers to moderate their demands. This dynamic can significantly increase the perceived cost of cooperation, making it less likely the target of coercion will concede.

Deterrence

Deterrence, as previously discussed, depends on the ability to signal a capable, credible threat. Classical models of deterrence, like Schelling’s, treat actors as if they were undifferentiated, where both seek to deter the other. However, sometimes actors are differentiated by their preference for the status quo. In these interactions, one actor defends the status quo while another challenges it. In the case of Ukraine, arguably Russia challenged the status quo relative to NATO and took actions to deter stronger political and economic ties between Ukraine and Western Europe and to degrade NATO’s relationships with Eastern European states, which would make them more susceptible to Russian pressure. In these cases, deterrence is “unilateral” in that only one side employs a deterrent strategy.

The differentiation between challenger and defender entails differentiation in preferences. Unlike classical deterrence, where escalation is the worst outcome for both actors, in unilateral deterrence that is only true for the defending actor. The status quo challenger, almost by definition, will prefer escalation to the status quo. Otherwise, there is no reason to pose a challenge. To prevent a challenge, the status quo defender has two options: it can either impose costs high enough that a challenge is more costly than the status quo or increase the challenger’s satisfaction with the status quo to devalue the challenge.

The first option is relatively straightforward but is not always possible and can be less rational than the second option. For example, NATO could have threatened to deploy military forces to defend Ukraine against a Russian invasion. However, it is not clear that, given the cost of war, doing so would be worth it. Moreover, strong rhetoric is unlikely to help. For deterrence to be effective, adversaries must believe not only that they are better off by employing the deterrent threat than conceding, but also that they are worse off if their opponent deploys that threat.

Fortunately, there are nonmilitary ways to make an adversary worse off. As Frank C. Zagare points out, even if challengers prefer the status quo to escalation, they may still challenge if they believe defenders’ worst outcome is war. Preferring the status quo to escalation, however, is not the same as being satisfied with the current balance of power. There is a threshold, and a challenger’s satisfaction with the status quo may be high enough that the cost of posing a challenge is not worth any perceived benefit. Simply put, challengers do not have to like the status quo, they just need to prefer it to the alternatives.

Accordingly, increasing an adversary’s satisfaction with the status quo can be an effective deterrent strategy. For example, in 2016, Jin Canrong, a close advisor to Chinese President Xi Jinping, detailed a strategy that intertwined US and Chinese interests and also established a set of alternatives to the global presence of the United States, like the Belt and Road Initiative, to eventually displace US influence, regionally and globally. By cooperating with the United States on some interests and challenging it on others, China is in a better power position than it could have been if did not cooperate at all.

However, cooperation for its own sake does not ensure deterrence success. For example, the United States recently dropped its objections to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which it had previously opposed because it would likely make Europe more dependent on Russian natural gas and increase Russian leverage in Europe. Now that tensions have escalated into conflict, it is clear that the cooperative measure had little effect and Germany has once again stopped its construction to impose costs on Russia.

Therefore, increasing an adversary’s satisfaction with the status quo can often come at a cost and can be ineffective, if not self-defeating. Rather, it makes more sense to establish a quid pro quo where any concession is conditioned on measures an adversary must also take to make deterrence success more likely. For example, dropping objections to the Nord Stream 2 project in exchange for limits on the numbers or types of Russian troops in Belarus and along the Ukrainian border may have made an invasion less likely since Russia would have had to further mobilize to bring its force levels to the point that an invasion would be successful. Any additional requirement to mobilize would have bought NATO additional time to respond. Knowing that NATO would have time to respond—thus potentially increasing Russia’s costs—could have further disincentivized an invasion in the first place.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine can be seen as a failure to coerce on the parts of both NATO and Russia. While NATO clearly failed to deter the invasion, Russia failed to compel either NATO countries or Ukraine to limit their ties with one another. Given Russia’s interest in Ukraine is arguably much higher than NATO’s, deterrence likely had little chance. However, Russia arguably made a mistake in its December 17, 2021 ultimatum, in which it essentially demanded NATO accept a Russian sphere of influence in Eastern Europe, including over NATO members. By doing so, Russia not only raised the stakes, giving NATO more reason to resist, but also foreshadowed future iterations, making it more rational for NATO to bear higher costs and take greater risks than the alliance was previously willing. Resolving this impasse requires both sides to do more than simply impose costs. Either must calibrate its demands given the potential for cooperation, resistance, or defection present in the adversarial relationship. Otherwise, both sides only have escalation or concession as ways forward.

These, then, are important rules of thumb that guide adversarial interactions. Even if one side is significantly stronger, it should not make excessive demands unless it seeks to better understand an adversary’s preferences and is prepared to accept failure, at least at first. In interactions that iterate, minimizing adversaries’ fears that more demands may be forthcoming diminishes the likelihood that those adversaries will perceive their costs of concession to be increasing. To prevent challenges in the first place, it is important for an actor to convince adversaries that acting on an issued threat is its most rational response. If that is not possible, then it becomes important to find ways to decrease the value of the adversary’s challenge in the first place. Of course, there are likely times when none of those options are possible. However, knowing that enables better preparation for the inevitable conflict to come.

Ukrainians will not give up, even though there will be some kind of ceasefire and partition ahead. The invasion was no different than the ones in Georgia and Chechnya, with Putin still trying to reinstate some Russian pre-USSR imperial vision in reacquired territory. There will be domestic repercussions from this war. 4,000 Russian troops have now perished. 10,000 Russian antiwar protesters have been arrested.

Even Putin’s designated Russian puppet who had hoped that the victory would have been swift, is trying to convince Zelensky to surrender. Yanukovych is now in Minsk no differently than Trump in Mar-a-Lago, impatiently waiting to be ‘reinstated’. “A bilateral negotiation process with Ukraine could nullify Russia’s thesis that this conflict is internal to Ukraine and Russia’s claim of mediating role.” The 11 October open letter from Medvedev which more likely was from Putin, reveals the consistently dictatorial view of Ukraine’s sovereignty made complicated by not having Trump as POTUS.

⚡️Yanukovych addresses Zelensky, urges him to stop fighting. Ex-President Viktor Yanukovych, who lives in Russia since being ousted in 2014, asks Zelensky to “overcome his pride” and stop the war at any cost. Yanukovych’s letter to Zelensky was published by the Russian media.

x Russian progress in the north to take Kyiv is stalled, while President Vladimir Putin's forces in the south are making some progress, a senior defense official said on background. Learn more at https://t.co/2lyDxWSr54. — Department of Defense 🇺🇸 (@DeptofDefense) March 8, 2022

With almost all the Russian forces that amassed on Ukraine's borders now within the country, the wave of Russian invaders continues to crash on the rocks of Ukrainian resistance, said a senior defense official speaking on background.

Overall, Russian progress in the north to take Kyiv is stalled, while President Vladimir Putin's forces in the south are making some progress, the official said.

""Near Kyiv, we still observe that Russian forces have not moved closer to the city center,"" the official said. ""The closest they've been able to get is the airport.""

Russian forces are trying to attack Kyiv from the east. ""We estimate that they're about 60 kilometers or so from the city,"" the official said. ""So they're still further away than the main advance coming down on the north.""

In the south, Mariupol is ""isolated"" but still fighting, and the official said it appears the Russians are looking to attack the port city of Odesa from the landward side. This could be joined by an amphibious attack as the Russians have 11 amphibious ships in the region.

The official said it does not appear that Putin is ordering in troops or capabilities from other parts of Russia for the invasion. He noted that the Russians have a lot of combat power in Ukraine. The Russian troops invading Ukraine are afflicted by poor morale, and logistics and sustainment problems. He said the Russians did not expect the ferocious defense by the Ukrainian military and Ukrainian civilians. Ten days into the invasion, the Russian forces appear to be behind their timetable for conquest.

Russian long-range artillery and missiles (they have now fired nearly 670 missiles into Ukraine) are regularly hitting civilian areas, the official said. The United Nations now estimates 1.4 million Ukrainians have fled the country with many thousands more internally displaced.

x CIA Dir. William Burns said Russian Pres. Vladimir Putin went to war with Ukraine based on a 'number of assumptions which led him to believe … Russia faced a favorable landscape,' but Putin’s assessment was 'profoundly flawed' — here’s why pic.twitter.com/Uub7mUPOkO — NowThis (@nowthisnews) March 9, 2022

Poland said on Tuesday evening that it is willing to hand over its fleet of 28 MiG 29s to the US – which is in turn expected to pass them on to the Ukrainian air force. Poland is also expecting the US to supply it with more advanced F-16s to fill the gap.

[...]

If what is left of Ukraine’s air force were to sustain further losses it would soon reach the point where it is unable to defend itself from attack in the skies. A new fleet of aircraft would ensure the airspace above Ukraine remains contested at least for a time, and would make Russia think twice about airstrikes on Kyiv.

But the main problem faced by Ukraine’s armed forces at present, is Russia’s preponderance in artillery. Russia has been shelling cities such as Kharkiv and Mariupol for several days in an attempt to force their surrender.

Ukraine could try to use its planes to strike enemy convoys from the air, but that would be fraught with risk as Russia is thought to have brought air defence systems closer to the frontline in the past few days.

x Today's Ukraine thread begins w/ a story: A U.S. general assessed today that 2,000 to 4,000 Russian soldiers have died since the invasion of Ukraine began.



That came up a bit later during background briefing w/ a senior U.S. defense official.



Takeaways:https://t.co/g9HowbM1Cy — Dan Lamothe (@DanLamothe) March 8, 2022

The number is based on imperfect information, prompting Lt. Gen. Berrier, the director at DIA, to say he has ""low confidence"" in the number. Still, it's the best estimate the U.S. appears to have.

The senior U.S. defense official said Berrier did ""the best he could"" to answer.

In today's Pentagon briefing, many details sound reasonably stagnant. Bombardments continue. The convoy north of Kyiv is still stalled beginning at Hostomel airport. And the Russians continue to have a bit more success in southern Ukraine.

As of today, ""nearly 670"" missiles have been launched at Ukraine by Russia since the invasion began Feb. 26, the senior U.S. defense official said. That number has risen by a few dozen per day for a while now.

Notably: The senior defense official noted the advance of Russian forces northeast of Kyiv. They've been pushing west from the area around Sumy, as Russia seeks to encircle the capital. As of today, they are about 37 miles east of Kyiv, the official said.

No appreciable change in combat power Russia has put in the fight. They are still at ""nearly 100 percent"" of the combat forces they had arrayed at the border before the invasion began, senior U.S. defense official says. No sign they are bringing in reinforcements, he adds.

Russian combat power is still ""largely intact,"" senior defense official says. Ukraine's too.

Rough breakdown of Russia's 670-missile barrage so far:



- Almost half fired from Russia

- About 70 from Belarus

- Handful from Black Sea

- The rest from inside Ukraine

Senior defense official says airspace is still contested. But he notes that Russia can reach just about anywhere over Ukraine with surface-to-air missiles. That, of course, is important in any conversation about a no-fly zone being established.

Russia shelled a major gas pipeline in eastern Ukraine yesterday, the senior defense official said. As a result, many in eastern Ukraine are now without gas.

Russians are ""stuck"" outside Chernihiv without making progress there, senior U.S. defense official says.

In contrast, Mariupol is now isolated, the Pentagon assesses.

""Iterative discussions"" are ongoing with allies and partners are underway to supply Ukraine what it needs, senior defense official says. But no changes on the discussion about sending jets to Ukraine.

On humanitarian corridors, the senior defense official says that it is ""disingenuous"" to say anything heading toward Belarus or Russia counts. Hope is for more that are honored by Russia in the future.

In the hearing with Lt. Gen. Berrier, he forecast greater challenges for Kyiv this month, as Russia attempts to cut food and water supplies.

The situation, he said, ""will become somewhat desperate in 10 days to two weeks.""

The senior U.S. defense official said that when it comes to humanitarian corridors, ""the Russians have not proven to be reliable.""



""Whether the two sides are able to continue to work out these kinds of agreements, we can't know for sure,"" the official said.

x Also, Grozev cites a source who claims that Putin was “enraged” to learn that Russia fired particularly expensive missiles at Vinnytsia Airport. He’s a cheapskate even when invading a neighbor! — Kevin Rothrock (@KevinRothrock) March 9, 2022

As Mark Milley tells the story conveyed by his map, the Russian leader began a war that he will have great difficulty completing — and any attempt to expand it will summon a devastating response.

Maps are the most basic tools of military strategy. They allow commanders to chart a course through the fog of war; they organize the chaos of the battlefield. Milley huddling with his staff around his battle plan of the Ukraine theater conjures similar scenes through history, as generals from George Washington to Dwight D. Eisenhower leaned over maps to study the enemy’s formation and plot strategy.

Milley ordered aides to begin assembling the map in late October, when startling intelligence reports signaled that Russia was gathering an invasion army on Ukraine’s border. The Russian forces were no exercise; intercepted messages showed that Russia was actually planning an attack. Milley took the first versions of his map to the White House in late October, “to paint the picture for the NSC and the president,” one defense official said. The chairman would bring five or six copies of the map, Ukraine in green, and leave them with top officials. Biden quickly concluded that Russia’s assault planning was for real — and that America needed to lead an effort to stop it. Biden then did something unprecedented. He decided to share much of the top-secret intelligence with NATO allies — and then, increasingly, with the public through leaks to the press. On the eve of Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion, Biden ordered Milley and Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines to brief Congress on what the map showed — and then to give the same briefing, on “deep background,” to the Pentagon press corps. This was a declassified version of code-word intelligence, drawn from communications intercepts, surveillance satellites and spies on the ground. America’s best weapon against Putin, Biden decided, was the truth. The administration had found a way to weaponize intelligence. www.washingtonpost.com/...

I asked how his spirits were holding up. Answer: ""Now is not the time for crying; now is the time for laughing.""

He meant at Russia's military performance and its enormous losses in manpower and firepower in the field.

""They have lost far more than they expected. That is why they started peace negotiations on the second day of the war.""

""Yesterday, they lost 30 helicopters in the vicinity of Kherson where our marines destroyed them. The government announced this. Frankly speaking, it's true.""

""There was also some evidence for the loss of two aircraft in the airspace around Kyiv.""

""Our mood: Everything is OK. We are defending our soil, our Motherland. We have nothing to lose. They are conquerors. They are the fascists. And we will win. I have no doubt.""

I asked about all the Russian deserters abandoning their undamaged tanks, BTRs, air defense systems. Where did they go and where are they now?

""They fled into the woods. Sometimes they're marodyory [looters, marauders]. Even according to our interceptions we can determine many are robbing civilian houses and occupying them.""

""We also have evidence that even when the Russians occupy villages and towns they face resistance. In Kyiv they will meet extremely tough Territorial Defense.""

He also confirmed the majority of Ukraine's Air Force is still intact, on Day 12, including fixed wing and rotary aircraft. I asked how many operational Bayraktar TB2 drones Ukraine has in its arsenal. He laughed. ""OK, Michael, can I just say: 'It's enough.'"" // END

ISTANBUL — When President Vladimir V. Putin launched his invasion two weeks ago, he said a primary goal was the “denazification” of Ukraine. He referred to the Ukrainian government as a “gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis,” making it clear that his aim was to topple it.

But in recent days, the language has shifted, with the Kremlin signaling that Mr. Putin is no longer bent on regime change in Kyiv. It is a subtle shift, and it may be a head-fake; but it is prompting officials who have scrambled to mediate to believe that Mr. Putin may be seeking a negotiated way out of a war that has become a much bloodier slog than he expected.

On Thursday, Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov of Russia is expected to meet his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, in Turkey, in the highest-level talks between the two countries since the war began on Feb. 24. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, whose top diplomat has held a total of 10 calls with Mr. Lavrov and Mr. Kuleba since the start of the war, said on Wednesday that the meeting could “crack the door open to a permanent cease-fire.” Leading up to the meeting, both sides have softened their public positions, though they remain far apart. Russia has narrowed its demands to focus on Ukrainian “neutrality” and the status of its Russian-occupied regions, and declared on Wednesday that Russia was not seeking to “overthrow” Ukraine’s government. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine on Tuesday suggested he was open to revising Ukraine’s constitutionally enshrined aspiration to join NATO, and even to a compromise over the status of Ukrainian territory now controlled by Russia.

“The changes are noticeable,” Ivan Timofeev, the director of programs at the government-funded Russian International Affairs Council, said of the evolution in Russia’s negotiating position. “This position has become more realistic.” The Kremlin’s position now, according to comments this week by its spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, is that Ukraine must recognize Russian sovereignty over Crimea and the independence of the Russian-backed, separatist “people’s republics” in the country’s east and enshrine a status of neutrality in its constitution. That is still far from what Mr. Zelensky has said he would be willing to accept — and it could also puncture Mr. Putin’s strongman image at home, opening him up to criticism that he waged an enormous war for limited gain. www.nytimes.com/...

""The situation today is disconcertingly similar to that at the outset of World War II. Russian President Vladimir Putin now speaks of Ukraine as an artificial state and nation. In 1938 and 1939, Adolf Hitler spoke in just the same way about Germany’s neighbors. Putin prepared the way for his invasion with a litany of imaginary atrocities supposedly suffered by compatriots across the border. Hitler was the pioneer of atrocity talk as a pretext to aggression. He used such lies to absorb Austria, destroy Czechoslovakia, and invade Poland,"" Tim Snyder wrote.

""EU heads of state and government will meet Thursday in Versailles, France. There, they have a chance to do something historic: to honor Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s request and offer Ukraine EU membership negotiations. This would renew the essential tradition of integration as the answer to war in a way that speaks to present circumstances. Such a promise would offer Ukrainians a brighter future, a sense of meaning to their sacrifice and suffering now.

Major takeaways from a couple of Pentagon briefings: — Dan Lamothe (@DanLamothe) March 10, 2022

In a morning background briefing, a senior U.S. defense official said the Pentagon now assesses that Russia is using ""dumb bombs."" It marks another example of how they're indiscriminately attacking people in Ukraine.

Right on cue, the images of today's hospital bombing in Mariupol flashed. The senior defense official said they did not yet have an assessment.

The Russians have made some progress toward Kharkiv, the senior U.S. defense official said. ""They gained about 20 kilometers over the last 24 hours in terms of proximity.""

The situation around Kyiv was the same today. Russians are still stalled near the airport north of the city. Other Russians are attempting to advance from other directions. The city still holds.

Russians are making some progress near the southern city of Mykolaiv, too, the senior U.S. defense official said.

""We estimate that they're about 15 kilometers away, but to the north of Mykolaiv, and they have increased their shelling of the city,"" he added.

As of Wednesday, the Russians had launched 710 missiles at Ukraine since the start of the invasion two weeks ago. That number continues to climb by a few dozen per day.

Patriot missile batteries have been repositioned in Poland, the senior defense official said. That move was announced Tuesday night, so done deal there. The units are designed to shoot down incoming ballistic missiles.

Rather, the Pentagon maintains that supplying Ukraine with ground-based air defense systems, such as surface-to-air missiles, has proved effective at weakening Russian forces, including its air capabilities. The United States is evaluating how to provide Ukraine with more of those types of weapons rather than the aircraft its leaders have asked for.

The United States already has shipped Ukraine a number of Stinger antiaircraft missiles and Javelin antitank missiles, alongside shotguns and other materials useful for fighting in urban areas, as The Washington Post first reported last week.

Russian forces continue to close in on key population centers.

Nor do those armed Ukrainian numbers include the six annual conscript classes that filled up that 250,000 man army in the eight years of fighting in the Donbas.

With the world worried about the risk of nuclear escalation between Russia and the West, now might also be a good time to worry about the risk of cyber conflict escalating to war as well.

In recent years, a number of scholars and practitioners have argued that cyber conflict should be seen as an intelligence battle or pressure-release valve rather than something that could escalate into actual conflict or war. Indeed, to date, no state has responded to a rival’s cyber attack with a kinetic reprisal. But that does not mean it will not happen now. As geopolitical circumstances change, the escalatory potential of cyber capabilities is likely to change as well.

Moscow, for example, might respond to Western sanctions with intensified cyber attacks. Or Western leaders, recognizing that no-fly zones are too risky, might approve cyber interventions to prevent civilian massacres instead. In either case, they could well assume this escalation would not meet with a direct military response. And in either case, they could be wrong.

Minimizing this risk requires both recognizing and respecting the latent but strong escalatory potential of cyber attacks. It also involves delving deeper into the psychology of the situation, as escalation will be driven as much by the perceptions and misperceptions of the participants as any technical aspects of cyber warfare.

The Great News

So far, cyber attacks have not proven particularly escalatory or effective on the battlefield. Even the most provocative incidents that came closest to resembling kinetic attacks, such as Stuxnet or the ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline, have not led to particularly menacing crises, much less war. If anything, over the past decade cyber capabilities have helped de-escalate crises, acting as a “non-kinetic option for leaders who feel pressure to act in a crisis, but who are wary of using force.”

The U.S. conflict with Iran offers a clear example. After Iran attacked several oil tankers and downed a U.S. drone in June 2019, President Donald Trump canceled punitive U.S. airstrikes at the last minute out of concern that the casualties could prompt further escalation. However, he allowed nonlethal cyber disruption of Iranian computer systems, anticipating Iran would not respond violently. Indeed, Iran’s supreme leader “blocked any large, direct retaliation,” limiting the country’s response to the cyber realm.

Scholars have offered different explanations for the non-escalatory nature of these attacks. Cyber effects are “uncertain and often relatively limited” and “offer great powers escalatory offramps [and] signaling mechanisms” to de-escalate. In the “cyber strategic competitive space short of armed conflict,” states have “tacitly agreed on lower and upper bounds” and accordingly “have mutual interests in avoiding escalation to violent conflict.” Cyber conflict also has characteristics of an intelligence, not military, contest.

The Bad News

Cyber conflicts have flourished during a relatively peaceful time when major powers generally did not invade one another. Perhaps cyber capabilities acted as a pressure release simply because in the post-Cold War period states usually wanted to de-escalate and the geopolitical stakes were not that high anyway? What happens now when Moscow feels that the stakes are much higher?

Already there have been warnings that if Russian forces face further setbacks, Putin may lash out in desperate and ultimately self-harming ways. A major cyber power has never faced such a crisis before, so past performance may be a limited indicator of future potential. In fact, the very perception that cyber attacks are non-escalatory might itself increase the risk of unintended escalation.

There are multiple ways cyber conflict around the Ukrainian invasion might escalate into a direct conflict between Russia and NATO, possibly as a result of either side’s offensives.

First, Russian offensive cyber operations might spark a wider war. President Vladimir Putin has declared sanctions “are akin to a declaration of war” and may see aggressive cyber attacks as the perfect response, particularly since they are reversible and non-lethal. Russia has been entangled with Western economies for decades, especially in the realms of energy and finance. But now, as ties are being severed quickly and viciously, Russia no longer has to fear the backlash if its cyber forces were to disrupt Western banks or liquified natural gas terminals. If you are dealt out of the game, why not just flip the table?

Russia’s cyber generals may be just as enthusiastic as their Army counterparts. They may assure Putin their forces are ready for battle and can quickly and bloodlessly get the West to back down. Putin could be convinced disruptive attacks against the West are no big deal, a low-cost signal that the West should de-escalate or just the next natural move in a non-escalatory intelligence contest. After all, U.S. research found that in response to cyber attacks, “Americans are less likely to support retaliation with force” compared to a more traditional strike.

This can lead to escalation in two ways. The United States — along with countries like the United Kingdom, France, and the Netherlands — might well decide to defend forward against such attacks. Gen. Paul Nakasone, the commander of U.S. Cyber Command, has insisted his forces “must take this fight to the enemy, just as we do in other aspects of conflict.” His then-deputy has also argued that the United States “cannot cede any territory” to adversaries as the “Russians will keep pushing until we push back on them.”

Worse, Dmitri Alperovitch recently warned that if Russia launches cyber attacks after “[h]aving already exhausted the power of economic sanctions, America and its European allies would have few choices other than to respond to these attacks with offensive cyber-strikes of their own.” Such dynamics can feed a spiraling escalation in cyberspace that might take on a life outside of the control of policymakers.

Second, Western offensive cyber operations might spark war. U.S. cyber espionage and operations against Putin, his cronies, or Russia’s military forces will appear far more ominous to Putin if he believes they are aimed at regime change. Could Putin turn the other cheek if the United States were to electronically raid the cryptocurrency wallets of Russia’s sanctions-avoiding kleptocrats? He might feel the need to escalate his own cyber operations as part of his own version of defending forward.

Escalation could happen on the battlefield as well. According to the New York Times, teams from U.S. Cyber Command are “in place to interfere with Russia’s digital attacks and communications.” Other teams are almost certainly collecting digital intelligence on the location and intent of Russian combat forces. The United States is sharing such intelligence with the Ukrainians but apparently not yet providing any real-time targeting. That may change soon, as the United States seeks to alleviate intensifying attacks on civilians. And with his KGB-bred paranoia, Putin might already see the presence of U.S. defensive and intelligence teams operating on or against Russian military networks as evidence of direct U.S. involvement in the war. Confirming his apparent belief that Ukraine is just a NATO puppet, this might force a response, either inside or outside of cyberspace.

Further, if Western governments have infiltrated Russia’s operational military networks, they may feel pressure to disrupt those networks to prevent civilian massacres. Because cyber capabilities are billed as non-lethal, reversible, and non-escalatory, tub-thumping newspapers may push decision-makers to take shots they might not otherwise: “We can’t create a no-fly zone but can use cyber capabilities to prevent civilian harm.” Some well-meaning national leaders may succumb to this pressure, potentially causing a larger conflict.

Future Risks

Even if Russia and the West avoid direct conflict this time, they might not be so lucky the next. As relations worsen, future disruption of critical Western infrastructure by Russian intelligence, such as the NotPetya and Olympic Destroyer attacks, are less likely to be viewed as mere crimes. Repeated crises bordering on war may further erode the tacit agreements and relative restraint of quieter times. After repeated iterations of intensifying cyber operations, both Russia and the West may feel their backs to the wall with few options left other than military force when the next crisis — physical or cyber — emerges. Under extreme conditions, some of the same characteristics that lead cyber capabilities to be a pressure release might have the opposite effect, a mechanism that Bob Jervis and I have described as the Escalation Inversion.

If Putin believes a direct conflict with NATO is likely and expects its adversaries to take measures to reduce vulnerabilities, he could conclude that the best possibility for success is to launch a massive preemptive cyber attack. Since the U.S. military may seem otherwise unbeatable, this may lead Russia to “compensate with audacity in order to redress the balance.” The more the United States brags about its overwhelming offensive cyber advantage, but frets over weak defenses, the more any adversary might feel the need to target the United States as early and as hard as possible.

If Russia fears war with the United States may happen on Saturday, it might feel the need to get in its cyber punches on Friday. If the United States thinks the same, it may need to start on Thursday. Cyber capabilities may be to World War III as mobilization timelines were to World War I.

Since a cyber sucker punch may also seem less escalatory, adversaries could be tempted to take risks they would not otherwise. In this situation, the sense that cyber is a pressure-release valve becomes positively dangerous: If the system is seen to be stable, then there is less reason to act with restraint, thereby making it less stable. Fortunately, the good news is leading U.S. policymakers appear attuned to this risk.

Avoiding Escalation

How can Washington reduce the risk of cyber attacks escalating into a direct conflict with Russia? First, by recognizing it. Cyber conflict may be an intelligence contest or a pressure release in peacetime and something quite different during or after a major war in Europe. Cyber war may be far easier to stumble into when states fear the wolf at their door.

Second, escalation control requires a better understanding of political psychology — specifically the mindset and desperation of one inscrutable, increasingly isolated, and blood-covered tyrant. There were more than enough expert commentators who believed that Putin would never invade Ukraine because it objectively seemed so irrational. Assessments of cyber escalation must also cover seeming irrationality, including the misperceptions, mistakes, and miscalculations that can lead even the most rational leaders to get caught up in an escalatory spiral that is no longer under their control.

Third, preventing escalation requires military and intelligence leaders to understand and respect cyber capabilities. Cyber capabilities are not “magic invisible weapons” but rather real weapons with massive, cascading consequences. They have a range of advantages and restrictions that sober-minded national leaders should approach as they would any other weapon.

Finally, even if we dodge a bullet this time, we should not become complacent. Personally, I would put the chances of cyber conflict escalating into a Russia–NATO war at less than 10 percent. With luck, escalation will not happen, and I will be written off as a “cyber catastrophist.” “Cyber doesn’t work like that,” we will tell ourselves. “Remember the lessons of the Ukrainian cyber non-war. Cyber doesn’t escalate. It isn’t useful on the battlefield or for coercing other states.”

This will hopefully continue to be true for weeks or even years. But the world is in the first few decades of an information age that will continue for a long time. The existential stakes of cyber conflict rise as more countries become more digitized and more reliant on vulnerable information technology.

It also raises questions about how far European countries are prepared to escalate militarily before they believe they will touch a dangerous Russian tripwire.

The US and Europe have worked hard to keep their differences over sanctions and oil embargos to a public minimum, and tried to accommodate each other’s national interests. So it was striking on Tuesday when first the Pentagon described a Polish offer to send planes to the US airbase in Ramstein as “untenable”, and then the deputy US secretary of state said the US had not been consulted about the plan.

Part of the problem was that the Polish proposal was subtly but critically different to a scheme that had previously been discussed in private. Against the backdrop of highly charged diplomatic tensions, presentation matters.

In essence, Poland said it would cooperate in strengthening the Ukrainian air force so long as this would be seen in Moscow as a US, Nato or EU scheme but not a Polish one.

In its original, US-conceived iteration, the proposal was a trilateral deal whereby Poland would hand over the MiGs to Ukrainian pilots to fly into their homeland, and the US would then provide some substitute planes. Boris Johnson, an enthusiast, described the plan as “rent a MiG”.

That proposal, arguably, was not qualitatively different to Nato members providing Ukraine with Javelin anti-tank missiles. In return, Poland would eventually fill the hole in its air force with 28 F-16s being provided by the US.

But under private pressure from the US, Poland felt the plan unduly exposed its citizens to Putin’s ire. So instead, in a game of diplomatic pass the parcel, Poland tweaked the proposals so the planes would be sent free of charge to the US airbase in Ramstein, Germany, rather than being flown out of Poland into Ukraine. The move would literally take Poland out of the line of Russia’s fire since the plan could be labelled as that of the US, Nato or the EU.

Poland also suggested other frontline Nato countries with MiG planes should match its plan, a proposal directed at Slovakia and Romania. If executed it would mean Ukraine had 70 extra planes at its disposal.

The Pentagon’s response – “it is simply not clear to us that there is a tangible justification for this” – was swift. Passing the parcel back, it said any decision to hand over planes ultimately rested with the Polish government, although it did not kill off the proposal altogether.

It is possible that Poland’s nationalist government launched its plan with the aim of relieving pressure from the US Congress and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, knowing full well it would be rejected.

Either way the public spat is a setback. Over the weekend the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, had said a plan involving planes was under active consideration.

The upshot after this mini-debacle is Russia retains air superiority. Ukrainian pilots who were being trained in Poland to fly the planes are now grounded with no machines with which to defend their country. An opportunity has been squandered.

The episode may have lessons for both sides. The possibility of making the MiG-29s available first appeared publicly on 27 February, when the EU made the unprecedented decision to provide military aid to a country outside the bloc. The first tranche of equipment for Ukraine is expected to amount to €500m (£417m), but up to €5bn is to be spent under the European Peace Initiative.

It was then that the head of EU diplomacy, Josep Borrell, said that aid for Kyiv would also include offensive weapons, including planes. At that point it became clear that the planes would only be MIG-29 and Su-25, because Ukrainian pilots only have experience with these machines. Poland, it would seem, did not appreciate the issue being disclosed.

However, the country has emerged strengthened in another way from the past 24 hours. The US has provided Poland with two Patriot defence missile batteries. Each battery consists of two firing platoons with two launchers. This means there will be 16 launchers in Poland. They can have either four or six missiles. The latest Pac-3 MSE missiles are capable of shooting down the Russian Iskander ballistic and manoeuvring missiles.

Unfortunately, they are also the anti-aircraft defence that Ukraine lacks. Nato, as its constitution requires, looks after its own.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/09/clash-over-poland-and-us-missile-plans-reveals-tensions-in-escalating-war
