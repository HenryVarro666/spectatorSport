Why it matters: Vladimir Putin has a history of deploying illegal nerve agents against enemies, including Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny and former double agent Sergei Skripal. In Syria, Russia helped Bashar al-Assad cover up the use of chemical weapons against his own people.

What's happening: Kremlin propagandists have been frenetically spreading baseless claims that the Pentagon is funding dangerous bioweapons labs in Ukraine.

Chinese diplomats and state-controlled media have joined in on the conspiracy theories, raising fears about a level of coordination between the two powers not seen during the conflict thus far.

Reality check: The U.S. and Ukraine have vigorously denied the presence of any U.S.-backed bioweapons program, saying the only labs the U.S. supports in Ukraine are standard research facilities that focus on ""diagnostics, therapeutics, treatment prevention and vaccines.""

The Biden administration has issued statements calling the Russian claims ""preposterous"" and ""total nonsense,"" and urging the world to ""be on the lookout"" for Russia to use chemical weapons itself or attempt a ""false flag"" operation in Ukraine.

""Allegedly, we are preparing a chemical attack,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a new video address. ""This makes me really worried because we've been repeatedly convinced: If you want to know Russia's plans, look at what Russia accuses others of.""

Zoom out: ""I am the President of an adequate country, an adequate nation. And the father of two children. And no chemical or any other weapons of mass destruction were developed on my land,"" an exhausted-looking Zelensky pleaded.

""The whole world knows that.""

Between the lines: The U.S. has repeatedly sought to debunk Russia's narratives about Ukraine by declassifying intelligence about Putin's plans ahead of time, a novel approach that undermines his element of surprise.",https://www.axios.com/russia-propaganda-chemical-weapons-37e3c832-d458-433d-909a-5ecfabfb4b53.html

Then Chinese diplomats and state media organizations repeated the conspiracy theory at news conferences in Beijing, in articles and on official social media accounts.

Now, the Biden White House has taken the extraordinary step of calling out both countries on their coordinated propaganda campaign and saying they might be providing cover for a potential biological or chemical weapons attack on Ukrainians by the Russian military.

“Now that Russia has made these false claims, and China has seemingly endorsed this propaganda, we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them,” Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, wrote on Twitter on Wednesday evening. “It’s a clear pattern.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/10/us/politics/russia-ukraine-china-bioweapons.html

Russia accused the United States at the United Nations on Friday of supporting a biological weapons program in Ukraine, a fact Moscow said it uncovered as its forces pressed deeper into Ukraine. The claim was vehemently denied by the United States’ U.N. ambassador, Linda Thomas-Greenfield. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight Vasily Nebenzya, Russia’s U.N. representative, told the U.N. Security Council that Russia had discovered “truly shocking facts” related to what he said were at least 30 Ukrainian laboratories working on diseases including anthrax, cholera and “the plague,” with funding and oversight by the U.S. military.

He said the “reckless” activity included research related to diseases born by birds, lice and fleas. “We call on you to think about a very real biological danger to the people in European countries which can result from an uncontrolled spread of bio-agents from Ukraine,” he said.

Russia requested the meeting Thursday amid its allegations of U.S.-supported bioweapons research. U.S. officials have denied all such charges and suggested that Moscow may be making the allegations as a pretext for its own use of chemical or biological warfare in Ukraine.

Thomas-Greenfield said that Russia had asked the Security Council for Friday’s meeting “for the sole purpose of lying and spreading disinformation.”

“Russia is attempting to use the Security Council to legitimize disinformation and deceive people to justify President Putin’s war of choice against Ukraine and the Ukrainian people,” she said, adding that China has also been spreading disinformation supporting Russia’s claims.

“Ukraine does not have a biological weapons program, and there are no Ukrainian biological weapons laboratories supported by the United States — not near Russia’s borders, not anywhere,” she said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also denied the Russian accusations in a video address to his war-torn nation, posted Thursday on Facebook. “No chemical or any other weapons of mass destruction were developed on my land,” he said. “The whole world knows that.”

“They accuse us … that we are allegedly developing biological weapons, allegedly we are preparing a chemical attack. This makes me really worried,” he added, noting that he is the father of two children.

“It is they who are capable of this,” he said, referring to Russia. “They have already done such things in other countries … and they will do so again,” he added.

Zelensky said laboratories in Ukraine were “engaged in ordinary science … not military technology.” He also warned that if Russia does deploy such chemical weapons, it should prepare for the “most severe sanctions response.”

“We’ve been repeatedly convinced — if you want to know Russia’s plans, look at what Russia accuses others of,” he added.

A U.S. defense official, speaking to reporters Thursday on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the Pentagon, said that Ukraine had five biological research centers that were focused on disease prevention and treatment.

For years, Russia has been laying the groundwork for such allegations, claiming that the United States has installed biochemical labs in Ukraine and other former Soviet republics. This disinformation campaign, now being peddled by Russian authorities amid the Ukrainian invasion, has been endorsed by Chinese and Russian state media and notable far-right U.S. figures such as former Trump adviser Stephen K. Bannon and QAnon figure Ron Watkins.

Kremlin spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters Wednesday that Russia had concluded that “in Ukrainian laboratories close to our borders, components of biological weapons were being developed.”

While China claims it has not taken sides in the conflict — neither denouncing the Russian invasion nor overtly endorsing it — state media and Chinese Foreign Ministry officials regularly echo Russian propaganda, and the Russian biolab claims have quickly spread online, racking up millions of views on the social media platform Weibo.

“This Russian military operation has uncovered the secret of the U.S. labs in Ukraine, and this is not something that can be dealt with in a perfunctory manner,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said Thursday, according to the Associated Press.

There are labs in Ukraine and other former Soviet republics that receive funds from the United States, and their existence is not a secret. After the Soviet Union collapsed, emerging republics with little expertise on how to handle biohazards found themselves in possession of sophisticated laboratories, thanks to the Soviet Union’s robust biological weapons program. The U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency was established in 1998, aiming at containing and destroying pathogens that can be used as biological weapons.

The program was extremely successful at “defanging the Soviet monster,” Thomas Moore, who worked with Sen. Richard Lugar (D-Ind.), one of the leaders of the initiative, said in an interview with Foreign Policy. The agency was able to destroy significant amounts of biochemical agents in former Soviet states.

Moore said that claims that the United States is supporting biohazard research close to Russia’s borders are not new and that the Kremlin has been asserting this for decades. The funding is aimed at destroying and controlling infectious diseases instead of creating them, Justin Ling writes in Foreign Policy.

Thomas-Greenfield said Friday that Ukraine owns and manages public health laboratories focusing on detecting and diagnosing diseases such as covid-19. “The United States has assisted Ukraine to do this safely and securely,” she said.

Stéphane Dujarric, a spokesman for the U.N. secretary general, told reporters Thursday that “the use of chemical weapons in any conflict, in any context, is a grave violation of international law.” A day earlier, Dujarric told reporters that the World Health Organization has been working with the Ukrainian government and is “unaware of any activity on the part of the Ukrainian government which is inconsistent with its international treaty obligations, including on chemical weapons or biological weapons.”

Elsewhere, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson also suggested Thursday that Russia’s accusations could be a “cynical” pretext for its own actions.

“The stuff that you’re hearing about chemical weapons, this is straight out of their playbook,” Johnson told Sky News. “They start saying that there are chemical weapons that are being stored by their opponents or by the Americans. And so when they themselves deploy chemical weapons, as I fear they may, they have a sort of a maskirovka, a fake story, ready to go.”

The White House warned this week that Russia could use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki tweeted that Russia “has long maintained a biological weapons program in violation of international law” and cited its military intervention in Syria in support of President Bashar al-Assad’s regime and its suspected poisoning of Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny in 2020 with a Novichok-like nerve agent.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted Thursday: “The manic obsession with which various Russian officials fantasize about non-existent biological or chemical weapons or hazards in Ukraine is deeply troubling and may actually point at Russia preparing another horrific false flag operation.”

Despite rebuttals from independent scientists, Ukrainian leaders, and officials at the White House and Pentagon, the online popularity of the claims suggests some Americans are willing to trust Kremlin propaganda over the US media and government.

Like any effective conspiracy theory, the Russian claim relies on some truths: Ukraine does maintain a network of biological labs dedicated to research into pathogens, and those labs have received funding and research support from the US.

But the labs are owned and operated by Ukraine, and the work is not secret. It is part of an initiative called the Biological Threat Reduction Program, which aims to reduce the likelihood of deadly outbreaks, whether natural or man made.

The US efforts date back to work in the 1990s to dismantle the former Soviet Union’s programme for weapons of mass destruction.

“The labs are not secret,” said Filippa Lentzos, a senior lecturer in science and international security at King’s College London. “They are not being used in relation to bioweapons. This is all disinformation.”

US biolabs

But that has not stopped the claim from being embraced by some on the far-right, by Fox News hosts, and by groups that push debunked claims that COVID-19 is a bioweapon created by the US.

The day of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, an early version appeared on Twitter – in a thread espousing the idea that Russia’s offensive was targeting “US biolabs in Ukraine” – and was soon amplified by the conspiracy theory website Infowars.

It has spread across mainstream and lower-profile social platforms, including Telegram and Gab, that are popular with far-right Americans, COVID-19 conspiracy theorists, and adherents of QAnon, the baseless hoax that Satan-worshipping paedophiles secretly shape world events.

Many of the accounts posting the claim are citing Russian propaganda outlets as sources. When Kremlin officials repeated the accusation on Thursday, saying the US was developing bioweapons that target specific ethnicities, it took a few minutes for their quotes to show up on American social media.

Several Telegram users who cited the comments said they trusted Russian propaganda over independent American journalists, or their own democratically elected officials.

“Can’t believe anything our government says!” one poster wrote. Others cited the claim while parroting Russia’s talking points about the invasion. “It’s not a “war,” it’s a much needed cleansing,” wrote a member of a Telegram group called Patriot Voices that is popular with supporters of Trump.

“Ukraine has a ton of US govt funded BioWeapons Labs that created deathly pathogens and viruses.”

Television pundits and high-profile political figures have helped spread the claim even further. Fox News host Tucker Carlson devoted segments on his shows on Wednesday and Thursday to promoting the conspiracy theory.

On Wednesday, Donald Trump Jr said conspiracy theories around the labs were proven to be a “fact” in a tweet to his 7.3 million followers.

Both Carlson and Trump misrepresented congressional testimony from a State Department official saying the US was working with Ukraine to secure material in the biological labs, suggesting that indicated the labs were being used for illegitimate purposes.

It is not surprising that a biological research centre would contain potentially hazardous material, however.

The World Health Organization said on Thursday that it has asked Ukraine to destroy any samples that could pose a threat if released, either intentionally or accidentally.

While the disinformation poses a threat on its own, the White House warned this week the Kremlin’s latest conspiracy theory could be a prelude to a chemical or biological attack that Russia would blame on the US or Ukraine.

“Frankly, this influence campaign is completely consistent with longstanding Russian efforts to accuse the United States of sponsoring bioweapons work in the former Soviet Union,” US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said during testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee.

“So this is a classic move by the Russians.”

‘Nothing they claim is true’

The conspiracy theory has also been picked up by Chinese state media, and was further amplified this week by China’s foreign ministry, which repeated Russia’s claim and called for an investigation.

Milton Leitenberg, an arms control expert and senior research associate at the Center for International and Security Studies at the University of Maryland, noted Russia has a long history of such disinformation.

In the 1980s, Russian intelligence spread the conspiracy theory that the US created HIV in a lab. Leitenberg said numerous Russian scientists had visited a similar public health lab in the republic of Georgia, but that Russia continued to spread false claims about that facility.

“There’s nothing they don’t know about what’s taking place there, and they know that nothing of what they claim is true,” Leitenberg said. “The important thing is that they know that, unquestionably.”

While gaining traction in the US, the claims about bioweapons are likely intended for a domestic Russian audience, as a way to increase support for the invasion, according to Andy Carvin, senior fellow and managing editor at the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab, which is tracking Russian disinformation.

He noted the Kremlin has also spread hoaxes about Ukrainian efforts to obtain nuclear weaponry.

“It’s a rinse-and-repeat cycle to hammer home these narratives, particularly to domestic audiences,” Carvin said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/12/russias-bioweapon-conspiracy-theory-finds-support-in-us

Security Council meeting Friday for “lying and spreading disinformation” as part of a potential false-flag operation by Moscow for the use of chemical or biological agents in Ukraine.

Watch Thomas-Greenfield’s remarks in the player above.

U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Russia was playing out a scenario put forth in the council last month by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken — that President Vladimir Putin would “fabricate allegations about chemical or biological weapons to justify its own violent attacks against the Ukrainian people.”

“The intent behind these lies seems clear, and is deeply troubling,” she said. “We believe Russia could use chemical or biological agents for assassinations, as part of a staged or false-flag incident, or to support tactical military operations.”

Russia had requested the council meeting to address its allegations of U.S. “biological activities” in Ukraine — a charge made without any evidence and denied by both Washington and Kyiv.

Britain’s U.N. Ambassador Barbara Woodward, called the allegations “utter nonsense” and said “Russia is sinking to new depths today, but the council must not get dragged down with it.”

U.N. disarmament chief Izumi Nakamitsu told the council she was aware of media reports about allegations of biological weapons programs and said: “The United Nations is not aware of any biological weapons programs.”

Thomas-Greenfield said Ukraine doesn’t have a biological weapons program or biological weapons laboratories supported by the United States, as Russia claimed. Ukraine does own and operate its own public health laboratory facilities which make it possible to detect and diagnose diseases like COVID-19 which the U.S. has assisted Ukraine in doing “safely and securely.”

Thomas-Greenfield said that ever since Russia began building up forces near Ukraine’s borders, Washington’s strategy has been to counter Moscow’ tactics and share what it knows with the world.

“We’re not going to let Russia get away with lying to the world or staining the integrity of the Security Council by using it as a venue for legitimizing Putin’s violence,” she said.

“We do not sit in this chamber to be an audience for Russia’s domestic propaganda,” Thomas-Greenfield added. “And we should not allow Russia to abuse its permanent seat to spread disinformation and lies nd pervert the purpose of the Security Council.”

The U.N. human rights office has received “credible reports” that Russian forces are using cluster munitions in Ukraine, including in populated areas which is prohibited under international humanitarian law, Undersecretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo told the Security Council.

“Indiscriminate attacks, including those using cluster munitions, which are of a nature to strike military objectives and civilians or civilian objects without distinction, are prohibited under international humanitarian law,” DiCarlo said. “Directing attacks against civilian and civilian objects, as well as so-called area bombardment in towns and villages, are also prohibited under international law and may amount to war crimes.”

Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia replied that the allegations are “refuted repeatedly by our Ministry of Defense.”

The Russian request for the Security Council meeting, tweeted Thursday by its first deputy U.N. ambassador, Dmitry Polyansky, followed a U.S. rejection of Russian accusations that Ukraine is operating chemical and biological labs with U.S. support.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova had made the accusation earlier this week, following a warning from White House press secretary Jen Psaki that Russia might use chemical or biological weapons against Ukraine in the invasion.

Psaki called Russia’s claim “preposterous” and tweeted: “This is all an obvious ploy by Russia to try to justify its further premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified attack on Ukraine.”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also denied Russia’s accusation. Like Psaki, he said the accusation itself was a bad sign.

“That worries me very much because we have often been convinced that if you want to know Russia’s plans, they are what Russia accuses others of,” he said late Thursday. “No chemical or any other weapon of mass destruction has been developed on my land. The whole world knows this.”

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby called the Russian claim “a bunch of malarkey.”

Olivia Dalton, spokesperson for the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, said “Russia has a well-documented history of using chemical weapons and has long maintained a biological weapons program in violation of international law” as well as “a track record of falsely accusing the West of the very violations that Russia itself is perpetrating.”

U.N. disarmament chief Izumi Nakamitsu and U.N. political chief Rosemary DiCarlo also were scheduled to brief the council Friday.

U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric reiterated Thursday that the World Health Organization, which has been working with the Ukrainian government, “said they are unaware of any activity on the part of the Ukrainian government which is inconsistent with its international treaty obligations, including on chemical weapons or biological weapons.”

The United States for months has warned about Russian “false flag” operations to create a pretext for the invasion, which began Feb. 24.

The White House warning, and Dalton’s statement Thursday, suggested Russia might seek to create a pretense for further escalating the 2-week-old conflict that has seen the Russian offensive slowed, but not stopped, by stronger-than-expected Ukrainian defenders.

The international community for years has assessed that Russia used chemical weapons in carrying out assassination attempts against President Vladimir Putin’s opponents such as Alexei Navalny, now in a Russian prison, and former spy Sergei Skripal, who lives in the United Kingdom.

Now, the White House says it may be used by Putin as cover for a bioweapons attack on Ukraine.

In less than two weeks, a conspiracy theory about Ukrainian biolabs has gone from a fringe QAnon Twitter account to becoming a major rallying cry for both Russian President Vladimir Putin’s regime and the U.S. far-right.

Now, the White House says it may be used by Putin as cover for a bioweapons attack on Ukraine.

The theory that the Russian invasion was a pretext to destroy U.S.-installed biolabs first emerged online in the hours after Putin began airstrikes in Ukraine—although it can be traced back to older conspiracy claims. Since then, it has been touted or outright endorsed by a roster of Russian disinformation accounts; Russian and Chinese state media; Russian officials, including Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and United Russia leader Dmitry Medvedev; and noted U.S. far-right figures, including QAnon leader Ron Watkins and former U.S. President Donald Trump advisor Steve Bannon.

Mounting fears inside the U.S. defense and intelligence community that Russian bombing could, in fact, cause a biological incident—or could be the pretext for Russia deploying biological or chemical weapons—has served to reinforce the skeptics’ belief that America has something to hide.

The conspiracy theory got an extra boost on Tuesday during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. Sen. Marco Rubio asked U.S. Undersecretary of State Victoria Nuland whether there were bioweapons in Ukraine: In answering, she stressed that “Ukraine has biological research facilities.” She added that the United States is working with the Ukrainian government to ensure those research facilities do not fall “into the hands of Russian forces.”

Even if she categorically did not say the United States funds the creation of bioweapons in Ukraine, her comments were taken as proof by the theory’s boosters. They allege those labs are performing such dangerous and risky experiments that Russia is well within its rights to destroy them.

Bannon’s War Room podcast heard from former Trump apparatchik Peter Navarro that health advisor Anthony Fauci was at the center of everything. “Whatever happened in the Ukraine,” Navarro said about those biolabs, “he had to know about it.”

Writer Glenn Greenwald, increasingly aligned with far-right polemicists, spun an imaginary narrative where Rubio was “visibly stunned,” characterizing Nuland’s comments as confirmation of U.S-controlled or created biological weapons in Ukraine.

“The only reason to be ‘quite concerned’ about these ‘biological research facilities’ falling into Russian hands is if they contain sophisticated materials that Russian scientists have not yet developed on their own and which could be used for nefarious purposes,” Greenwald writes. “Either advanced biological weapons or dual-use ‘research’ that has the potential to be weaponized.”

Greenwald’s theory was quickly endorsed by Fox News host and de facto voice of the American far-right Tucker Carlson. Carlson dismissed the idea that QAnon (“whatever that is,” Carlson said) was responsible for the original theory—despite the theory’s originator being a longtime QAnon follower. Carlson declared Nuland’s testimony confirmation that “the Russian disinformation they’ve been telling us for days is a lie, and a conspiracy theory, and crazy, and immoral to believe is, in fact, totally and completely true,” he said. “Woah.”

Carlson’s conclusion that these “secret” labs posed an existential threat and the United States and Ukraine were uniquely to blame for it is cribbed directly from Russia’s propaganda efforts of the past decade—and, particularly, from the last week.

This all lines up with what Russia itself is saying. “It can be concluded that components of biological weapons were being developed in Ukrainian biolabs located in close vicinity of our border,” Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said at a press conference. “The emergency destruction of dangerous pathogens on Feb. 24 was a necessary step aimed at concealing the fact that Ukraine and the U.S. had violated Article 1 of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention.”

Moscow’s sudden enthusiasm for the conspiracy theory has led Washington to raise the alarm.

On Tuesday, Rubio asked the undersecretary about propaganda disseminated from Russian sources alleging they have “uncovered a plot by the Ukrainians to release biological weapons in the country.” He asked: “If there is a biological or chemical weapon incident or attack inside of Ukraine, is there any doubt in your mind that, 100 percent, it would be the Russians?”

“There is no doubt in my mind, senator, and it is classic Russian technique to blame on the other guy what they’re planning to do themselves,” Nuland responded.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki echoed this sentiment on Wednesday, tweeting, “[W]e should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them.”

As Foreign Policy reported last week, the existence of these U.S-funded laboratories is neither secret nor unusual. Understanding why these labs exist is critical to understanding just how baseless these allegations are—and just how dangerous the war could get if the White House is right about Russia’s possible planned use of biological or chemical agents.

After the fall of the Soviet Union, a massive amount of nuclear, chemical, and biological material was suddenly the responsibility of nascent governments with no particular expertise in handling them.

“The Soviet Union had the most efficient, sophisticated, and powerful offensive [biological weapons] program in the world,” Kenneth Alibek, first deputy director of the Soviet Union’s bioweapons program, Biopreparat, told the Nonproliferation Review in a 1999 interview. “I personally developed three versions of a tularemia biological weapon, a sophisticated plague biological weapon, and a dry form of anthrax that is one of the most powerful biological weapons in the world today.”

As recently as 1985, Alibek said, then-Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev signed a five-year plan to create Ebola and Marburg biological weapons as well as ramp up the creation of weaponized smallpox. Although the United States and Soviet Union were both signatories of the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention that outlawed offensive research, many Soviet officials were convinced the Americans were lying about ending their own program and thus felt justified in continuing their own efforts. While Alibek said those efforts were eventually abandoned and efforts were made to destroy the pathogens, he was certain that elements of his program remained.

When the Cold War came to a close and a series of reciprocal visits were organized between Washington and Moscow to tour each other’s biological weapons facilities, Alibek recounted the shock that struck each side—the Americans’ surprise over just how extensive the Soviet program had been and the Russians’ realization that they had been lied to about U.S. research. Despite evidence of research being done decades prior, Alibek found there was no active bioweapons program. It became clear to Alibek that then-U.S. President Richard Nixon had been telling the truth in 1969 when he signed an order ending the United States’ offensive bioweapons program.

As the Soviet Union disintegrated, Alibek said he was asked by the newly formed government in his native Kazakhstan to help develop their own bioweapons program. He declined and defected to the United States shortly thereafter.

Alibek continued to warn about the risk of a Russian bioweapons program, however. “Russia is interested in maintaining its offensive biological potential because biological weapons have unique capabilities,” he told the Review. He hypothesized how these biological agents could be dispersed via entrenched fighters in Chechnya. “These weapons can be considered highly effective for certain types of low-intensity or high-intensity conflict. Especially, in my opinion, for a country that is losing its conventional military potential and becoming weaker practically every single day.”

After the Berlin Wall fell, an U.S. effort—led by former Sens. Richard Lugar and Sam Nunn—began work to identify and destroy stockpiles of Soviet nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. Their work led to the creation of what is now known as the Defense Threat Reduction Agency.

While the agency isn’t entirely about nonproliferation—it actively contributes to managing the United States’ nuclear capabilities—its Biological Threat Reduction Program does significant work in security and destroying nonconventional weapons abroad. That’s involved cooperation with post-Soviet countries, including Russia itself.

A 2007 review of the agency’s work by the National Research Council endorsed the program and found that “the national security payoffs from a robust and far reaching program in this field are considerable.” A 2019 fact sheet from the agency claims it destroyed some 4,700 tons of chemical weapons and facilitated the “construction or renovation of more than 100 laboratory and storage facilities” as well as coordinated “more than 300 cooperative research projects aimed at safely studying, detecting, and diagnosing especially dangerous pathogens.”

The Defense Threat Reduction Agency is responsible for funding labs and programs in Ukraine and elsewhere in the region, including Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and (in the early 2000s) Russia itself.

Thomas Moore, who worked for Lugar and was intimately familiar with efforts to manage the former Soviet bioweapons program, said the program was incredibly successful in “defanging the Soviet monster.” Since it successfully destroyed significant quantities of chemical and biological agents in the former Soviet states, he said work has ramped up around disease surveillance—Uzbekistan, for example, has a particularly high rate of infectious disease outbreaks. If you believe COVID-19 emerged naturally from an animal reservoir in southern China, as the majority of the virology community does, then infectious disease surveillance is a particularly useful quest.

But Moore said insisting U.S. interests are more nefarious is “pretty familiar territory, unfortunately.” Moore stressed that Russia has been trying to gin up the idea that America is doing nefarious research on its borders for decades.

The funding, however, is explicitly aimed at destroying, preventing, or containing infectious diseases—not creating them.

“We’re not talking about gain of function,” Moore said, referring to the favored bugbear of those who believe COVID-19 was created with U.S. government funding. “We’re talking about removing function.”

Much of this research is public. For example, $1.8 million funded the creation of a veterinary lab. Another cooperation saw the agency fund a study of influenza in dogs and cats. $1.7 million went to a facility in Kharkiv, Ukraine, that has been doing COVID-19 testing throughout the pandemic. More than a decade ago, funding from the agency also brought Ukrainian hospitals and research sites onto the Electronic Integrated Disease Surveillance System, a program used worldwide.

Ukraine does have some health-focused research facilities that handle more dangerous pathogens, such as the plague, specifically because the country has seen outbreaks throughout its history. Their work is published in peer-reviewed journals, and research is done in conjunction with scientists in the United States, Canada, Europe, and abroad. In fact, a 2007 report by the Nuclear Threat Initiative found that the United States’ plans to upgrade a research facility in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, would improve security mechanisms and “serve to substantially decrease whatever proliferation threat the institute now poses.” They further found no evidence of an offensive bioweapons program and continue to assess Ukraine as a low risk for biological weapons proliferation. A 2021 review by the Global Health Security Index found “an apparent lack of interest in dual-use research among Ukrainian experts and officials.”

Moore said the United States, since Nixon’s order, “is engaged in absolutely no research, study, or development of biological weapons.” What’s more, he said, “there are no [bioweapons] facilities in Ukraine, and the Ukrainian authorities have never had any interest whatsoever.”

Although American and Ukrainian research labs are relatively open and accessible to outside scrutiny, Russia does not operate on the same basis.

“Russia probably does have a biological weapons program. The U.S. believes it does and has said so,” Gigi Gronvall, bioweapons expert and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told me last year. “They have facilities that are not open. They’ve cut off track two—any sort of person-to-person—[diplomacy]. One of the only scientists I knew in Russia was one of those victims of suicide. He just happened to jump out of a 12-story window.”

Moscow is a signatory to the Biological Weapons Convention, but it contains no verification measures—indeed, the Soviet Union signed the convention just as they were ramping up domestic bioweapons production. “There’s no credible evidence that they completely abandoned everything,” Moore told Foreign Policy.

Since taking power two decades ago, Putin has opposed international inspectors of possible biological weapon sites and has openly mused about the possibility of developing “genetic weapons.”

“I would never publicly say that Russia does not have biological weapons programs,” Moore said. “I would never be able to give more detail than that.”

The State Department, per a 2021 report, “assesses that the Russian Federation (Russia) maintains an offensive BW program and is in violation of its obligation under [the Biological Weapons Convention.] The issue of compliance by Russia with the BWC has been of concern for many years.”

Moore suspects this propaganda effort is not, as the White House has suggested, an attempt to launch a biological attack on Ukraine.

Geopolitically, biological weapons have been used only a few times in the battlefield—likely, the only major modern power responsible for the deployment of biological agents against an enemy was the Soviets themselves during their counterinsurgency in Afghanistan. Alibek said he believes the Glanders biological agent was deployed against the mujahideen in 1982. CIA assessments certainly support the idea that the Soviets were deploying or providing toxin weapons.”

But beyond that instance, Alibek made clear, the Soviets saw biological weapons as a piece of the total nuclear deterrence package. “The main doctrine was to use biological weapons in so-called total wars involving possible mutual destruction between the United States and the Soviet Union and their allies,” he explained. Although he hypothesized that these weapons could be used inside Russia, deploying these hitherto unheard-of weapons within Europe’s borders would be extremely provocative. While Washington’s much-touted red line around chemical weapons in Syria ultimately proved to be bluster, with no response after Syria actually used chemical weapons, deploying such weaponry against Ukraine would likely evoke a much stronger response.

Russia’s interest in bioweapons may be more than rhetorical, however.

“What worries me is if they’d plant some ‘evidence,’” Moore said.

Even if nobody believes it, Moore said, producing even a small quantity of anthrax would give Russia the pretext to continue its brutal war and portray Ukraine and the United States as the aggressors. It would allow Putin to say, as Moore put it: “You guys went to Iraq to find it, and we came to Ukraine to find it.”",https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/03/10/bioweapons-ukraine-russia-disinformation/

The U.N. Security Council met to discuss Russian claims of biological weapons research labs in Ukraine. Russian Ambassador to the U.N. Vassily Nebenzia outlined what he said was evidence of these labs discovered by Russian soldiers. Ambassador Nebenzia claimed this research was being funded by the United States. The U.N. Under Secretary-General and High Representative for Disarmament Affairs Izumi Nakamitsu said the U.N. is, “not aware of any biological weapons program in Ukraine.” The U.S. and Ukrainian U.N. Ambassadors, Linda Thomas-Greenfield and Sergiy Syslytsya respectively, denied Russia’s allegations. Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield warned the Russian claim could be used as an excuse to use biological weapons against the Ukrainian people. Reminding the Council, “It is Russia that is the aggressor here.”

This week, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova — without evidence — accused Ukraine of running chemical and biological weapons labs with U.S. support. White House press secretary Jen Psaki called Russia’s claim “preposterous” and said it could be part of an attempt by Russia to lay the groundwork for its own use of such weapons of mass destruction against Ukraine.

“This is all an obvious ploy by Russia to try to justify its further premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified attack on Ukraine,” Psaki tweeted Wednesday. “Now that Russia has made these false claims, and China has seemingly endorsed this propaganda, we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them.”

The U.S. for months has warned about Russian “false flag” operations to create a pretext for the invasion. Wednesday’s warning suggested Russia might seek to create a pretense for further escalating the two-week old conflict that has seen the Russian offensive slowed by stronger-than-expected Ukrainian defenders, but not stopped.

Dmitry Chumakov, a Russian deputy U.N. ambassador, repeated the accusation Wednesday, urging Western media to cover “the news about secret biological laboratories in Ukraine.”

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby on Wednesday called the Russian claim “a bunch of malarkey.”

The international community for years has assessed that Russia has used chemical weapons before in carrying out assassination attempts against Putin enemies like Alexey Navalny and former spy Sergei Skripal. Russia also supports the Assad government in Syria, which has used chemical weapons against its people in a decade-long civil war.

Asked by a Russian journalist about the claims, United Nations spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. “At this point have no information to confirm these reports or these allegations about these kinds of labs.”

“Our colleagues at the World Health Organization, who have been working with the Ukrainian Governments, said they are unaware of any activity on the part of the Ukrainian Government which is inconsistent with its international treaty obligations, including on chemical weapons or biological weapons,” Dujarric added.

Russia has a long history of spreading disinformation about U.S. biological weapons research. In the 1980s, Russian intelligence spread the conspiracy theory that the U.S. created HIV in a lab. More recently, Russian state media have spread theories about dangerous research at labs in Ukraine and Georgia.

The conspiracy theory about U.S.-run labs in Ukraine has been picked up by Chinese state-controlled media and is now circulating in online message boards popular with COVID-19 conspiracy theorists and far-right groups in the U.S.

Filippa Lentzos, a senior lecturer in science and international security at King’s College London, said there are no “U.S. labs” in Ukraine. Instead, she said in an email, there are labs in the country that have received money through a U.S. Defense Department threat reduction program.

“These are public and animal health facilities that are owned and operated by Ukraine,” she said.

The carnage and chaos unleashed by Putin’s unprovoked war with Ukraine is shaking the very foundations of the contemporary international system. It has upended much of what we have long taken for granted regarding international peace and security on the European continent. It also raises many troubling questions about the viability of global arms control and nonproliferation treaties, including the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

It is not surprising, therefore, that we face many challenges to our preconceived notions, and it is important to be open to a reexamination of what often passes for conventional wisdom. By the same token, it is now more essential than ever to identify and debunk unfounded and malicious lies and misinformation. Among the most sensational are those being propagated by Russian media about alleged Ukrainian intentions to acquire and employ radiological weapons (RW).[1]

A flurry of these unsubstantiated and intentionally misleading allegations began prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24 and continue to this date. Links to an incomplete but indicative collection of these false narratives are provided below along with brief annotations. Please note that the links to some of the original on-line stories are no longer accessible, but have been included for informational purposes. CNS has hard copies or PDF files for all items on the list.

In order to counter the Russian disinformation campaign related to radiological weapons, it is important to be aware of past national RW programs, including those developed during the Soviet period.[2] As detailed in a fall 2020 article in International Security with which at least one of the Russian disinformation agents appears to have been familiar, this history begins almost simultaneously with the publication of a science fiction story by Robert Heinlein (under the pseudonym Anson MacDonald) in May 1941 and a secret U.S government report that same month. The government report identified “the production of violently radioactive materials…carried by airplanes to be scattered as bombs over enemy territory” as one of three possible military applications of atomic fission.[3]

The United States was not alone in its interest in RW, and along with the Soviet Union, developed and conducted tests of radiological weapons in the years between the end of World War II and the mid-1950s. The United Kingdom also initiated a program of research on RW during the same time period, and subsequently Iraq developed and tested primitive radiological weapons during its war with Iran. In addition, Egypt flirted with RW in the early 1960s, seeking to acquire radiological sources from abroad. All of these programs, however, ultimately were abandoned, usually due to a combination of technical obstacles, economic constraints, perceived lack of military effectiveness, health and safety considerations, loss of leadership support, normative concerns, bureaucratic opposition, and a decision to focus on other non-conventional weapons.

While the Soviet Union’s RW program withered away in the mid-1950s, Moscow has shown renewed interest in nuclear weapons that seek to maximize radioactive contamination. The primary example is the nuclear powered, unmanned, underwater vehicle weapon system known variously as “Kanyon,” “Status-6,” and “Poseidon.” It is designed to attack coastal cities and military targets with a nuclear warhead encased in a cobalt shell.[4] Russian military analysts have offered little insight into the military rationale for the new doomsday weapon, which has little in common with past radiological weapons.

To summarize, no country has ever used RW in war and none is known to have incorporated them into their nation’s military arsenal. Indeed, in another era—the late 1970s—the United States and the Soviet Union jointly proposed a draft treaty to the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva to prohibit the development, production, stockpiling and use of radiological weapons.[5] That treaty was never adopted, but it is an idea that merits reconsideration.

It is conceivable that in the future some countries may decide that RW serve their perceived national interests. Notwithstanding Russian propaganda, however, there is no evidence that Ukraine has ever seriously considered that option.

The following is an annotated chronology on allegations of Ukrainian RW that was circulated in Russian media in the lead-up to the invasion, and the development of those allegations since that time.

The Military Observer Publishes Photos of Ukraine’s Alleged RW program, 02/04/2022 https://t.me/new_militarycolumnist/70794 This appears to be the earliest source for claims that Ukraine was pursuing a dirty bomb in the lead-up to the Russian invasion. In the following weeks, many Russian state sources would cite this post as the source of their claim of Ukrainian dirty bombs and it appears that narrative began here. This is the Telegram channel of the pro-Kremlin outlet The Military Observer, in which they published a screenshot of a Ukrainian video that allegedly shows the Ukrainian National Crops preparing RW. The source and authenticity of the screenshots is unclear. The same day, the Ukrainian Independent Information Agency published this response: https://www.unian.net/war/propagandisty-zapustili-feyk-o-tom-chto-nackorpus-izgotovil-gryaznuyu-radioaktivnuyu-bombu-novosti-donbassa-11693578.html They reject the photos as a forgery and note the video appears to be an IED with a dosimeter thrown on top of it, as well noting that the text in the photos containing many grammatical errors that native Ukrainian speakers are unlikely to make.

“‘Dirty bombs’ and a Second Chernobyl: What Blackmail Can Ukraine Use After the Abandoned War.” Komsomolskaya Pravda, 02/15/2022 https://www.kp.ru/daily/27365/4546576/ Komsomolskaya Pravda ridicules the West’s claims that Russia is going to invade Ukraine. Then the article cites supplies requests that Ukraine had made to NATO. The requests include protective clothing and gloves. From this, the article deduces that Ukraine must be preparing for an imminent “large-scale man-made disaster. No other conclusion can be drawn from reading this list of aids.” This leap in logic is used to suggest that Ukraine is attempting to create a nuclear weapon or a dirty bomb.

“Expert: Ukraine will not be able to make a nuclear bomb, but there is another danger.” Radio Sputnik, 02/20/2022 https://radiosputnik.ria.ru/20220220/ukraina-1773912013.html While the previous dirty bomb claims were in non-state media sources, this article is one of the earliest published in Russian state media that specifically suggests dirty bombs as an alternative to the nuclear weapons narrative. This source also links dirty bombs to “nationalist-inclined politicians,” which is notably different than claims two weeks later when the dirty bomb idea is linked to the Azov Battalion and the United States collaborating with the Ukrainian government.

“Instead of a Nuclear Warhead, Kyiv Might Get a ‘Dirty Bomb’” Rossiya 24 , 02/21/2022, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BrsorOmI4c Rossiya 24 broadcasts a segment on the post-Soviet removal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine and evaluates the technical capability of Ukraine to create NW or RW: “The potential attempt by Kyiv itself to create warheads might actually turn into the creation of a dirty bomb, and even in the Soviet era, Ukraine did not have such a capability.” This reflects an interesting change in the narrative that Russian state media would increasingly push as the invasion began. While President Putin alleged pursuit of nuclear weapons as one of the rationales of invasion, the media narrative quickly changed to suggest that Ukraine desires nuclear weapons but since they do not have the technical ability to create them, Ukraine has decided to pursue RW. The source also states that Zelenskyy’s Munich speech was antithetical to the NPT and that the West “either didn’t understand what Zelenskyy said or they are ready to agree to any Ukrainian action, including a direct violation of Ukraine’s obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.” There seems to be confusion in this report over the difference between a nuclear weapon and a radiological weapon, and the reporter incorrectly suggests that either one would be a violation of the NPT.

“Ukraine Almost Created a Dirty Bomb.” Sergei Savchuk, RIA Novosti, 02/25/2022 https://ria.ru/20220225/ukraina-1774945400.html This is one of the more analytical examinations of possible Ukrainian RW. The author claims that the invasion already managed to stop the creation of dirty bombs in Ukraine. He suggests that such bombs would be impossible to make without western help, and that the invasion has successfully prevented the West from giving Ukraine direct help in separating radiological components for RW. He also examines the potential for Ukrainian delivery systems to handle a theoretical dirty bomb.

“A Dirty Bomb: What is it and How Dangerous is it?” Aleksandr Petrov, Populyarnaya Mekhanika, 02/25/2022 https://www.popmech.ru/weapon/12296-gryaznaya-bomba-chto-eto-takoe/ A historical and scientific look at RW. The actual content of the article is neutral, but the framing is not—the lede frames the article in terms of the fact that “Vladimir Putin hinted that Ukraine was able to make ‘dirty’ bombs.”

“A Dirty Bomb, The Siege of Crimea, a February Anomaly, A No-Fly Zone.” Rossiya 24, 02/25/2022 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQQaaWi5YL4 This is among the only Russian media sources to use the phrase “radiological weapon.” Most sources fail to clearly distinguish a radiological device from NW. However, note the animation at 4:40, in which the effects of a radiological dispersal device are described accurately, but the animation portrays a device more similar to NW, complete with a stereotypical mushroom cloud. Also of note is that the presenter at the ends says that there is no serious attempt on the part of the Ukrainian government to pursue a dirty bomb, but that the risk is that nationalist groups might attempt to do so. This differs from the narrative two weeks later, when such groups are alleged to be working with the Ukrainian government to procure a dirty bomb.

“Russia is not Engaging in a War with the Ukrainian People—Permanent Representative to the UN.” Interfax, 02/26/2022 https://www.interfax-russia.ru/main/rossiya-ne-vedet-voynu-s-ukrainskim-narodom-postpred-pri-oon?utm_source=yxnews&utm_medium=desktop&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fyandex.ru%2Fnews%2Fsearch%3Ftext%3D One of the rare mentions of the dirty bomb claims by Russia in an international forum. The lackluster attempt by Russia to push the RW claims in international fora suggests that it is a narrative targeting only a domestic audience. Even in this instance, the dirty bombs are not mentioned as a cause of the war, as they are portrayed often in Russian media, but rather as the reason that Russian forces moved to secure Chernobyl. Here, Ambassador Nebenzya mentions it in his speech after the Security Council vote on the Ukrainian invasion draft resolution.

“Putin has gotten ahead of the West,” Elena Golovan, Argumenty Nedeli, 03/01/2022, https://argumenti.ru/interview/2022/03/761941?utm_source=yxnews&utm_medium=desktop&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fyandex.ru%2Fnews%2Fsearch%3Ftext%3D An interview with Yevgeny Satanovsky, an economist and Middle East expert, in which he had suggested that Ukraine might have sabotaged Chernobyl to create a radiological crisis had Russia not seized control of the zone.

Alleged FSB whistleblower letter, Vladimir Osechkin, 03/04/2022 https://www.facebook.com/vladimir.osechkin/posts/4811633942268327 This letter is alleged to have come from an FSB insider on the conduct of the war. Of note, he claims that the SVR are “digging up dirt” to try and prove the Ukrainians were attempting to build nuclear weapons and a dirty bomb. This source should be approached with extreme caution and skepticism but we include it here because it fits extremely well with the media strategy that Russia is pursuing, and Christo Grozev of Bellingcat opined that the source is credible: https://twitter.com/christogrozev/status/1500197460626624513

His supposed evidence is that “not a single sane soldier from either the Russian or Ukrainian armies would ever risk carrying out such a provocation on Europe’s largest nuclear station,” and that Zelenskyy’s remarks after the attack seemed to be “an instantaneous reaction,” and must have therefore been prepared in advance. He claims by intervening in Ukraine, Russia has prevented a nuclear war.

This aspect of the call was not widely reported in Western media, but if true, it appears to be one of the few cases in which Russia has attempted to use the nuclear narrative when engaging with the West and not just a domestic audience.

“The Main Topics of the Hour: 9:30” Radio Sputnik, 03/06/2022, https://radiosputnik.ria.ru/20220306/1776887012.html Radio Sputnik claims that a representative of a “competent department of the Russian Federation” has told them that Kyiv was working in Chernobyl Exclusion Zone on creating a radiological weapon, saying that “the naturally increased radiation background of Chernobyl hid the conduct of such work.”

“A Source Tells Why Ukraine Used the Chernobyl NPP Zone” RIA Novosti, 03/06/2022 https://ria.ru/20220306/chaes-1776880399.html This source also cites the “representative of one of the competent departments of the Russian Federation.” It claims that several research institutions in Ukraine have been working on RW-related projects, including Kyiv National University and Odessa Polytechnic. Their proof is that these projects allegedly focused on “the metallurgical field of nuclear materials and technologies for the production of special alloys.”

They claim that Ukraine has been pursuing nuclear weapons since 1994, and they could have secretly acquired centrifugal enrichment and laser isotope separation technology from the United States, as well as plutonium. They further allege to have discovered unspecified evidence at the captured Chernobyl site that Chernobyl was being used by Kyiv to both separate plutonium from radioactive waste products and to create a dirty bomb. The source also discusses Ukrainian missile technology imports and suggests that Ukrainian aerospace company Yuzhmash had partnered with Turkey for “the creation of a mobile complex fitted with a solid-propellant ballistic missile capable of reaching 1500 kilometers.” The article also alleges that Ukraine has developed rockets which are “ideal delivery system[s] for dirty bombs.”

“RF Ministry of Defense: SBU is preparing a provocation with a radioactive contamination in the vicinity of Kharkiv.” TASS, 03/06/2022 https://tass.ru/armiya-i-opk/13989709; The Russian government’s newest version of events says that Ukraine’s SBU is collaborating with the Azov Battalion to “mine” a reactor, and blame the ensuing catastrophe on a Russian missile strike. The so-called reactor in question is actually the accelerator-driven subcritical assembly at the Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology. This, TASS claims, is why NPPs in Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhia were taken by Russian soldiers, implying that the Russian war effort is the act of a responsible nuclear superpower attempting to prevent a radiological disaster by a collaboration between the Ukrainian government and the neo-Nazi Azov group. This allegation links together several of the Russian government’s claims over the last few days into a single narrative.

“Cholera and Anthrax: Ukraine Was Preparing Biological Weapons By the Order of the United States,” Aleksandr Grishin, Komsomolskaya Pravda, 03/06/2022 https://www.kp.ru/daily/27373/4555101/; and “Direct Evidence that NATO Was on the Side of Ukraine’s Regime,” Nikita Makerenov and Pavel Khanarin, Komsomolskaya Pravda, 03/06/2022 https://www.donetsk.kp.ru/daily/27373/4555062/ This appears to be another claim, first appearing Monday morning in Moscow that Ukraine was also working on BW. Their evidence comes from the Donetsk leader who claims to have obtained a laptop belonging to NATO on war plans in Ukraine. The laptop pictured is well over a decade old, with what appears to be duct tape holding it together—it is extremely dubious evidence. This combined with the accusation of NW and RW pursual makes it seem like propaganda is being churned out to see what sticks. Of note, the first article also repeats the line about the competent government source, and asserts that the belief that Ukraine was starting to work on creating a dirty bomb was “probably” why Russian forces were sent to Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhia.

“Zelenksyy ‘In Exile.’ American Biolabs. Dirty Bombs of the Kyivan Regime.” Nikolai Starikov, 03/07/2022 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET12cpt0N5U This video by Nikolai Starikov, a popular Russian media personality, at 10:13 conflates NW with RW. This has appeared in both Western and Russian sources, but it is possible this is at least partially intentional in Russian media. The initial claims that Ukraine was preparing a nuclear bomb were easily falsifiable, so conflating that initial reason given on the eve of the invasion with a dirty bomb appears almost as an intentional tactic to muddy the waters. Note that this is very similar to Russian media tactics of the recent past. The Skripal poisoning was derided initially by Russian media as being the result of fentanyl poisoning, and Dmitry Kiselyov of the popular show Vesti Nedeli suggested that the British government poisoned the Skripals and blamed it on Russia. The claims about dirty bombs parallel these types of accusations.

“The IAEA Believes that the Scientific Nuclear Installation in Kharkiv Might Have Been Destroyed.” TASS, 03/07/2022 https://tass.ru/ekonomika/13994243?utm_source=yxnews&utm_medium=desktop&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fyandex.ru%2Fnews%2Fsearch%3Ftext%3D Russian state media reproduces Director General Grossi’s comments on Monday about the destruction of the Kharkiv facility, and then adds after those comments the Russian Ministry of Defense’s claim that the SBU and Azov Regiment were planning on destroying the facility and blaming Russia.

“A Source: By All Indications, Ukraine Received Nuclear Materials from the United States.” TASS, 03/07/2022 https://tass.ru/politika/13984437?utm_source=google.com&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=google.com&utm_referrer=google.com On March 7th, Russian media started carrying the allegation that the US was aware that Ukraine was pursuing nuclear weapons and sent them plutonium for the purpose of speeding up R&D on the project. Like the biological weapons claims being pushed, Russia is going farther than before by spuriously accusing the United States of aiding a made-up nuclear program.

“What was the Trigger for Putin to Switch on the ‘Soviet Chekist’ Regime,” Olga Lebedeva, ru, 03/08/2022 https://www.pravda.ru/news/politics/1688592-sovetskii_chekist/?utm_source=yxnews&utm_medium=desktop Blogger Igor Dmitriev claims the rapid transition of Russian from a corporatist state to a police state had something to do with a “secret document.” He says, “What happened that turned [Putin] from a company director to a Soviet Chekist again? Everyone is talking about some secret document that changed his relationship to what is going on in Ukraine…it is now clear that in the document that pressed the trigger which activated a completely different regime in Putin—there was data about nuclear weapons.” This version of events is currently circulating in several Russian media outlets, but the secret document that Dmitriev claims everyone is talking about does not appear to exist, and all references to it by Russian media links back to Dmitriev’s own Telegram channel. This account is interesting because it ties the claims that Ukraine is attempting to do an amorphous something with nuclear weapons or dirty bombs together with the reorientation of the Russian state. In this new version, not only did the nuclear threat justify the war, but it also justified Russia’s totalitarian shift. In addition, a few hours later, Dmitriev posted in his channel, “I need to clarify: I don’t know anything about nuclear technologies, I don’t know what was in the report, and I don’t sure that it is real and whether the report has a real basis.” This addendum was not reported anywhere in Russian media, and was only seen by 70,000 viewers, compared to his initial claims which reached on 300,000 on Telegram and countless others in news articles reproducing his claims. His Telegram posts have been aggregated here: https://acrobat.adobe.com/link/review?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:327a2a9c-c630-3619-a209-14bec4bbaa3c

“The Ministry of Defense Has Learned of Nationalist Plans to Arrange a Provocation with Chemical Weapons.” RIA Novosti, 03/09/2022, https://ria.ru/20220309/minoborony-1777366517.html?utm_source=yxnews&utm_medium=desktop After accusing Ukraine of building nuclear, radiological, and biological weapons, Russia rounds out the CBRN accusations by claiming Ukraine is stockpiling 80 tons of ammonia near Kharkiv, which the source indicates will then be used to accuse Russia of chemical warfare. Note that ammonia is not a controlled substance on the Annex on Chemicals in the Chemical Weapon Convention and has extremely limited uses as a chemical warfare agent, though it can be used as a precursor in the production of hydrogen cyanide. This accusation is written extremely similarly to the dirty bomb claims, and the specific language the source uses, “preparing a provocation in order to accuse Russia,” is nearly an identical to that used to describe RW/BW.",https://nonproliferation.org/russian-misinformation-about-ukrainian-radiological-weapons-capabilities-and-intentions/
