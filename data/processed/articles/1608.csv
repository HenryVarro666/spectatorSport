Poland can send its warplanes to Ukraine without the Biden administration’s approval. No, really, it can — right now, actually. But the issue is Warsaw doesn’t want to, not that President JOE BIDEN unilaterally blocked the handover to Kyiv.

This straightforward point — that Poland is in charge of its MiG-29s, not America — has gotten lost in the brouhaha over the botched U.S.-Poland deal.

After a broader secret arrangement was errantly made public by the European Union’s top diplomat, Washington worked for weeks with Warsaw to salvage the warplane transfer to Ukraine. Ultimately it fell through because Poland wanted the U.S. to act as the middleman instead of directly giving the keys to Ukrainian pilots. The reason? Fear, from all sides.

“They are worried about Russia responding with military strikes against Polish bases, including nuclear strikes,” someone familiar with the Polish government’s thinking told NatSec Daily. In effect, Poland passed the buck to the U.S., hoping America would take the heat while guaranteeing F-16s as a backfill.

Biden and his team didn’t think that was a good idea. Not only did the U.S. fear an open handover of warplanes would ratchet up tensions, but officials in the Pentagon and intelligence community made clear the costs would outweigh the benefits. The president agreed with them, leading the administration to express its opposition to the deal, even though they repeatedly said Poland maintains the sovereign right to give Ukraine its fighter jets.

“The transfer of MiG-29 aircraft will not appreciably increase the effectiveness of the Ukrainian Air Force. The Ukrainian Air Force currently possesses numerous mission capable aircraft that are flying daily. Adding aircraft to the Ukrainian inventory is unlikely to change the effectiveness of the Ukrainian Air Force relative to Russian capabilities. Therefore, we assess that the overall gain is low,” Gen. TOD WOLTERS, the U.S. European Command chief, said in a Thursday statement.

A senior U.S. defense official added Friday that the Ukrainians “are not using their fixed-wing fighter aircraft very much. They have about 56 fighter aircraft remaining on the ground, and that is the majority of their fleet.” Kyiv is only flying about five to 10 sorties a day compared to Russia’s roughly 200, the official continued. The Ukrainians “haven't proven that they need to do more than what they're doing. They've been very effective with the other tools that they have used, very creatively, and those are having a good effect on Russian airpower.”

(NatSec Daily can’t help but note that Ukrainians figured out how to drop Molotov cocktails from drones.)

Instead of fighter jets, the U.S. and its allies may soon provide what they deem are more effective weapons to counter Russian President VLADIMIR PUTIN’s forces.

“The surface-to-air systems under consideration are more sophisticated than the shoulder-launched, heat-seeking missiles NATO members and others have already provided Ukraine. They include what NATO refers to as the SA-8 and SA-10, which can target planes at much higher altitudes, as well as what Russia calls the S-300, which was a state-of-the-art system until a few years ago,” The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. “The S-300 is an air-defense system, first produced by the Soviet Union and later Russia, that is capable of shooting down aircraft and cruise missiles. The S-300 was designed to be highly mobile, allowing air-defense forces to fire their weapons and quickly relocate to avoid being hit in a retaliatory strike.”

It’s still unclear where the S-300s would come from, but three NATO countries — Bulgaria, Greece and Slovakia — have them.

And yet, all the administration’s critics can talk about is the lack of MiGs, which, again, is Poland’s decision, not America’s.

“[W]e strongly disagree with your decision to delay and deny Poland the option to transfer fighter jets to Ukraine,” 42 Republican senators, led by Sen. JONI ERNST (R-Iowa) and including Senate Minority Leader MITCH McCONNELL, wrote to Biden in a Thursday letter.

“At this point, why are we picking and choosing what we think would constitute a bridge too far with Putin? He has said in the past he thinks sanctions are an act of war. We’ve been sending in military equipment already that is being used against Russian soldiers and likely killing Russian soldiers. We don’t understand why the administration thinks these planes will somehow become the straw that broke the camel’s back,” said a senior House GOP aide.

Democrats are pushing back. “Bottom line is Congress and the admin have poured an unprecedented amount of defensive and lethal aid to Ukraine to meet their most urgent needs. If Ukraine needs planes, we’ll find a way,” a senior Democratic staffer texted NatSec Daily. “But right now, it’s clear that’s not at the top of the list of what they need. But yet again, Republicans seem to be looking for ways to use Ukraine to score political points at home.”

U.S. ENDS NORMAL TRADE TIES WITH RUSSIA: Biden announced that he wants to work with Congress to impose Cold War-era trade restrictions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, our own DOUG PALMER reported.

Removing “permanent normal trade relations,” or PNTR, with Russia “is going to make it harder for Russia to do business with the United States and doing it in unison with other nations that make up half of the global economy will be another crushing blow to the Russian economy. It’s already suffering very badly from our sanctions,” Biden said at a White House event to announce coordinated action with Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom as well as the European Union.

Biden also announced he was banning imports of Russian seafood, vodka and diamonds, which White House officials said collectively totaled more than $1 billion.

The Commerce Department also moved Friday to cut off Russia’s access to luxury goods, imposing restrictions on the export and reexport of American-made booze, jewelry, vehicles and clothing to all consumers in both Russia and neighboring Belarus.

Congress could vote on repealing PNTR as early as next week. “Vladimir Putin doesn’t get to tear down the international order, brutalize the Ukrainian people with his unjust war and then benefit from normal trade relations,” Senate Finance Chair RON WYDEN (D-Ore.) said.

RUSSIAN DRONES ARRIVE: Two weeks into the war, and Russian drones are finally starting to show up on the battlefield. Social media posts by Ukraine watchers have identified Russian Orlan and Forpost surveillance drones on the ground, suggesting that the lack of evidence of Russian unmanned operations doesn’t mean their absence.

The fact that small Russian units have been so regularly ambushed in the early days of the war indicates they weren’t using small drones for surveillance and reconnaissance, in effect ignoring their own doctrine and training, said SAMUEL BENDETT, an adviser with CNA’s Russia Studies Program and adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security.

“They were supposed to have [intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance] ISR assets overhead,” Bendett said. While the Russian ground forces are still making “strange mistakes and errors, we are starting to see evidence of Russian UAVs as ISR assets” helping them out over the past several days.

The Russian defense ministry — possibly trying to match the epic videos of Ukrainian Bayraktar drones wiping out Russian armor — has released two videos of their Orion mid-range combat drone firing missiles at Ukrainian targets. “They're doing sort of a piecemeal PR by showing that an Orion drone is capable of striking targets,” Bendett said. But it’s still not clear how many drones Russia is flying, or why they don’t seem to be feeding useful intel back to the forces on the ground who continue to be surprised, and attacked, by the Ukrainians.

UKRAINE ON THE BRAIN: Instead of our normal Friday “Drinks with NatSec Daily” feature, for the next few weeks we’ll ask members of our community to send us their favorite things about Ukraine.

Today, we’re featuring the memories of Puck News’ JULIA IOFFE, who has been a must-read source on all things Ukraine these past few weeks. Here’s what she sent in:

“My favorite fact about Ukraine is that it gave us both the Beylis trial and [Ukrainian President] VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY. It is a country that had fought and worked to break away from its past, from its Soviet past, its nationalist, anti-Semitic past. It wasn't always perfect, but it was doing it, forging its way into a better, more tolerant, more democratic future. It is awful to see it being punished for exactly that, for having a future that is unlike its past,” she wrote.

“Favorite memory is sitting with my grandmother one evening on the patio of a traditional Odessa courtyard where we were staying with her cousin Volodya and his Greek-Ukrainian wife Galya. My grandmother's father and Volodya's father were brothers, born in Odessa to a poor, alcoholic Jewish cobbler. There were something like 11 siblings and they all scattered across the Soviet Union. Now we were sitting under the stars in their fathers' home city, drinking beer, and telling old Odessa jokes because Odessa is the wellspring of Jewish humor,” she continued.

Please send us your favorite memories of Ukraine and we’ll try to feature them in an upcoming Friday edition of NatSec Daily.

Flashpoints

EU DOESN’T FAST TRACK UKRAINE MEMBERSHIP: The European Union firmly sided with Ukraine during a summit in Versailles Friday, but stopped short of promising to admit the country into the bloc any time soon.

“The European Council acknowledged the European aspirations and the European choice of Ukraine,” the EU said in a statement, adding that it’s moving “swiftly” to get the European Commission’s “opinion” on the matter. As our own DAVID HERSZENHORN and JACOPO BARIGAZZI reported, all this means is Ukraine is at the “the initial stage of a long process toward being declared a candidate country and beginning membership talks.”

“While the statement was unequivocal in voicing the EU’s intention to help Ukraine, including with political and financial assistance and temporary protection for refugees, it did not offer the guarantee of membership that Zelenskyy had requested,” they continued. “A number of EU countries, led by the Netherlands, had insisted that there was no way to shortcut the lengthy accession process, even for Ukraine, which is under active military attack by Russia.”

Still, the EU will contribute around $550 million in assistance to Ukraine and further pledged to rebuild the country after the war — “presuming the country still exists and has not been occupied by” Russian forces, Herszenhorn and Barigazzi wrote.

DID DRONE FROM UKRAINE WAR LAND IN CROATIA? The War Zone’s TYLER ROGOWAY has a wild story about a drone from the Ukraine-Russia war possibly crash landing in Croatia — a NATO country.

“After close examination of the visual evidence, The War Zone strongly believes this was actually a Tu-141 ‘Strizh’ reconnaissance drone that must have severely malfunctioned and crossed over the entirety of Hungary or parts of neighboring countries and into Croatia from Ukraine. Flying direct from Ukraine's border to Zagreb is nearly a 350-mile journey. It has been reported that Ukraine has been putting the high-speed, Soviet-era drones to work in recent days following Russia's invasion of the country. Ukraine is the only known current operator of the Tu-141,” Rogoway wrote.

Croatian President ZORAN MILANOVIĆ said the drone crash was a “serious incident” but “was not directed at Croatia.”

“The drone flew over Hungary for over 40 minutes, it was less than seven minutes in the Croatian air space, and crashed in the Jarun neighbourhood, fortunately with no casualties,” he said in a Friday statement. “[C]ertain procedural things must be examined, we must ascertain how it has come to this, and how come a drone the size of an airplane was not struck down on its path from evidently Ukraine to Zagreb.”



Keystrokes

YOUTUBE BLOCKS RUSSIAN STATE MEDIA WORLDWIDE: YouTube announced on Friday that it’s banning Russian-state funded media channels on its video platform globally, setting up potential pushback and blockage by Moscow.

Google's video platform announcement has larger implications for how Russia spreads its state-run propaganda through its RT (formerly Russia Today) and Sputnik channels on YouTube, which will no longer be accessible in Russia or the rest of the world. This is an expansion from YouTube's ban of these channels in Europe on March 1, due to the spread of disinformation justifying Russia's invasion into Ukraine.

YouTube's actions — the furthest the platform has taken since Russia's invasion in Ukraine — puts the company square in the target of Russia's communications regulator, Roskomnadzor. The regulator has blocked Facebook and restricted access to Instagram due to their parent company's efforts to clamp down on Russian disinformation and the prevalence of Ukrainians calling for violence against Russian soldiers, our own REBECCA KERN wrote (for Pros!).



WH BRIEFED TIKTOKERS ON UKRAINE: I guess we can now add TikTok stars as extended members of the White House press corps.

Per The Washington Post’s TAYLOR LORENZ, White House press secretary JEN PSAKI and her team briefed 30 influential TikTokers about the administration’s Ukraine policy and strategic goals. The aim — other than promoting viral dances or one-person bits — is to better inform those with large followings so they can spread that message to the larger public.

“This week, the administration began working with Gen Z For Change, a nonprofit advocacy group, to help identify top content creators on the platform to orchestrate a briefing aimed at answering questions about the conflict and the United States’ role in it. VICTORIA HAMMETT, deputy executive director of Gen Z For Change, contacted dozens with invitations via email and gathered potential questions for the Biden administration,” Lorenz wrote.

“The invitations to the event were distributed Tuesday and Wednesday. KAHLIL GREENE, 21, a creator with more than 534,000 followers on TikTok, said he wasn’t surprised when an invitation arrived in his email inbox. ‘People in my generation get all our information from TikTok,’ he said. ‘It’s the first place we’re searching up new topics and learning about things.’ So, he figured, it made sense that the Biden administration would engage people like him on the platform,” Greene told Lorenz.

You can listen to the 50-minute recording of the call, led by special adviser for communications MATT MILLER.



The Complex

HERMEUS PAYDAY: Our friends at Morning Defense (for Pros!) reported that hypersonic aircraft company Hermeus raised $100 million — bringing its total to $176 million to make a new (very) fast plane.

Backers include In-Q-Tel, a nonprofit tech investor for U.S. intelligence agencies, and Founders Fund, the VC outfit that has invested in other start-ups such as Anduril, Palantir and SpaceX.

The Air Force has invested up to $30 million in the Atlanta-based company to expand the hypersonic propulsion industrial base. Hermeus was the only start-up present at the Pentagon’s unclassified meeting in February on hypersonic weapons development.

The new funding will be used to complete the development of the hypersonic aircraft Quarterhorse — which is slated to make its first flight next year — and accelerate the uncrewed Darkhorse. Both projects are expected to assist in development of Halcyon, a hypersonic commercial passenger aircraft.



On the Hill

$1.5B McCONNELL-SCHUMER CALL: McConnell and Senate Majority Leader CHUCK SCHUMER’s call this week led to the doubling of a $1.5 billion fund to assist Ukraine’s troops.

“While Ukraine came under attack, Congress scrambled to boost lethal and humanitarian aid for the European ally. So as leaders finalized a $1.5 trillion government spending bill that included emergency assistance for Ukraine, the Senate GOP leader phoned his Democratic counterpart this week with a simple but significant request: Double the size of a critical $1.5 billion fund for Ukraine to help its military fight Russian invaders,” our own BURGESS EVERETT and ANDREW DESIDERIO wrote.

“To Chuck’s credit, he said, ‘OK,’” McConnell recalled in an interview Thursday in his Capitol office. “It wasn’t a hard sell.”

All told, the bill Biden will soon sign will more than double his initial request of $6.4 billion for Ukraine to roughly $14 billion. Senators in both parties negotiating the aid deal described a pot of money that ballooned each day as Russia’s assault on Ukraine escalated, killing civilians and sending millions of refugees across Europe.

“I do think that they’ve taken every step they’ve needed to take, but not soon enough to have had a real impact,” McConnell said of the Biden administration. Nonetheless, he described his approach to Biden this way: “What I’m trying to do is, in a respectful way, get him to change. I’m not trying to take political advantage of the situation. I’m trying to influence him.”

FUNDING FIGHT FINISHED: A $1.5 trillion government spending package is ready for Biden's signature after it passed the Senate Thursday night in a 68-31 vote.

The deal provides a major funding hike to the Pentagon. National defense programs — including the Pentagon, nuclear programs and other security initiatives — get $782 billion for the full year, roughly $29 billion more than Biden sought. The package also includes nearly $14 billion in emergency military and humanitarian aid for Ukraine.

The package ultimately won strong backing from Democrats, despite progressives' push to hold the line on defense spending. Democrats ultimately agreed to back a big Pentagon increase to lock in a major boost for spending on their domestic priorities.

No Democratic senators opposed the spending package. When the defense portion of omnibus came up for a vote Wednesday in the House, just 15 Democrats voted against it.

Our colleagues SARAH FERRIS and CONNOR O'BRIEN previewed the progressive defense dilemma earlier this week.

EGYPT DEAL SEALED: The Senate on Thursday also rejected in a whopping 19-80 vote a resolution from Sen. RAND PAUL (R-Ky.) to cancel a $2.2 billion sale of a dozen C-130J cargo planes to Egypt over the country's human rights record.

The Biden administration has walked a fine line with Egypt, notifying lawmakers about the sale in January within days of withholding $130 million in military aid due to human rights concerns. But most senators were fine allowing the sale of non-lethal equipment to go forward. Connor has the details.

Broadsides

RUBIO BASHES NSC STAFFER: Sen. MARCO RUBIO wishes there were a dislike button on Instagram so he could smash it for a pic by a top NSC staffer.

Rubio tweeted out an IG picture of JUAN GONZALEZ, the NSC’s Western Hemisphere lead. He recently traveled to Venezuela for a meeting with officials in Caracas, namely to secure the release of Americans hostages and convince Caracas to export oil to the U.S. But the Florida lawmaker — a longtime Venezuela hawk — didn’t appreciate the photo Gonzalez posted on his personal account.

“This is Biden’s NSC staffer for Western Hemisphere posting on instagram like he is a celebrity as he flies in the luxury of a government jet to #Caracas to meet with a narco-dictator responsible for 6 million refugees who have had to flee #Venezuela,” Rubio tweeted.

It’s unclear precisely why this bothered Rubio so much. Perhaps if Gonzalez were on his way somewhere other than Venezuela it wouldn’t have irked him. Still, this social media squabble underscores the intense resistance the White House is facing for thawing relations with Venezuela, including from some Democrats.

Gonzalez did return home having secured the release of two unlawfully detained Americans, however.

The Russians can fire cruise missles from planes on the Russia side of the border without risking a strike by Ukraine's air defenses.

Ukraine still has about 56 operational jets flying five to 10 hours every day, according senior US defense official.

The Pentagon says some Russian jets are avoiding Ukrainian airspace, apparently to avoid being shot down by Ukraine's air defense systems.

During a background briefing with reporters, a senior US defense official said the Pentagon assesses that Russia is flying about 200 sorties every day but some never enter Ukraine's air space. Instead, the Russians are able to fire aerial-mounted cruise missiles at Ukraine from planes on the Russian side of the border.

It was widely assumed by defense analysts that Russia would quickly gain air superiority during its invasion of Ukraine, but Russia's Aerospace Forces have played little role as the ground forces have struggled to take major cities in the face of stalwart Ukraine fighters.

Many observers were expecting Russian bombers to knock out Ukraine's radar installations and surface-to-air missile batteries, leaving air superiority fighters like the Su-35 to attack Ukraine's aircraft as it moved its own SAM systems into Ukraine. But Russia failed to do so and Ukraine's smaller air force and its missiles have downed Russian planes.

Similarly, Russia's fleet of combat helicopters has largely gone unusued, another signal that Russian commanders are aware of the risks posed by air defenses and increasingly shoulder-fired missiles like the Stingers the US is sending.

In the first days of the war in Ukraine, researchers at Oryx — a blog that tracks military equipment losses through open-source data — found that Russia lost a number of combat jets to Ukraine's defense systems.

The skirting of Ukrainian air space suggests Russia warplanes are aware of these still considerable dangers.

In an interview on Wednesday, an expert on the Russian military said he's seeing signs that its air force is ""risk averse"" and said there's still debate as to why.

""Maybe they're saving their aircraft in case this conflict goes wider,"" said Jeffrey Edmonds, an expert on the Russian military with the Arlington, Va.-based research organization CNA.

4,af326aee-5447-49d3-812e-6760521902fa,"['Abc News', 'Matt Seyler', 'March']",,"But Russia is flying 20 times as many sorties as Ukraine.

The Pentagon has been providing daily updates on the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine's efforts to resist.

Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters on Friday:

Russia flying 20 times as many sorties as Ukraine

Russian military planes are flying an average of 200 sorties per day, compared to only about 10 per day flown by Ukraine, according to the official.

Much of the airspace above Ukraine is heavily guarded by both Ukrainian and Russian surface-to-air missiles, making air operations risky for both sides.

But Russian aircraft don't have to enter Ukrainian airspace to do damage.

""You can launch cruise missiles from aircraft from a great distance away. And if your target is relatively close, you don't need to enter the airspace,"" the official said.

For the first time, the official gave details on the total number of functioning Ukrainian fighter jets and how much they're being used.

""They have 56 available to them now, fully operational, and they're only flying them five to 10 hours a day,"" the official said.

Ukraine needs drones, not jets: Official

Noting Russia's vast umbrella of anti-aircraft capability over Ukraine and its larger air force, the official repeated some of the arguments we heard from the Pentagon earlier this week about the relative ineffectiveness of sending more aircraft to Ukraine.

""It makes little sense to us that additional fixed-wing aircraft is going to have somehow solve all these problems. What they need are surface-to-air missile systems, they need MANPADS, they need anti-armor, and they need small arms and ammunition, and they need these drones, because that's what they're using with great effect. And so, that's what we're focused on,"" the official said.

Ukrainian forces are making ""terrific"" use of drones, especially against Russian ground movements, according to the official. The drones can be also used both for reconnaissance and surveillance.

""They're trained on how to use them, they can fly below radar coverage by the Russians,"" the official said.

They are also much cheaper than fighter aircraft, and being unmanned, don't risk pilots being killed or captured.

Chemical weapons and false flags

The official said that despite claims from China and Russia, the U.S. is not helping Ukraine create or use any chemical or biological weapons.

""This is bio research with regard to two things: One, helping Ukraine over the years decrease the pathogen inventory that they had under Soviet years, and then to develop strategies to defeat pathogens going forward,"" the official said. ""It's scientific research, it's not bio-weapons capabilities.""

The official said the U.S. has nothing to hide, and that information on its role in scientific work in Ukraine was already publicly available.

""The only reason why we elevated the discussion is because the Russians and the Chinese decided to lie about it -- just flat out lie,"" the official said.

The official would not offer any U.S. intelligence assessment of the likelihood of Russian President Vladimir Putin deploying chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine.

""We know that the Russians have had -- and we assess that they still have -- a sophisticated chemical and biological weapons program. I'm not going to talk about intelligence assessments about what they may do with that program or what, if any, designs they might have on Ukraine in that regard,"" the official said.

The official said Russia's ""ridiculous narrative"" could possibly ""be building a pretext for some sort of false flag event.""

State of the invasion

The push to Kyiv: Russians have not moved any closer to Kyiv from the northwest since yesterday, still approximately 9 miles from city center. But the U.S. has seen rear elements move up closer to those advance troops. Russians advancing on the capital from northeast now 12-19 miles out.

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters Friday that the Russians coming from the east, while further from Kyiv, are gaining more ground than those to the northwest near the Hostomel Airport.

""We do assess that the Russians are beginning to make more momentum on the ground towards Kyiv, particularly from the east, not quite so much from the north,"" Kirby said.

Kharkiv: Russians are ""closing in,"" but the city is well defended and hasn't been taken yet.

Mariupol: The port city is under increasing pressure today. It is surrounded from northeast and southwest, under heavy bombardment, but Ukrainians are fighting back there.

Kherson: The city remains under Russian control: ""We continue to assess that they have Kherson,"" the official said.

Mykolayiv: Russian forces remain to the northeast of the city, though it is under increasing pressure. ""We've observed the Ukrainians are continuing to defend the city, and the Russians are just outside the city,"" the official said.

Lutsk and Ivano-Frankovsk: The Russians struck airfields in each city Friday.

""Obviously, they wanted to eliminate the Ukrainians' ability to use these airfields,"" the official said.

The official did not know how much the Ukrainians were using these two airfields or how extensive the damage was.

""What's unusual about it is that [the Russians] haven't been striking in western Ukraine,"" the official said of the strikes.

Russian missile strikes

The Russians have now launched nearly 810 missiles against Ukraine -- almost half have been fired from within Ukraine using mobile platforms. The rest have been fired from Russia, Belarus, and a small number from the Black Sea. This is up from an estimate of 775 missiles offered by the official Thursday.

Majority of combat power intact

Russia still has roughly 90% of its invading combat power still viable, with Ukraine falling just under 90%, the official said.",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ukraine-drones-great-effect-russian-forces-pentagon-updates/story?id=83391603

The Biden administration, under pressure to expand the arsenal of weapons that Ukraine has in its conflict with Russia, is working with European allies to expedite more sophisticated air-defense systems and other armaments into the war zone, U.S. officials said Friday.

ArrowRight Discussions were ongoing ahead of Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s planned trip next week to meet with NATO allies in Brussels and Slovakia, which along with Poland and Romania has indicated a willingness to transfer military aid to its embattled neighbor. Slovakia also possesses the S-300 surface-to-air missile system, which is used to shoot down enemy aircraft and is familiar to the Ukrainians.

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters that the United States is committed to arming the government in Kyiv with “the kinds of capabilities that we know the Ukrainians need and are using very well.” He declined to specify what types of weapons could be included in the next wave of shipments.

“Some of that material we have and are providing. Some of that material we don’t have but we know others have, and we’re helping coordinate that as well,” Kirby said.

The administration is facing backlash over its decision earlier this week to scuttle Poland’s proposal that would have sent a number of its MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine via a transfer “free of charge” to the United States. Washington, citing concerns that Russia would view the move as a provocation, said the offer from Warsaw was not “tenable.”

Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, have pleaded for the MiG-29 transfer. And while they have support from a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers, the Biden administration, citing assessments from senior American military commanders in Europe, has said the additional aircraft would offer only minimal value to Ukraine given the contested nature of its airspace.

“We believe the most effective way to support the Ukrainian military in their fight against Russia is to provide increased amounts of antitank weapons and air defense systems, which is ongoing with the international community,” said Air Force Gen. Tod Wolters the chief of U.S. European Command. “The Ukrainians are making excellent use of these weapons now.”

NATO countries have been limited in what they can send to Ukraine due in part to the Ukrainian military’s training, which centers heavily on Soviet- or Russian-made weapons that exist in dwindling stock.

Ukraine has sought the S-300 surface-to-air missile system, said a senior European official familiar with the situation. There are ongoing talks about that possibility, the official said, but questions remain about whether there are any that can be spared.

“Nobody wants to mishandle expectations,” said the official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.

Ukrainian troops also are trained on the Buk surface-to-air missile system — the same type of weapon that shot down a Malaysia Airlines civilian jet over a part of eastern Ukraine held by Russian-backed separatists in 2014. Some eastern European countries possess both systems, but in small numbers, the European official said.

Austin’s upcoming visit to Slovakia could be used to secure additional agreements to use its railways to facilitate faster transfers of humanitarian aid and fuel into Ukraine, the European official said. Unlike some other countries nearby, Slovakia has a shipping hub that operates on both European standard-gauge rail and the wider-gauge rail used in Ukraine, making it an appealing option.

Assessments of how long the Ukrainians can continue to hold out against the Russian onslaught are intertwined with what weapons they already have.

On Friday, a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the United States sent a letter to President Biden asking him to transfer manned and unmanned aircraft to Ukraine, saying that “despite heroic and skilled resistance,” the Russians had achieved air superiority over the Ukrainians. That went farther than U.S. defense officials, who have noted the Russians have a significantly larger air force but had been unable to control the skies over Ukraine.

“Russia’s advantage in this domain could soon develop into air dominance if the Ukrainians do not receive necessary military aid,” the lawmakers said.

The lawmakers called for the continued delivery of Stinger missiles, man-portable antiaircraft weapons, but also called for the United States to facilitate the transfer of S-300 systems.

“Providing Soviet-era platforms that Ukrainian servicemembers have previously operated and maintained will be essential to their success on the battlefield and will also protect U.S. defense technology from falling into the hands of the Russians,” lawmakers said in the letter, which was first reported by Politico.

They also urged the president to reconsider the Polish MiG decision and said the Biden administration should look for ways to send more armed drones and Su-25 aircraft to Ukraine. The jet is used by a handful of U.S. allies and partners, including Bulgaria, a NATO nation.

The lawmakers signing the letter Friday included numerous U.S. veterans.

Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.), a former Army Ranger who is among the signatories, said the administration was drawing a nonsensical distinction between acceptable weapons and those it considers potentially too escalatory.

“I don’t believe there is a distinction between providing a MiG and providing a Javelin and a Stinger,” he said. “These are defensive systems; we are not providing offensive capabilities because Ukraine is not on the offense, all they’re doing is fighting for their survival and trying to maintain their democracy against a Vladimir Putin invasion.”

Crow also said that while the provision of Javelins and Stingers has been useful thus far, the West must step up its contributions to give Ukraine a chance to sustain its resistance — particularly in the skies, where Zelensky’s forces are trying to prevent Russia from achieving superiority.

“Short of MiGs, they need more advanced ground-to-air missile systems,” Crow said, noting that the Stingers provided to Ukraine work well against helicopters and planes conducting low-altitude bombing runs, but aren’t enough to ground the Russian air force. “They need something that can reach out and conduct regional air defense, higher altitude air defense.”

Rep. Michael Waltz (R.-Fla.), who has served in Special Forces units and also signed the letter, said that transferring S-300 systems and components of them, such as radar, could be helpful.

Among Western weapons, the Ukrainians also could benefit from the Avenger system, which allows Stinger missiles to be mounted to vehicles, he said. Other American air-defense systems, including Patriot missiles, require too much training to make them practical in the near term.

The Ukrainians could benefit, too, from counter-battery radar systems, which scan for the originating locations of incoming artillery fire, and its equipment they’ve asked for before, Waltz said.

“At a minimum, once the Russians know you have that, they won’t be able to just sit there and lob round after round after round,” Waltz said. “It degrades their ability to just sit there and pummel you. They have to move, obviously, because now you have the ability to counter-battery.”

The Ukrainian military has 56 fighter jets left and is using them just five to 10 hours per day, a senior U.S. defense official said Friday. The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the Pentagon, cited that as one reason the administration had decided against transferring the MiGs to Ukraine, noting that Russian surface-to-air missile systems can reach just about anywhere over the war zone.

U.S. officials continue to speak to the Ukrainians regularly, the defense official said, and the “things they need the most” are antiaircraft and antiarmor weapons, such as Javelin missiles. For items the Ukrainians need that the United States does not have, the administration is working with allies and partners “who might have inventory.”

“We’re trying to help them further that defense in ways and with systems that they know how to use already,” the official said. “They’re good at it, and it’s having effect on the Russians.”

6,af326aee-5447-49d3-812e-6760521902fa,[],2022-03-11,"WASHINGTON — Russian troops launched long-range ballistic missiles Friday at two airfields in western Ukraine, which could indicate invasion forces are preparing to push deeper into that region of the country, chief Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said.

The Russian Defense Ministry on Friday said it launched missile attacks on military airfields in Luska and Ivano-Frankivsk, which are about 70 and 130 miles from the Polish border, respectively.

While it wasn’t the first time Russia has targeted areas in western Ukraine, its forces have largely stayed away from the part of the country that borders NATO nations such as Poland and Slovakia, and their ground forces remain in the east.

""It's not like there hasn't been any airstrikes in western Ukraine since the beginning of this operation 16 days ago, it's just that we haven't seen that as a routine,” Kirby said. “Now you've got two in one day. That's notable.""

The Pentagon spokesman said it's unclear whether the Russians struck the two western Ukraine airfields in response to international attention placed on Poland’s offer of MiG-29 fighter jets to the U.S. with the expectation American forces would deliver them to Ukraine. U.S. officials rejected the plan, but they said they cannot stop Poland from providing the aircraft to Ukraine on its own.

More so, a senior U.S. defense official said Friday that Pentagon officials do not believe the jets would make much difference in the war, as the Ukrainians still have about 80% of their fixed-wing fighter aircraft available — only a fraction of which are flying daily.

""It's not clear to us that additional fixed-wing aircraft are actually going to be a contributing factor in helping Ukraine mount the defense that they've been mounting so effectively,” said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity. “They have 56 available to them now fully operational, and then only flying five to 10 a day.""

The official said other weapons such as surface-to-air missiles, man-portable air-defense systems, anti-armor weapons and drones are being used against the Russian forces with “great effect.”

“I think we all understand that [Ukraine is] being careful in marshaling their fixed-wing inventory,” the official said. “But it's [unclear] to us how additional fixed-wing aircraft is going to have somehow solve all this problem.”

The U.S. continues to send security-assistance packages to Ukraine, including during the past 24 hours, Kirby said.

Russia has launched nearly 810 missiles since the start of the war — almost half have been fired from inside Ukraine and the other half from Russia and Belarus, the official said. Six were shot from Russian vessels in the Black Sea.

To this point in the war, the Belarus military has not invaded Ukraine, though that country has allowed Russia to launch missiles from its territory and move troops into Ukraine.

On Thursday, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko told his defense ministry in a note that the army must prevent rear attacks on Russian forces advancing south from Belarus into Ukraine.

“That's the first time that he's ever said anything about Belarus getting involved, but [there are] no indications at this time that they have,” Kirby said. “We haven't seen any indications that Belarusian troops or forces have moved inside Ukraine.”

Russia’s challenges

Lukashenko was referring to the Russian troops who have been stuck for nearly two weeks in a 40-mile convoy outside the Ukraine capital of Kyiv, Kirby said. On Friday, some forces started to slowly disperse off the road.

However, the movement doesn’t mean the convoy is making progress toward Kyiv or regrouping for a renewed mission, Kirby said. It might be they are simply taking cover from Ukrainian attacks.

“I don't want to make too much of the fact that there's satellite imageries … [of] the convoy moving off into tree lines or dispersing,” he said. “That could just be force protection because Ukrainians have continued to threaten that convoy and its progress.""

U.S. officials have said they believe food and fuel shortages, as well as Ukrainian resistance, have stalled the convoy. A defense official on Friday criticized Russia’s poor planning and execution of its invasion, especially with logistics and sustainment of its forces during the invasion.

“I think what you're seeing is poor planning running up against actual execution ... this is not a military that has great expeditionary experience or capability,” the official said. “This is an operation that they’ve never [done] before — not since World War II.”

That inexperience also led to challenges for Russian forces with integrating its ground and air forces. For a military operation of the size and scope that Russia has launched in Ukraine, the official said ground operations must be supported by air forces.

“For all [Russia's] advanced capabilities — and they have resourced their military fairly well, they have bought sophisticated systems — it doesn't appear ... they have developed the proper operational concepts to use these modern capabilities,” the official said.

Russian advance

Kyiv was under heavy fire Friday from several Russian lines of attack, but there are still no indications that Russian forces have further progressed toward Ukraine’s capital city, the official said.

The closest line of advance remains about 9 miles from the Kyiv’s center, but Russia has “moved rear elements up closer to the advanced elements [headed for Kyiv,] so they're still trying to make some progress there.""

In northeastern Ukraine, Russia continues “closing in on” Kharkiv, the official said. Invading forces are “on the outskirts” of Ukraine’s second-largest city, but Ukrainian troops continue fighting them to prevent Russia from taking control of Kharkiv.

""We are seeing more reports of internet outage there,” the official said. “It seems to be part of the [Russian] playbook, right? When you encircle a town … you start shutting off the communication so that people can't communicate outside of it.""

In southern Ukraine, where Russian forces have had more success, Russian troops have isolated Mariupol and they are trying to “increase their pressure” with heavy bombardment as the Ukrainians fight back to defend the city of about 450,000 people.

Russia is also increasing pressure on Mykolaiv in southern Ukraine, though it has not taken control of the city, the official said.

“The Ukrainians are continuing to defend the city, and the Russians are just outside the city, mostly to the northeast,” the official said. “But it continues to be heavily fought over.""

Kirby said Ukrainians are ""fighting skillfully, bravely, quite creatively” throughout the country as the war drags into its third week.

“The fighting isn't just by their armed forces — average citizens ... [are] getting arms [from] the government and learning how to use them and using them,” he said. “Some of the resistance has been nonviolent ... with crowds of Ukrainians blocking city streets and actually stopping in their tracks some Russian units.""",https://www.stripes.com/theaters/europe/2022-03-11/ukraine-russian-invasion-belarus-pentagon-war-kyiv-5313331.html

Yesterday saw high level tripartite talks in Turkey but these appear to have achieved little. The shelling of Ukrainian cities continues but no significant changes on the ground have been observed.

It appears that there is localised fighting on all fronts but no sign of a renewed major thrust from Russian forces. The Institute for the Study of War has gone so far as to suggest that the likelihood of Ukrainian forces fighting Russia to a standstill is increasing. It is claimed by open source intelligence (OSINT) sources that Russian missiles struck Lutsk airport in the far West of Ukraine last night, possibly striking Ukrainian air force assets, this is yet to be verified.

Today, Ukraine has warned of Russia’s intention to carry out a false flag operation on the stricken Soviet nuclear plant at Chernobyl. Meanwhile Russia has restricted access to Instagram, following earlier moves to block Facebook and Twitter, claiming the platform has hosted calls for violence against Russians.
