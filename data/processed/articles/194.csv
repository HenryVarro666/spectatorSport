“And unless there is an immediate end to the conflict, millions more are likely to be forced to flee Ukraine.”

Commitment to stay

Mr. Grandi reported that staff from the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, remain in Ukraine, along with other humanitarians, working where and when they can in frightening conditions.

“Our staff stay, even at great risk, because we know the needs in the country are huge,” he said.

Teams are also working throughout the region to scale-up protection and assistance programmes for the refugees, in support of host governments.

Most of the refugees have headed to Poland and other neighbouring countries such as Hungary, Moldova, Romania and Slovakia.

A UNHCR data portal, unveiled on Wednesday, is keeping track of arrivals.

Mr. Grandi commended regional governments and local communities that have taken in refugees, though stressing that ending the conflict is the only solution.

“International solidarity has been heartwarming,” he said. “But nothing – nothing – can replace the need for the guns to be silenced; for dialogue and diplomacy to succeed. Peace is the only way to halt this tragedy.”

Concern for third country nationals

Among the masses leaving Ukraine are people from dozens of other countries, including migrant workers and students.

Some have encountered challenges as they attempt to escape conflict-affected areas, cross borders, or seek life-saving assistance.

The head of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) was alarmed by verified credible reports of discrimination, violence and xenophobia against third country nationals.

“Let me be clear, discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, nationality or migration status is unacceptable,” said IOM Director General, António Vitorino.

He stressed that neighbouring countries must allow all people fleeing Ukraine to access their territory, while assistance and protection must be provided in a manner that is non-discriminatory and culturally appropriate.

No legal justification

Independent UN human rights experts have also weighed in on the issue, citing reports by individuals and the media about discrimination against African students and their dependents.

“Measures that differentiate between people, on any ground, especially on the basis of race or ethnicity, are not only legally unjustifiable but morally and ethically repugnant as we embrace our common humanity and fight for fundamental freedoms,” the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent said in a statement.

The members of the Working Group operate in their individual capacity, and are neither UN staff nor do they receive a salary from the Organization.

They were appointed by the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, which began its annual month-long session this week. On Thursday, the Council held an urgent debate on the situation in Ukraine.

Death toll likely higher

Nearly 250 people have been killed since the start of the Russian onslaught on 24 February, the UN human rights office, OHCHR, reported on Thursday.

The victims include 31 men, 27 women, six boys and three girls, as well as 174 adults and eight children whose sex is yet unknown. Meanwhile, 553 people have been injured.

OHCHR believes that real figures are considerably higher, especially in Government-controlled territory and particularly in recent days, due to delays in information from areas where intense fighting is taking place.

The UN office added that Ukraine’s Ministry of Health has reported 352 persons killed, and more than 1,680 injured.

Mobilizing staff and supplies

As needs continue to grow in Ukraine, the UN and partners are scaling up assistance to people who have fled across borders as well as those who remain inside the country.

Humanitarian agencies were already present in Ukraine, where Government forces and separatists have been battling in the east since 2014. They were reaching more than 1.5 million people prior to the current crisis.

Osnat Lubrani, UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator, said programmes will be expanded, while new operations will be established wherever required across the country.

She stressed that warring parties must ensure unimpeded access to people in need.

“As anywhere in the world, the work of UN teams and our humanitarian partners is always neutral, impartial and independent: we are here to help the most vulnerable civilians, whoever and wherever they are,” she said.

Solidarity with workers

The head of the International Labour Organization (ILO), Guy Ryder, has highlighted the need to support Ukraine’s workers.

He joined the UN General Assembly, which, on Wednesday, adopted a resolution condemning the Russian military offensive in the country.

“Those responsible for the aggression know full well that among its first victims will be working people and that the devastation of jobs, enterprises and livelihoods will be massive and endure for many years,” said Mr. Ryder.

He underscored the agency’s duty “to stand in solidarity with the government, workers, and employers of Ukraine and to join with the rest of the United Nations system in providing all possible assistance to them.”",https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/03/1113192

Others have found shelter in Hungary, Moldova, Romania, Slovakia and beyond. Nearly 43,000 have also moved to the Russian Federation.

Deciding to leave

As the conflict intensifies, families have been escaping Ukraine any way they can. Some have been walking long distances in freezing temperatures, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has reported.

Tania, who is from the city of Chernivtsi, located in western Ukraine near the border with Romania, had to make a snap decision to leave home with her family.

She escaped with her sister Sophia, 19, and daughter Mia, 2, just days after Russia launched the military offensive on 24 February.

“The decision was taken in just a few moments, because the situation in Ukraine is very hard and you don’t know what it will be the next minute,” she told UNICEF.

Round-the-clock support

UN agencies are working around the clock to support the displaced Ukrainians flooding across western borders, half of whom are children.

UNHCR has been in the region for years and is coordinating the refugee response together with sister UN agencies and partners, in support of national authorities.

In Poland, for example, staff are supporting the authorities with registering refugees and providing them with accommodation and assistance.

Families on the move need basic necessities such as shelter, food and water, while children traumatized by the violence they have witnessed also require psychosocial care, UNICEF said.

Agency staff are at the Palanca crossing point on the border between Moldova and Ukraine, where a temporary refugee centre has been established.

The team has delivered several tons of desperately needed basic hygiene products, such as disinfectant, diapers and wipes.

Safe spaces for families

UNICEF is setting up ‘Blue Dot’ safe spaces at border points and other key locations in receiving countries to support delivery of emergency services to families.

These centres were crucial during the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe in 2015-2016.

Blue Dot hubs offer a range of services, including safe spaces for mothers and children, psychosocial support, basic legal counselling, recreational kits and hygiene products.

Unaccompanied and separated children can also get help, and there are places where boys and girls can play.

Disaster back home

Nine-year-old Yaroslav and his mother, Vica, were planning to cross into Romania after travelling several days from their hometown, Kherson, in southern Ukraine.

“Our family is there. All the time they are sheltering. It’s a disaster,” said Vica. “We have a couple of friends in Europe, maybe we can go there, we don’t know. Maybe Spain, but I’m not sure right now”.

Vica has spoken with friends who have stayed behind in Kherson. “All the kids there are terrified to death, hiding in bathrooms, in the shelters, hiding in basements,” she said.

Ramping up response

The UN has launched a $1.7 billion appeal to provide urgently-needed assistance in Ukraine and to support refugees and neighbouring countries hosting them.

It is estimated that 12 million people inside Ukraine will need relief and protection, while more than four million refugees may need protection and assistance in the coming months.

“This is the darkest hour for the people of Ukraine,” said Martin Griffiths, the UN humanitarian affairs chief.

“We need to ramp up our response now to protect the lives and dignity of ordinary Ukrainians. We must respond with compassion and solidarity.”",https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/03/1113102

GENEVA (AP) — The U.N. refugee agency said Thursday that 1 million people have now fled Ukraine since Russia’s invasion less than a week ago, an exodus without precedent in this century for its speed.

The tally from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees amounts to more than 2% of Ukraine’s population — which the World Bank counted at 44 million at the end of 2020 — on the move across borders in just seven days. The agency cautions that the outflows are far from finished: It has predicted that as many as 4 million people could eventually leave Ukraine, and even that projection could be revised upward.

In an email, UNHCR spokeswoman Joung-ah Ghedini-Williams wrote, “Our data indicates we passed the 1M mark” as of midnight in central Europe, based on counts collected by national authorities.

U.N. High Commissioner Filippo Grandi said in a statement: “I have worked in refugee emergencies for almost 40 years, and rarely have I seen an exodus as rapid as this one.”

“Hour by hour, minute by minute, more people are fleeing the terrifying reality of violence. Countless have been displaced inside the country,” said Grandi, who on Thursday was visiting Ukraine neighbor Romania, which has taken in tens of thousands of refugees. “And unless there is an immediate end to the conflict, millions more are likely to be forced to flee Ukraine.”

On Twitter, Grandi appealed for the “guns to fall silent” in Ukraine so humanitarian aid can reach millions more still inside the country.

Grandi’s comments testified to the desperation of Ukrainians as artillery fire, exploding mortar shells and gunfire echoed across the country, and the growing concerns across the U.N. system at agencies like the World Health Organization and the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs — which launched an appeal for funds with UNHCR on Tuesday.

The day-by-day figures pointed to the dizzying speed of the evacuation: After more than 82,000 people left on the first day of the Russian invasion on Feb. 24, each day after that tallied at least 117,000 new refugees, hitting a peak of nearly 200,000 on Tuesday alone, based on the latest UNHCR count. Some longtime staffers accustomed to dealing with refugee crises said they’d never seen anything like this exodus.

Syria, whose civil war erupted in 2011, remains the country with the largest refugee outflows — nearly 5.7 million people, according to UNHCR’s figures. But even at the swiftest rate of flight out of that country, in early 2013, it took at least three months for 1 million refugees to leave Syria.

Two years later, in 2015, hundreds of thousands of Syrian and other refugees who had mostly been in Turkey fled into Europe, prompting disarray in the European Union over its response and at times skirmishes and pushbacks at some national borders.

So far, U.N. officials and others have generally praised the response from Ukraine’s neighbors, who have opened homes, gymnasiums and other facilities to take in the new refugees.

UNHCR spokeswoman Shabia Mantoo said Wednesday that “at this rate” the outflows from Ukraine could make it the source of “the biggest refugee crisis this century.”

According to the latest figures on UNHCR’s online data portal , which still showed 934,000 refugees early Thursday, more than half of the refugees from Ukraine had gone to neighboring Poland — over 505,000 — and more than 116,000 had gone to Hungary to the south. Moldova had taken in more than 79,000 and 71,200 had gone to Slovakia.

Ghedini-Williams said the figures on the data portal reflected a count through mid-afternoon in Europe, but the agency had received estimates of additional arrivals through the rest of the day and into the evening.

“I have worked in refugee emergencies for almost 40 years, and rarely have I seen an exodus as rapid as this one,” United Nations Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said in a statement Thursday.

European governments and humanitarian organizations have been planning for their arrival for weeks, but the number of refugees has surpassed those expectations. The UN has projected that 4 million Ukrainian refugees could arrive in neighboring countries just in the coming weeks.

Such a heavy influx would be a “huge burden for receiving states and would no doubt stress reception systems and related resources,” Grandi said during a United Nations Security Council meeting on Monday.

So far, at least 505,000 Ukrainians have gone to Poland, 139,000 to Hungary, 97,000 to Moldova, 51,000 to Romania, 72,000 to Slovakia, and 90,000 to other European countries. Nearly 48,000 have also gone to Russia and a few hundred have gone to Belarus. Most of the refugees are women and children, including a growing number of unaccompanied children. Ukraine has conscripted men between the ages of 18 and 60 to fight, prohibiting them from leaving.

The refugees are arriving by crammed-full trains, by car, and even on foot after walking for dozens of miles, waiting in long lines at the borders to reach safety, and bringing whatever they could fit in their suitcases if they had time to pack. Those who can afford it have found their own accommodations, but others are staying in government-run shelters, hotels paid for by private companies, churches, or with their families or ordinary citizens who have offered to take them in.

Right now, with help from the international community, Ukraine’s neighbors are managing to handle the refugees they’re receiving. But in order for them to continue to do so successfully, they’ll need a lot more supplies and money, and quickly.

There are still long lines at the borders

Neighboring countries have kept their borders open, unlike in other migrant crises in the recent past. But actually crossing the border is still an arduous process.

Though Poland is accepting refugees without a passport, there have been miles-long lines at border crossings where people have had to wait as long as 60 hours to be processed in freezing temperatures and have been sleeping in their cars, if at all. The traffic has gotten so bad that the Polish government has asked volunteers not to show up at the border unless they’ve made arrangements to meet refugees ahead of time.

Earlier this week, the UN also reported a 20-hour queue in Romania, and it’s taking 24 hours to drive the roughly 60 kilometers that separate Odesa from Ukraine’s border with Moldova.

There have been reports of Black refugees, many of them third-country nationals who were students in Ukraine, facing difficulty crossing. At the Polish border, some Ukrainian guards sent Black people to the back of the line last week, saying that “Ukrainians” took priority. Polish authorities have said that anyone who shows up at the border is being allowed to cross.

“We strongly condemn this racism and believe that it is damaging to the spirit of solidarity that is so urgently needed today,” Kenyan Ambassador to the UN Martin Kimani said Monday at the security council meeting.

Ensuring that refugees in line have adequate access to food, water, and medical support is also a problem. One Nepalese man who had been studying in Ukraine said he had not eaten anything for three days while waiting to enter Poland, and an older woman died at one of the border checkpoints, according to the Washington Post.

NGOs have tried to help. Chef José Andrés’s World Central Kitchen, for instance, handed out 4,000 meals over the course of 18 hours at Medyka, currently Poland’s busiest border crossing. The Polish authorities have also tried to streamline processing, but the resources and personnel at their borders just aren’t equipped to deal with the current volume of arrivals.

European countries are ensuring that Ukrainians have a place to go

The European community has mobilized to ensure that Ukrainians have a place to stay in both the short and long term. Local governments created temporary shelters, and civilians are welcoming refugees into their homes. The EU also asked all 27 member nations to grant asylum to all Ukrainians for up to three years, which would give them access to social services and permission to work. EU Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson said Sunday that an “overwhelming majority” were in favor of doing so, but did not specify which countries opposed the measure.

In Poland, where roughly half of Ukrainian refugees have gone so far, new arrivals are being transported via tour buses to one of nine reception centers, where they are being provided meals, medical care, beds, and information and legal services. In the town of Korczowa, for instance, a makeshift shelter with folding cots has been set up inside a warehouse. There, refugees can also meet up with family; Poland was already home to about 2 million Ukrainians before Russia’s most recent incursion.

Polish civilians have also clamored to support refugees. Locals in the Polish capital of Warsaw have advertised roughly 2,500 apartments where refugees can stay. They have also flocked to reception centers offering to transport or host refugees and bringing donations of food, water, clothes, sleeping bags, shoes, blankets, diapers, toys, sanitary products, battery packs, and cellphone charging cables.

Private companies have funded accommodations for Ukrainians, too. Airbnb, for instance, has offered free short-term housing for up to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees and is working with countries in the region to arrange long-term stays. There is also an online directory of hotels and hostels that have openings for refugees.

The government, citizens, and private companies will have to continue to ramp up capacity to prepare for even more arrivals, but other EU states have promised to share responsibility by also taking in refugees.

The Ukrainian refugee population needs more humanitarian support in the coming weeks

The needs of the Ukrainian refugee population in Europe will likely only balloon in the coming weeks, and meeting those needs will require money.

The UN, which has set up a Ukraine Humanitarian Fund, has requested a preliminary $550.6 million from member states in addition to the $190 million it had already sought to help support reception efforts in neighboring countries. Humanitarian groups are still assessing the most pressing gaps in assistance, but that money would go toward shelter, emergency relief items, and cash assistance, as well as mental health and psychosocial support for refugees.

For its part, the US has recently approved $54 million in humanitarian aid for Ukraine, and Congress is considering issuing another $2.9 billion. Every day that lawmakers deliberate, however, delays the delivery of aid.

The European Commission has also said that its commitment of 90 million euros in aid on February 28 is just the beginning.

“So far, [the needs of Ukrainian refugees] have been met, though I am seriously concerned about the likely further escalation in the number of arrivals,” Grandi said Monday.",https://www.vox.com/22954721/ukraine-refugee-poland-moldova-europe

During the 2015 refugee ""crisis,"" the EU called for detaining arriving refugees for up to 18 months. Not so today in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The reasons for this difference point to an intractable challenge in Europe's ability to embrace the international refugee protection regime.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has triggered one of the largest and fastest refugee movements that Europe has witnessed since the end of World War II.[1] By 2 March, only seven days into the war, 874,000 people were estimated to have fled to neighbouring countries. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has predicted that as many as four million people could flee the country in the coming weeks.[2] The European Union (EU) puts this number higher, estimating that there may eventually be seven million refugees.[3] Regardless which number is correct, it is now abundantly clear that an unprecedented refugee challenge is unfolding in Europe.

While the EU calls this the largest humanitarian crisis that Europe has witnessed in ""many, many years,""[4] it is important to remember that it was not so long ago that the continent faced another critical humanitarian challenge, the 2015 refugee ""crisis"" spurred by the conflict in Syria. But the starkly different responses---to date---that Europe has directed at these two situations provide a cautionary lesson for those hoping for a more humane, generous Europe. The differences also help explain why some of those fleeing Ukraine---in particular, nationals from Africa, Asia, and the Middle East---are not getting the same generous treatment as the citizens of Ukraine.

As of this writing, Ukraine's neighbours have responded with an outpouring of public and political support for the refugees. Political leaders have said publicly that refugees from Ukraine are welcome and countries have been preparing to receive refugees on their borders with teams of volunteers handing out food, water, clothing, and medicines.[5] Slovakia[6] and Poland[7] have said that refugees fleeing the war in Ukraine will be allowed to enter their countries even without passports, or other valid travel documents; other EU countries, such as Ireland, have announced the immediate lifting of visa requirements for people coming from Ukraine.[8]

Across Europe, free public transport[9] and phone communication[10] is being provided for Ukrainian refugees. The EU is proposing to reactivate the Temporary Protection Directive, introduced in the 1990s to manage large-scale refugee movements during the Balkans crisis.[11] Under this scheme, refugees from Ukraine would be offered up to three years temporary protection in EU countries, without having to apply for asylum, with rights to a residence permit and access to education, housing, and the labour market.

The EU is also proposing to simplify border controls and entry conditions for people fleeing Ukraine.[12] Ukrainian refugees can travel for 90 days visa-free throughout EU countries, and many have been moving on from neighbouring countries to join family and friends in other EU countries.[13] Throughout Europe, the public and politicians are mobilizing to show solidarity and support for those fleeing Ukraine

This is how the international refugee protection regime should work, especially in times of crisis: countries keep their borders open to those fleeing wars and conflict; unnecessary identity and security checks are avoided; those fleeing warfare are not penalized for arriving without valid identity and travel documents; detention measures are not used; refugees are able to freely join family members in other countries; communities and their leaders welcome refugees with generosity and solidarity.

But we know that this is not how the international protection regime has operated in Europe, particularly in those same countries that are now welcoming refugees from Ukraine. Public discourse in Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, and Romania is often tainted by racist and xenophobic rhetoric about refugees and migrants, in particular those from Middle Eastern and African countries, and they have adopted hostile policies like border push-backs and draconian detention measures.

A case in point is Hungary: The country has refused to admit refugees from non-EU countries since the 2015 ""refugee crisis.""[14] Prime Minister Victor Orbán has described non-European refugees as ""Muslim invaders"" and migrants as ""a poison,""[15] claiming that Hungary should not accept refugees from different cultures and religions to ""preserve its cultural and ethnic homogeneity.""[16] In May 2020, The European Court of Justice found that Hungary's arbitrary detention of asylum seekers in transit zones on its border with Serbia was illegal.[17]

Hungary was not alone in its harsh response to the 2015 ""crisis."" In their book Immigration Detention in the European Union: In the Shadow of the ""Crisis"" (Springer 2020), Global Detention Project (GDP) researchers detailed the evolution of the detention systems of all EU Members States before, during, and after the 2015 refugee crisis. Among their key findings: During the years leading up to 2015, migration-related detention had largely plateaued across the EU, but refugee pressures spurred important increases in detention regimes across the entire region, which remained in place long after the ""crisis"" had subsided. Fuelling these increases was anti-migrant rhetoric that spread from Brussels across the entire continent, abetted by EU-wide migration directives that allowed for lengthy detention periods. Then-European Council President Donald Tusk argued at that time that all arriving refugees should be detained for up to 18 months, in line with the limits in EU directives, while their claims were processed.[18]

More recently, in late 2021, the terrible treatment of migrants and asylum seekers, most of them from Iraq and Afghanistan, trapped on Belarus's borders with Poland and Lithuania sparked outrage across Europe. Belarus was accused of weaponizing the plight of these people, luring them to Belarus in order to travel on to EU countries as retaliation against EU sanctions.

Polish border guards were brutal in their treatment of these refugees and migrants, many of whom sustained serious injuries from Polish and Belarussian border guards. Thousands were left stranded in the forests between the two countries in deplorable conditions with no food, shelter, blankets, or medicines: at least 19 migrants died in the freezing winter temperatures. In response to this situation, Poland sent soldiers to its border, erected razor-wire fencing, and started the construction of a 186-kilometre wall to prevent asylum seekers entering from Belarus. It also adopted legislation that would allow it to expel anyone who irregularly crossed its border and banned their re-entry. Even before the stand-off between Poland and Belarus, refugees in Poland did not receive a warm welcome. Very few asylum seekers were granted refugee status (in 2020 out of 2,803 applications, only 161 were granted refugee status) and large numbers of refugees and migrants were detained: a total of 1,675 migrants and asylum seekers were in detention in January 2022, compared to just 122 people during all of 2020.

With this recent history as backdrop, the double standards and racism inherent in Europe's refugee responses are glaring. There are no calls from Brussels today to detain refugees fleeing Ukraine for up to 18 months. Why? Because, as Bulgarian Prime Minister Kiril Petkov said recently about people from Ukraine: ""These are not the refugees we are used to. ... These people are Europeans. ... These people are intelligent, they are educated people. ... This is not the refugee wave we have been used to, people we were not sure about their identity, people with unclear pasts, who could have been even terrorists.""[19]

Similarly, Hungary's Orban has said that every refugee coming from Ukraine will be ""welcomed by friends in Hungary,"" adding that one doesn't have to be a ""rocket scientist"" to see the difference between ""masses arriving from Muslim regions in hope of a better life in Europe"" and helping Ukrainian refugees who have come to Hungary because of the war.[20]

Sadly, these double standards have reared in the response to non-Ukrainians fleeing the war in Ukraine. There are a growing number of accounts of students and migrants from Africa, the Middle East, and Asia who have faced racist treatment, obstruction, and violence trying to flee Ukraine. Many described being prevented from boarding trains and buses in Ukrainian towns while priority was given to Ukrainian nationals; others described being aggressively pulled aside and stopped by Ukrainian border guards when trying to cross into neighbouring countries.[21] There are also accounts of Polish authorities taking aside African students and refusing them entry into Poland, although the Polish Ambassador to the UN told a General Assembly meeting on 28 February that assertions of race or religion-based discrimination at Poland's border were ""a complete lie and a terrible insult to us."" He asserted that ""nationals of all countries who suffered from Russian aggression or whose life is at risk can seek shelter in my country."" According to the Ambassador, people from 125 different nationalities have been admitted into Poland from Ukraine.[22]

Several African leaders---including, notably, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari---have strongly criticized the discrimination on the borders of Ukraine, saying everyone has the same right to cross international borders to flee conflict and seek safety.[23] The African Union stated that ""reports that Africans are singled out for unacceptable dissimilar treatment would be shockingly racist and in breach of international law,"" and called for all countries to ""show the same empathy and support to all people fleeing war notwithstanding their racial identity.""[24] Similar messages were shared by the UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, who said in a Tweet: ""I am grateful for the compassion, generosity and solidarity of Ukraine's neighbours who are taking in those seeking safety. It is important that this solidarity is extended without any discrimination based on race, religion or ethnicity,""[25] and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees who stressed that ""it is crucial that receiving countries continue to welcome all those fleeing conflict and insecurity---irrespective of nationality and race.""[26]

The Ukraine refugee crisis presents Europe with not only an important opportunity to demonstrate its generosity, humanitarian values, and commitment to the global refugee protection regime; it is also a critical moment of reflection: Can the peoples of Europe overcome their widespread racism and animosity and embrace the universalist spirit of the 1951 Refugee Convention? As Article 3 of the Convention holds, all member states ""shall apply the provisions of this Convention to refugees without discrimination as to race, religion or country of origin.""[27]

8,f17a7f7c-22be-43f4-a714-6118c7db73aa,['Associated Press'],,"GENEVA — The U.N. refugee agency said Thursday that 1 million people have now fled Ukraine since Russia’s invasion less than a week ago, an exodus without precedent in this century for its speed.

The tally from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees amounts to more than 2% of Ukraine’s population — which the World Bank counted at 44 million at the end of 2020 — on the move across borders in just seven days. The agency cautions that the outflows are far from finished: It has predicted that as many as 4 million people could eventually leave Ukraine, and even that projection could be revised upward.

In an email, UNHCR spokeswoman Joung-ah Ghedini-Williams wrote, “Our data indicates we passed the 1M mark” as of midnight in central Europe, based on counts collected by national authorities.

On Twitter, U.N. High Commissioner Filippo Grandi wrote, “In just seven days we have witnessed the exodus of one million refugees from Ukraine to neighboring countries.”

Grandi appealed for the “guns to fall silent” in Ukraine so humanitarian aid can reach millions more still inside the country.

Grandi’s comments testified to the desperation of Ukrainians as artillery fire, exploding mortar shells and gunfire echoed across the country, and the growing concerns across the U.N. system at agencies like the World Health Organization and the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs — which launched an appeal for funds with UNHCR on Tuesday.

The day-by-day figures pointed to the dizzying speed of the evacuation: After more than 82,000 people left on the first day of the Russian invasion on Feb. 24, each day after that tallied at least 117,000 new refugees, hitting a peak of nearly 200,000 on Tuesday alone, based on the latest UNHCR count. Some longtime staffers accustomed to dealing with refugee crises said they’d never seen anything like this exodus.

Syria, whose civil war erupted in 2011, remains the country with the largest refugee outflows — nearly 5.7 million people, according to UNHCR’s figures. But even at the swiftest rate of flight out of that country, in early 2013, it took at least three months for 1 million refugees to leave Syria.

Two years later, in 2015, hundreds of thousands of Syrian and other refugees who had mostly been in Turkey fled into Europe, prompting disarray in the European Union over its response and at times skirmishes and pushbacks at some national borders.

So far, U.N. officials and others have generally praised the response from Ukraine’s neighbors, who have opened homes, gymnasiums and other facilities to take in the new refugees.

UNHCR spokeswoman Shabia Mantoo said Wednesday that “at this rate” the outflows from Ukraine could make it the source of “the biggest refugee crisis this century.”

According to the latest figures on UNHCR’s online data portal, which still showed 934,000 refugees early Thursday, more than half of the refugees from Ukraine had gone to neighboring Poland — over 505,000 — and more than 116,000 had gone to Hungary to the south. Moldova had taken in more than 79,000 and 71,200 had gone to Slovakia.

Ghedini-Williams said the figures on the data portal reflected a count through mid-afternoon in Europe, but the agency had received estimates of additional arrivals through the rest of the day and into the evening.",https://www.marketwatch.com/story/historic-exodus-1-million-ukraine-refugees-flee-in-just-7-days-01646271217
