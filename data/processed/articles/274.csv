The Chernobyl nuclear site has lost power, according to a Facebook post by the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine.

According to the post, power was lost at 11:22 local time Wednesday morning. Emergency diesel generators are providing power to critical safety systems at the site. The generators have enough fuel for 48 hours, and repair to the transmission lines is made impossible by continued combat operations in the area.

Ed Lyman of the Union of Concerned Scientists says the site's 20,000 spent fuel rods are at least 20 years old. They do put out heat, and over time the water in the pool they're in could start to evaporate. If the top of the fuel rods became exposed, that would be a potential local radiation hazard.

""It's inching towards a crisis, but there's time to intervene,"" Lyman said. ""It's a troubling development.""

In a tweet, the International Atomic Energy Agency said that the pool was sufficiently large enough to keep the fuel safe even without electrical power to the site.

But the agency is increasingly worried about the deteriorating situation at the site.

On Tuesday, it said 210 technical personnel and guards at the site have been forced to work there for 13 days straight (that's two weeks as of Wednesday). It also reported that it had lost radiation-monitoring data from the site.

On Thursday, Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's minister of foreign affairs, called for a cease-fire to allow for repairs.

""The only electrical grid supplying the Chornobyl NPP and all its nuclear facilities occupied by Russian army is damaged. CNPP lost all electric supply. I call on the international community to urgently demand Russia to cease fire and allow repair units to restore power supply,"" Kuleba tweeted.

""Putin's barbaric war puts entire Europe in danger. He must stop it immediately!""

Hours after the news hit headlines, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) says it sees “no critical impact on safety” from the power cut at the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine. According to a statement released by the organisation that seeks to promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy, it said the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine (SNRIU) reported that power from one of the two off-site power transmission lines supplying electricity to the site was lost overnight.

#Ukraine has informed IAEA of power loss at #Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant, @rafaelmgrossi says development violates key safety pillar on ensuring uninterrupted power supply; in this case IAEA sees no critical impact on safety. — IAEA - International Atomic Energy Agency (@iaeaorg) March 9, 2022

However, the SNRIU informed the agency that this power line does not provide power to safety-related equipment. Further, it found that nevertheless, due to this loss of power, there were difficulties in carrying out routine maintenance and repair of some safety-critical equipment. ""Due to time elapsed since the 1986 Chornobyl accident, the heat load of the spent fuel storage pool and the volume of cooling water contained in the pool is sufficient to maintain effective heat removal without the need for electrical supply,"" according to the statement.

Furthermore, it said that the site has backup emergency diesel generators available in case there be a total loss of power.

It is worth mentioning that the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant has been undergoing decommissioning since the 1986 accident. According to IAEA, significant amounts of nuclear material remain in various facilities at the site in the form of spent fuel and other radioactive waste. In order to address the ongoing emergency like situation in the plant, a meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors was held on Wednesday where the officials discussed all the circumstances that could posses a threat to humanity.

Russian forces took control of Chernobyl power plant last month

Notably, Russian forces took control of the Chernobyl power plant in northern Ukraine on February 25. Yevgeniya Kuznetsova, a spokeswoman for the State Agency of Ukraine on Exclusion Zone Management told CNN that troops overran the plant on the first day of Russia's multi-pronged invasion of Ukraine. ""When I came to the office today in the morning [in Kyiv], it turned out, that the [Chernobyl nuclear power plant] management had left. So, there was no one to give instructions or defend,"" she said. It should be mentioned that the capture came nearly hours after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that Russia was trying to seize the power plant.

Ukraine’s state-run nuclear company Energoatom announced on Wednesday that during fighting between Ukrainian troops and Russian forces, all the facilities at the Chernobyl exclusion zone had been completely disconnected and were now without electricity. It was impossible to restore the power lines because of continued fighting in the surrounding areas.

“Emergency diesel generators are switched on at the site to supply power to safety-critical systems. In case of trouble-free operation, the stock of diesel fuel on diesel generators will be enough for 48 hours,” Energoatom said in a post on the Telegram messaging app.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba also said that after the 48 hours were up, “cooling systems of the storage facility for spent nuclear fuel will stop, making radiation leaks imminent.”

“I call on the international community to urgently demand Russia to cease fire and allow repair units to restore power supply,” Kuleba said on Twitter.

Russian Deputy Defense Minister Nikolai Pankov claimed in a special briefing on Wednesday, “At the moment, the Ukrainian side is doing everything possible to avoid the organization of repair and restoration work.”

Pankov accused Ukrainian nationalist forces of attacking a substation and the power lines that supply electricity to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, calling the move an ""extremely dangerous provocation.""

Russian Deputy Minister of Energy Pavel Sorokin also indicated that Russia’s Belarusian colleagues had worked out a means to restore electricity supplies to the plant on a permanent basis by connecting it to the Belarusian energy system.

However, the IAEA said there was enough water in the spent fuel pools for the fuel rods to cool sufficiently to avoid an accident.

IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said on Twitter that the “development violates (a) key safety pillar on ensuring uninterrupted power supply” but that “in this case IAEA sees no critical impact on safety.”

Earlier on March 3, the agency published a statement that said due to the amount of time since the Chernobyl disaster in 1986, the spent fuel had cooled down enough that “the pool is sufficient to maintain effective heat removal without the need for electrical supply.”

But it voiced concern that the site had stopped transmitting data on ambient radiation and other variables, and expressed concern for the staff who had not been able to change shifts. The situation for the staff was worsening, the IAEA said, citing the Ukrainian nuclear regulator.

Chernobyl is located about 100 km north of Kyiv, and 10 km from the Belarusian border. One of its reactors suffered a catastrophic meltdown in April 1986, forcing the evacuation of the surrounding areas and leading to the premature deaths of thousands of people.

The Chernobyl disaster is widely considered the worst nuclear disaster in history.

In a video shared on Telegram last week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urged world leaders and European citizens to do more to avoid a repeat of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.

“I address all Ukrainians, all Europeans, everyone who knows the word Chernobyl, everyone who knows how many victims that explosion of a nuclear plant brought,” Zelensky said.",https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2022/03/10/678307/Chernobyl-nuclear-power-station-loses-electricity-IAEA-sees-no-risk

Ukrainian authorities expressed concern that without power, cooling mechanisms within the plant will not operate sufficiently, leaving the plant in risk of leaking radiation from the spent nuclear fuel it stores. The International Atomic Energy Agency said in a tweet Wednesday morning that while its director general, Rafael Grossi, said this development violated a “key safety pillar on ensuring uninterrupted power supply,” in this case IAEA saw “no critical impact on safety.”

The site of the 1986 nuclear disaster has no operating reactors, but requires constant operation to prevent the leakage of nuclear material. Ukrainian grid operator Ukrenergo said on its Facebook page that the site has been knocked off the electrical grid that supplied it with the energy it needed to run because of “military actions from Russian occupiers.”

The facility is currently relying on backup power from reserve diesel generators with a 48-hour capacity, Dmytro Kuleba, minister of foreign affairs of Ukraine, said in a tweet.

In nuclear facilities, spent fuel, which holds the majority of radioactive material, sits in the bottom of a pool covered in water; in the event that a facility loses control of cooling operations and melts down, this water can evaporate or explode and leak spent fuel into its surrounding environment. This is apparently why both Ukrenergo and Kuleba expressed concern that the plant was cut off from the grid.

In addition to its tweet on Wednesday, the IAEA said in a statement last week that the risk of this is low.

“Due to time elapsed since the 1986 Chornobyl accident, the heat load of the spent fuel storage pool and the volume of cooling water contained in the pool is sufficient to maintain effective heat removal without the need for electrical supply,” the statement reads.",https://www.vice.com/en/article/93b8m5/chernobyl-is-cut-from-the-grid-but-atomic-agency-sees-no-critical-impact-on-safety

The Chernobyl plant in Ukraine is disconnected from the grid due to damage inflicted by Russian occupying forces, sparking concerns of radioactive contamination if the cooling of spent nuclear fuel stops.

The 750 kV Chernobyl-Kyiv high-voltage line is currently disconnected ""due to damage by the occupiers,"" Energoatom, or the state-run National Nuclear Energy Generating Company of Ukraine, said Wednesday. The Chernobyl station and all nuclear facilities of the Exclusion Zone are without electricity.

The regulator explained that there are about 20,000 spent fuel assemblies stored at the facility that require constant cooling. Without electricity to cool the pumps, the temperature in the holding pools will increase, prompting the release of radioactive substances into the environment.

""The only electrical grid supplying the Chornobyl NPP and all its nuclear facilities occupied by Russian army is damaged,"" Ukrainian Foreign Affairs Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted Wednesday. ""CNPP lost all electric supply. I call on the international community to urgently demand Russia to cease fire and allow repair units to restore power supply.""

""Reserve diesel generators have a 48-hour capacity to power the Chornobyl NPP,"" he added. ""After that, cooling systems of the storage facility for spent nuclear fuel will stop, making radiation leaks imminent. Putin’s barbaric war puts entire Europe in danger. He must stop it immediately!""

Wind can transfer the radioactive cloud to other regions of Ukraine, Belarus, Russia and Europe, according to Energoatom. Ventilation at the facility also won’t function without electricity, so some 210 captured technical personnel and guards who have been working to maintain the facility since Russian forces took control of the site two weeks ago risk exposure to radiation.

The fire extinguishing system is down, posing a dangerous risk if missiles were to strike the plant. Fighting is currently underway, making it impossible to carry out repairs and restore power, Energoatom said. The city of Slavutych is also without electricity.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Ukraine informed them of the power loss at Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, and Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said the development violated a key safety pillar on ensuring uninterrupted power supply. As of now, the IAEA does not see a critical impact on safety.

The IAEA had warned Tuesday that the same shift has been on duty at the Chernobyl NPP since the day before the Russian military entered the site of the 1986 accident on Feb. 24, meaning staff have in effect been living there for the past two weeks.

Grossi has repeatedly stressed that staff operating nuclear facilities must be able to rest and work in regular shifts, stating this is crucial for overall nuclear safety, the IAEE said. Their capacity to make decisions ""free of undue pressure is among the seven indispensable pillars of nuclear safety and security"" he outlined at a meeting of the IAEA’s Board of Governors on March 2.

Since then, the 210 technicians and guards responsible for keeping it safe have not taken a proper break.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the United Nations body responsible for nuclear security, says a key pillar of nuclear safety is giving operating staff the capacity to make decisions free of ""undue pressure."" But overworked staff at Chernobyl are trying to fulfil their duties amid an invasion that has already forced 2 million people to flee.

A combination of factors has increased fears of radioactive leaks from the Chernobyl site. But there is no chance of a nuclear meltdown — the last reactor was closed more than two decades ago. For now, the main concerns are for staff.

""I'm deeply concerned about the difficult and stressful situation facing staff at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and the potential risks this entails for nuclear safety,"" said IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi in a press statement Tuesday. ""I call on the forces in effective control of the site to urgently facilitate the safe rotation of personnel there.""

Communications and power failures

Compounding the concerns are problems with communications and electricity.

On Tuesday, the IAEA said data transmission from monitoring systems installed at Chernobyl had been lost and Ukraine's regulatory authority could only communicate with the plant via email. State-run nuclear energy company Ukrenergo reported Wednesday that a high-voltage electricity line connecting Kyiv and Chernobyl had been disconnected. That has forced workers to rely on diesel generators for electricity and there are concerns it could disrupt the cooling pumps for spent fuel.

Radioactive fuel rods continue to heat up after they have been taken out of reactors and need to be chilled in water for years before they can be moved to dry storage facilities. More than 20,000 spent fuel rods are sitting in wet and dry storage facilities at the site.

If the cooling pools were to dry out, the radiation could hurt workers. But experts said a large release of radiation akin to the 1986 disaster is unlikely and would not ""have consequences outside the plant site.""

""It is also important to note that drying out of the ponds will not cause a nuclear reaction or explosion to occur,"" said Mark Foreman, associate professor of nuclear chemistry at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden, in a statement.

A report from the Ukrainian state regulator in 2011 stress-tested different scenarios that could lead to failure. It found that if electricity were cut, the loss of the pool water cooling function would raise temperatures — but not by enough to cause an accident.

In a tweet on Wednesday, the IAEA confirmed the heat load of the spent fuel storage pool and the volume of cooling water was enough to effectively remove heat without the need for electricity.

""The spent fuel there is so old that evaporation will not likely be the problem,"" said Jan Haverkamp, a nuclear expert at environmental campaign group Greenpeace. Still, he added, ""an explosion hitting the pool could cause overheating.""

At the same time, Claire Corkhill, Chair in Nuclear Material Degradation at the University of Sheffield, said that communications with monitoring systems needed to be restored.

""It is essential that radiation monitoring systems are able to constantly monitor the situation inside reactor 4 so that we can be aware of any potential reasons for concern about the exposed nuclear fuel that resides there,"" explained Corkhill.

The loss of electricity could also hit the ventilation system and make it harder to manage radioactive dust.

""It may become much harder for workers to enter some parts of the site without full protective clothing,"" said Foreman. ""They may also have greater difficulty in changing in and out of their protective clothing. Some parts of the site might become off limits to the workers until the power is restored.""

Nuclear safety

Russian President Vladimir Putin's decision to fully invade Ukraine in February has thrown the security of nuclear power into the spotlight.

""If there is a nuclear accident the cause will not be a tsunami brought on by mother nature,"" said Grossi on Monday, referring to the earthquake that flooded the reactor of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan in 2011. ""Instead, it will be the result of human failure to act when we knew we could.""

Chernobyl is a powerful symbol of nuclear catastrophe. In 1986, a sudden surge of power during a reactor test destroyed Unit 4 of the poorly designed nuclear power station, in what was then part of the Soviet Union. The fire that followed released clouds of radioactive material into the environment that led to authorities setting up an exclusion zone and evacuating hundreds of thousands of people. Dozens are thought to have died as a direct result of the disaster.

Radiation levels have since fallen. Some residents of the exclusion zone have returned to their homes and live in areas with levels that are above average but not fatal. Radiation unexpectedly spiked in February when Russian troops entered the area, possibly because of heavy vehicles raising a layer of topsoil and kicking dust up into the air.

The IAEA found the levels pose no danger to the public. But the unprecedented reality of war in a country operating nuclear power stations has raised the specter of nuclear catastrophe.

The Russian army shelled Europe's largest nuclear power plant last week before taking over the site. Though there was no safety incident, it was the first time that military explosives have hit an operating nuclear facility.

""We've entered something that that the industry was in complete denial of,"" said Haverkamp. ""Nuclear power is just not an energy source that belongs in a war situation.""
