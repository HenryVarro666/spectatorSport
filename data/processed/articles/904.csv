The charge has been categorically denied by Russia, whose navy currently dominates the Black Sea.

On its Twitter account, the Ukrainian embassy said the Emmakris-III, a Panama-flagged bulk carrier, was prevented from sailing to Egypt. The embassy said the wheat had been ""purchased by Egypt.""

The Russian Embassy responded by blaming the Ukrainian military for keeping the commercial vessel docked at the Black Sea ports of Odesa and Chornomorsk. It said the Russian navy ensured commercial shipping in the area.

The social media tussle between the two embassies is part of an apparent media war between the two neighbours since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, with both nations seeking to discredit and tarnish the other.

Russia's embassy in Egypt said that the presence of the Russian navy in the Black Sea ensured the free movement of merchant vessels.

There was no immediate word from the Egyptian government on whether the Emmakris-III was headed for Egypt with a cargo of wheat.

Egypt, where bread is a staple, depends on Russia and Ukraine for about 80 per cent of its annual wheat imports, which stood at about 13 million tonnes in 2021.

The world’s largest wheat importer, it has said the last shipment of Ukrainian wheat it had bought left a day before Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24.

Egypt has wide-ranging and complex ties with the two warring nations. Besides wheat imports, Russians and Ukrainians account for a significant portion of the millions of tourists who visit Egypt every year. Egypt also imports large quantities of sunflower oil from both nations.

According to UkrAgroConsult, the ship carrying the wheat is currently being held at the Chernomorsk port in the Black Sea. The Russian embassy in Cairo has denied the claim.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine, which began on 24 February, has massively affected the supply of wheat to countries in the MENA region, including Egypt, by cutting off shipments to the North African country.

Egypt is one of the largest importers of wheat with Russia and Ukraine accounting for 80 per cent of imports.

The price of bread has risen dramatically in a country where living prices are already soaring and the economy is on its knees.

In March it was reported that the Egyptian government had taken steps to protect wheat supplies in the country including that Egyptian farmers would have to sell at least 60 per cent of their wheat to the government. It said if they don't, they will lose support from the Agricultural Bank of Egypt and access to subsidised fertilisers.

The Centre for Global Development has said that the massive spike in food and energy prices which are a result of the Russian invasion will push 40 million people into poverty.

The most immediate concern, said researchers, was for direct wheat customers of Ukraine and Russia, which include Egypt.

Egypt has been in talks once again with the IMF for a fourth loan since 2016 to help the country.

Following the Russian invasion, inflation surged. It was already at a ten year high largely to do with the fallout from the global coronavirus pandemic.

Cairo -

With the continuation of the Russian war on Ukraine, the negative economic repercussions are increasing on the Egyptian economy, as data from the Egyptian government showed a decrease in wheat stocks, in conjunction with the exchange of accusations by the Russian and Ukrainian embassies in Cairo about disrupting a ship carrying Ukrainian wheat on its way to Egypt.

Following the cabinet meeting on Monday, Egyptian government spokesman Nader Saad said that his country's wheat stock is now sufficient to cover domestic consumption for a period of 2.6 months, coinciding with the start of the local wheat harvest season, and supplying it to official authorities.

This comes despite the government’s previous announcement by more than one official that the wheat stockpile would suffice for 4 months, while Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly confirmed in previous statements that the wheat stock is sufficient for the end of the year, due to the beginning of the local wheat harvest season.

Egypt is the largest importer of wheat in the world, and the amount of its imports of wheat reached 6.1 million tons during the first 11 months of 2021, according to the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (a government agency).

According to the data of the Statistics Authority, Russia and Ukraine provide about 80% of the Egyptian imports of wheat, and Russia topped the list of the top 10 countries from which Egypt imported wheat during 2021, with a quantity of 4.2 million, or 69.4% of Egypt's total wheat imports, while Ukraine ranked The second, with a quantity of 651.4 thousand tons, or 10.7%.

wheat ship crisis

The Ukrainian embassy in Egypt said on Monday that Russia had prevented a ship loaded with Ukrainian wheat from moving, after Cairo had bought it, and the US embassy in Cairo republished the tweet of the Ukrainian embassy.

On the other hand, the Russian embassy denied - in the early hours of Tuesday morning - what the Ukrainian side said about banning the wheat ship, noting that it is the Ukrainian military forces that prevent the movement of ships in the Odessa and Chernomorsk regions, while the Russian Navy guarantees the freedom of movement of commercial ships.

Because of the escalation of the war in Ukraine and the rise in wheat prices globally, Egypt recently canceled two tenders to import wheat from other countries due to the high prices.

Ship's itinerary

The Sanad Agency for Monitoring and Verification of News of the Al-Jazeera network monitored the itinerary of the ship loaded with wheat in the Ukrainian port of Chornomorsk, through the navigational data published by the accounts of the US and Ukrainian embassies as follows:

The ship ""EMMAKRIS III"" - flying the flag of Panama and belonging to an Emirati company - unloaded a cargo of goods from Russia in the port of Damietta and then headed to Ukraine.

The ship left the Egyptian port of Damietta on the fifth of last February to reach the Ukrainian port of Chornomorsk on February 22, two days before the war.

The ship was loaded with goods on March 16th.

The ship has settled in the port since its entry until today in its position.

The Russian authorities, in turn, accused the Ukrainian army of laying naval mines in several ports in Odessa, including the port of Chornomorsk, and prevented shipping traffic to and from these ports.

There are other ships that did not move, including the Turkish ship Ragip Yagci in the port of Chernomorsk

Hope for local production

The Egyptian government is relying a lot on local wheat - whose harvest season begins in the middle of this month - to cover the deficit in its stocks, and to face any possible delay in wheat deals as a result of the continuation of the war.

Last March, the government announced an additional incentive of 65 pounds per ardeb on the prices of local wheat imports, so that farmers would receive between 865 and 885 pounds per ardeb, an increase of 8% over the price set last November, while the Farmers Syndicate demanded an increase in the price to One thousand pounds (one dollar equals 18.24 pounds).

Yesterday, Monday, Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly announced the provision of 1.1 billion pounds as an advance payment under an account to purchase the local wheat crop, in order to allow immediate payment of farmers’ dues, and so that this season would be the highest in facilitating procedures and the quantity of wheat supplied.

Egypt relies heavily on wheat for its food by consuming more than 16 million tons of wheat annually, including about 9 million tons for the production of subsidized bread, which is spent on ration cards to produce nearly 270 million loaves per day, benefiting 71 million citizens.

Domestic production is only sufficient for 34.5% of Egypt’s wheat needs, according to the Central Bureau of Statistics, and the total that was imported in 2019 was about 13 million tons, including 7 million tons for the public sector (the Supply Commodities Authority) and 6 million tons for the private sector, with a bill that exceeded 3 billion. dollar.

But the wheat import bill is likely to increase by about one billion dollars, as Egyptian Finance Minister Mohamed Maait said - earlier - that the rise in wheat prices around the world will increase the cost of imports by 15 billion pounds (about one billion dollars) in this year's budget.

7,613c49a9-bf20-45f2-a2db-7d2deeb229ba,[],2022-04-06 09:39:24,"Egypt, often the world's top wheat buyer, saw a rise in imports of the grain from Russia in March despite supply and payment disruptions following its invasion of Ukraine that also drove traders to seek shipments from other suppliers.

Egypt received 479,195 tonnes of wheat from Russia in March, 24% up from the same month last year, according to freight data seen by Reuters. Ukrainian wheat imports stood at 124,500 tonnes, down 42% year-on-year.

""Russian ports remained open,"" said Mohammed El Gammal, a Cairo-based grains consultant for the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation and U.S. Wheat Associates.

""Shipping slowed a little in late February and it picked up in March, whether for new contracts or old ones signed before the invasion.""

Egypt relies heavily on Black Sea wheat due to its quality, cost and proximity, traders say. In 2021, Egypt imported around 80% of its wheat from Russia and Ukraine.

Since the Feb. 24 invasion, wheat importers in Egypt have faced record-high prices, payment complications due to sanctions against Russia, and disruptions to Black Sea wheat shipments, especially from Ukraine.

Although sanctions exclude food, traders say banks are reluctant to finance wheat imports from Russia.

Importers are still ""trying to figure out a secured channel"" for payments of already-delivered Russian cargoes, said one trader who imports to Egypt.

A second trader said some cargoes were paid for because they were purchased before the invasion, and that cases were being resolved individually through negotiations with banks.

Egypt's milling industry is highly accustomed to Russian and Ukrainian wheat, said Cairo-based trader Hesham Soliman. ""They'll always give it priority as long as it's available,"" he said.

But purchases of private sector wheat imports from alternative suppliers have continued, despite higher prices, traders say.

They have secured unusual wheat shipments from France, Brazil, Lithuania and Bulgaria, according to Reuters shipping data, and are also expecting a rare shipment from Germany, which traders say hasn't supplied Egypt for several years.

Egypt's state grains buyer, the General Authority for Supply Commodities (GASC), cancelled two tenders as prices soared after the invasion and has indicated it would return to the market in mid-May.

Wheat reserves have dropped to 2.6 months' supply, well below recent levels and government targets of six months, but officials say they should rise again with procurement from the local harvest, which starts this month.

GASC supplies wheat for heavily subsidised bread available to tens of millions of Egyptians. The government has said it will also support the commercial sector after setting price caps for unsubsidised bread.

Wheat imports by Egypt's private sector overtook those by GASC in 2021, reaching around 60% of the total.
