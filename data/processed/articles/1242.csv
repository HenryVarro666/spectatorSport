Kharkiv is Ukraine's second city, largely Russian speaking, close to the Russian border and one of the first targets of Moscow's all-out invasion of its smaller neighbour.

For more than a week shells and missiles have been raining down on the town, leaving residential blocks and civilian administrative buildings shattered, like a scene from the 1940s.

""It looks like scenes from that war we knew from books and films,"" said Ostaptchenko, a writer for an online news site.

In normal times, Kharkiv is a city of 1.4 million people, but many have fled, despite what Ostaptchenko called their ""naivety"" in waiting until war was on their doorstep.

""We thought we were in the 21st century. The Russians are surely not going to bombard us!"" she said.

Neither the journalist, nor her 25-year-old son, an actor, and his partner have yet left the city, but they are scared to go outside and live in the corridor and the bathroom of their flat.

Several civilians have been killed in the city just venturing outside for groceries and normal life is impossible.

""Today, it was fairly calm, and life revived a little, but when you can hear a plane the brutal horror come back to you. It's like the films of our childhood,"" she told AFP.

Before the shelling, Olena hoped to stay in the city whether under Ukrainian rule or Russian occupation, but she now admits ""against bombs and missiles I can do nothing"".

Two days ago she was ready to flee, but her son has become a hospital volunteer and did not want to go. So she stayed.

Makeshift metro shelter

Ostaptchenko fears she could be driven mad by loneliness if she goes. By staying she hopes to act as a calming influence on her son, to persuade him not to take senseless risks.

But her formerly vibrant city, once briefly the capital of Soviet-era Ukraine, is unrecognisable. Public transport is halted and pedestrians and cyclists are now rare.

Kharkhiv's metro tunnels, like those in the capital Kyiv, have been transformed into a huge air raid shelter. Electricity, water and communal heating systems regularly cut out.

Supermarkets open for brief spells, a few hours a day, but many shelves are bare and meat is particularly scarce.

What keeps Ostaptchenko going is her work providing news, even if she does not know if and when she will be paid.

""It helps me to pull myself together, to take a step back,"" she said. ""Until a new plane pops up.""

There are expected to be new talks between Ukrainian and Russian negotiations on Thursday, but Ostaptchenko does not hold out much hope for a breakthrough.

""I don't know what we can place our hopes in,"" she lamented, suggesting that only the overthrow of Russia's President Vladimir Putin could halt the fighting.

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

How you can help: Here are ways those in the U.S. can help support the Ukrainian people as well as what people around the world have been donating.

Mishra was one of hundreds of medical students who walked 25 km to reach Pesochin late Wednesday, after the Indian embassy gave an urgent call on Twitter to all students in Kharkiv to leave within four hours and reach shelters at three location around the city.

He had attempted to leave the city by train a day before the embassy’s call but couldn’t find any vehicle to the station. On Wednesday morning, he was lucky to get a taxi. But that’s where his luck ran out.

“It was a stampede-like situation,” Mishra said. “Some students were able to get on the train to Lviv, but most of us were stranded at the station. That’s when we decided to walk to the towns the embassy had advised (them to reach).”

As the group started walking, there was a blast a couple of hundred metres away.

“We were shell-shocked. Some people fell down either because of the force or the shock. All of us walked yesterday, risking our lives.”

Describing the place where students have been put up, Mishra said, “Yesterday it was quiet here. I didn’t hear blasts for the first time in days. Now it has started again. Are we even safe here?”

Dr K P S Sandhu, one of the education contractors (who arranges for admissions, travel and stay of Indian students in Ukraine) for the region, in his video updates on Instagram said there were 1,200 students stuck in Kharkiv. While a couple of hundred managed to board the trains, around 500 stayed back at the station bunker, and the others walked to the three towns.

He was trying to arrange for buses to take the students to the border.

“I know that a couple of my friends were stuck in Kharkiv till afternoon; now even they might have started walking to these shelters,” Mishra said. “But how does that matter? It’s not like we know how to reach the border from here. We haven’t heard about any plans from the embassy.

“The government is calling this an evacuation…but they have been flying out people from the western parts of the country who were already safe. Those who managed to reach the borders did so on their own. Nobody was there to help them.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/india/25-km-on-foot-to-escape-kharkiv-ukraine-russia-7800065/

The Ministry of Defence on Thursday evening issued a list of dos and don'ts for Indians stuck in war-torn Ukarine's Kharkiv as ""potentially dangerous or difficult situations"" are ""to be expected"" in the city.

In a statement, the ministry said each designated group or squad of Indians should keep a white flag or white cloth for waving.

Conserve and share food and water, it suggested, adding that they should stay hydrated, avoid full meals and eat smaller portions to extend rations.

Aerial raids, attacks by aircraft or drones, missile attacks, artillery shelling, gunfire by small arms, grenade explosions are few of the ""potentially dangerous or difficult situations"" that are ""to be expected"" in Kharkiv, the ministry said.

In the list of dos, it said Indians stuck in Kharkiv must keep a small kit of essential items on person or at hand round the clock.

The ministry suggested that the emergency kit should contain items such as passport, identity card, essential medication, life saving drugs, torch, matchbox, lighter, candles, cash, energy bars, power banks, water, first-aid kit, headgear, gloves, warm jacket and warm socks.

""If you find yourself in an open area or field, melt snow to make water,"" the ministry of defence (MoD) added.

If available, keep one large garbage bag per person to use as ground matting or cover against exposure to rain or cold or storm or during forced march or evacuation, it suggested.

India has been evacuating its citizens from Ukraine's western neighbouring countries such as Romania, Hungary and Poland since February 26. However, a section of Indians -- mainly students -- are stuck in Kharkiv, which is in eastern Ukraine closer to the Russian border.

The ministry advised that Indians should organise themselves in small groups or squads of 10 Indian students and within that ""organise buddy/pair system/nominate a coordinator and a deputy coordinator in each group of ten persons"".

""Your presence and whereabouts must always be known to your buddy or small group coordinator,"" the ministry noted.

Remain mentally strong and do not panic, it stated.

""Make a WhatsApp group, compile details, names, address, mobile numbers and contact in India,"" MoD mentioned.

Share geo location on WhatsApp with control room in embassy or in New Delhi and update information every eight hours, it said, adding that keep frequent head count every eight hours.

""Only coordinator or deputy coordinator should communicate with local authorities or Embassy or control rooms in India to conserve phone batteries,"" it suggested.

According to the ministry, ""potentially dangerous or difficult situations"" that are ""to be expected"" include use of Molotov cocktails (including by local people or militia), building collapse, falling debris, internet jamming, lack of electricity or food or water, exposure to freezing temperature, psychological trauma, injuries, lack of medical support, lack of transportation and face-to-face situation with armed fighters or military personnel.

If injured or ill, intimate condition and seek advice from control room or helpline or WhatsApp, the MoD advised.

Delete all unnecessary apps in mobile and limit conversations to low volume or audio mode to conserve battery, it said.

The Indians should stay indoors, preferably in designated zones, basements and bunkers, it said.

""If you find yourself in the streets, then walk on the sides of the roads, close to cover of buildings, crouch low to avoid being targeted, do not cross streets and avoid city centres, downtown areas. Turn around street corners in urban areas with great caution,"" the MoD said.

""Learn two or three sentences in Russian (e.g., we are students, we are not combatants, please do not harm us, we are from India),"" it noted.

When stationary, do regular deep breathing and mild movement of limbs to maintain good blood circulation, it mentioned.

""Pack minimum personal belongings (other than the emergency kit) preferably in small backpack suitable for long trek or walking,"" the MoD said .

Be ready to move under instructions at short notice and do not carry large bags to avoid slowing down, fatigue and crowding, it mentioned.

If stopped by military check-post or by police or armed personnel or militia, do cooperate, obey and raise your hands with open palms facing forward above your shoulders, the list said.

""Remain polite, provide necessary information, contact the Control Room or helpline when possible without confrontation,"" the MoD said.

Movement for evacuation should be done in coordination with authorities as guided by control room or helpline, it said.

The MoD also issued a list of don'ts for Indians stuck in Kharkiv.

""Avoid stepping out from your banker or basement or shelter at all times. Do not go to downtown or crowd crowded areas. Do not join local protesters or militia. Refrain from commenting on social media,"" it stated.

Do not pick up weapons or any unexploded ammunition or shells, the MoD advised.

Do not take pictures or selfies with military vehicles or troops or soldiers or check posts or militia, it stated.

""Do not try and film live combat situations. In the event of warning sirens, take immediate shelter wherever possible. If you are in the open, lie flat on your stomach and cover your head with your backpack,"" it said.

The MoD said do not light fires in enclosed spaces, do not consume alcohol and refrain from substance abuse.

""Do not wear wet socks to avoid chill blains or frostbite. Wherever possible, remove your shoes and dry your socks and other wet belongings,"" the list said.

Avoid unstable or damaged buildings and be mindful of falling or flying debris, it said.

""Stay away from glass windows to avoid injury from flying glass during explosions or gunfire. At check-posts, do not alarm the armed personnel by suddenly reaching for things or documents in your pockets unless told to do so,"" it said.
