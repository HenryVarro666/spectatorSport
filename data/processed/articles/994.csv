Numerous Russian media also report on the control of the plant by the Ukrainian military. A video posted on April 3 shows a tactical quadcopter inspecting what is supposed to be the site of the plant.

At the same time, it is not possible to assess the extent of damage, and the amount of damage at the moment. On March 20, Enver Tskitishvili, the Director General of Azovstal, stated that it was too early to say that the plant could be stopped forever.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt say that the Azovstal was stopped forever. We will return to the city, rebuild, and revive the plant. It will continue to work the same way, and bring glory to Ukraine, as it always has been,‚Äù added he.

The plant was switched into hot conservation mode after the war began.

According to the latest data, in January 2022, Azovstal increased the output of rolled steel products by 12%, to 330 thousand tons per month.

In 2021, Azovstal increased the output of rolled steel products by 4.1% compared to 2020, to 4.1 million tons. Crude steel production increased by 3.5% y-o-y, to 4.34 million tons. Pig iron output remained unchanged compared to 2020 ‚Äì 3.8 million tons.

The plant‚Äôs structure of production in 2020 is the following: 70% of the company‚Äôs products are slabs, 18% are steel plates, up to 9% are shaped products.

Azovstal ‚Äòs export structure in 2020 was as follows: 46% of products were shipped to Italy, 11% to Turkey, 6% to the UK, 5% to China.

Azovstal steel plates are used in shipbuilding, power and special machine building, bridge building, production of large-diameter pipes for main gas and oil pipelines.

The OSW emphasizes that the Russians‚Äô withdrawal from the blockade and occupation of Kiev is temporary.

Russian forces have left the Kiev and Chernihiv Oblasts, and are also starting to withdraw from the Sumy Oblast. Russian sabotage and reconnaissance groups aimed at tracking down and eliminating Ukrainian military troops remained in the north of the country, experts from the Center for Eastern Studies (OSW) inform after 39 days of Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine.

The withdrawal of the Russians from the blockade and occupation of the capital is temporary, say Andrzej Wilk and Piotr ≈ªochowski from OSW. As they add, the forces operating so far in the Kiev and Chernihiv region are being transferred to the Russian Belgorod region bordering on the Kharkiv region.

According to the Ukrainian general staff, Russia has problems with replenishing losses and the soldiers‚Äô refusal to take part in the war against Ukraine. In Krasnodar Krai, Dagestan, Ingushetia and Kalmykia, and in the Perm Oblast, the mobilization of reservists, who have been equipped with stored weapons for over 30 years, is to be carried out.

As noted by OSW experts, spoils of war are the main motivating factor for service, because in Russia there is a belief that war participants can improve their financial situation.

OSW: Mariupol‚Äôs defenders hold their positions

As analysts explain, the military situation in the south and east of the country has not changed. Bombing and shelling of civilian and military facilities are underway. Kharkiv is still being blocked, and the enemy is also trying to attack south of Iziumu.

In Donbas, the defenders rescued seven attacks, and the main clashes are Rubi≈ºne and Popasna in the Luhansk region and Avdiyivka, Marjinka, Krasnohorivka and Trojiƒáke in the Donetsk region. In addition, according to reports, a hostile attack is being prepared on the village of We≈Çyka Nowosika on the border with the Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhia oblasts.

Mariupol‚Äôs defenders hold positions in the center, industrial area and port. Local military-civilian administrations are calling on the population to evacuate, and the appeal concerns all residents of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, and in the Kharkiv oblast ‚Äì the Lozov railway junction, which is at risk of missile attacks. The aggressor intensified the shelling of Ukrainian positions and civilian facilities in the Mykolaiv Oblast and on the border of the Kherson and Dnipropetrovsk Oblasts.

Russia is firing at Ukraine‚Äôs strategic infrastructure

The Russians intensified missile fire on strategic infrastructure facilities, partially repeating attacks on previously attacked targets. The Ukrainian side restricts access to detailed information about the targets and consequences of the attacks. It was only confirmed that they were the closed refinery and crude oil storage facilities in Odessa and the fuel storage facilities in Ternopil.

Most likely, similar objects were also shelled in the Rivne and Miko≈Çaj√≥w districts. In addition, the military infrastructure in Wasylk√≥w in the Kiev region (probably the air defense command center at the local airport) and Miko≈Çaj√≥w (probably used as a heliport for the Ba≈Çowne airport) were attacked, analysts explain.

According to the mayor of Chernihiv, the center is 70 percent destroyed. Mer Iziumu estimates the level of damage at 80%. There is no electricity, water or heating in the city, and no rough estimate of the civilian casualties can be given. The number of people who got stuck in the city and surrounding villages is estimated at 15-20 thousand. The authorities of the Donetsk region called on the inhabitants to evacuate the region in connection with the possible escalation of hostilities in the near future.

OSW on Russian information and psychological operations

The State Service for Special Communications of Ukraine does not confirm reports that the occupiers eavesdropped on Ukrainian conversations. All the statements turned out to be false and are part of information and psychological operations, add OSW experts.

According to analysts, they were intended to intimidate citizens, as well as to force them to stop providing their own military with data about the places where enemy equipment was moving. Previously, residents were falsely informed from anonymous numbers that they should turn off their phones, as they increase the accuracy of missile strikes.

In Ukraine, as a result of hostilities, 23,000 people were destroyed. km of roads and 273 bridges and viaducts. The losses are estimated at UAH 874 billion (USD 30 billion). The greatest damage was recorded in the east, south and north.

The missile attacks continued by the Russians continue to increase losses in the road infrastructure. The Ministry of Development of Hromad estimates that 6,800 were destroyed in the country. residential buildings. The cost of reconstruction in the initial period is estimated at tens of billions, and the total cost at hundreds of billions of dollars, summarize OSW experts.
