2,7ee9460f-f33d-4ccc-8412-b08a82c7c700,[],2022-02-24 00:00:00,"Russian media reported quoting President Putin had given approval to a ‘special military operation’ in the Donbas region of Ukraine.

Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “special military operation” in eastern Ukraine has been swiftly condemned by several nations.

The authorisation by Putin was made at the same time as the United Nations Security Council met late on Wednesday for its second emergency meeting this week to urge de-escalation and return to diplomatic talks.

Russian media reported quoting Putin he had given approval to the operation in the Donbas region of Ukraine, where Moscow earlier recognised rebel-held territories in Luhansk and Donetsk and said they had asked for its “help”.

Here is how the world is reacting:

Ukraine

Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Putin had “launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine” and that peaceful cities were “under strikes”.

“This is a war of aggression. Ukraine will defend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now,” he tweeted.

Speaking at an emergency UN Security Council meeting, Ukrainian Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya said it was too late to talk about de-escalation. “I call on every one of you to do everything possible to stop the war,” he said.

United States

President Joe Biden has condemned Russia for an “unprovoked and unjustified attack” on Ukraine while promising that his country and its allies “will hold Russia accountable”.

“President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering. Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way. The world will hold Russia accountable,” he said.

Tomorrow, I will be meeting with the Leaders of the G7, and the United States and our Allies and partners will be imposing severe sanctions on Russia. We will continue to provide support and assistance to Ukraine and the Ukrainian people. — President Biden (@POTUS) February 24, 2022

G7

The Group of Seven industrialised nations strongly condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and said they would bring forward severe and coordinated economic and financial sanctions against Moscow.

“This crisis is a serious threat to the rules-based international order, with ramifications well beyond Europe,” the G7 leaders said in a joint statement, adding Russian President Vladimir Putin had re-introduced war to the European continent.

“He has put himself on the wrong side of history,” said the leaders in the statement released by Germany.

The leaders also said they supported consistent and constructive engagement and coordination among major energy producers and consumers towards stable global energy supplies and were ready to act to address potential disruption.

United Nations

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned Russia’s actions, telling Putin to “bring your troops back to Russia”.

“In the name of humanity, do not allow a war to start in Europe which could be worst war since the beginning of the century with consequences not only devastating for Ukraine, not only tragic for the Russian Federation but with an impact cannot even foresee.”

Speaking at the UN Security Council, Guterres implored Putin to “give peace a chance.”

World Health Organization

The UN health agency has voiced alarm over an expected health emergency in Ukraine.

“Amid the conflict rapidly unfolding in Ukraine, the WHO Regional Office for Europe reiterates its deepest concern for the safety, health and wellbeing of all civilians impacted by the crisis in the country and possibly beyond,” the office said in a statement.

United Kingdom

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was appalled by the horrific events in Ukraine and has spoken to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss the next steps.

“President Putin has chosen a path of bloodshed and destruction by launching this unprovoked attack on Ukraine,” Johnson tweeted.

In a televised address to the nation, he said Western powers would impose massive sanctions to hobble the Russian economy. “Today, in concert with our allies, we will agree a massive package of economic sanctions designed in time to hobble the Russian economy,” he said.

I am appalled by the horrific events in Ukraine and I have spoken to President Zelenskyy to discuss next steps. President Putin has chosen a path of bloodshed and destruction by launching this unprovoked attack on Ukraine. The UK and our allies will respond decisively. — Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson) February 24, 2022

European Union

The bloc will hold Moscow accountable for the “unjustified” attack on Ukraine, the chief of the EU’s Executive Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said.

“In these dark hours, our thoughts are with Ukraine and the innocent women, men and children as they face this unprovoked attack and fear for their lives,” she said on Twitter.

The EU is expected to discuss a further sanctions package on Russia at an emergency meeting later in the day.

Speaking at a news conference alongside the President of the European Council Charles Michel, von der Leyen said EU sanctions will “seriously degrade” Russia’s economy.

NATO

The Atlantic alliance’s secretary general said Russia had “chosen the path of aggression against a sovereign and independent country.”

The attack “puts at risk countless civilian lives,” Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement, describing it as a “grave breach of international law, and a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security.”

After chairing an emergency meeting of NATO ambassadors, Stoltenberg said the Western military alliance will deploy capabilities and forces on its territory after Russian invaded Ukraine, saying it put over 100 warplanes on high alert.

NATO leaders will also hold a virtual summit on Friday.

International Olympic Committee

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said Russia had breached the Olympic Truce that is currently in effect, which aims to harness the power of sport to promote peace and dialogue.

A UN resolution calling for cooperate with the IOC and the International Paralympic Committee “to use sport as a tool to promote peace, dialogue and reconciliation” was adopted on 2 December 2021 by consensus of all 193 UN Member States.

Belarus

President Alexander Lukashenko said the Belarusian armed forces were not taking part in Russia’s military operation against Ukraine, the Belta news agency reported.

“Our troops are taking no part in this operation,” Lukashenko was quoted as saying.

Turkey

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has denounced Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a “heavy blow” to regional peace.

“We reject Russia’s military operation,” Erdogan said in a televised speech, calling it as a “heavy blow to regional peace and stability.”

Czech Republic

Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky said Russia’s attack on Ukraine is a “barbaric act of aggression” and that his country will respond together with its allies,

“The Kremlin’s decision to launch a completely unprovoked attack is unacceptable and in contradiction to international law,” he posted on Twitter.

I strongly condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Kremlin's decision to launch a completely unprovoked attack is unacceptable and in contradiction to international law. Together with Allies, we will respond to this barbaric act of aggression. — Jan Lipavský (@JanLipavsky) February 24, 2022

China

China rejected calling Russia’s moves on Ukraine an “invasion” and urged all sides to exercise restraint.

“You are using a typical Western media question method of using the word invasion,” Hua Chunying, spokesperson at China’s foreign ministry told reporters.

“China is closely monitoring the latest situation. We call on all sides to exercise restraint to prevent the situation from getting out of control.”

The Chinese embassy in Ukraine told its citizens in Ukraine to stay put at home as a precautionary measure, following the bombings of some Ukrainian cities.

Poland

Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki demanded an immediate reaction to Russia’s aggression on Ukraine, seeking the “fiercest possible” sanctions.

“We must immediately respond to Russia’s criminal aggression on Ukraine,” Morawiecki tweeted.

“Europe and the free world have to stop Putin. Today’s European Council should approve fiercest possible sanctions. Our support for Ukraine must be real.”

The country’s health ministry said it is preparing a medical train to transport the wounded, adding that Polish hospitals were ready to receive thousands of patients.

We must immediately respond to Russia's criminal aggression on Ukraine.

Europe and the free world has to stop Putin. Today's European Council should approve fiercest possible sanctions.

Our support for Ukraine must be real. — Mateusz Morawiecki (@MorawieckiM) February 24, 2022

Hungary

Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said “war is the worst-case scenario”.

“The task now, just as always, is to guarantee the security of Hungarian people,” Sjijjarto posted on his official Facebook page.

“Our embassy in Kyiv is operating, and ready to help Hungarians who are in the Ukraine right now.”

Bulgaria

Bulgarian President Rumen Radev said his country was preparing to evacuate by land more than 4,000 ethnic Bulgarians from Ukraine and was ready to host other Ukrainian refugees.

Bulgarian Prime Minister Kiril Petkov said the Balkan country would prepare hotels and other tourism bases to host them.

Australia

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said sanctions against Russia would become law Friday but would not take effect until the end of March.

He said the time was needed to give “opportunities for businesses that have had very legitimate operations and business interests in Russia and in the affected territories of Ukraine to be able to make changes to their arrangements.”

“The reason we’re doing this is there must be a price for the unprovoked, unlawful, unwarranted, unjustified attacks and threats and intimidation that has been imposed by Russia on Ukraine. This cannot be a consequence-free action by Vladimir Putin and the Russian regime,” Morrison said.

Germany

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz condemned Russia’s attack on Ukraine as a “blatant breach of international law” that “cannot be justified by anything”.

He said western sanctions would ensure Russia paid a “bitter price” for its attack on Ukraine and that Putin had made “a serious mistake.”

France

President Emmanuel Macron has said France will stand by Ukraine’s side and warned that Russia’s invasion of its neighbour will have durable and “deep” consequences for the continent of Europe.

“We will respond without weakness to this act of war, with calm, determination and unity,” Macron said in an address to the French nation.

Spain

The Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez condemned the Russian military operation in Ukraine and said he is in contact with allies from NATO to coordinate a response.

Draghi has called on Russia to “withdraw unconditionally” from Ukraine and “put an immediate end to the bloodshed.”

Greece

Greece slammed Russia’s attack on Ukraine as “revisionist” as it scrambled to bolster consular support for its ethnic community of over 100,000 people in the country.

“We strongly condemn the Russian aggression against an independent country,” Greek President Katerina Sakellaropoulou said.

Deputy foreign minister Andreas Katsaniotis said that “while other countries withdrew their diplomats, we increased our personnel.”

Finland

Finland’s President Sauli Niinistö strongly condemned the Russian military measures, describing them as an assault not just on Ukraine, but “on the entire European security order.”

“We feel deep compassion towards Ukraine and are seeking ways to increase our support to Ukraine,” he said.

Since news of the Ukraine-Russia conflict broke, NATO has been a hot topic of discussion. Some member countries have called on Article 4. This ensures NATO members consult whenever any country feels their territory, security or independence is under threat. However, there remains confusion over which European countries are (and are not) in NATO, and why.

Russia’s attack on Ukraine in the early hours of Thursday (24 February 2022) has been justified by Russian president Vladimir Putin as a “demilitarisation and denazification” to protect Russian-speaking citizens of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine.

As reported by the BBC, Putin also accused the US and NATO members of ignoring his requests to reject Ukraine from joining the alliance. At the 2007 Munich Security Conference, he claimed: “It is obvious that NATO expansion does not have any relation with the modernisation of the alliance itself or with ensuring security in Europe. On the contrary, it represents a serious provocation that reduces the level of mutual trust.”

Given the current state of relationships between the neighbouring countries and the fears of other former Soviet Bloc nations, people are curious to know which European countries are members of the Treaty.

There are six EU countries not in NATO, neither is Switzerland

Austria, Cyprus, Finland, Ireland, Malta and Sweden are the only EU states that are not members of NATO. Switzerland – which isn’t a member of the EU – also remains neutral regarding military conflict.

However, all the countries mentioned above, except Cyprus, are members of NATO’s Partnership For Peace (PfP) programme. Established in 1994, the PfP aims to ““ncrease stability, diminish threats to peace and build strengthened security relationships between NATO and non-member countries in the Euro-Atlantic area,” as per the official website.

The full list of the 30 NATO members is available here. Of the 30 member countries, all are deemed in Europe apart from the US and Canada.

Despite Ukraine contributing towards NATO missions, the country is still not an official member. However, the former Soviet state has been close to securing ties in the past two years, something that has angered Russia and Putin. In September 2020, Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskyy approved Ukraine’s National Security Strategy, with the goal to strengthen partnerships with NATO in hopes of future membership.

Why are Austria and Switzerland not in NATO?

Austria was granted neutrality in 1955 through the Constitutional Law On The Neutrality Of Austria, stating its “permanent neutrality of its own accord”. Austria committed itself to “maintain and defend its neutrality with all means at its disposal” in exchange for the withdrawal of Allied forces (Soviet Union, US, UK and France) which had occupied the country since 1945 and the end of the Second World War.

Switzerland has remained fiercely neutral regarding military conflicts, with Alexandre Vautraver – Swiss Military Review’s editor-in-chief – stating Article 5 of the NATO treaty was “incompatible with neutrality” as it follows the principal of collective defence, implying an attack on one ally is considered an attack on all allies.

4,7ee9460f-f33d-4ccc-8412-b08a82c7c700,['View All Posts Jmbk.News'],2022-02-25 00:00:00,"In an unprovoked attack on Ukraine, all of Europe may be on the edge of a nuclear catastrophe as Putin moves Russian troops in closer to capture the nation. On Thursday, February 24th Russian troops had moved in to capture the abandon reactor at the Chernobyl Nuclear powerplant, giving Russia the advantage of a “nuclear threat.” The result of combat between the two countries has already stirred up residual radiation, causing an extreme spike in radiation levels, which could lead to decade old residual nuclear fallout being distributed across Europe.

The nuclear reactor meltdown of 1986 caused an international incident, causing the evacuation of the city of Chernobyl. If Putin can seize the Chernobyl power plant, they will be able to use the threat of nuclear war to allow the surrender of independent territories, possibly even all of Ukraine. The Ukrainian President spoke on Twitter, announcing this was now a War on all of Europe.

Not only have Russian forces moved in to take Chernobyl, but Ukraine’s capitol Kiev, and surrounding cities are also under attack seemingly from all directions. Reports from Russia show Putin has fired missiles on Kiev1, Odessa2, and Chuhuiv, destroying buildings and apartment complexes. Initial reports state eighteen were killed in Odessa, while photos emerged online of injured and bloodied Ukrainians in Chuhuiv, including those mourning their lost family and friends who perished during the attack3.

Early reports indicated that Belarusian troops had invaded alongside Russian troops, though President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus denied these allegations.

“Our troops are not taking any part in this operation,” the Belarusian president assured4.

Russia’s Plan of Attack

Putin announced his plan of attack, which was ignored by much of the world. Following China’s 2022 Winter Olympic Games, Putin sent in troops to attack, targeting Chernobyl, Kyiv, Pripyat, Odessa, Crimea, and Eastern Ukraine’s Separatist regions.

The Chernobyl Exclusion Zone is stated to be one of the most radioactive places which exist on Earth. According to a report5 environmental impacts still occur to this day, including fish, milk, meat, and even wood from trees.

“The Chernobyl accident was the largest nuclear accident in history. The higher radionuclide depositions occurred in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine, but high deposition also occurred in a number of other European countries6.”

“Of the 600 workers present on the site, 134 suffered from radiation sickness. Of those, 28 died in the first three months. Another 19 died in the 1987-2004 period of various causes, not necessarily associated with radiation exposure.”

Under the guise of the abandoned Ukrainian cities, Putin was able to advance on Ukrainian troops undetected.

Biological Warfare

Radiation Levels

Radiation Levels have skyrocketed according to real-time radiation monitoring of Chernobyl7. On February 23rd, 2022 steady levels had been reported for years around 3,000 nSv/h, yet on February 24th, 2022 during the Russian invasion, it rose to over 65,000 nSv/h. That is an over two thousand percent [2083%] increase in radiation levels.

This data means that the Russian invasion of Ukraine has become full-scale biological warfare. Now, Ukrainian [and Russian] troops are being exposed to decade old residual radiation from the largest nuclear reactor meltdown in the history of humanity. Should other countries become involved, they will also risk exposure to gamma ray ionizing radiation.

Gamma Rays

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines gamma rays as “a radiation hazard for the entire body8.” Gamma rays have enough penetrating power to destroy tissue, and damage DNA.

According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Gamma rays are the most penetrating type of radiation, capable of traveling miles through air and penetrating deeply into tissue. Gamma rays are known to cause extensive damage to tissues extending deep into vital organs9.

As the Russian troops kick up gamma rays and other radioactive dust, this active biowarfare extend its impacts beyond Ukraine’s borders. Fighting on terrain alongside active nuclear reactors opens potential for an inconceivable international disaster, while functioning as a strategic advantage for Putin. The frightening possibility is the sheer extent that Putin’s platoon will go to conquer Ukraine, claiming their victory.

To outside countries across the world, individual leaders and their officials have spoken on behalf of Ukraine, condemning their actions, many countries citing this offensive and dangerous invasion as an act of war on all of Europe. Beyond the horrifying potential of another nuclear reactor meltdown, Putin’s actions show his distaste for the rest of the world, as his troops lead their attack on a European ally. Beyond government officials, the aggressive breach of the Ukrainian borders was felt by billions of people around the world.

Ukraine’s Response

The President of Ukraine [Президент України] Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Russian occupation forces were attempting to seize the Chernobyl power plant. Ukraine’s President also alerted other nation’s leaders stating this was a declaration of war against all of Europe.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy

“Phone conversation with @JustinTrudeau 🇨🇦 Today there is a full-scale war throughout 🇺🇦! We demand the immediate imposition of additional tough sanctions against Russia. Now, more than ever, we need concrete support! I count on leadership of 🇨🇦 in this process13!”

Global Response

European countries united together, enlisting each other’s support to fight the imperialist Russian takeover, as the battle for Ukraine wages on. Across the world, nations condemned the actions of Putin, and the advancement of his troops on a non-hostile military force. Despite the blood on the front lines, a sense of unity has been provoked throughout the world, where many countries publicly oppose authoritarian imperialism, despite having ties to the regimes themselves.

These restrictions that are made to harm the tyrannical Putin, will ultimately be more devastating to the people under Putin’s rule. Russian citizens will suffer as a result of the Russian invasion through the increased cost of international products, through sanctions covering every possible sector.

France

Emmanuel Macron called Putin’s offensive maneuver a “refusal” of diplomacy, calling for European unity against the “ghosts of the past.”

“PM Orbán on @EUCouncil joined other EU MSs condemning the Russian military actions and adopting EU sanctions. EU leaders underlined dialogue and agreed to provide financial assistance to assure UA’s stability. They as well emphasised the protection of the Eastern borders.37”

“PM Orbán after the NatSec Operational Corps: HU together with EU and NATO allies condemns the Russian military actions. HU’s safety is #1 priority, so we won’t send soldiers or weapons to UA but are ready to give humanitarian help especially in case of UA people seeking refuge38.”

NATO Secretary General

Jens Stoltenberg

“Spoke with President Sauli @niinisto on #Russia‘s attack on #Ukraine. At our #NATO Summit tomorrow our close partners #Finland, #Sweden & the #EU will join us to address the greatest crisis for European security in a generation39.”

“Spoke with PM @MarkRutte of the #Netherlands on #Russia‘s invasion of #Ukraine. Despite our tireless efforts to pursue diplomacy, Moscow has chosen the path of war. I have convened a Summit with Allied leaders tomorrow to discuss our next steps40.”

“Joined G7 Leaders’ meeting on #Russia‘s brutal attack on #Ukraine. #NATO is part of a united international response. We say with one voice that democracy will prevail over autocracy. Freedom will prevail over oppression41.”

The United Kingdom

Boris Johnson

“I am appalled by the horrific events in Ukraine and I have spoken to President Zelenskyy to discuss next steps. President Putin has chosen a path of bloodshed and destruction by launching this unprovoked attack on Ukraine. The UK and our allies will respond decisively42.”

“To our Ukrainian friends in this moment of agony, we are with you and we are on your side. Your right to choose your own destiny is a right that the United Kingdom and our allies will always defend. Slava Ukraini43”

“Ukraine is a country that for decades has enjoyed freedom and democracy and the right to choose its own destiny. We – and the world – cannot allow that freedom just to be snuffed out. We cannot and will not just look away44.”

Canada

Justin Trudeau

“Russia’s actions are an affront to the democratic principles that generations of Canadians have fought to protect. We must make sure the Ukrainian people – like all people – are free to determine their own future, and we must stand firmly against authoritarianism.45”

“We’re imposing new and severe sanctions on those responsible for Russia’s brutal, unjustified attack on Ukraine. These sanctions will target banks, financial elites, and members of the Russian Security Council — including the Defence, Finance, and Justice Ministers46.”

Mélanie Joly – Minister of Foreign Affairs

“Russia is solely responsible for this crisis and their actions will not go unpunished. Canada has one of the strongest sanctions package being imposed today, and together with our Allies, we are imposing severe costs to the Russian regime and the Russian economy47.”

The United States of America

President Biden made stern remarks regarding Putin’s advancement on Ukraine. These words comes after Biden handed over the Pipeline Nord Stream 2 in May 2021, waiving sanctions to Putin. Conversely, the President announcing a Green initiative, executed the shutdown of Keystone XL Pipeline in June contributing to the extreme inflation experienced throughout America.

U.S. President Biden

“Today, I am authorizing additional strong sanctions and new limitations on what can be exported to Russia. This will impose severe costs on the Russian economy — both immediately and over time48.”

“With today’s actions, we have now sanctioned Russian banks that hold around $1 trillion in assets. We cut off Russia’s largest bank — and we are also fully blocking four more major banks. That means every asset they have in America will be frozen49.”

“As promised, we’re also adding names to the list of Russian elites and their family members that we are sanctioning. These are people who personally gain from the Kremlin’s policies — and they should share in the pain50.”

“On Tuesday, we stopped the Russian government from raising money from U.S. or European investors. Now, we will apply the same restriction to Russia’s largest state-owned enterprises — companies with estimated assets of $1.4 trillion51.”

“Some of the most powerful impacts of our actions will come over time as we squeeze Russia’s access to finance and technology for strategic sectors of its economy. Along with our Allies and partners, we estimate we will cut off more than half of Russia’s high-tech imports52.”

“It will strike a blow to their ability to continue to modernize their military. It will degrade their aerospace industry. It will hurt their ability to build ships. It will be a major hit to Putin’s long-term strategic ambitions. And we are prepared to do more53.”

“President Zelenskyy reached out to me tonight and we just finished speaking. I condemned this unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces. I briefed him on the steps we are taking to rally international condemnation, including tonight at the UN Security Council.54”

Conclusion

As Russia continues to attack Ukraine, many European nations have banded together to come forward in Ukraine’s defense. Putin seeks to conquer the entire nation, sparing no expense, bringing apparent evidence that this has been in strategic coordination for quite some time. Will sanctions be enough to combat the radioactive fallout, and the dangers of waging war on a battlefield shared with live nuclear reactors?

Will the invasion of Ukraine, and the threat of nuclear war trigger other countries to respond in defense of Ukraine? Could an international response to this battle between Russia and Ukraine be the start of a third World War?

As Xi Jinping watches the global response to the invasion of Ukraine, he is able to gain a better understanding into the modern global response to an invasion of claimed territories. Xi Jinping may have known in advance about these attacks, and Putin’s plans for a full-scale invasion. Putin even coordinated his troops for the attack to proceed the conclusion of the 2022 Olympic Winter Games. How will this invasion play a role in the influence of the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) invasion of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Tibet, in an attempt to gain the semiconductor manufacturing, and natural resources? What has Putin’s actions revealed to nefarious dictators in the face of global criticism?",https://jmbk.news/2022/02/25/russia-invades-chernobyl/

Los últimos en incorporarse han sido los aviones que se encuentran en Bulgaria. Ninguna de las tres misiones es nueva, todas llevan años en marcha.

Militares españoles de los tres Ejércitos se suman así a misiones con destino al Mar Negro, Bulgaria y Letonia, donde se encuentra el mayor número de efectivos: 350 militares, la mayoría de la Brigada 'Guzmán el Bueno' de Córdoba. Estos efectivos, además, cuentan con los carros de combate Leopard y Pizarro, elementos importantes del Ejército de Tierra. Junto a otros 17 países de la OTAN, impulsan una maniobra disuasoria hacia Rusia, una misión que no es nueva y que comenzó hace cinco años.

El pasado mes de enero, zarpó desde Cartagena (Murcia) el cazaminas M-32 Sella, el tercero de los tres buques que la Armada Española mantiene presentes en la zona de crisis, con más de 300 marinos. Además, el pasado mes de enero también zarpó desde Ferrol la fragata Blas de Lezo y el buque Meteoro ante la escalada de tensión entre Rusia y Ucrania.

Estos militares permanecerán entre el Mar Negro y el Mediterráneo oriental entre dos y tres meses y forman parte de las agrupaciones permanentes de la OTAN, unas fuerzas navales de disuasión creadas hace décadas que navegan durante todo en año en aguas de interés para la Alianza.

Los últimos en incorporarse han sido cuatro cazas, unos aviones que han ido desde una base de Albacete a Bulgaria, y con ellos 130 militares del Ejército del Aire, entre los que se encuentran pilotos, agentes de mantenimiento, logística y seguridad. Se encargarán de controlar que ningún avión ruso entre en el espacio aéreo de Bulgaria y países vecinos. Una tarea defensiva que los cazas españoles llevan desempeñando en la zona desde 2006.

El secretario de la OTAN, Jens Stoltenberg, ha indicado este jueves que la alianza militar occidental ha puesto en alerta máxima a sus tropas. El plan de defensa consiste en dar permiso a los jefes militares para utilizar el armamento de los aliados en defensa, ante la posible invasión total de Ucrania. el plan incluye el despliegue de 100 aviones para proteger el espacio aéreo europeo, más de120 buques aliados y el envío de más tropas a las fronteras.

“Hoy hemos activado los planes de defensa de la OTAN, que les otorgan a nuestros jefes militares más autoridad para mover fuerzas y desplegar fuerzas cuando fuese necesario y, por supuesto, estos podrían ser también elementos de la fuerza de respuesta de la OTAN” -Jens Stoltenberg

Stoltenberg también ha anunciado a una convocatoria extraordinaria de manera virtual a los 30 líderes de la Alianza Atlántica para este viernes. Con el objetivo de evaluar los pasos a seguir ante una posible invasión, aunque ha explicado que los países aliados no tienen intención de enviar tropas aliadas a Ucrania. Pero que si Ucrania le pide ayuda de la OTAN se la darán sin dudarlo.

¿Qué es la OTAN?

​La Organización del Tratado del Atlántico Norte (OTAN) tiene sus orígenes en la firma del Tratado de Washington de 1949. Mediante el cual diez países de ambos lados del Atlántico que son: Bélgica, Canadá, Dinamarca, Estados Unidos, Francia, Islandia, Italia, Luxemburgo, Noruega, Países Bajos, Portugal y Reino Unido. Se comprometieron a defenderse mutuamente en caso de agresión armada contra cualquiera de ellos

La expansión de la OTAN en Europa en las décadas de 1990 y 2000 para incluir países como Polonia, Lituania, Letonia y Estonia ha detonado el miedo de Rusia por la invasión extranjera. A pesar de que la OTAN ha recalcado que su propósito solo es crear una alianza defensiva. Pero muchos en Rusia la ven como una organización militar dominada por Estados Unidos, que ha invadido países extranjeros como Afganistán e Irak dos veces en los últimos 20 años. Por lo que Rusia se ha mantenido en constante alerta ante los movimientos de la organización.

Ante esto, los funcionarios de inteligencia de Estados Unidos advirtieron recientemente a los aliados de la OTAN que las fuerzas militares rusas están concentrando hasta 175.000 soldados en la frontera de Ucrania. Y podrían estar en condiciones de invadir ese país a finales de enero. De hecho, el 24 de ese mismo mes, Reino Unido y Estados Unidos ordenaron la evacuación de las familias de los diplomáticos en Kiev, ante una invasión que cada vez parece más inminente. También, el día 25 de enero Estados Unidos anunciaba el estado de alerta máxima para 8.500 soldados, totalmente preparados para movilizarse ante cualquier necesidad de la OTAN en la zona.

¿Por qué Rusia ataca a Ucrania?

Ucrania ha estado en guerra fría con Rusia desde hace un par de años lo que ocasionó que el 16 de marzo 2014 se independizará los pueblos de la península de Crimea de Ucrania para que tiempo después Rusia pudiera tener el alquiler de la base naval en Sebastopol hasta 2042. Ahora se encuentran en constante pelea por el territorio de Donetsk y Lugansk.

La guerra detonó en cuanto Putin, emitió un discurso de una hora emitido durante la noche del lunes en la televisión rusa, dijo que Ucrania no tenía legitimidad histórica como país independiente. La respuesta del presidente de Ucrania, Volodymyr Zelensky, por medio de un discurso en la televisión local advirtió que una invasión del país vecino sería el inicio de una gran guerra en el continente Europeo.

En conclusión, el conflicto surge debido a que Rusia al no dejar que se expanda la OTAN debido a que la ve como una gran amenaza, no dejara que Ucrania pertenezca a esta asociación o que haya infiltrados de dicha organización dado a que son vecinos por lo que la creación de bases militares enemigas tan cerca de su territorio, volverían sumamente vulnerable al país soviético. Por lo que Rusia ha decido tener más influencia y control en Ucrania para evitar un atentado en su nación.",https://www.mexmads.com/la-otan-activa-el-plan-de-defensa-por-la-invasion-de-rusia-a-ucrania/
