The warning from the Ministry of Defence came as there were more missile strikes against cities on Tuesday including a Russian missile striking a TV tower in Kyiv which killed five people.

Ukraine’s foreign ministry condemned Russia for the “barbaric” attack, which was near a memorial site commemorating the victims of Babyn Yar, one of the biggest single massacres of Jews during the Holocaust.

Kremlin spokesman Igor Konashenkov called on residents living in Kyiv to “leave their homes” in anticipation of further strikes on Tuesday evening.

“Over the past 48 hours, increased numbers of Russian air and artillery strikes have been conducted against densely populated urban areas across Ukraine,” the MOD said.

The UK defence chiefs also warned a column of tanks and other military vehicles, said to be 40-miles long, continues to make “slow progress” towards the capital Kyiv.

The defence chiefs added: “Ukrainian forces continue to hold the cities of Kharkiv, Kherson and Mariupol, however all three cities are now likely encircled by Russian forces.”

Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city was hit by a strikes on Tuesday including in its Freedom Square where at least 10 civilians were killed , in a move which Ukranian president Volodymyr Zelensky condemned as a war crime.

The air strikes came amid pleas from Ukraine for Nato to help repel the Russian invasions to enforce a no-fly zone over the nation to prevent bombings from Russian president Vladimir Putin’s planes.

But Boris Johnson again rejected President Zelensky’s calls for British forces to actively join the effort, warning it would trigger a wider war with Russia.

On a visit to Nato members Poland and Estonia to shore up support for the defence alliance Mr Johnson said: “When it comes to a no-fly zone in the skies above Ukraine we have to accept the reality that that involves shooting down Russian planes … that’s a very, very big step, it’s simply not on the agenda of any Nato country.”

The attack on the TV tower came soon after the Russian defence ministry said it would launch missile strikes on the Ukrainian capital to destroy buildings and other infrastructure in what it claimed was retaliation for cyberattacks against Russia.

It said “high-precision” strikes would target facilities of the Ukrainian state security service, as well as what it described as a centre of “psychological and information operations”.

The airstrike caused devastation in the area surrounding the TV tower, which is close to the city centre and smoke could be seen billowing from Kyiv’s skyline.

As well as causing casualties, the attack also knocked some Ukrainian TV channels offline.

In a tweet, the defence ministry has said some Ukrainian channels would not work for a while but backup programmes would be broadcast in their place.

On twitter, the foreign ministry said “Russian troops fired on the TV tower, near the Memorial complex #BabynYar”.

It added: “Russian criminals do not stop at anything in their barbarism. Russia = barbarian.”

Earlier in the day, Mr Zelensky was given a standing ovation following a virtual speech at the European Parliament, saying “nobody will break us”.

Meanwhile UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Alexander Lukashenko’s administration would be ‘made to feel the economic consequences’ for supporting Moscow as she announced sanctions on Belarus.

Belarusian military chiefs are among those to be targeted as part of the UK’s first tranche of sanctions against Minsk for the role it is playing in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The images are being posted on various Telegram channels run by Ukraine’s interior ministry and Security Service as the violence continues to escalate.

One grim photo shows the mutilated body of a Russian soldier lying in a field with his flesh and organs alongside him.

Days after launching the full-scale attack, Moscow was still refusing to disclose how many of its own soldiers had been killed or captured.

Another features a man dressed in his camouflage uniform lying frozen in the snow close to bombed Russian tanks and vehicles.

Other images show the charred or bloodied remains of troops lying on roadsides that have been obliterated.

Russian troops were met with huge resistance from Ukrainian forces after President Vladimir Putin gave the orders to invade last week.

But days after launching the full-scale attack, Moscow was still refusing to disclose how many of its own soldiers had been killed or captured.

Russia’s defense ministry only admitted on Sunday that they had experienced some losses, but only went as far as saying the number was far lower than those suffered by Ukraine.

In addition to the photos of slain soldiers, Ukrainian officials are parading captured Russian forces on social media by posting videos of them weeping and admitting to war crimes.

In one of the confessional videos, one soldier claimed that Russian forces were killing their own wounded soldiers and then just leaving their bodies behind without informing their relatives, Ukrainian officials said.

“We are killing civilians who haven’t done anything wrong,” a Russian soldier said in one video when he was asked what he was doing in Ukraine.

Another confessed: “Let Vladimir Putin see this. Enough. It’s been a meat grinder here. Children are being killed.”

Others cried as they called relatives to reveal they had been captured, including some who said they didn’t know they were being sent to fight.

“I became a prisoner of war in Ukraine,” one soldier said during a call. “When we were sent here, we were told that we were going as peacekeepers … but in fact a war has now broken out and we are aggressors.”",https://nypost.com/2022/03/02/ukrainian-officials-post-photos-of-dead-russian-soldiers-online/

Despite sanctions and warnings of a humanitarian crisis, the fresh assaults on day six of Russia's invasion came as a massive military convoy was closing on the capital, and Moscow warned terrified residents living near security infrastructure to leave their homes.

""This is state terrorism on the part of Russia,"" charged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, accusing Moscow of committing a ""war crime"" in Kharkiv.

After a call with U.S. President Joe Biden — who later delivered a State of the Union address overshadowed by the spiraling Ukraine conflict — Zelensky tweeted: ""We must stop the aggressor as soon as possible.""

Although Russia has denied targeting civilian infrastructure, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday called the bombardment of Kharkiv ""absolutely sickening"" and reminiscent of massacres of civilians in Sarajevo in the 1990s.

Eight people were reported killed in the strike on a residential building in the city, Ukraine's second largest, and officials said 10 people had been killed by Russian shelling on a local government complex.

The Kyiv TV tower strike killed five people and knocked out some state broadcasting, Ukrainian officials said, but left the structure intact.

Strategic win along Azov Sea



The International Criminal Court has already opened a war crimes investigation against Russia. Ukraine says more than 350 civilians, including 14 children, have been killed in the conflict.

In southern Ukraine, the city of Mariupol on the Azov Sea was left without electricity after bombardment, while Kherson on the Black Sea reported Russian checkpoints encircling the city.

In a key victory for Moscow, Russia's Defense Ministry said its troops had linked up with pro-Moscow rebel forces from eastern Ukraine along the Azov Sea coast.

But Ukrainian forces say despite incursions by ""sabotage groups,"" Russian forces have yet to capture a major city.

'Shattered peace in Europe'



During a visit to an airbase in Poland, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said Russian President Vladimir Putin had ""shattered peace in Europe.""

Zelensky reiterated an urgent appeal for his country to be admitted to the European Union.

""Prove you are not abandoning us and you are really Europeans,"" he told MEPs in a video address to the European Parliament.

More than 660,000 people have fled abroad, the UN refugee agency said, estimating that a million people are displaced within ex-Soviet Ukraine, which has a population of 44 million.

Russia has defied international bans, boycotts and sanctions to press ahead with an offensive it says is aimed at defending Ukraine's Russian speakers and toppling the leadership.

Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Russia would continue ""until set goals are achieved.""

He vowed to ""demilitarize and de-Nazify"" Ukraine and protect Russia from a ""military threat created by Western countries.""

Western powers are planning more sanctions, with French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire vowing they would cause the ""collapse of the Russian economy"" — before saying his language was inappropriate.

Russia's ex-president Dmitry Medvedev, deputy head of Russia's Security Council, hit back, warning that ""economic wars quite often turned into real ones.""

Bombing 'all night'



Fears are growing of an all-out assault to capture Kyiv, a city of 2.8 million.

Satellite images provided by U.S. firm Mazar showed a 65-kilometer (40-mile) long build-up of Russian armored vehicles and artillery north of the capital.

Inside Kyiv, makeshift barricades dotted the streets and residents queued outside the few shops open to buy essentials.

In nearby Shaika village, Natasha, 51, opened a canteen in the local church to feed soldiers and volunteers.

""The shelling and the bombing kept us up all night,"" she said.

Sanctions hit Russians



Western nations have moved to further isolate Russia, responding with an intensifying diplomatic, economic, cultural and sporting backlash.

Germany has already promised arms for Ukraine, while the EU said, in a first, that it will buy and supply arms to the country.

Turkey said it would implement an international treaty to limit ships passing through the Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits, a move requested by Ukraine to block Russian warships.

Apple on Tuesday stopped all sales in Russia. And the European Union banned Russian state media outlets RT and Sputnik from broadcasting in the bloc while also barring some Russian banks from the SWIFT bank system.

Within Russia, sanctions imposed by the West have begun to bite.

Putin announced emergency measures intended to prop up the Russian ruble, including banning Russians from transferring money abroad, after the currency crashed to a record low.

Russia's invasion has triggered a widening international sporting ban.

Traditionally a powerhouse in figure skating, Russia's skaters have been barred from all competitions and its athletes were also barred from this year's world championships.

FIFA has already kicked Russia out of the 2022 World Cup.

After nearly a week, Russia has yet to achieve its aim of overthrowing Ukraine's government, but has, according to the Ukrainian emergency service, killed more than 2,000 civilians and destroyed hospitals, kindergartens and homes.

The invasion has sent more than 870,000 people fleeing over Ukraine's borders and retaliatory sanctions have shaken the world economy, with surging oil prices exacerbating fears of inflation.

It comes as the UN General Assembly voted overwhelmingly to demand that Russia immediately stops using force against Ukraine and withdraws its military from the country, with 141 nations backing the motion and only five, including alleged co-aggressor Belarus, opposing it.

Resolutions of the General Assembly are not legally binding but do show the strength of international feeling and further diplomatically isolates Russia at the UN.

Bombing of Kharkiv, an eastern city of 1.5 million people, has left its centre a wasteland of ruined buildings and debris.

""The Russian 'liberators' have come,"" one Ukrainian volunteer lamented sarcastically, as he and three others strained to carry the dead body of a man wrapped in a bedsheet out of the ruins on a main square.

After an air strike on Wednesday morning, the roof of a police building in central Kharkiv collapsed as it was engulfed in flames. Authorities said 21 people were killed by shelling and air strikes in the city in the past 24 hours, and four more on Wednesday morning.

Moscow denies targeting civilians and says it aims to disarm Ukraine, a country of 44 million people, in a ""special military operation"".

Russia said it had sent delegates for a second round of peace talks in Belarus. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia must stop bombing if it wanted to negotiate.

According to Russia’s Defence Ministry, some 498 Russian troops have been killed in Ukraine, with 1,597 wounded.

Here are the latest developments:

Russia’s defence ministry says it has captured the southern city of Kherson, something local officials have denied. Situated on the Dniepr river, the provincial capital would be the biggest Ukrainian to be taken by city Russian forces so far.

UN believes Russia controls area around Europe's largest nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine

Russian armed forces are believed to have taken control of the area around Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia - the largest nuclear power plant in Europe and one of the 10 largest in the world.

According to the UN’s nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi, Russian diplomats in Vienna have informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that personnel have been allowed to continue their work.

The IAEA was told radiation levels ""remain normal"".

Six out of Ukraine’s 15 nuclear energy reactors are located in Zaporizhzhia.

There are reports online of Ukrainian citizens blocking roads leading to the power plant.

One video shows Ukrainians building makeshift roadblocks near the city of Energodar, close to Zaporizhzhia.

Meanwhile, Russian forces escalated their attacks on crowded urban areas in what Ukraine’s leader called ""a blatant campaign of terror.""

Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have fled the fighting since Putin ordered a full-scale invasion nearly a week ago, with a 65km-long Russian military convoy north of Kyiv readying to advance on the capital.

'Nobody will forgive. Nobody will forget'

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during an address posted online. Picture: Facebook

Mr Zelenskyy said Russia's attack on Babyn Yar – the site of a second world war massacre of Jews by German occupation troops and Ukrainian auxiliaries - proved that Russia does not ""know a think about our history.""

""This strike proves that for many people in Russia our Kyiv is absolutely foreign.

They don’t know a thing about Kyiv, about our history. But they all have orders to erase our history, erase our country, erase us all.

“Nobody will forgive. Nobody will forget,” Mr Zelenskyy vowed after the bloodshed on the central square in Kharkiv, the country’s second-largest city, and the deadly bombing of a TV tower in the capital.

The invading forces also pressed their assault on other towns and cities, including the strategic ports of Odesa and Mariupol in the south.

Yet, Russia has failed to capture a Ukrainian single major city and Western analysts say Moscow appears to have fallen back on tactics which call for devastating shelling of built-up areas before entering them.

Day six of the biggest ground war in Europe since World War II found Russia increasingly isolated, beset by the sanctions that have thrown its economy into turmoil and left the country practically friendless, apart from a few nations like China, Belarus and North Korea.

Death toll mounts

As the fighting in Ukraine raged, the death toll remained unclear.

One senior Western intelligence official estimated that more than 6,000 Russian soldiers had been captured or killed. Ukraine gave no overall estimate of troop losses.

The UN human rights office said it has recorded 136 civilian deaths. The real toll is believed to be far higher, with Ukraine’s emergency service claiming up to 2,000 civilians have been killed.

The UK's ministry of defence said it had seen an increase in Russian air and artillery strikes on populated urban areas over the past two days. It also said two cities — Kharkiv and Mariupol — were encircled by Russian forces.

Many military experts worry that Russia may be shifting tactics. Moscow’s strategy in Chechnya and Syria was to use artillery and air bombardments to pulverize cities and crush fighters’ resolve.

Ukrainian authorities said five people were killed in the attack on the TV tower, which is near central Kyiv and a short walk from numerous apartment buildings. A TV control room and power substation were hit, and at least some Ukrainian channels briefly stopped broadcasting, officials said.

The bombing came after Russia announced it would target transmission facilities used by Ukraine’s intelligence agency. It urged people living near such places to leave their homes.

Mr Zelensky’s office also reported a missile attack on the site of the Babi Yar Holocaust memorial, near the tower. A spokesman for the memorial said a Jewish cemetery at the site, where Nazi occupiers killed more than 33,000 Jews over two days in 1941, was damaged, but the extent would not be clear until daylight.

In Kharkiv, with a population of about 1.5 million, at least six people were killed when the region’s Soviet-era administrative building on Freedom Square was hit with what was believed to be a missile.

15 other people were killed during fighting elsewhere in the city.

The Slovenian foreign ministry said its consulate in Kharkiv, located in another large building on the square, was destroyed in the attack.

The attack on Freedom Square – Ukraine’s largest plaza, and the nucleus of public life in the city – was seen by many Ukrainians as brazen evidence that the Russian invasion was not just about hitting military targets but also about breaking their spirit.

The bombardment blew out windows and walls of buildings that ring the massive square, which was piled high with debris and dust. Inside one building, chunks of plaster were scattered, and doors, ripped from their hinges, lay across hallways.

“People are under the ruins. We have pulled out bodies,” said Yevhen Vasylenko, an emergency official.

Zelenskyy: 'This is state terrorism of the Russian Federation'

Mr Zelenskyy pronounced the attack on the square “frank, undisguised terror” and a war crime. “This is state terrorism of the Russian Federation,” he said.

In an emotional appeal to the European Parliament later, Mr Zelenskyy said: “We are fighting also to be equal members of Europe. I believe that today we are showing everybody that is what we are.”

Another Russian airstrike hit a residential area in the city of Zhytomyr, the town’s mayor said. Ukraine’s emergency services said Tuesday’s strike killed at least two people, set three homes on fire and broke the windows in a nearby hospital. About 85 miles west of Kyiv, Zhytomyr is the home of the elite 95th Air Assault Brigade, which may have been the intended target.

Mr Zelenskyy said 16 children had been killed around Ukraine on Monday, and he mocked Russia’s claim that it is going after only military targets.

“Where are the children? What kind of military factories do they work at? What tanks are they going at?” Mr Zelenskyy said.

Human Rights Watch said it documented a cluster bomb attack outside a hospital in Ukraine’s east in recent days. Residents also reported the use of such weapons in Kharkiv and Kiyanka village. The Kremlin denied using cluster bombs.

Cluster bombs shoot smaller “bomblets” over a large area, many of which fail to explode until long after they’ve been dropped. If their use is confirmed, that would represent a new level of brutality in the war and could lead to further isolation of Russia.

The first talks between Russia and Ukraine since the invasion were held on Monday, but ended with only an agreement to talk again. On Tuesday, Mr Zelenskyy said Russia should stop bombing first.

""It's necessary to at least stop bombing people, just stop the bombing and then sit down at the negotiating table,"" he told Reuters and CNN in a joint interview in a heavily guarded government compound in Kyiv.

Inside Russia, a top radio station critical of the Kremlin was taken off the air after authorities threatened to shut it down over its coverage of the invasion. Among other things, the Kremlin is not allowing the fighting to be referred to as an “invasion” or “war”.

“It is a nightmare, and it seizes you from the inside very strongly. This cannot be explained with words,” said Kharkiv resident Ekaterina Babenko, taking shelter in a basement with neighbours for a fifth straight day. “We have small children, elderly people, and frankly speaking it is very frightening.”

Ukraine’s Defence Ministry also said on Tuesday it has evidence that Belarus, a Russian ally, is preparing to send troops into Ukraine, while oil prices surged more than 5 dollars per barrel after a release of supplies failed to calm markets.

Biden: 'Putin has no idea what's coming'

""While he may make gains on the battlefield – he will pay a continuing high price over the long run,"" Biden said in his State of the Union address. Straying from the prepared text, Biden added ""He has no idea what's coming.""

The United Nations General Assembly is set to reprimand Russia on Wednesday for invading Ukraine and demand that Moscow stop fighting and withdraw its military forces, a move that aims to diplomatically isolate Russia at the world body.

By Tuesday evening nearly half the 193-member General Assembly had signed on as co-sponsors of a draft resolution ahead of a vote on Wednesday, diplomats said. The text ""deplores"" Russia's ""aggression against Ukraine.""",https://www.irishexaminer.com/world/arid-40819755.html

A Russian woman has set fire to her passport during a protest in Edinburgh on Tuesday.

Anna Jakubova, from Moscow, set her passport alight at a vigil set up to show solidarity with Ukraine which saw hundreds of protestors travel across the country to attend.

She said she took the decision to burn her travel document “as a gesture against the Russian government”.

She said: “I burnt my passport as a gesture against the Russian government and to show that even Russian citizens are turning against this country and the horrific things that it’s doing.

“I am hoping to attract attention to the plight of the Ukrainians and give them a voice to amplify their suffering and their struggles.”

Ms Jakubova, a graduate from the University of Edinburgh, travelled from Dundee for the event.

She praised also Russian people back home for taking to the streets in a show of defiance against their leader Vladimir Putin after he invaded Ukraine.

The 26-year-old continued: “There are quite a few Russians protesting in Moscow and they are risking their livelihoods and their careers and their families.

“I feel I am representing a significant proportion of Russians, even if it’s not the majority.”

Ms Jakubova added: “I don’t want to be a citizen of a country that committed war crimes that are so horrible it killed children and innocent people who are just defending their own country.

“I don’t think I would be able to go back to Russia and I don’t think I want to. I feel very sad. I feel shame that it is a country that is associated with me that has done this. I feel like nothing I can do is enough.”

Demonstrations have taken place across the UK including in Edinburgh and London.

It comes as the Russian invasion of Ukraine entered its seventh day.

Russian troops have escalated the shelling of Ukraine’s second largest city Kharkiv following an airstrike at Freedom Square on Monday which destroyed the opera house and a local administration building.

In the country’s capital Kyiv, a Russian missile hit a TV tower, killing five people and knocking Ukrainian broadcasters offline.

Dmitry Koshkin, 41, originally from Kharkiv and now living in Edinburgh, also attended the vigil.

He has relatives who are hiding in a bomb shelter in his home city including his cousin, his cousin’s wife and their nine-year-old son.

“My cousin actually celebrated his birthday in these four concrete walls,” he said.

“It’s smelly and crammed with people with lots of children and people with dogs and cats. So, for his birthday present to himself, he actually ran back home to take a hot bath. That was his birthday treat.”

Mr Koshkin added: “I cannot comprehend these conditions. It also feels wrong to sit in my warm Edinburgh flat while they are doing that.

“I try to come to these gatherings as much as I can just to do something because it tears me apart that they are over there, struggling, fighting, helping each other, and I am 5,000 miles away, I cannot do much except for message on WhatsApp.”",https://uk.news.yahoo.com/russian-woman-burns-her-passport-130923745.html

“Nobody will forgive. Nobody will forget,” Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky vowed after Tuesday’s bloodshed on the central square in Kharkiv, the country’s second-largest city, and the deadly bombing of a TV tower in the capital.





He called the attack on the square “frank, undisguised terror” and a war crime.

Meanwhile, the Kremlin said a Russian delegation will be ready on Wednesday evening to resume peace talks with Ukrainian officials.

Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that “in the second half of the day, closer to evening, our delegation will be in place to await Ukrainian negotiators”.

He did not indicate where the talks could take place, while there was no immediate word from Ukrainian authorities about their plans.

The first round of talks on resolving the Russia-Ukraine war were held near the Belarus-Ukraine border last Sunday.

They produced no breakthrough, though the two sides agreed to meet again.

President Zelenskyy has accused Russia of trying to force him into concessions by continuing to press its invasion.

Mr Biden used his first State of the Union address to highlight the resolve of a reinvigorated Western alliance that has worked to re-arm the Ukrainian military and adopt tough sanctions, which he said have left Russian president Vladimir Putin ”isolated in the world more than he has ever been”.

“Throughout our history we’ve learned this lesson, when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos,” Mr Biden said.

“They keep moving. And the costs and threats to America and the world keep rising.”

As Mr Biden spoke, a 40-mile convoy of hundreds of Russian tanks and other vehicles advanced slowly on Kyiv, the capital city of nearly three million people, in what the West feared was a bid by Mr Putin to topple the government and install a Kremlin-friendly regime.

The invading forces also pressed their assault on other towns and cities, including the strategic ports of Odesa and Mariupol in the south.

As the seventh day of the war dawned Wednesday, Russia found itself increasingly isolated, beset by the sanctions that have thrown its economy into turmoil and left the country practically friendless, apart from a few nations like China, Belarus and North Korea.

Leading Russian bank Sberbank announced on Wednesday that it is pulling out of European markets amid the tightening Western sanctions.

As fighting raged, the humanitarian situation worsened.

Roughly 660,000 people have fled Ukraine, and countless others have taken shelter underground.

The death toll was less clear, with neither Russia nor Ukraine releasing the number of troops lost.

The UN human rights office said it has recorded 136 civilian deaths, though the actual toll is likely to be far higher.

One senior Western intelligence official estimated that 5,000 Russian soldiers had been captured or killed in the biggest ground war in Europe since the Second World War.

Many military experts say Russia may be shifting tactics. Moscow’s strategy in Chechnya and Syria was to use artillery and air bombardments to pulverize cities and crush fighters’ resolve.

The UK’s Defence Ministry said it had seen an increase in Russian air and artillery strikes on populated urban areas over the past two days.

It also said Kharkiv and Mariupol were encircled by Russian forces and that troops had reportedly moved into the centre of a third city, Kherson.

Russia’s defence ministry said it had seized Kherson, though the claim could not be confirmed.

Ukrainian authorities said five people were killed in the attack on the TV tower near central Kyiv.

A TV control room and power substation were hit, and at least some Ukrainian channels briefly stopped broadcasting, officials said.

Mr Zelensky’s office reported that the site of the Babi Yar Holocaust memorial, which is adjacent to the TV tower, was also hit.

A spokesman for the memorial said a Jewish cemetery at the site, where Nazi occupiers killed more than 33,000 Jews over two days in 1941, was damaged, but the extent would not be clear until daylight.

Mr Zelensky expressed outrage on Wednesday at the attack on Babi Yar and concern that other historically significant and religious sites, such as St Sophia’s Cathedral, could be targeted.

“This is beyond humanity. Such missile strike means that for many Russians our Kyiv is absolutely foreign,” Mr Zelensky said in a speech posted on Facebook.

“They have orders to erase our history, our country and all of us.”

Russia previously told people living near transmission facilities used by Ukraine’s intelligence agency to leave their homes.

But Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov claimed Wednesday that the airstrike on the TV tower did not hit any residential buildings.

He did not address the reported deaths or the damage to Babi Yar.

In Kharkiv, with a population of about 1.5 million, at least six people were killed when the region’s administrative building on Freedom Square was hit with what was believed to be a missile.

The Slovenian foreign ministry said its consulate in Kharkiv, located in another large building on the square, was destroyed.

The attack on the square, the nucleus of public life in the city, was seen by many Ukrainians as evidence that the Russian invasion was not just about hitting military targets but also about breaking their spirit.

Humanitarian needs are rising steeply in Ukraine, as essential supplies and services are disrupted and civilians flee.



The UN has launched an emergency appeal for US $1.7 billion to urgently deliver humanitarian support.

The bombardment blew out windows and walls of buildings that ring the square, which was piled high with debris and dust. Inside one building, chunks of plaster were scattered, and doors lay across hallways.

Another Russian airstrike hit a residential area in the city of Zhytomyr.

Ukraine’s emergency services said Tuesday’s strike killed at least two people, burned three homes and broke the windows in a nearby hospital.

About 85 miles west of Kyiv, Zhytomyr is the home of the elite 95th Air Assault Brigade, which may have been the intended target.

In the southern port city of Mariupol, the mayor said the attacks were relentless.

“They have been flattening us non-stop for 12 hours now,” Mariupol mayor Vadym Boychenko was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying.

“We cannot even take the wounded from the streets, from houses and apartments today, since the shelling does not stop.”

Mr Boychenko called Russia’s actions “genocide” – the same word that Mr Putin has used to justify the invasion.

Mr Zelensky has mocked Russia’s claim that it is going after only military targets, saying 16 children were killed on Monday.

“Where are the children? What kind of military factories do they work at?” Mr Zelensky said.

Human Rights Watch said it documented a cluster bomb attack outside a hospital in Ukraine’s east in recent days.

Residents also reported the use of such weapons in Kharkiv and Kiyanka village. The Kremlin denied using cluster bombs.

Cluster bombs shoot smaller “bomblets” over a large area, many of which fail to explode until long after they’ve been dropped. If their use is confirmed, that would represent a new level of brutality in the war.

The first talks between Russia and Ukraine since the invasion were held Monday, but ended with only an agreement to talk again. On Tuesday, Mr Zelensky said Russia should stop bombing first.

Instead, Moscow made new threats of escalation on Tuesday, days after raising the spectre of nuclear war.

A top Kremlin official warned that the West’s “economic war” against Russia could turn into a “real one”.

Inside Russia, a top radio station critical of the Kremlin was taken off the air after authorities threatened to shut it down over its coverage of the invasion.

Among other things, the Kremlin is not allowing the fighting to be referred to as an “invasion” or “war”.

Ukraine’s defence ministry said it had evidence that Belarus, a Russian ally, is preparing to send troops into Ukraine.

A ministry statement posted early Wednesday on Facebook said the Belarusian troops have been taken into combat readiness and were concentrated close to Ukraine’s northern border.

Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko has said his country has no plans to join the fight.

A senior US defence official said that Russia’s military progress, including the massive convoy, has slowed, plagued by logistical and supply problems.

Some Russian military columns have run out of petrol and food, the official said, and morale has suffered as a result.

Overall, the Russian military has been stalled by fierce resistance on the ground and a surprising inability to completely dominate Ukraine’s airspace.

The immense convoy, with vehicles packed together along narrow roads, would seemingly be “a big fat target” for Ukrainian forces, the senior Western intelligence official said.

But it also showed Russia was comfortable that they would not come attack by air, rocket or missile, the official said.",https://www.breakingnews.ie/world/russia-takes-aim-at-crowded-cities-as-kremlin-vows-to-continue-peace-talks-1267135.html

In the face of Ukraine’s dogged defence of urban areas, Russia’s strategy has shifted in recent days towards more devastating assaults on cities that have so far repelled ground incursions. The level of civilian casualties has soared.

The Pentagon said on Tuesday that 80 per cent of the Russian forces Moscow had amassed on Ukraine’s borders before last week’s invasion had now entered Ukraine.

Russian weapons inside Ukraine include launcher systems that could be used to fire “thermobaric” bombs, which draw in oxygen to create an especially intense explosion, US officials said.

“What’s coming down the road to Kyiv and other cities now is a wholly different order of magnitude of potential military force,” said General Sir Richard Barrons, former commander of the UK’s Strategic Command.

“That is something that will be in use I would imagine in the next 48 hours or so . . . We’re about to see a step change in violence potentially,” he told BBC Northern Ireland Radio on Tuesday.

The UK’s ministry of defence said on Wednesday morning that “heavy Russian artillery and air strikes have continued to target built-up areas over the past 24 hours”.

A missile strike hit a police headquarters in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second- largest city on Wednesday morning, where the regional governor said at least 21 people were killed and 112 wounded over the past 24 hours. That followed a strike on Kyiv’s main television tower on Tuesday evening, and the shelling of residential areas in the west and east of the capital overnight.

Russia also used missiles to strike targets in Zhytomyr, a town west of Kyiv that hosts an air base, in a sign that Moscow may turn its attention to the western third of the country, the route out for most refugees fleeing the conflict. Four people were killed in the strike that hit residential areas, Ukrainian officials said.

At the same time, the front of a Russian military convoy that stretched more than 60km on Tuesday had reached Kyiv’s outskirts, putting the city centre within the firing range of the BM-21 Grad rockets that Russia has used with devastating effect to hit residential areas in Kharkiv.

Russia has air superiority in Ukraine but not dominance. So the possibility of bombing the Russian convoy has intensified calls from Ukraine for Nato allies to enact a no-fly zone over the country.

Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, said that option remained off the table as it would effectively mark a declaration of war by Nato on Russia.

Moreover, it might not reduce Russia’s levels of urban bombardment. “The bombardment they are doing is from Russian artillery. So a no-fly zone would not affect that,” he told the BBC.

A senior US defence official said the Russian military continued to face problems prosecuting its campaign in Ukraine due to logistical problems that seemed to be slowing the progress of this advance on Kyiv.

The official said on Tuesday evening that the main Russian advance on the capital had made little progress over the past 24 hours, amid continued resistance from Ukrainian forces and signs of growing logistical constraints, including insufficient fuel supplies.

“It is not exactly moving with great speed. They continue to be bogged down, coming down from the north, to get to Kyiv,” the official said. “We are also picking up signs that they’re having problems feeding their troops, that they’re not only running out of gas but they are running out of food.”
