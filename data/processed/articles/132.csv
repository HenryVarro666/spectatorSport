As President Putin’s war against Ukrainian people continues, so does our resolve to support Ukraine and cripple the financing of Kremlin’s war machinery. This fourth package of sanctions is another major blow to the economic and logistic base upon which Russia relies on to carry out the invasion of Ukraine. The aim of the sanctions is that President Putin stops this inhuman and senseless war. Josep Borrell, High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy

The Council decided in particular to:

prohibit all transactions with certain state-owned enterprises ,

the provision of any , as well as access to any subscription services in relation to credit rating activities, to any Russian person or entity, expand the list of persons connected to Russia’s defence and industrial base, on whom tighter export restrictions are imposed regarding dual-use goods and goods and technology which might contribute to Russia’s technological enhancement of its defence and security sector,

connected to Russia’s defence and industrial base, and goods and technology which might contribute to Russia’s technological enhancement of its defence and security sector, prohibit new investments in the Russian energy sector , as well as a to introduce a comprehensive export restriction on equipment, technology and services for the energy industry,

Furthermore, the Council decided to sanction key oligarchs, lobbyist and propagandists pushing the Kremlin’s narrative on the situation in Ukraine as well as key companies in the aviation, military and dual use, shipbuilding and machine building sectors.

Statement in the WTO context

Separately, the Council gave a green light to the Commission to join, on behalf of the EU, a plurilateral statement on aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine with the support of Belarus, that is expected to be issued in the context of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Like other WTO Members that are to co-sponsor that statement, the EU confirms its readiness to take any actions that are considered necessary to protect our essential security interests. These may include actions in support of Ukraine, or actions to suspend concessions or other obligations with respect to the Russian Federation, such as the suspension of most-favoured-nation treatment to products and services of the Russian Federation. Furthermore, in light of Belarus’ material support to the actions of the Russian Federation, the EU considers that its WTO accession process is to be suspended.

Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified military aggression against Ukraine grossly violates international law and the principles of the UN Charter and undermines European and global security and stability. It is inflicting unspeakable suffering on the Ukrainian population. Russia, and its accomplice Belarus, bear full responsibility for this war of aggression and those responsible will be held to account for their crimes, including for indiscriminately targeting civilians and civilian objects.

The European Union demands that Russia ceases its military action and withdraws all forces and military equipment from the entire territory of Ukraine immediately and unconditionally, and fully respects Ukraine’s territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence within its internationally recognised borders.

The relevant legal acts, including the names of the listed individuals and entity, have been published in the Official Journal of the EU.",https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/03/15/russia-s-military-aggression-against-ukraine-fourth-eu-package-of-sectoral-and-individual-measures/

The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making “the most important decision of their life -- to fight.”

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.”

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the major developments on Russia's invasion, how Kyiv is fighting back, the plight of civilians, and Western reaction. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.

Zelenskiy noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.”

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

BACKGROUND AND OVERVIEW

In the last few weeks, the European Union has adopted measures to react to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. These new sanctions are in addition to the restrictive measures already imposed by the European Union on Russia since 2014, mainly in connection with the illegal annexation of Crimea.

The newly adopted measures are extremely broad in scope, varied in nature, and concern many different economic sectors. Some of the new measures expand the scope of previously existing restrictions, while others create brand new restrictions.

The table below provides an overview of the current status of the EU sanctions on Russia.

With the ongoing war, the scope of sanctions is regularly being expanded and additional measures are actively under consideration at the time of publication. Furthermore, the European Union adopted new sanctions against Belarus in connection with the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The EU sanctions on Russia (until and including the measures adopted on 15 March 2022) are analyzed in more detail below. Please note that the measures are subject to specific exceptions.

EXPANDED SANCTIONS

Targeted Personal Sanctions: Asset Freezes and Travel Bans

Asset freezes entail that all assets of the listed persons and entities are frozen. It is also prohibited to make any funds or assets directly or indirectly available to them. Travel bans prevent listed individuals from entering or transiting through the EU territory.

Legacy Measures

Since March 2014, the European Union has had asset freezes and travel bans in place on several hundreds of (mainly) Russian individuals and entities, typically because their actions have undermined Ukraine’s territorial integrity, sovereignty, and independence. The lists of sanctioned individuals and entities have been reviewed and amended several times. They also include individuals responsible for the misappropriation of Ukrainian state funds.

New Measures

Between 23 February and 15 March, as a reaction to the invasion into Ukraine, the European Union has added hundreds of additional persons and entities to the sanctions lists, reaching a total of 862 individuals and 53 entities. The new measures target, in particular:

President Putin and Sergey Lavrov, the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs, are only subject to asset freezes and not to travel bans, so that they will be allowed to travel to the European Union for negotiations;

All members of the Russian State Duma, who voted in favor of the decision of the Russian Federation to recognize Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts as independent entities and to send Russian troops, and 146 members of the Russian Federation Council who ratified the government decisions of the “Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance between the Russian Federation and the Donetsk People’s Republic and between the Russian Federation and the Luhansk People’s Republic”;

Individuals and entities who have been considered to play a role in undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty, and independence of Ukraine, including decision makers such as members of the government, banks, businesspersons, oligarchs financially or materially supporting Russian operations in the Donetsk and Luhansk territories, or benefitting from them (such as Bank Rossiya, Promsvyazbank, and VEB.RF), senior military officers, individuals responsible for leading a disinformation war against Ukraine, and Belarusian nationals; and

The members of the National Security Council of the Russian Federation.

Economic Sanctions

Legacy Measures

Since 2014, the European Union adopted measures limiting the access to its primary and secondary capital markets for certain Russian banks and companies.

In particular, it prohibited making certain loans and credit to listed entities, as well as transactions with certain financial instruments issues by listed entities.

New Measures

These sanctions have been broadened considerably now. The new, restrictive financial measures include enhanced restrictions on transactions and dealings with certain financial instruments issued by listed institutions, as well as the prohibition to:

Accept deposits exceeding certain values (exceeding €100 000) from Russian nationals or residents, in order to limit the financial inflows from Russia to the European Union;

For EU Central Securities Depositories to hold accounts of Russian clients, i.e., any Russian national or natural person residing in Russia or any legal person, entity, or body established in Russia;

Sell euro-denominated securities to Russian clients;

Sell, supply, transfer, or export euro denominated banknotes to Russia or to any natural or legal person, entity, or body in Russia, including the government and the Central Bank of Russia, or for use in Russia;

Provide public financing or financial assistance for trade with, or investment in, Russia;

List and provide services (as of 12 April 2022) on trading venues registered or recognized in the European Union for the transferable securities of any legal person, entity, or body established in Russia and with over 50 % public ownership;

Provide specialized financial messaging services, which are used to exchange financial data (SWIFT), to seven Russian banks;

Enter into transactions with the Central Bank of Russia;

Invest, participate, or otherwise contribute to projects co-financed by the Russian Direct Investment Fund;

Enter into transactions with certain state-owned enterprises across different sectors; and

Provide credit rating services to any Russian person or entity.

Restriction on the Energy Sector

Legacy Measures

The European Union had previously imposed restrictions on the export of certain equipment (notably, equipment suited for oil exploration and production) and on the provision of related technical assistance or other related services, as well as the provision of financing or financial assistance. It had also prohibited the provision of services necessary in Russia for oil exploration and production in certain cases.

New Measures

The new sanctions include a prohibition on the sale, supply, transfer, or export to Russia of specific goods and technologies for use in oil refining and to provide related services (such as technical assistance and brokering services).

The new measures also include a far-reaching prohibition on new investments in the Russian energy sector, with limited exceptions (relating in particular to civil nuclear energy and the transport of certain energy products back to the European Union). In particular, the new measures prohibit the acquisition or extension of participation in Russian companies active in the energy sector, to finance such companies, or to create joint ventures with them.

Trade Restrictions

Legacy Measures

The European Union had previously imposed an export and import ban on trade in arms with Russia, and an export ban on dual-use goods for military use or military end users in Russia.

New Measures

The new EU sanctions include additional restrictions on exports of dual-use goods and technology, as well as restrictions on exports of certain goods and technology, which might contribute to Russia’s technological enhancement of its defense and security sector (such as semiconductors).

The European Union most recently imposed an import ban on iron and steel products, and an export ban on listed luxury goods if their value exceeds €300 (including for example luxury cars and jewelry), with the aim of directly hitting Russian elites.

Restriction on Trade With Crimea and Sevastopol, and With Donetsk and Luhansk

Legacy Measures

In 2014, the Council of the European Union adopted restrictive measures in response to the “illegal annexation” of Crimea and Sevastopol by Russia. Those measures, the scope of which is limited to those territories, included an import ban on goods, restrictions on trade and investment related to certain economic sectors, a prohibition on supplying tourism services, as well as an export ban on certain goods and technologies.

New Measures

The European Union has now imposed essentially the same restrictions on trade with Donetsk and Luhansk, in response to the Russian decision to recognize the two areas as independent entities and to send Russian troops into those areas.

NEW SANCTIONS

Restrictions on the Transport Sector

The Council of the European Union imposed an export ban on listed goods and technology suited for use in aviation or the space industry (including aircraft and aircraft parts), as well as further restrictions to the export of maritime navigation goods and technology (with potential derogations for maritime safety, as well as exemptions for humanitarian and others purposes). The provision of services related to those goods and technology, as well financing and financial assistance related to those goods and technology, is now also prohibited.

In addition, EU member states are obliged to deny permission to land in, take off from, or overfly the territory of the European Union to:

Any aircraft operated by Russian air carriers (including as a marketing carrier in code-sharing or blocked-space arrangements);

Any Russian-registered aircraft; and

Any non-Russian-registered aircraft which is owned, chartered, or otherwise controlled by any Russian natural or legal entity.

Exceptions apply, e.g., for emergency flights or landing, or for humanitarian purposes.

Restrictions on Activities of Russian State-Owned Media Outlets

On 2 March 2022, the European Union suspended the broadcasting activities in the European Union of Sputnik and Russia Today until the end of the aggression against Ukraine, and until Russia and its associated outlets cease conducting what the European Union considers disinformation and information manipulation actions against the European Union and its member states.

Sputnik and Russia Today have been specifically targeted because they are under the control of the Russian authorities and are considered key propaganda instruments to promoting and supporting the military aggression against Ukraine and to destabilizing its neighboring countries.

The European Union has therefore imposed a prohibition on operators to broadcast, or to enable, facilitate, or otherwise contribute to broadcast, any content by those entities including through transmission or distribution by any means such as cable, satellite, IP-TV, internet service providers, internet video-sharing platforms or applications, whether new or pre-installed.

Russia Today has already challenged the ban before the Court of Justice of the European Union.

DIPLOMATIC MEASURES

In 2014, the EU-Russia summit and member states’ bilateral summits with Russia were cancelled and since then Russia was excluded from the G7 summits. The European Union has now suspended the visa regime that allowed privileged access to the European Union for certain categories of Russian citizens, namely the members of the official delegations, the members of the national and regional Governments and Parliaments, the members of the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court, citizens holding diplomatic passports, as well as business people and representatives of business organizations.

The new package, promoted by European leaders at their informal meeting on March 10-11 in Versailles (France) and approved this Monday by the ambassadors of the Twenty-Seven to the European institutions, includes trade and financial restrictions and adds more oligarchs to the community club's blacklist. This package, coordinated with the group of the most industrialized countries gathered at the G7, shows the EU's “determination” “to support Ukraine and stop funding for the Kremlin war machine,” said EU High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy Josep Borrell. “This is another big blow to the economic and logistical base on which Russia relies to carry out the invasion of Ukraine” and its goal is for Russian President Vladimir Putin to “stop this inhumane and senseless war,” Borrell added in a statement issued by the European Council, representing the EU countries. MOST PROMINENT MEASURES The new wave of sanctions, which is expected to enter into force today following its publication in the Official Journal of the EU, includes a total ban on any transaction with certain Russian state-owned companies in different sectors and which the European Commission called in another statement “the Kremlin military-industrial complex”. In addition, an EU import ban on steel products is added, amounting to approximately 3.3 billion in lost export earnings to Russia, according to Brussels calculations, which points out that higher import quotas will be distributed to other third countries to offset. The restrictions also include a “far-reaching” ban on new investments in the Russian energy sector, with limited exceptions for civil nuclear energy and the transport of certain energy products back to the EU. Another ban affects the export of luxury goods from the EU (cars, jewelry or other goods) in order to “directly hit the Russian elites”. In addition, the list of sanctioned individuals and entities has been further expanded to include more oligarchs and business elites linked to the Kremlin, as well as companies active in military and defense areas, which are logistically and materially supporting the invasion. There is also a new list of actors active and considered key to misinformation. And finally, there is a ban on the rating of Russia and Russian companies by EU credit rating agencies and the provision of rating services to Russian customers, which “would cause them to lose even more access to the EU financial markets,” emphasizes the EU Executive. RUSSIA, OUTSIDE THE STATUS OF MOST-FAVORED NATION Following last Friday's announcement by the G7, the EU, along with other members of the World Trade Organization (WTO), also agreed today to deny Russian products and services most-favoured-nation treatment on EU markets, which will deprive Moscow of “significant benefits”. These actions against Russia “protect the essential security interests of the EU and its partners” by Russia's “unprovoked, premeditated and unjustified” aggression against Ukraine, with the assistance of Belarus, and are “fully justified” under WTO legislation, Brussels noted. The Commission also received the green light from the Council to request, on behalf of the EU, the suspension of the process of Belarus's accession to the WTO. “Russia and its accomplice Belarus bear full responsibility for this war of aggression, and those responsible will be held accountable for their crimes, including the indiscriminate attack on civilians and civilian objects,” stressed the EU, which demanded that Moscow “cease its military action and withdraw all military forces and equipment from all over the territory of Ukraine immediately and unconditionally”.

Passage of new economic crime legislation

The Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Act 2022 (the Act) received Royal Assent during the early hours of 15 March, following its expedited passage through the legislative process.

In summary, the Act contains the following key measures:

provision for an expedited procedure under which the UK can impose asset freezing sanctions on designated persons already subject to sanctions in an allied jurisdiction;

the introduction of expanded sanctions enforcement powers for the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI);

introduction of a new Register of Overseas Entities in relation to the ownership of UK property; and

reforms to the unexplained wealth order process.

The press release announcing publication of the Act also noted that the Home Secretary Priti Patel would attend the inaugural ministerial Russian Elites Proxies and Oligarchs Task Force on 16 March, which brought together finance and justice and home affairs ministers from the G7, EU and Australia responsible for the supervision of sanctions and enforcement work. This Task Force “aims to ensure the effective implementation of financial sanctions on Russian elites and oligarchs to further drive collective efforts to tackle Kremlin-linked illicit finance”.

New designations

Following the passage of the Act, OFSI announced the addition of 350 Russia-related entries to the UK’s asset freeze list. The vast majority of these are individuals, designated under the Act’s new “urgent procedure” on the basis of their previous designation by the EU, US, Australia and/or Canada, including a number of Members of the Federation Council of the Russian Federation. The newly-designated entities are: Gas Industry Insurance Company SOGAZ, Geopolitica, Internet Research Agency, New Eastern Outlook, and Oriental Review, all of which have been designated by the EU and/or US.

OFSI also announced the designation of eight further individuals and one entity under the UK’s cyber sanctions regime, all of whom are already subject to US Russia/cyber-related sanctions.

A further round of designations was announced during the evening of 15 March. This comprised the designation of 12 further individuals, and two further entities under the UK’s Russia regime, in all cases based on existing EU designations.

New trade sanctions: export tariffs and export finance support

On 15 March, the UK announced it would deny Russia and Belarus access to Most Favoured Nation tariffs for hundreds of their exports, publishing an initial list of goods which will now face an additional 35% tariff. The affected products are: iron, steel, fertilisers, wood, tyres, railway containers, cement, copper, aluminium, silver, lead, iron ore, residue/food waste products, beverages, spirits and vinegar, glass and glassware, cereals, oil seeds, paper and paperboard, machinery, works of art, antiques, fur skins and artificial fur, ships, and white fish.

The press release reports that the tariff increases will be legislated for using powers under the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Act 2018, and will be operationalised in the relevant customs systems next week (w/c 21 March).

On the same day, the UK announced that it would no longer issue any new guarantees, loans and insurance for exports to Russia and Belarus.

The Department for International Trade has expanded its Export Support Service to act as a single point of contact for businesses with questions about trading with Russia or Ukraine.

New export restrictions announced (not yet in force)

On 15 March, the UK also announced further Russian trade sanctions which will take the form of a ban on the export to Russia of listed luxury goods. These measures are not yet in force, and the list of affected items has yet to be published, although the press release notes that the restrictions “will likely affect luxury vehicles, high-end fashion and works of art”. It is anticipated that they will broadly mirror the new EU luxury goods restrictions mentioned below.

The export restrictions are to come into force “shortly”.

FCA statement on Russian divestments

On 13 March, the FCA responded to Chancellor Rishi Sunak's call for firms to stop investing in Russia, noting that there are currently significant practical challenges in terms of disposing of Russian assets and reminding firms to comply with sanctions requirements when carrying out any such transactions.

EU

On 15 March, the Council of the EU announced the formal agreement of a fourth package of EU sanctions against Russia, comprising the following:

a prohibition on any transactions with certain Russian state-owned enterprises (SOEs);

a prohibition on the provision to Russian persons of credit rating services, as well as access to related subscription services;

an expansion of the list of Russian companies on whom specific export restrictions have been imposed regarding dual-use goods;

a ban on new investment in the Russian energy sector and expansion of the existing trade sanctions regarding equipment, technology and services relevant to the energy sector;

trade restrictions on iron and steel products, and luxury goods; and

further designations of additional oligarchs and business elites, as well as military/defence.

Further detail on the new restrictions is contained in the underlying legislation, which was published in the Official Journal on 15 March. We have provided a summary of the key measures below.

The Commission has also published a Q&A on the fourth sanctions package.

Restrictions on dealing with Russian SOEs (in force from 16 March)

The majority of the new restrictions outlined above are contained in Council Regulation (EU) 2022/428 (Regulation 2022/428), amending Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 (the 2014 Russia Regulation). Regulation 2022/428 introduces a new Article 5aa into the 2014 Russia Regulation which prohibits engaging directly or indirectly in any transaction with: (i) the SOEs listed in Annex XIX of the 2014 Russia Regulation, (ii) non-EU entities owned as to more than 50% by an entity falling within (i) above, or (iii) any legal person, entity or body acting on behalf of, or at the direction of, an entity falling within (i) or (ii) above.

The following exemptions apply to this prohibition:

the execution until 15 May 2022 of contracts concluded before 16 March;

transactions which are strictly necessary for the purchase, import or transport of fossil fuels, as well as titanium, aluminium, copper, nickel, palladium and iron ore from or through Russia into the EU; and

transactions related to energy projects outside Russia in which an entity listed in Annex XIX is a minority shareholder.

Annex XIX contains the following: OPK Oboronprom, United Aircraft Corporation, Uralvagonzavod, Rosneft, Transneft, Gazprom Neft, Almaz-Antey, Kamaz, Rostec, JSC PO Sevmash, Sovcomflot, and United Shipbuilding Corporation. Although these entities have not been added to the EU’s designated persons list (such that there is no requirement to freeze their assets), the new measures will likely substantially restrict EU companies’ ability to do business with these entities, in particular after 15 May 2022 when the ‘grandfathering’ of existing contracts ceases to apply.

Credit rating services (in force from 16 March but takes effect as of 15 April)

As of 15 April 2022, the following will be prohibited under Article 5j of the 2014 Russia Regulation:

the provision of credit rating services to any Russian national or natural person residing in Russia, or any entity established in Russia; and

the provision of access to any subscription services in relation to credit rating activities to the same Russian persons.

There is an exemption for nationals or temporary/permanent residents of an EU Member State.

For these purposes, “credit rating” means an opinion regarding the creditworthiness of an entity, a debt or financial obligation, debt security, preferred share or other financial instrument, or of an issuer of such an obligation, security or instrument, issued using an established and defined ranking system of rating categories. “Credit rating activities” mean data and information analysis, and the evaluation, approval, issuing and review of credit ratings.

Dual-use goods (in force from 16 March)

Annex I to Regulation 2022/428 adds a number of additional entities to Annex IV of the 2014 Russia Regulation, bringing them within scope of the existing dual-use goods restrictions. Member State competent authorities may only issue a licence for the supply of dual-use goods (or related technical financial assistance) to Annex IV entities after having determined that such supply is necessary for health and safety grounds, or is due under a contract concluded before 26 February 2022 (provided the licence is sought before 1 May 2022).

Energy sector restrictions (in force from 16 March)

Companies operating in the energy sector will likely be familiar with the “Annex II” restrictions introduced by the 2014 Russia Regulation (these required prior authorisation for the supply to Russia of certain listed oil and gas equipment, with authorisation requests to be denied in respect of certain exploration and production projects). Regulation 2022/428 replaces those restrictions with a prohibition on the supply to Russia of Annex II items, along with related technical assistance, brokering services, financing or financial assistance.

This prohibition is subject to the following exemptions:

supply of goods (or related technical or financial assistance) necessary for: the transport of fossil fuels from or through Russia into the EU; or the urgent prevention or mitigation of an event likely to have a serious and significant impact on human health and safety or the environment;

the execution until 17 September 2022 of an obligation arising from a pre-16 March contract (subject to a requirement to make a prior notification to the relevant Member State competent authority); and

the provision of insurance or reinsurance to any EU entity with regard to its activities outside the energy sector in Russia.

Member State competent authorities may also license the supply of Annex II equipment or relevant technical/financial assistance if: (i) it is necessary for ensuring critical energy supply within the EU; or (ii) it is intended for the exclusive use of entities owned, or solely or jointly controlled by an EU-incorporated entity.

Regulation 2022/428 also prohibits the following:

acquisition of any new, or extension of any existing, participation in any entity incorporated under the law or Russia or any third country and operating in the energy sector in Russia;

granting or being part of any arrangement to grant any new loan or credit, or otherwise providing financing (including equity capital) to any entity incorporated under the law or Russia or any third country and operating in the energy sector in Russia, or for the documented purpose of financing such a person;

creating any new joint venture with any entity incorporated under the law of Russia or any third country and operating in the energy sector in Russia; and

providing investment services in relation to the above activities.

Member States may license such activities if: (i) they are necessary for ensuring critical energy supply within the EU; or (ii) they exclusively concern entities owned by an EU-incorporated entity.

Other trade sanctions (in force from 16 March)

Regulation 2022/428 introduces a new Annex XVII to the 2014 Russia Regulation, listing various iron and steel products. It is now prohibited to:

import Annex XVII products into the EU if they originate in or have been exported from Russia;

purchase Annex XVII products which are located in or originate in Russia;

transport Annex XVII products if they originate in Russia or are being exported from Russia to any other country; and

provide technical assistance, brokering services, financial or financial assistance (including financial derivatives as well as insurance and reinsurance) relating to the above prohibitions.

These restrictions are subject to an exemption in respect of the execution of pre-existing contracts until 17 June 2022.

Regulation 2022/428 also inserts into the 2014 Russia Regulation a new Annex XVIII listing various luxury goods. It is prohibited to sell, supply, transfer or export Annex XVIII goods to any natural or legal person, entity or body in Russia or for use in Russia, insofar as their value exceeds €300 per item (unless otherwise specified in Annex XVIII). This is subject to an exemption in respect of goods which are necessary for the official purposes of diplomatic or consular missions of Member States or partner countries, international organisations, or the personal effects of their staff.

Additional designations (in force from 15 March)

The EU has added a further 15 individuals and nine entities to its Russia-related asset freeze list. The full list of names can be found in Council Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/427.
