7:56pm: Russians in Germany take to streets to protest anti-Russian discrimination

Around 800 people descended on the German city of Frankfurt on Sunday amid a sea of Russian flags to protest against the “hatred and harassment” they say they have suffered since the start of the war in Ukraine.

Germany is home to 1.2 million people of Russian origin and 325,000 from Ukraine. Authorities fear the conflict could be imported into Germany and the protests used to promote Moscow’s war narrative.

Police have so far recorded 383 anti-Russian offences and 181 anti-Ukrainian offences since the Kremlin’s invasion started on February 24.

3:46pm: More than 1,200 bodies found in Kyiv region, prosecutor says

Ukraine’s prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova on Sunday told Britain’s Sky News that “we have actually now, only for this morning, 1,222 dead people only in Kyiv region”.

She did not specify whether the number referred only to civilians, or whether it included killed Ukrainian fighters too. A week ago, Venediktova said 410 civilians had been found dead in areas near Kyiv which had been occupied by Russian troops.

3:40pm: 2,200 Ukrainian men detained for trying to leave the country

Ukraine’s border guard agency says that about 2,200 Ukrainian men of fighting age have been detained so far while trying to leave the country in violation of martial law.

The agency said Sunday that some of them have used forged documents and others tried to bribe border guards to get out of the country. It said some have been found dead while trying to cross the Carpathian mountains in adverse weather, without specifying the number.

Under martial law, Ukrainian men between 18 and 60 are barred from leaving the country so that they can be called up to fight.

2:49pm: Russian rockets destroy Dnipro airport

Russian forces fired rockets into Ukraine’s Luhansk and Dnipro regions on Sunday, Ukrainian officials said, completely destroying an airport and potentially leaving casualties.

“The airport itself was destroyed, as well as nearby infrastructure. And the rockets fly and fly,” Valentyn Reznichenko, governor of the central Dnipropetrovsk region, said.

Serhiy Gaidai, governor of Luhansk, an eastern region bordering Russia, wrote earlier on Telegram that a school and a high-rise apartment building had been hit in the city of Sievierodonetsk. “Fortunately, no casualties,” Gaidai said.

He had heard a rocket land near his home around 1 in the morning but thought little of it. There had been plenty of rockets since Russian forces invaded in late February. The thuds, crumps and blasts had become a cruel but familiar soundtrack to those who stayed behind, along with the acidic smell the weapons left in the air.

But what landed in his yard was a new weapon for the town’s residents to add to their growing lexicon of destruction: They knew the Smerch, the Grad, the Hurricane — and now they were introduced to the PTM-1S land mine, a type of scatterable munition.

“Nobody understood what it was,” said Sergiy, declining to provide his surname out of fear of retribution. The weapons roar in like any rocket, but instead of exploding instantly, they eject up to two dozen mines that explode at intervals, parceling out death in the hours afterward.

Since the start of the invasion, Russia has made clear that it is willing to mete out violence and destruction to achieve its aims, often indiscriminately. It has launched cruise missiles, sent in tanks and fired mortars, artillery and rockets. Now it has also turned to something less ominous in appearance but just as brutal.

These scatterable mines, banned under some interpretations of international law and never officially recorded during this war, have appeared only sparingly in Bezruky and elsewhere in the periphery of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. The weapons add yet another element of peril for civilians trying to navigate parts of the ruined landscape.

The mines are green tubes about the size of a liter of soda, packed with 3 pounds of explosives. They are often used to disable tanks but had, in Sergiy’s case, landed where his 8-year-old daughter likes to play when the weather is pleasant.

“These weapons combine the worst possible attributes of cluster munitions and land mines,” said Brian Castner, a senior arms researcher for Amnesty International. “Any one of these indiscriminate attacks is unlawful, and they’re happening on top of each other.”

Scatterable land mines can include those meant to kill people and those designed to destroy tanks. The United States last used them during Operation Desert Storm in 1991, and they have since largely been banned by a 1997 international treaty signed by 164 nations, including Ukraine, that targeted anti-personnel mines.

Some anti-vehicle mines — like the PTM-1S that landed in Sergiy’s yard — have sensitive fuses that can cause them to explode when people pick them up and can be considered anti-personnel mines. They are thus banned under international law, though neither Russia nor the United States has joined the relevant treaty.

Sunday morning began like any other in Bezruky since the Russian invasion began: another day without power for the several thousand residents, and the sporadic shelling between Ukrainian and Russian forces that had become commonplace.

It was mostly quiet, but around 10 a.m., Sergiy’s backyard shed exploded. There was no sound of an incoming artillery shell or rocket — just the blast.

Sergiy, who had lived in Bezruky for much of his life, went out to inspect the damage. Debris had scattered all over his workbench, the side of the shed was damaged, and a rectangular crater several inches deep had appeared.

He went out to board up the windows of his house, fearing there might be another explosion, when he spotted a green tube, another PTM-1S mine, next to the fence in his neighbor’s backyard. He quickly snapped a picture and went back inside.

It exploded 20 minutes later, he said.

“The bursts continued throughout the day with intervals around 50 minutes, and the last one was around 3 o’clock the next night after it first landed,” Sergiy said. There is no Ukrainian military equipment in Bezruky. The Russian front lines are roughly 10 kilometers to the north, and to the south are Ukrainian artillery positions.

The mines were set to self-destruct at specific times, a feature baked into each mine, which can be set at two-hour intervals for up to 24 hours. Nobody was killed or injured in the series of blasts that rocked his neighborhood.

“It was lucky that kids didn’t play there that day,” Sergiy said. “Normally, they would play in the backyard at the time of the first pieces detonating, but it was rainy that day.”

Bomb disposal technicians in Kharkiv, who respond to calls for unexploded munitions across the city and its periphery, said this was the first recorded appearance of the PTM-1S since the war’s beginning.

As Russia shifts its focus to the country’s east after its stinging defeats around the country’s capital, Russian forces have increased their shelling around Kharkiv and elsewhere in the region, often resorting to indiscriminate attacks to tie up resources.

Intentionally targeting civilians with weapons of any kind is prohibited under the Geneva Conventions, and Russia’s use of these scatterable mines would likely constitute an indiscriminate attack, given that the artillery rockets carrying these mines, which can travel up to 20 miles (32 kilometers), were fired at a civilian area devoid of military targets.

“This weapon appeared,” said the team leader of an explosives removal unit working in Kharkiv and the towns nearby. He provided only his first name, Maksym, for security reasons. There are at least six other teams like his deployed throughout the region.

The randomly exploding mines are just a new feature of Maksym’s grueling job. His team of a half-dozen men have been working nonstop in the Kharkiv region since Russia invaded. It will likely take years, and possibly decades, to clear all of the ordnance launched into Ukraine during the war.

The 26-year-old team leader records five to 30 incidents a day, fields reports of rockets landing in homes on his phone and is often asked by passersby to come look at explosive debris.

On Tuesday, Maksym’s rounds included digging out a 122-millimeter rocket casing from in front of a supermarket and removing debris from an apartment building and an amusement park.

Toward the end of the day, as he worked in a farmer’s field to extract the remains of a Smerch rocket, a man on a bicycle rode up and waved him down.

“Can you go pull out the same thing from my place?” the man shouted.

does the administration think that Russia might have intentionally targeted the transition knowing that there will be a lot of civilians there? Well, what we've seen over the course of the last six weeks or more than that, um, has been, um, what the president himself has characterized as war crimes, which is the intentional targeting of civilians. This is yet another horrific atrocity committed by Russia striking civilians who are trying to evacuate and reach safety where we are now is we're going to support efforts to investigate the attack as we document Russia's actions, hold them accountable and we will continue to surge of security assistance and weapons deliveries to help Ukraine defend their country. Obviously, the targeting of civilians would certainly be a war crime. And we've already called a range of the actions we've seen to date a war crime, but we're going to be supporting efforts to investigate exactly what happened here. Mm hmm. Yeah. And

A missile hit a train station in eastern Ukraine where thousands had gathered Friday, killing at least 52 and wounding dozens more in an attack on a crowd of mostly women and children trying to flee a new, looming Russian offensive, Ukrainian authorities said.The attack that some denounced as yet another war crime in the 6-week-old conflict came as workers unearthed bodies from a mass grave in Bucha, a town near Ukraine's capital where dozens of killings have been documented after a Russian pullout. Photos from the station in Kramatorsk showed the dead covered with tarps, and the remnants of a rocket with the words “For the children” painted on it in Russian. About 4,000 civilians had been in and around the station, heeding calls to leave before fighting intensifies in the Donbas region, the office of Ukraine’s prosecutor-general said.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who says he expects a tough global response, and other leaders accused Russia’s military of deliberately attacking the station. Russia, in turn, blamed Ukraine, saying it doesn't use the kind of missile that hit the station — a contention experts dismissed.Zelenskyy told Ukrainians in his nightly video address Friday that great efforts would be taken “to establish every minute of who did what, who gave what orders, where the missile came from, who transported it, who gave the command and how this strike was agreed to.""Pavlo Kyrylenko, the regional governor of Donetsk, in the Donbas, said 52 people were killed, including five children, and many dozens more were wounded.“There are many people in a serious condition, without arms or legs,” Kramatorsk Mayor Oleksandr Goncharenko said. Even with 30 to 40 surgeons working, the local hospital was struggling, he said.British Defense Minister Ben Wallace denounced the attack as a war crime, and U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called it “completely unacceptable.”“There are almost no words for it,” European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, in Ukraine, told reporters. “The cynical behavior (by Russia) has almost no benchmark anymore.”Ukrainian authorities and Western officials have repeatedly accused Russian forces of atrocities in the war that began with the Feb. 24 invasion. More than 4 million Ukrainians have fled the country, and millions more have been displaced. Some of the most startling evidence of atrocities has been found in towns around Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, from which Russian President Vladimir Putin's troops pulled back in recent days.In Bucha, Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk has said investigators found at least three sites of mass shootings of civilians and were still finding bodies in yards, parks and city squares — 90% of whom were shot.Russia has falsely claimed that the scenes in Bucha were staged. On Friday, workers pulled corpses from a mass grave near a town church under spitting rain, lining up black body bags in rows in the mud. About 67 people were buried in the grave, according to a statement from Prosecutor-General Iryna Venediktova's office.“Like the massacres in Bucha, like many other Russian war crimes, the missile attack on Kramatorsk should be one of the charges at the tribunal that must be held,” Zelenskyy said, his voice rising in anger late Friday.He expounded on that theme in an excerpted interview with CBS' “60 Minutes” that aired Friday, citing communications intercepted by the Ukrainian security service.“There are (Russian) soldiers talking with their parents about what they stole and who they abducted. There are recordings of (Russian) prisoners of war who admitted to killing people,” he said. “There are pilots in prison who had maps with civilian targets to bomb. There are also investigations being conducted based on the remains of the dead.”Zelenskyy's comments echo reporting from Der Spiegel saying Germany's foreign intelligence agency had intercepted Russian military radio traffic in which soldiers may have discussed civilian killings in Bucha. The weekly also reported that the recordings indicated the Russian mercenary Wagner Group was involved in atrocities there.German government officials would not confirm or deny the report, but two former German ministers filed a war crimes complaint Thursday. Russia has denied that its military was involved in war crimes.Video: Mariupol residents endure relentless shellingAfter failing to take Kyiv in the face of stiff resistance, Russian forces have now set their sights on the Donbas, the mostly Russian-speaking, industrial region where Moscow-backed rebels have been fighting Ukrainian forces for eight years and control some areas.A senior U.S. defense official said Friday that the Pentagon believes some of the retreating units were so badly damaged they are “for all intents and purposes eradicated.” The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal military assessments.The official did not say how many units sustained such extensive damage, but said the U.S. believes Russia has lost between 15% and 20% of its combat power overall since the war began. While some combat units are withdrawing to be resupplied in Russia, Moscow has added thousands of troops around Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, he said.The train station hit is in Ukrainian government-controlled territory in the Donbas, but Russia's Defense Ministry accused Ukraine of carrying out the attack. So did the region's Moscow-backed separatists, who work closely with Russian regular troops.Western experts refuted Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov's assertion that Russian forces “do not use” that type of missile, saying Russia has used it during the war. One analyst added that only Russia would have reason to target railway infrastructure in the Donbas.“The Ukrainian military is desperately trying to reinforce units in the area … and the railway stations in that area in Ukrainian-held territory are critical for movement of equipment and people,” said Justin Bronk, a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London.Bronk pointed to other occasions when Russian authorities have tried to deflect blame by claiming their forces no longer use an older weapon “to kind of muddy the waters and try and create doubt.” He also suggested that Russia specifically chose the missile type because Ukraine also has it.A Western official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence, also said Russia’s forces have used the missile — and that given the strike's location and impact, it was ""likely” Russia's.Video: Ukrainian town of Borodyanka in ruins after battleUkrainian officials have almost daily pleaded with Western powers to send more arms, and to further punish Russia with sanctions and exclusion of Russian banks from the global financial system.NATO nations agreed Thursday to increase their supply of weapons, and Slovakian Prime Minister Eduard Heger announced on a trip to Ukraine on Friday that his country has donated its Soviet-era S-300 air defense system to Ukraine. Zelenskyy had appealed for S-300s to help the country “close the skies” to Russian warplanes and missiles.American and Slovak officials said the U.S. will then deploy a Patriot missile system to Slovakia.After meeting with Zelenskyy on Friday, during which he urged the EU to impose a full embargo on Russian oil and gas, von der Leyen provided him with a questionnaire that is a first step for applying for EU membership.Video: Ukrainian refugee celebrates birthday amid warElsewhere, in anticipation of intensified attacks by Russian forces, hundreds of Ukrainians fled villages that were either under fire or occupied in the southern regions of Mykolaiv and Kherson.In the northeast's Kharkiv, Lidiya Mezhiritska stood in the wreckage of her home after overnight missile strikes turned it to rubble.“The ‘Russian world,’ as they say,” she said, wryly invoking Putin’s nationalist justification for invading Ukraine. “People, children, old people, women are dying.

The 33-year-old Nigerian postgraduate student at the Dnipro Medical Institute in Ukraine had wrapped up her studies and gone to bed just hours earlier.

The calls were from relatives in Nigeria, worried about her safety because Russia had invaded Ukraine.

""If I didn't wake up to use the restroom, I wouldn't have seen these because I would have probably woken up around 7 a.m. or 7:30 a.m.,"" Bamidele told DW.

News sites were reporting explosions in Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, and in Kharkiv. Explosions had also been heard in Dnipro, which lies between the two cities.

Dnipro is a six-hour drive from Ukraine's capital Kyiv whose outskirts came under heavy attack

Discrimination on trains

Bamidele initially wanted to stay put in her home of the past six years.

""I was like: I am going to remain here since this city is still calm and there is nothing going on. So, definitely, maybe, we would just be safe till the end of it,"" she said.

But her parents in Nigeria ordered her to leave Ukraine.

On February 28, Bamidele set off for the train station. She told DW that she wanted to see if it was true that foreigners were not being allowed on outbound trains. Media reports about stranded African, Indian and Arab students were going viral.

""I just wanted to see what was going on because I was hearing on the news that they were not allowing foreigners to enter the trains,"" she said.

""When I got there, there were a lot of people. I met some people who said they had been there for 12 hours and they were not allowed to enter the train.""

She said that she saw a person of color smash a train window and a fight break out.

The scramble for any bus

The next day, Bamidele returned to the train station and found some of the foreigners she had seen the previous day still waiting. There were only two trains per day bound for Lviv, not far from the Polish border.

Russian missiles had damaged the train station and Ukrainian soldiers had been ordered to prevent entry and exit to Dnipro as of March 3

Bamidele realized that she had to leave immediately. A day before the city was shut down, she scoured the bus stations for a way out and met a woman who could get her on to a private bus.

Hours later, Bamidele, five other Dnipro Medical Institute students from Nigeria and 44 others boarded a 50-seater bus bound for the border.

Hypothermia and exhaustion

The six Nigerian students did not want to travel to the Romanian border but that was where the bus was heading.

""So, when we got to a city that was close to Romania after 24 hours, it was a very hectic journey for us because we needed to stop at every checkpoint and there were a lot of checkpoints,"" said Bamidele.

The soldiers, she said, checked everyone to ensure there was no ""intruder"" on the bus.

The students decided to stay in the Ukrainian city of Chernivtsi until they could figure out which country they would try to reach.

Soldiers in Ukraine on the lookout for ""intruders"" at checkpoints

They had to figure out a plan while suffering from hypothermia, said Bamidele. They had also heard about the discrimination and ill treatment being meted out to Africans at Poland's border.

Hotels and apartments in Chernivtsi were fully booked but the group of students eventually found two very small rooms they could rent.

""That city was cold and the apartment was cold as well. There was nothing we could do. So we were there the first day to see what was going to happen. Maybe there would be another border that would be opening, and we would be going there,"" said Bamidele.

A smoother journey to Hungary

By the third day, the cold rooms in Chernivtsi had become unbearable. At the bus station, they bought tickets to Uzhhorod, near Ukraine's border with Hungary.

The 12-hour trip to Uzhhorod was smoother than the ride to Chernivtsi and there were fewer military checkpoints.

They arrived in Uzhhorod at about 4 a.m. on March 6 and caught a taxi to the city of Chop, where they waited to transfer to a train bound for the Hungarian border. Too tired to wait five more hours for a free train, the students bought tickets for a train departing immediately for Budapest, Hungary's capital.

Young Africans flee to Hungary because people of colour are better welcomed there.

On the platforms at the main train station in Budapest, many volunteers were on hand to help those fleeing Ukraine. Bamidele said they distributed toiletries and other basic supplies. Some even opened their homes to those who had nowhere to go.

In Dnipro, Bamidele used to volunteer for Diaspora Relief. In Budapest, a volunteer from the nonprofit organization welcomed the six students and took them to a hostel.

Bamidele's uncle in Nigeria was not pleased that she was staying in a hostel where men and women were sharing bedrooms and bathrooms. On March 8, she moved to a private one-bedroom apartment he had booked online.

Bamidele volunteered to cook for the students and to help others still trying to reach Hungary.

""I started cooking because I knew that a lot of people hadn't eaten good food. We had been eating junk. And I knew that while they are in the hostel, they cannot even cook. So, finding myself in a comfortable place, I was like: Let me just cook for other people that don't have this opportunity,” she said.

Soon Bamidele was cooking for over 300 students. The meals are sponsored by Diaspora Relief.

Rejection upon rejection

Bamidele is doing more for African students than cooking because they are going through a rough time in Hungary. Accommodation is hard to find. Apartments need to be booked for four to five nights and check-in is always 4 p.m., while checkout is 10 a.m. The students need somewhere to stay warm in the times in between.

Bamidele is helping people to search for apartments where new arrivals can stay temporarily.

""After booking on Airbnb, we have to go and check to see if they want us as people coming from Ukraine because it is very hard to get hosts that are going to take people coming from Ukraine,” she said.

DW asked several of the African students who had made their way to Hungary about their experience. Many said that the owners of Airbnb apartments in Hungary were now refusing to rent to them.

""They are not specific but I think it is Africans,"" Bamidele suggested.

African students in Hungary also told DW that Ukrainians who had fled to Hungary were more likely to find private accommodation or stay in refugee camps.

Racism in a refugee camp

A Ghanaian management student who declined to be named said he had left the refugee camp he was placed in after fleeing Sumy in northeastern Ukraine because of discrimination. He told DW that a Ukrainian man had complained to camp officials that sleeping beside a black man was traumatizing. The student was then moved to another space within the camp.

""So, hearing that, a lot of people don't want to stay in a refugee camp. So we just look for Airbnb and some of the NGOs like Diaspora Relief have been paying for food and accommodation,"" he said.

Though many African students in Hungary are without stable accommodation, some are still trying to attend the online lectures offered by their universities in Ukraine, while others are taking up the language classes offered by the government of Hungary.

Olufunmilola Bamidele told DW she would stay in Budapest for now. But she is planning to travel to Ireland, which she has heard is open to Africans who left Ukraine.
