Warsaw, Poland

12:57 P.M. CEST



PRESIDENT DUDA: (As interpreted.) Your Excellency and distinguished Madam Vice President of the United States of America, distinguished ladies and gentlemen: This is a very important moment in our relations. But, first and foremost, under these circumstances which we are facing right now in Europe, behind our Eastern border, in Ukraine — friendly to us and with us — where the Russian troops are carrying out a barbarious aggression and murdering innocent people, murdering civilians, bombing maternity hospitals from which, under dramatic circumstances, wounded women right before labor — are being carried out.



None of us has ever expected that we would be able to see such things in the 21st century.



Especially it is a great satisfaction to all of us here in Poland that Madam Vice President of the United States of America, Ms. Kamala Harris, is here with us in Warsaw, in our country.



And she’s demonstrating that strength and depth of the atlantic — transatlantic and Allied bond, demonstrating decisive engagement and commitment of the United States to the security of NATO’s eastern flank and to Europe as a whole.



Let me stress very forcefully: There is no doubt whatsoever that together with the United States and our other Allies within the framework of the North Atlantic Alliance, and along with the entire free and honest world, we stand with Ukraine. We stand with Ukraine, and we will try to do our best to make sure that Ukraine can be defended.



Thank you very much, Madam Vice President, for coming. Thank you for our meetings today, for the conversations that we have had.



We had a meeting just a couple of minutes ago. We had a private meeting, a tête-à-tête meeting. And we also met with Polish and American delegations. We discussed all the important topics. And I highlighted very forcefully how important it is, and I thanked also for the position of the President of the United States, Mr. Joe Biden. I thanked for the position of Madam Vice President and her team. But I also thanked for the position of the U.S. Congress.



I thanked for this necessity and, actually, the imposition of effective sanctions on the Russian Federation. The United States is in the vanguard of those sanctions, and, speaking honestly, these sanctions are working.



Above all, thank you also for all the support which is being provided to the fight in Ukraine — to Ukraine, which is defending itself.



Thank you for the humanitarian assistance, which is being supplied there.



And to you, Madam Vice President, I would like to thank for the involvement of all the organizations and of all the NGOs that are being involved in providing assistance — humanitarian assistance. Also, they’re providing medical aid. They’re providing equipment for children, for wounded, for the sick.



My wife Agata is involved in this as well. And I know that, in those respect, she is in cooperation with various institutions from the United States. She is in contact with the First Lady of the United States, Jill Biden.



I’m very happy that this Polish-American cooperation is developing. But I’m pleased that it serves to provide common aid to the fight in Ukraine and common aid to all those who are suffering, all those who need this assistance from us.



And today, I shared with Madam Vice President — I described the situation that we are facing. I said that, today, for a number of days actually, we have been receiving refugees from Ukraine in Poland. This number is close to 1.5 million persons who have come to us. And I’m addressing my compatriots right now. I was proud to tell Madam Vice President that all those people have not been sent to any camps and refugee camps. They have been accepted and received by Polish families in Polish homes. They are accommodated in Polish hotels, in Polish spa resorts, in Polish motels.



Most often, however, they’re accommodated with private people. They have been received by ordinary Polish people who feel in their hearts that they should extend a helping hand to the people in need.



And I thank you so much for this, to my fellow Polish people. This is a reason to be proud for us, for the Polish authorities. And I’m very, very much grateful to you for that.



At the same time, I asked Madam Vice President for support, as it is quite obvious that such a huge refugee crisis is a surprise for Poland. And it is a complicated situation for Poland, for the Polish authorities in the era of the crisis. The prices are growing — of fuel prices are growing; generally, the prices are growing. That is why we do need this support. And I’m going to be hugely grateful for any form of support because we have to survive this difficult time.



And we have to do that by helping our neighbors, because that is extremely important right now.



However, first and foremost, we discussed security issues.



The presence of Madam Vice President here in Poland is yet another demonstration of U.S. presidents — of U.S. presence in Poland, next to the U.S. troops that we have here, next to U.S. defensive systems that are protecting our skies today and our land.



We also have with us here today the political representation, the top-level political representation of the United States, led by Madam Vice President.



And this is a very clear political message where important — most important things are happening today on the global stage in Europe: We have to rescue Ukraine. All of us are acutely aware of that. All hands should be on board. Ukraine needs to be helped. And we have to stay united in that respect. We need to stand together in this respect within the North Atlantic Alliance, keeping solidarity, speaking absolutely with one voice, just as we have to stand together in the European Union and in all the other international communities. We have to impose more sanctions on Russia.



We cannot accept such military activities, which bear the characteristics of the features of a genocide, because I don’t think that anybody is in any doubt if hospitals are bombed, if hospitals are bombed where pregnant women are staying, where children are staying, when ordinary people are killed, where bombs are dropped, when missiles are launched into residential houses where there are no military installations, then this is an act of barbarity bearing the features of a genocide. It aims at eliminating and destroying a nation. Hence, we have to stand and present a very tough stance here as representatives of the free world.



And Poland stands here together with the United States of America, just like — I have no doubt about that — our Allies stand with Ukraine and all the honest authorities and states, especially democratic states.



And at the end of our conversation, I mentioned the fact that we want to boost our security also on our own here in Poland. Also, thanks to the purchase of American equipment for our armed forces, there are already ongoing programs such as Patriot programs, such as HIMARS program, the program of the purchase of F-35s, or the recently started program — the purchase of Abrams tanks for Poland.



I asked Madam Vice President that those programs should be accelerated as far as this as possible, because we want to provide this state-of-the-art equipment to our armed forces as soon as possible.



If there is such a need — I think everybody can see that. We do not need to comment on this situation. We are able to witness the dramatic scenes unfolding in Ukraine every day in the media. You can see those horrific — horrifying scenes.



But at the same time, we’re able to witness the huge heroism and incredible determination of the Ukrainian people. And we stand at the side of the Ukrainian people. We’re going to support them with all our strength, but at the same time providing the security of our countries which is of crucial importance to us.



Once again, thank you very much, Madam Vice President, for coming to Warsaw. Thank you for this demonstration that we stand together and that we are a huge Euro-Atlantic community of freedom and security. Thank you.



I’d like to give the floor to Madam Vice President of the United States of America. Madam Kamala Harris.



VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Thank you, President Duda, and for the warm welcome under unfortunate circumstances, given what is happening in Ukraine, our friend. But I thank you for the warm welcome and for the very constructive and productive conversations we had today as part of our ongoing dialogue and friendship that spans generations.



I would like to also speak directly to the Polish people. I have shared with your president that, under his leadership — and your leadership has been extraordinary — the world has been watching Poland, Mr. President, your leadership and the leadership of the people of your country. And we’ve witnessed extraordinary acts of generosity and kindness. We have seen through images on the television — looking at images of ordinary people doing extraordinary things in support of the dignity and the wellbeing of perfect strangers.



So I, first and foremost, want to express the thanks for the people of the United States to you, Mr. President, on behalf of our President, Joe Biden, and to the people of Poland for what you are doing every day. It really represents the best of who we are.



We are here and I am here in Poland today as part of an enduring, longstanding friendship and commitment between the United States and Poland based on shared values and priorities.



I am here, standing here on the northern flank — on the eastern flank talking about what we have in terms of the eastern flank and our NATO Allies and what is at stake at this very moment. What is at stake this very moment are some of the guiding principles around the NATO Alliance and, in particular, the issue and the importance of defending sovereignty and territorial integrity, in this case, of Ukraine.



As President Duda has described, we have been witnessing for weeks — and certainly just in the last 24 hours — atrocities of unimaginable proportion. A maternity hospital, a children’s hospital, where we have witnessed pregnant women who were there for care, for one reason — being taken out, because they required care because of an act of violence — unprovoked, unjustified.



I am here, in Poland, as an expression of the enduring and important relationship between the United States and Poland that, again, has been longstanding, but, in particular on the issue of Ukraine, is unified and is clear. We will do everything together, in partnership, in solidarity, to support what is necessary at this very moment in terms of the humanitarian and security needs of Ukraine and the Ukrainian people.



Today, we discussed, Mr. President, many issues that relate to our special bond also, because, I will say as a point of personal privilege, we have a substantial Polish American community in my hometown of Los Angeles but throughout the United States, who understands the relationship that we have on many levels, including the diplomatic but also cultural relationships that span generations.



And so, through all of that and in the spirit of those relationships and our shared commitments — our shared commitment to the importance of international norms and rules — you and I discussed today many important topics, in particular as it relates to the eastern flank. And we talked specifically about what we cared deeply about in terms of our commitment — the United States commitment to Article 5.



I’ve said it many times; I will say it again: The United States commitment to Article 5 is ironclad. The United States is prepared to defend every inch of NATO territory. The United States takes seriously that an attack against one is an attack against all. We are here today to restate that commitment, but also do what we must do to reinforce our support of Poland and our Allies through the EU and NATO Alliance.



In particular, as it relates to troop deployment, we have recently deployed an additional 4,700 American troops to Poland. That’s on top of the years of rotation of about 5,000 American troops in Poland.



We are pleased to have announced this week that we have directed two Patriot missile defense systems to Poland. And today, I can announce that we have delivered those Patriot systems to Poland. We do this as a reminder and as a demonstration of our commitment to the security of our Allies and our commitment, in particular, to Poland at this moment in time.



As it relates to the people of Ukraine: They have suffered immensely. When we talk about humanitarian aid, it is because, yes, the assistance is necessary, but what compels us also is the moral outrage that all civilized nations feel when we look at what is happening to innocent men, women, children, grandmothers, grandfathers who are fleeing everything they’ve known. Our outrage, which compels not only our security assistance but our humanitarian assistance, is rooted in the fact that also we support the people of Ukraine who have shown extraordinary courage and skill and their willingness and, yes, ability to fight against Putin’s war and Russia’s aggression.



So, today we are also announcing, in pursuit of what must happen, which is to provide humanitarian assistance, that we will give another $50 million– the United States will — through the U.N.’s World Food Programme to assist with humanitarian aid.



The President and I also talked about the fact that, as he mentioned, Poland has taken, in just a very short period of time, in excess of one and a half million refugees in from Ukraine. And that has put an extraordinary burden on Poland and the people of Poland. And so, we will continue with the support that we can give you, Mr. President, in terms of the work that you and the people of Poland have been doing to bear this burden, but in a way that really has been with such grace

and such generosity.



We also are pleased to have shared with the President what our United States Congress has done, which is there is a commitment now of $13.6 billion in human- — humanitarian and security assistance that will be then distributed and shared with Ukraine and the people of this region and Europe, all again understanding that this moment in time requires both a humanitarian response as well as security assistance.



And today, I’m also pleased to say that we are in ongoing discussions with Poland and our Allies about the effectiveness of sanctions thus far and going forward. As we have announced in the United States, we have, through the United States Department of Justice, started a task force to do what is required and necessary and appropriate in terms of investigations as it relates to any criminal activities and behaviors on behalf of institutions and individuals, including oligarchs.



We talked — the President and I — about the effectiveness of the sanctions we’ve seen thus far, in terms of the courage and the bold action that has been taken through the NATO Alliance to do what is necessary to send a clear signal that there will be, as we promised, severe cost and consequence for Russia’s aggression to the point that we have now seen a freefall of the ruble, to the point that we have now seen that Russia’s credit rating has been rated as junk, and what we know to be real economic consequence to Russia because of Putin’s war.



As you know, the President of the United States also made the decision to do what was necessary in terms of the purchase of Russian oil in the United States.



Again, we will continue to focus on this issue, keeping in mind that this is a moment that requires severe and swift consequence for Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.



And I’ll close by saying what we say every day for these last weeks, which is we stand with the people of Ukraine, that we admire their courage, and that we are aligned in our support of their sovereignty and territorial integrity.



Thank you, Mr. President.



Q (As interpreted.) My name is Żaklina Skowrońska. I represent Polish Television. I would like to ask my question to both Madam Vice President and Mr. President. In what way has this brutal attack of Russia against Ukraine impacted Polish-American relations? Antony Blinken, State Secretary, during his last visit to Poland was saying that the Polish-American friendship has never been so strong in history as it is now. Is it going to translate also on the permanent military presence of the United States in Poland? Thank you very much.



VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: It cannot be said too frequently or strongly enough: The relationship between the United States and Poland is a deep, enduring, and strong one and, dare I say, has become even stronger when we have been faced as a world with such adversity. I think we all know, even in our personal lives, adversity really, truly, can present the real measure of an individual or a relationship. And what we have seen without any doubt is that this friendship and relationship between the United States and Poland is a strong one.



PRESIDENT DUDA: (As interpreted.) Ladies and gentlemen, answering your question, I want to go a little bit back into history — or deeper into history. Let me put it in the following way: When I started my service as President of the Republic of Poland in 2015, I was perfectly aware of the fact that an aggressive Russia, like President Lech Kaczyński was saying in Georgia in 2008, would not stop only attacking Georgia in 2008 and attacking part of Ukraine in 2014. I knew that this appetite, this imperial appetite will grow.



And if the world does not react to that — if the world does not react, if the North Atlantic Alliance does not stand up, does not present a tough stance, then we will see more attacks from Russia — to which perhaps, sooner or later, also my country, Poland, would fall victim to.



And when I started as President of Poland, I knew that I had to do everything that I could to protect Poland from such a scenario. One has to use very clear and strong words here in the presence of Madam Vice President of the United States. Those who understood well what I was saying back then, speaking about the Russian threat, were precisely the representatives of the United States, were the representatives of Barack Obama administration and the President himself back then, the U.S. generals as well.



And precisely thanks to their support, we were able to obtain the North Atlantic Alliance presence on the eastern flank, were able to execute the strengthening of the eastern flank for the first time since we joined NATO in 1999.



It was precisely in NATO Summit in Warsaw, through, first and foremost, the decisions of the U.S. President and his team, but also through the decisions of other Allies whom we were able to convince, has led to putting this presence on the eastern flank of the Alliance and, symbolically, in Poland.



The United States is the framework nation. At the same time, the U.S. soldiers came here and started the rotational presence in Poland. It is a rotational but also a persistent presence, enduring presence. It is a back-to-back presence. Soldiers change, but the U.S. armed forces are present on our soil all the time. And that was a breakthrough.



If we recall the words of President Lech Kaczyński, which I quoted many times and who said those words to me back in 2008, he said, and I quote: “Andrzej, when U.S. soldiers are on our soil, when U.S. military installations are on our soil, when U.S. military equipment is put in our soil, then the whole world will be able to see that we are no longer a Russian sphere of influence.” This is a true friendship.



As Madam Vice President remarked today, “A friend in need is a friend indeed.” That is why I’m really happy that today, when we are in need and when the NATO eastern flank is in need, the United States, by the decision of President Joe Biden, has deployed additional troops. The U.S. is deploying more troops, and the U.S. is announcing the strengthening of this presence in our part of Europe and also in Poland, because this is precisely the understanding of the geopolitics of strategic goals that have to be achieved by this geopolitics and by the free world. This is the understanding of the security.



Is Polish American presence today, if we look at the last couple of years, stronger than ever? Yes, Polish-American friendship, for sure, over the last seven years of my presidency is stronger than ever before.



And today’s presence here today in Warsaw of Madam Vice President Kamala Harris is yet another strong evidence of that, just as the presence of all the representatives of Mr. President Joe Biden’s administration here recently on our soil.



And also, this is evidenced by the frequency of contacts that I have with the President of the United States. We frequently talk and discuss the most important security-related topics and our mutual relations.



Yes, of course, whenever we speak about great politics and friendship, this is this friendship and great politics. And this is the friendship between states for sure. This is the friendship between Poland and the United States of America. It is very strong right now — the strongest perhaps ever in history.



WHITE HOUSE AIDE: The next question will come from Nandita Bose of Reuters.



Q Hi, Madam Vice President. Thank you for — and President Duda. Thank you for taking my question.



President Zelenskyy has strongly asked for better air power in recent days. And my question is: What kind of alternative plans does the United States have to get materials to help Ukraine defend itself, especially now that you have declined Poland’s offer on jets? Can you give us some specifics on what you discussed with the Polish leaders on this issue, Madam Vice President?



And one for President Duda. The United States says, Mr. President, it was not consulted before you made the offer to make your jets available to the United States. Is that accurate? And did Poland act unilaterally in making an offer? If yes, why? Especially now that you have spoken about the strong relationship that U.S. and Poland has shared over the years. Thank you.



VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: I want to be very clear: The United States and Poland are united in what we have done and are prepared to do to help Ukraine and the people of Ukraine, full stop.



In terms of the work that the United States has done thus far, we have, as you know, given military, humanitarian, and security assistance, and that is an ongoing process.



As I mentioned earlier, Congress — the United States Congress has now made a decision for 13-plus billion dollars of United States — of U.S. money to go to Ukraine and our European allies to assist in terms of both their security and humanitarian needs.



We have also, just this past week, given $240 million in security assistance delivered to Ukraine, and that’s on top of the $1 billion in just the past year that we have sent to Ukraine.



I can tell you that the issue facing the Ukrainian people and our Allies in the eastern flank is something that occupies one of our highest priorities in terms of paying attention to the needs, understanding it is a dynamic situation and it requires us to be nimble and to be swift.



I mentioned being swift in terms of accountability and consequence. We also fully appreciate we must be swift in terms of providing assistance where we can be helpful. And we will continue to do that.



Q Can you (inaudible) plans, especially in light of the issue with Poland on jets?



VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Well, we’re making deliveries every day, in terms of what we can do in terms of assistance and, in particular, when you look at what we’ve been doing, as it relates to anti-tank and anti — defense systems. That is an ongoing process, and that’s not going to stop to the extent that there is a need.



Thank you.



POLISH AIDE: (No translation provided.)



PRESIDENT DUDA: (As interpreted.) One moment. I need to give an answer as well.



Madam, that situation is extremely complicated, because we are all saying that there is a fight going on in Ukraine for independence, for sovereignty, for freedom, and for survival. And all of us support, with all the strength we have, the people of Ukraine.



It is not only the military. Also, the people of Ukraine have taken to arms to defend their homeland. It is not only men; it’s also women who fight on the frontline shoulder-to-shoulder with men in order to defend their country. And we have no doubt whatsoever that they need help and assistance.



Let me say something more. We accept that they have the right to demand this assistance from the international community. They can demand this support from NATO. We are providing them humanitarian assistance and material assistance the best we can. We are trying to do our best.



Some expectations were addressed in a very strong and unequivocal way, also towards us — towards Poland. However, we are members of the North Atlantic Alliance. And as far as security-related issues are concerned, we have to look at these not only through our own lens — through the prism of the security of Poland — but we also have to adopt the perspective of the security of NATO as a whole.



So, in a nutshell, we have to be a responsible member of the North Atlantic Alliance. That is why there were requests addressed to us. Those requests were addressed to us by the Ukrainian side and also, to a certain extent, by the media.



We behaved in such a way as a reliable member of NATO should behave — a member of NATO who does not want to expose NATO to any difficult situation. On the other hand, we, as members of NATO, also wanted and want to look for ways of support for the fight in Ukraine. And that is why we formulated statements, together with the Polish government — so myself as president, together with the Polish government.



And this statement or this declaration was announced by the Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs. It talked about the Polish possibilities — military possibilities of assisting Ukraine. Simply, we decided to put those jets at the disposal of NATO, not expecting anything in return, because we stressed very clearly that, as a gap filler for the donated equipment, we were able to buy something that we would need as a replacement. And we, ourselves, we’re ready to provide our equipment free of charge.



But we wanted NATO as a whole to make a common decision so that Poland remains a credible member of NATO, not a country who decides on its own on important issues which impact the security of NATO as a whole — which would impact the security of all members of NATO — also our neighbors who are part of NATO — members of NATO.



Thank you.



Another question?



POLISH AIDE: Maja Wójcikowska, TVN24.



Q Madam Vice President, each day we can see death and unimaginable suffering of the Ukraine people caused by decisions made by Vladimir Putin. My question is: Will the U.S. support an international investigation into war crimes committed by Russia in Ukraine? And can you see any political future for Putin?



(As interpreted.) This is also the question to the Polish President.



VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Okay, I’ll go.



PRESIDENT DUDA: (Points to himself.)



VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: You go this time, please. (Laughs.)



Q (Inaudible) I will start with Madam Vice President.



VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: (Laughs.) Okay.



PRESIDENT DUDA: (Points to Vice President Harris.)



Q Thank you. I appreciate that. (Laughter.)



VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Not at all. I — we are very clear: The NATO Alliance is stronger and Russia is weaker because of what Putin has done. That is very clear to us.



And when it comes to crimes and violations of international norms and rules, we are also very clear that any intentional attack on innocent civilians is a violation. The U.N. has set up a process by which there will be a review and investigations, and we will of course participate as appropriate and necessary.



But we all watched the television coverage of just yesterday. That’s on top of everything else that we know and don’t know yet, based on what we’ve just been able to see. And because we’ve seen it or not doesn’t mean it hasn’t happened.



But just limited to what we have seen: Pregnant women going for healthcare being injured by — I don’t know — a missile, a bomb in an unprovoked, unjustified war, where a powerful country is trying to take over another country — violate its sovereignty, its territorial integrity, for the sake of what? Nothing that is justified or provoked. Absolutely there should be an investigation, and we should all be watching. And I have no question the eyes of the world are on this war and what Russia has done in terms of this aggression and these atrocities. I have no doubt.



PRESIDENT DUDA: (As interpreted.) It is obvious to us that in Ukraine, Russians are committing war crimes. I hope that also in the future it will be obvious for a court investigating those issues who bears responsibility for that.



Now, please remember that the refugees from Ukraine are coming to us right now. And right now, as we speak, there are people crossing our border who witnessed their houses destroyed, who saw their neighbors being killed, who saw hospitals being bombed, who saw civilians being shot at, children being shot at. These are proofs. These are the reports of witnesses, and they also have those proofs on their smartphones. If you look at those footages, it just makes your blood curl. Such scenes are happening today, and they have been happening over the last days in Ukraine, and their perpetrators are Russians.



A group of prosecutors has come to us delegated by the court to look at the facts of this case. They are collecting evidence. We, as Poland, try as much as we can to give them best — the best possible conditions for work and then to fulfill this very difficult task.



Let us remember, the witnesses are here. There is a lot of evidence — the footages as I mentioned. We have those proofs and the evidence. All of that is being collected. The work is ongoing. And I do believe that it is going to result in very serious indictment acts.



And I do believe that the war crimes — criminals will be sentenced — those responsible for the war that is happening in Ukraine right now as a result of this (inaudible) Russian assault.



WHITE HOUSE AIDE: And the final question will be from Asma Khalid of NPR.



Q Thank you. Thank you, Madam Vice President. I wanted to ask you about some reporting that my colleague here in Poland noticed. He recently spoke with the mayor of the largest border town, who told him that the refugee system is essentially not set up for this, that it will collapse. It’s an improvised system that can work for maybe two weeks, but not indefinitely. And I’m wondering what the United States is going to do more specifically to set up a permanent infrastructure. And relatedly, is the United States willing to make a specific allocation for Ukrainian refugees?



And for President Duda, I wanted to know if you think and if you asked the United States to specifically accept more refugees.



VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Okay. (Laughs.) A friend in need is a friend indeed. (Laughter.)



PRESIDENT DUDA: Okay. I’ll go first. Okay, so this time — (as interpreted) — Madam, the situation is very complex. This is what I was saying today and I discussed this at length with Madam Vice President Kamala Harris. I said, in a very blunt way, that today we are seeing a refugee crisis. It is unfolding because Poland is still able to receive — it is all the time able to find the accommodation for those people who are coming to us all the time.



But we have got almost 1,500,000 people who have come to us over the last couple of days. So it’s been 10 days. We have received more than 1 million people within 10 days. Never before have we witnessed such a situation. So this is something totally new to us, and we are grappling with this huge challenge. Our entire society is facing up to this challenge. I have already expressed my gratitude to the Polish people for their wonderful position in this very difficult situation — that they are so openhearted.



But we are aware that the problem is growing and that this problem is increasing. We have to somehow handle it, and we do not have the experience. Therefore, yesterday, I had a long conversation with Mr. António Guterres, Secretary General of the United Nations organization. And I flagged out that problem to him. I described to him the situation — how it looks, how it develops. I described to him the reaction of the Polish society, of the Polish authorities, how we have been handling with this problem. But I told him that unless we receive international assistance, then, given further influx of refugees to Poland on this scale, this will end up in a refugee disaster. And I asked for help — both the material assistance, financial assistance — so that we are able to solve this in Poland.



I also asked for expertise, for the know-how, because the U.N. has got experts who have seen a multitude crisis of this dimension, and I’m sure that they have worked out methods of how to handle it. And I’m sure they know how to solve the problems, which ensue due to such a crisis situation.



And this is something that I described in detail also today to Madam Vice President. I said that the assistance of the United States in this respect is invaluable to us, and we would be very much grateful if we could use this assistance as soon as possible.



Furthermore, we discussed the refugees from Ukraine who have got relatives and families in the United States, and who would be willing — at least for the time when the war is still waging, they would like to visit those families, to stay with their families in the United States, and to wait there until the war is over and then come back to their homes.



I asked to speed up and simplify the procedures for such people — the consular procedures to be simplified for those people who would like to leave for the United States, to give the opportunity to these people to see their families as soon as possible, to be reunited with their families, to help them to survive this time.



So we are acting, and we are looking for international support because, indeed, the vast majority of Ukrainian refugees are coming to our country. Frankly speaking, that is because, first of all, we are a big country. And also, the material status of an ordinary citizen of Poland is for sure much better than the material status, the living conditions of an ordinary Ukrainian citizen, although we are not among those wealthy countries of Western Europe, but our living standards have increased over the last couple of years in Poland.



But they are coming because I believe that also the — it is their belief that thanks to the presence of NATO armed forces, thanks to the presence of our Allies from NATO — from Canada, from the UK, from Romania, and from other countries whose soldiers are deployed in Poland — they believe that Poland, due to that presence, is a safe country, a country which is not going to be attacked, a country where you can safely wait out this difficult situation.



VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: As the President said, we did discuss this issue. And I started by thanking the President in Poland and the people of Poland for what they have done. And I will restate what I said earlier this afternoon: They’ve shown extraordinary generosity and kindness and courage. And they have — there have been some here who have relatives who have arrived from Ukraine, but I think there are many more who are taking in perfect strangers with barely a lot to give but giving a lot nonetheless.



So, we recognize that, and we recognize the burden that it places on the government of Poland, on the president, and the infrastructure of this country; when you look at — as the President said, over one and a half million people coming within two weeks, virtually. Unprecedented if you track and look at refugee flows over the history of time from regions of conflict.



So the United States is absolutely prepared to do what we can and what we must to support Poland in terms of the burden that they have taken on that I think all of us who understand the moral obligation we should feel to help people who are fleeing harm and seeking refuge; the burden we should all be prepared to take on to support those people who are fleeing their home when they don’t want to leave.



In terms of what we are doing in the United States, we will then take this in terms of what we can do to support and look at those Ukrainians who want to come to the United States. What we’re seeing thus far is large parts of that population who are fleeing Ukraine, who desire to stay in Europe.



You probably know that we have made a decision as it relates to TPS — the Temporary Protected Status. So for Ukrainians that are in the United States whose visa may expire or has expired: If they were in the United States before — I believe it’s March; I don’t have the exact date — they will be able to stay; they won’t be required to leave, even though their visa has expired because, of course, we would not send them back to what is a warzone.



And the bottom line is that I have stated the position to the President this afternoon. As we have said many times through our work collectively in the U.N., through NATO, we will support Poland in terms of the burden it is facing and our collective responsibility to ensure the safety and wellbeing of these refugees.



POLISH AIDE: (As interpreted.) This concludes our press conference. Thank you very much for your participation, ladies and gentlemen.



VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Thank you.

10pm: Norwegian state oil company Equinor has stopped trading Russian oil as it winds down operations there in the wake of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, chief executive Anders Opedal said on Thursday.

A growing energy crisis from buyers steering clear of Russian oil will accelerate Europe's shift towards renewable power, while requiring more investment in oil and gas production, Opedal said in an interview at the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston.

9.45pm: Boris Johnson has again ruled out imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine, despite Russia’s strike on a maternity hospital in the besieged city of Mariupol.

“What’s happened in Mariupol in that maternity hospital really shows that Putin is prepared just to reject, to abandon, all norms of civilised behaviour,” he said.

“The difficulty is that there is a line beyond which, quite frankly, the UK and Nato would be deemed to be in conflict – direct conflict – with Russia.

8.10pm: The war in Ukraine and massive sanctions against Russia have triggered a contraction in global trade and sent food and energy prices sharply higher, and will force the International Monetary Fund to lower its global growth forecast next month, IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said on Thursday.

""There is also no question that inflation may be higher for the next few months than it would have been without ... president Putin and Russia's further invasion into Ukraine, particularly due to higher energy prices,"" she said.

6.15pm: Portugal said on Thursday it would not strip the citizenship of Chelsea soccer club owner Roman Abramovich for now because that measure was not part of EU sanctions against Russian oligarchs, but his nationality status could change depending on the outcome of an inquiry.

5.45pm: Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy will address Israel's parliament about the Russian invasion of his country and has asked to deliver remarks by video to its main Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem, officials said on Thursday.

The plans suggested efforts by Kyiv to win over Israel, after its government has taken a cautious public posture as it tries to mediate peace and coordinates with Russia on Syria.

5.30pm: British prime minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday he feared Russia would deploy chemical weapons in Ukraine.

""The stuff that you're hearing about chemical weapons, this is straight out of their playbook,"" Johnson said in an interview with Sky News.

""They start saying that there are chemical weapons that have been stored by their opponents or by the Americans, and so when they themselves deploy chemical weapons, as I fear they may, they have a sort of ... fake story, ready to go.""

5.20pm: Alphabet Inc's YouTube and Google Play store are suspending all payment-based services in Russia, including subscriptions, as Western sanctions start to pose banking challenges in the country.

5pm: Russia's defence ministry on Thursday denied having bombed a maternity and children's hospital in Ukraine's Mariupol the previous day, accusing Ukraine of a ""staged provocation"" there.

The ministry said that Russia carried out no air strikes on ground targets in that area on Wednesday, respecting an agreed ""silent regime"".

Foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said earlier that Ukrainian forces had taken over the hospital, while the Kremlin said their was a need to establish clear facts.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy who has accused Russia of carrying out genocide, said on Thursday three people including a child were killed in Wednesday's air strike on the hospital.

4.15pm: It is important that Ukraine has applied for membership of the European Union, but there is no fast-track procedure for accession, Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte said on Thursday.

Ukraine applied for fast EU membership shortly after the Russian invasion two weeks ago.

4pm: Russia blocked Ukrainian civilians from evacuating territory under its control in the eastern Ukrainian town of Izyum on Thursday, regional governor Oleh Synegubov said.

Ukrainian authorities were able to help around 1,600 people flee the part of Izyum held by Ukraine, he said in televised comments.

3.45pm: Germans have offered up 300,000 private homes to house refugees from Ukraine following Russia's invasion of the country, Germany's interior ministry said on Thursday.

The ministry is cooperating with the non-profit gut.org and home rental company Airbnb Inc's non-profit arm Airbnb.org to assign refugees to housing offers.

3.25pm: Russian president Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Russia would ultimately emerge stronger and more independent after overcoming the difficulties caused by what he called the West's illegitimate sanctions.

Putin said there had been no alternative to what Russia calls its special military operation in Ukraine and that Russia was not a country which could accept compromising its sovereignty for some sort of short-term economic gain.

""These sanctions would have been imposed in any case,"" Putin told a meeting of the Russian government. ""There are some questions, problems and difficulties but in the past we have overcome them, and we will overcome them.""

3.10pm: Goldman Sachs Group Inc said on Thursday it was closing its operations in Russia, becoming the first major Wall Street bank to exit the country following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.

""Goldman Sachs is winding down its business in Russia in compliance with regulatory and licensing requirements,"" the bank said in an emailed statement.

In its annual filing earlier, the bank had disclosed a credit exposure to Russia of $650 million (€589 million).

2.55pm: Global food prices will rise further if western nations intensify economic pressure on Russia, a major global fertilizer producer, president Vladimir Putin said.

2.40pm: Russia is adhering to its obligations on energy supplies, president Vladimir Putin told a government meeting, after the United States banned Russian oil imports.

2.25pm: Russia's energy ministry said on Thursday that Belarusian specialists had restored electricity supply to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine.

Chernobyl lost power amid fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces, after Russia invaded Ukraine

1.56pm: Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has said he does not believe the conflict in Ukraine would spiral into a nuclear war but cautioned the United States and Europe that Moscow never again wanted to be dependent on the West.

Russia's economy is facing the gravest crisis since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union after the West slapped heavy sanctions on almost the entire Russian financial and corporate system following Moscow's February 24th invasion of Ukraine.

Asked by a Kremlin correspondent for Russia's Kommersant newspaper if he thought a nuclear war could be triggered, Mr Lavrov told reporters in Turkey: ""I don't want to believe it, and I do not believe it.""

Despite Mr Lavrov's comments, British foreign minister Liz Truss told CNN that Britain is very concerned about the potential use of chemical weapons by Russia in Ukraine.

""We are very concerned about the potential use of chemical weapons,"" Ms Truss said.

""We have seen Russia use these weapons before in fields of conflict, but that would be a grave mistake on the part of Russia, adding to the grave mistakes already being made by Putin.""

1.15pm: EU leaders will offer to strengthen the bloc's bonds with Ukraine and deepen its partnership as the European Commission assesses if Kyiv is ready to become a candidate for full EU membership, a draft EU declaration showed.

Leaders of the 27-nation bloc are meeting in Versailles to discuss Ukraine's bid to become a member as the Russian war against the country enters its third week despite massive western sanctions against Moscow.

""Following the December 2016 decision by the EU Heads of State or Government, the European Council acknowledged the European aspirations and the European choice of Ukraine, as stated in the Association Agreement,"" said the draft declaration, which might still change.

""On 28 February 2022, the president of Ukraine submitted the application of Ukraine to become a member of the European Union. The Council has invited the Commission to submit its opinion on this application. Pending this and without delay, we will further strengthen our bonds and deepen our partnership,"" it said.

The leaders also say in the draft that they will make sure that sanctions against Russia over its invasion will be implemented and that they are ready to add more measures if needed and would keep pressure on both Russia and Belarus.

12.55pm: Poland's president Andrzej Duda has said Russian bombardments of hospitals and housing estates, and the resulting loss of civilian lives, were barbaric and resembled genocide.

Speaking the day after a Russian attack on a maternity hospital in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, Mr Duda told a news conference: ""There are pregnant women, there are children, if you kill ordinary people you throw bombs, rockets, at housing estates, this is barbarism bearing the features of genocide.""

12.12pm: The Russian government has banned exports of telecom, medical, auto, agricultural, electrical and tech equipment, among other items, until the end of 2022, in retaliation for Western sanctions on Moscow.

In total, over 200 items were included on the export suspension list, which also covered railway cars, containers, turbines and other goods.

Carmaker Stellantis, which produces and sells the Peugeot, Citroёn, Opel, Jeep, Fiat brands in Russia, was looking to start exporting locally-made light commercial vehicles to Western Europe before Russia invaded Ukraine.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has confirmed that three people including a child were killed in Wednesday's air strike on a maternity and children's hospital in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol.

In a televised address, he said Russia's assertion that the hospital had no patients was not true. ""Like always, they lie confidently,"" he said.

11.46am: Russian president Vladimir Putin, French president Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Olaf Scholz discussed the situation in Ukraine in a phone call, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying on Thursday.

It was not clear when the call took place.

11.17am: Russia is deliberately preventing the evacuation of civilians from Mariupol because it has failed to seize the strategic Black Sea port city, Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych has claimed.

Ukraine said earlier that an aid convoy to the city had to turn back because of fighting. Russia has denied targeting civilians in what it calls a ""special operation"" in Ukraine.

Belarusian president Aleksandr Lukashenko meanwhile is to meet his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Friday, according to the state-run Belarusian news agency which said the pair will discuss bilateral relations, economic cooperation under sanctions, and the situation in the region and Ukraine.

10.54am: Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has said Russian president Vladimir Putin would not refuse a meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy to discuss ""specific"" issues.

Mr Lavrov gave the comments at a news conference after talks with his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba in Turkey.

His comments came as a humanitarian convoy trying to reach the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol had to turn back because of fighting, Ukraine's deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said, as the city council reported more Russian shelling, which they said were hitting houses.

10.18am: Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said no progress was made on achieving a ceasefire in talks on Thursday with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov, the first high-level talks between the two countries since Moscow invaded its neighbour.

Speaking after the talks in southern Turkey, Mr Kuleba told a news conference that the most difficult situation was in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, and that Mr Lavrov did not commit to a humanitarian corridor there.

US vice president Kamala Harris will meanwhile discuss issues with Poland that will force Russia to pay a price for its invasion of Ukraine, she said on Thursday during a visit to Warsaw, adding that Poland was doing ""extraordinary work"" with the refugees who have fled Ukraine.

9.41am: Russia has switched tactics to targeting civilians after its military advance on Ukraine slowed, an adviser to Ukraine’s presidential office said on Thursday.

Ukraine has accused Russia of genocide after officials said Russia bombed a children’s hospital in the port city of Mariupol on Wednesday, a charge Moscow dismissed as ""fake news"". Russia has also denied targeting civilians.

Adviser Oleksiy Arestovych also said Ukraine had enough troops to withstand Russian efforts to capture the capital Kyiv.

In the UK, Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovic has been sanctioned for his links to Russian president Vladimir Putin as the British government pressures Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.

According to figures from the UN migration agency (IOM), more than 2.3 million people have fled Ukraine as of March 10th.

9.25am: Imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine would help bring the conflict there to a faster conclusion and save lives, the Polish ambassador to Kyiv said on Thursday, as Russia continued a relentless bombardment of several cities.

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has been pleading for Nato to impose a no-fly zone, but the alliance is wary of any step that might draw it into direct conflict with Russia.

Elsewhere, Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko has told his defence ministry that the Belarus army must prevent any attack on Russian forces from the rear, the state news agency BelTa said.

Russia used its ally Belarus as one of the launchpads for its invasion of Ukraine. Lukashenko was quoted as telling defence chiefs that they must prevent any attempt - presumably by Ukrainian forces - to cut off Russian supply lines and ""strike at Russians from the rear"".

8.53am: Britain is looking at easing its visa requirements for Ukrainian refugees, a minister said on Thursday, after the British government faced widespread condemnation for prioritising bureaucracy over the welfare of those fleeing war.

While households across Europe have taken in Ukrainian families forced to leave their homes, Britain has demanded they secure a visa first, meaning the country has accepted far fewer Ukrainians than the likes of France and Germany, or Ukraine's nearest neighbours.

Armed forces minister James Heappey said he believed the interior ministry, or British home office, was looking at ways to ease the system, after some refugees in the French port city of Calais were ordered to go to Paris or Brussels to fill out forms.

8.30am: Ukraine is opening seven ""humanitarian corridors"" on Thursday for civilians to leave cities besieged by Russian forces, including the southern port of Mariupol, deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said.

The Ukrainian government is also planning to create a food reserve big enough to feed the country's people and armed forces during the Russian invasion, prime minister Denys Shmygal said late on Wednesday, according to the government press service.

Ukraine is a major global food producer and exporter, but agriculture analysts have said the invasion by Russia could sharply reduce the area sown for 2022's grain harvest, creating shortages for the rest of the world as well as Ukraine.

This comes as Russia's defence ministry spokesperson Igor Konshenkov said Russian troops have destroyed 2,911 Ukrainian military infrastructure facilities so far, adding that the Russian army had taken control of a number of neighbourhoods in besieged southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol. Reuters was not immediately able to verify his statement.

7.42am: More than 10,000 people were evacuated from villages and cities around Kyiv on Wednesday, Kyiv regional governor Oleksiy Kuleba said on local television on Thursday.

Elsewhere, civilians started leaving the Ukrainian city of Sumy through a ""humanitarian corridor"" on Thursday following an agreement on a local ceasefire, the regional governor said.

Several thousand people have left the besieged city this week under agreements with Russia. People were also leaving the nearby settlements of Krasnopillya and Trostyanets, governor Dmytro Zhyvytskyy said. ""The (evacuation) columns are leaving. The ceasefire has been agreed!"" he added.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba has arrived in Turkey for talks with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, Ukrainian has television reported.

7.29am: The UK's defence ministry has said the large Russian column northwest of Kyiv has made little progress in over a week and is suffering continued losses.

As casualties mount, Russian president Putin will be forced to draw from across Russian armed forces and other sources to replace the losses, the UK ministry said in a statement.

There has also been a notable decrease in overall Russian air activity over Ukraine in recent days, it said.

6.57am: Russia said on Thursday a Ukrainian claim that it bombed a children's hospital in Mariupol was ""fake news"" because the building was a former maternity hospital that had long been taken over by troops.

""That’s how fake news is born,"" Dmitry Polyanskiy, Russia's first deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, said on Twitter.

Mr Polyanskiy said Russia had warned on March 7th that the hospital had been turned into a military object from which Ukrainians were firing.

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy accused Russia of carrying out genocide after Ukrainian officials said Russian aircraft bombed the children's hospital on Wednesday.

6am: Russia's war in Ukraine entered the third week on Thursday with none of its key objectives reached despite thousands of people killed, more than two million made refugees, and thousands forced to cower in besieged cities under relentless bombardment.

Ukrainian forces including citizen-soldiers who only last month never dreamed of firing a weapon in anger were holding out in Kyiv and other frontlines, while Russian troops, tanks and artillery made slow progress from the north, south and east.

Moscow's stated objectives of crushing the Ukrainian military and ousting the pro-West elected government of president Volodymyr Zelenskiy remained out of reach, with Mr Zelenskiy unshaken and lethal Western military aid pouring across the Polish and Romanian borders.

Western-led sanctions designed to cut the Russian economy and government from international financial markets were beginning to bite, with the Russian share market and rouble plunging and ordinary Russians rushing to hoard cash.

Mr Zelenskiy accused Russia of carrying out genocide after Ukrainian officials said Russian aircraft bombed a children's hospital on Wednesday, burying patients in rubble despite a ceasefire deal for people to flee the besieged city of Mariupol.

The attack, which authorities said injured women in labour and left children in the wreckage, underscored US warnings that the biggest assault on a European state since 1945 could become increasingly attritional after Russia's early failures.

The White House condemned the hospital bombing as a ""barbaric use of military force to go after innocent civilians"".

Evacuations

Russian had earlier pledged to halt firing so at least some trapped civilians could escape the port city, where hundreds of thousands have been sheltering without water or power for more than a week. Both sides blamed the other for the failure of the evacuation.

""What kind of country is this, the Russian Federation, which is afraid of hospitals, is afraid of maternity hospitals, and destroys them?"" Mr Zelenskiy said in a televised address late on Wednesday.

Mr Zelenskiy repeated his call for the West to tighten sanctions on Russia ""so that they sit down at the negotiating table and end this brutal war"". The bombing of the children's hospital, he said, was ""proof that a genocide of Ukrainians is taking place"".

The Donetsk region's governor said 17 people were wounded in the attack.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, asked by Reuters for comment, said: ""Russian forces do not fire on civilian targets."" Russia calls its incursion a ""special operation"" to disarm its neighbour and dislodge leaders it calls ""neo-Nazis.""

Rubble

Ukraine's foreign ministry posted video footage of what it said was the hospital showing holes where windows should have been in a three-storey building. Huge piles of smouldering rubble littered the scene.

The UN Human Rights body said it was verifying the number of casualties at Mariupol. The incident ""adds to our deep concerns about indiscriminate use of weapons in populated areas,"" it added through a spokesperson.

Among more than 2 million total refugees from Ukraine, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) said on Wednesday that more than 1 million children have fled the country since the invasion started on February 24th. At least 37 had been killed and 50 injured, it said.

The International Committee of the Red Cross said houses had been destroyed all across Ukraine. ""Hundreds of thousands of people have no food, no water, no heat, no electricity and no medical care,"" it said.

Foreign ministers from Russia and Ukraine will meet in Turkey on Thursday in the first high-level talks between the two countries since Moscow invaded its neighbour, with Ankara hoping they could mark a turning point in the raging conflict. Read full story

""I will say frankly that my expectations of the talks are low,"" Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said in a video statement on Wednesday.

Ukraine is seeking a ceasefire, liberation of its territories and to resolve all humanitarian issues, Kuleba said.

Moscow demands that Kyiv take a neutral position and drop aspirations of joining the Nato alliance.

Mr Zelenskiy told VICE in an interview on Wednesday that he was confident Russian president Vladimir Putin would at some stage agree to talks. ""I think he will. I think he sees that we are strong. He will. We need some time,"" he said.

Russia has been hit by Western sanctions and the withdrawals of foreign firms, the latest including Nestle, cigarette maker Philip Morris and Sony.

Rio Tinto on Thursday became the first major mining company to announce it was cutting all ties with Russian businesses, while the US House of Representatives on Wednesday voted to rush $13.6 billion in aid to Ukraine, sending the legislation to the Senate.

A majority of the US House of Representatives also voted to impose a ban on imports of Russian oil and other energy products in retaliation for Moscow's ongoing attack on Ukraine.

Zelenskyy says Moscow tank attack targeted human corridor

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused Russian forces of targeting a humanitarian corridor in the city of Mariupol in an operation of ""outright terror.""

Zelenskyy said that, while some 100,000 people have been evacuated the country's cities in just two days, some city residents have no way out.

The president said he had decided to send a convoy of trucks into the besieged port city with food, water, and medicine. However, he said, ""the occupiers launched a tank attack exactly where this corridor was supposed to be.""

""They knew what they were disrupting. They have a clear order to hold Mariupol hostage, to torture it, to carry out constant bombardment.""

""The world needs to know that. It has to admit it. We are all dealing with a terrorist state,"" Zelenskyy said.

Zelenskyy also said the city of Volnovakha was ""under attack"" in a similar way to Mariupol.

Mariupol's mayor says more than 1,200 civilians had died in 9 days of continuous shelling that have left residents with no water, heat, or communications.

International leaders and Ukraine have accused Russia of a ""barbaric"" attack on a children's hospital in the besieged city.

Ukraine says Russia shelled nuclear institute

Ukrainian officials say Russian forces have shelled a nuclear research institute in Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, setting buildings on fire.

A shell hit a building where some equipment — including an experimental nuclear reactor — could release radiation if it were damaged, Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's Interior Ministry, said.

The shelling caused a fire in a neighboring hostel that firefighters brought under control.

Authorities said they had observed no initial change in background radiation.

The Ukrainian parliament's official website had earlier said fighting close to the institute was continuing.

Russian forces have already taken over two nuclear power plants in Ukraine, raising concerns about the security of the nuclear facilities.

Ukraine says it lost contact with Chernobyl nuclear plant

Ukraine told the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that it lost contact with the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.

""Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that it had lost today all communications with the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP), the day after the Russian-controlled site lost all external power supplies,"" the IAEA said.

Schröder's mission to Moscow reportedly on Ukraine's request

Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder has traveled to Moscow to help mediate in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, Politico reported on Tuesday.

In an interview with DW, Politico's Executive Editor, Florian Eder said Schröder met President Vladimir Putin on Ukraine's request.

""The Ukrainian side asked Gerhard Schröder to try and build a bridge to Vladimir Putin and to try to negotiate about possible conditions for a ceasefire or something similar,"" Eder said.

The Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, had suggested a week ago that Schröder should mediate between Ukraine and Russia. The former chancellor is a longtime business associate of Kremlin circles and Putin.

Eder added it was ""really very much unprecedented"" for a former German leader to pursue diplomacy without telling the current government.

""I think very much that he is there on behalf of his own reputation that has been bruised and damaged in the past weeks, and he might hope to be able to repair that a little bit,"" he said.

German government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit told DW that should the report be accurate, the visit was made without consulting the government. Chancellor Olaf Scholz declined to comment when asked about the report in Versailles.

Schröder's wife, So-yeon Schröder-Kim, has since posted an image of herself in central Moscow.

Estonian prime minister calls for bolstering NATO defense posture

Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas told DW Thursday that the Russian invasion of Ukraine had fundamentally changed how NATO countries in Europe need to think about their defense strategy.

""We need to increase our spending on defense and we need to go from a deterrence posture to defense plans, as in how do we defend our territory?"" she said.

As a small country formerly part of the Soviet Union, with a significant Russian population, Estonia's inclusion into the European Union and NATO membership allow the country security guarantees.

Former Soviet countries like Georgia and Ukraine, both of which have seen Russian troops on their soil this century, enjoy no such guarantees.

""We are members of NATO, so attacking us would literally mean also attacking France, Germany or the United States,"" Kallas said. ""We have collective defense and we are not afraid. We don't see any miitary threats right now to us, and our focus is on helping Ukraine.""

Putin downplays effects of Russia sanctions

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday said that Russia would find a way to ""adapt"" to the massive international sanctions and pullouts of Western corporations in response to the invasion of Ukraine.

""We have to get through this period,"" he said, claiming that the unprecedented sanctions would make Russia stronger. ""The economy will undoubtedly adapt to the new situation. This will lead to an increase in our independence, self-reliance and sovereignty,"" Putin said.

As Western goods and services are cut off from Russia, and shortages loom, Putin tried to reassure Russians that the Kremlin had everything under control.

""It is clear that in such moments people's demands for certain categories of goods always increase, but we have no doubt that we will solve these problems in due course in a calm way and gradually people will find their way,"" Putin said.

Speaking to a televised government conference, Putin said the sanctions, in fact, hurt the West more than Russia.

""Their prices are rising, but that's not our fault. It's the result of their own miscalculations. There's no need to blame us,"" Putin said. ""They are telling their citizens to tighten their belts, to dress warmer,"" Putin said, adding that Russia was continuing to export oil and gas to Europe.

Many European countries continue to be dependent on Russian oil and gas. The US and UK this week said they would ban imports of Russian petroleum products. The EU is exploring ways to wean itself from Russian energy, but has so far held back from including oil and gas in sanctions packages.

Belarus says it will power Chernobyl

Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear power plant would be powered with energy from neighboring Belarus.

The energy ministry in Minsk made the announcement, according to the BelTA state news agency.

Ukraine's state-run nuclear company said Russian Forces had cut a power line supplying electricity to the site on Wednesday.

Chernobyl no longer generates electricity, but it needs the power to help cool spent nuclear fuel. The UN's nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, reported no critical impact on safety.

Ukraine's state-owned energy firm Ukrenergo criticized Minsk's intervention saying a ceasefire was the best remedy.

""All reports by Russian and Belarusian media on the supply of the Chernobyl power plant from Belarus are a provocation aimed at aggravating the situation,"" it said in a statement.

Berlin government was unaware of Gerhard Schröder's reported Moscow visit

Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder was meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, Politico reported on Thursday.

He was visiting as part of a mediation effort to end the war in Ukraine, Politico said, referring to ""sources familiar with the matter.""

German government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit told DW that should the report be accurate, the visit was made without consulting the government.

Last week Chancellor Olaf Scholz called on Schröder to step down from the boards of Russian state-owned energy companies.

Schröder is a longtime business associate of Kremlin circles and Putin. Like Scholz, Schröder is a member of the center-left Social Democrats. His close ties to Russia after leaving politics have embarrassed the party on more than one occasion in recent years.

When asked about the report by journalists on Thursday, Scholz simply replied: ""I do not wish to comment on that.""

Klitschko: Kyiv turned into a 'fortress'

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said nearly half of the capital's residents had fled and the capital had been turned into a fortress.

""A little less than 2 million people have currently left. However, Kyiv has been transformed into a fortress. Every street, every building, every checkpoint has been fortified,"" he said in a televised address. ""Even people who in their lives never intended to change their clothes, now they are in uniform with machine guns in their hands.""

The former boxing champion said the city was determined not to fall to advancing Russian forces. Russian troops have taken over the outskirts in the north and northwest of the city. More attacks are expected from the northeast.

Chelsea wants sanctions relief

Chelsea Football Club said activities would continue despite the sanctions against its owner Roman Abramovich.

Chelsea said they would ask the government to lift the restrictions, including a ban on new ticket sales.

""This will include seeking permission for the licence to be amended in order to allow the Club to operate as normal as possible,"" the club said in a statement.

Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries, whose portfolio includes sports, earlier said that the sanctions on Abramovich would ""obviously have a direct impact"" on Chelsea but would deprive ""Abramovich of benefiting from his ownership of the club.""

He previously said he would sell the club, but the sanctions make that impossible.

'Putin's idea of blitzkrieg has failed' — former Ukraine president

Ukraine’s former president Petro Poroshenko has told DW that Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine has been a failure.

""Today because of the Ukrainian army, because of our soldiers, because of the unity of Ukrainian people, Putin understands that his idea of blitzkrieg has failed,"" Poroshenko said.

""Please get out from Ukrainian soil. Please get out your troops. Please stop killing Ukrainians. And this is absolutely firm basis for negotiation,"" he added.

The former president emphasized that solidarity with allies was now vital and called for ""support of Ukraine, not only by finance, not only by political means, but also in their defensive capabilities.""

ECB speeds up exit from bond purchase and warns of higher inflation

The European Central Bank raised its inflation projections and cut its growth outlook owing in large part to Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine.

""The Russian invasion of Ukraine will negatively affect the euro area economy and has significantly increased uncertainty,"" ECB President Christine Lagarde said.

The bank now sees inflation at more than twice its 2% target this year, climbing to 5.1%, up from 3.2% previously. In 2023 and 2024, the ECB now projects inflation of 2.1% and 1.9%, respectively.

""Energy costs have risen further in recent weeks and there will be further pressure on some food and commodity prices owing to the war in Ukraine,"" Lagarde said.

The bank said it would accelerate its exit from bond purchases. The purchases aim to keep borrowing costs low for companies and promote business investment and hiring.

The ECB also said its first interest rate hike wouldn't immediately follow the end of asset purchases, as previously indicated.

The vice president said ""Absolutely there should be an investigation. And we should all be watching.""

Harris announced $53 million in humanitarian aid to Poland.

Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday condemned Russia’s airstrikes on a maternity hospital in Ukraine as “atrocities of unimaginable proportions” and urged an investigation into the attacks.

Harris underscored the United States’ commitment to “defend every inch of NATO territory.” The vice president visited Poland as part of an effort to show unity among NATO allies in response to Russia's war on Ukraine, where the death toll has been rising.

The trip came amid a controversy after the Pentagon declined Poland's surprise proposal to provide Soviet-built MiG-29 fighter jets for the United States to give to Ukraine.

“We have been witnessing for weeks, and certainly just in the last 24 hours, atrocities of unimaginable proportions,” Harris said. “A maternity hospital, a children's hospital, where we have witnessed pregnant women who were there for care for one reason being taken out because they required care, because of an act of violence, unprovoked, unjustified.”

Russian airstrikes hit the hospital in the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol on Wednesday. Three people were killed, including a child, and 17 people wounded.

'Horrifying':Russia strike on Ukraine maternity hospital draws outrage as civilian war toll rises

Harris noted the United Nations has started to review Russian attacks on civilians.

""Absolutely there should be an investigation. And we should all be watching,” Harris said at a news conference with Polish President Andrzej Duda. “I have no question the eyes of the world are on this war and what Russia has done in terms of this aggression and these atrocities.”

Duda went further than Harris.

“Russians are committing war crimes,” he said. ""This is an act of barbarity, bearing the features of a genocide aimed at eliminating or destroying a nation.""

Fighter jets debacle

Harris and Duda stood as a united front, bucking any concerns of tension between the two countries after the United States turned down Poland's fighter jet proposal.

“I want to be very clear, the United States and Poland are united in what we have done and are prepared to do to help Ukraine and the people of Ukraine,” she said. “Full stop.”

When asked whether there is an alternative plan to get materials to Ukraine to defend itself, Harris noted the United States has given billions in aid.

“We're making deliveries every day in terms of what we can do in terms of assistance,” she said. “In particular, when you look at what we've been doing as it relates to anti-tank and anti-defense systems, that is an ongoing process, and that's not going to stop to the extent that there is a need.""

Duda tried to clear up Poland's fighter jet proposal, saying he wanted NATO to decide on the plan so “that Poland remains a credible member of NATO, not a country who decides on its own on important issues.”

In Washington, Republican senators blasted the Biden administration Thursday for declining to send donated Polish jet fighters to Ukraine despite pleas from President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for air support.

Two of them, Sens. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and Ben Sasse, R-Neb., said they didn’t buy the administration’s reliance on a U.S. intelligence assessment that concluded that transferring jet fighters directly to Ukraine would escalate U.S. involvement more than providing anti-aircraft batteries and other weapons and that it could drag the United States into a war with Russia.

“It's not impossible to figure out a way to solve the problem if we wanted to solve the problem,” Sasse told top U.S. intelligence officials testifying at a Senate intelligence hearing on the annual Worldwide Threat Assessment report. “And women and children are being bombed. Nobody on this committee is calling for U.S. boots on the ground in Ukraine. But there's more we can do, and we should be going faster.”

Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, said U.S. military and intelligence officials believe providing planes could cross some sort of red line and prompt Russian President Vladimir Putin to lash out.

“I do believe that there is an escalation ladder,” Berrier said. “And there's a difference between an anti-tank weapon, a shoulder-fired air defense weapon and a combat aircraft and a jet that could cross a border and actually conduct operations on Russian soil.”

US aid to Poland

Harris announced the United States will give $50 million in humanitarian aid to Poland.

Harris said the excess amount of refugees fleeing the war “put an extraordinary burden on Poland and the people of Poland.”

""We will continue with the support that we can give you, Mr. President, in terms of the work that you and the people of Poland have been doing to bear this burden,” Harris said.

Poland has accepted more than 1.4 million Ukrainian refugees, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.

Oil, gold, trade:Congress looks for options to punish Russia for invading Ukraine

The vice president said two U.S. Patriot missile systems were delivered to Poland, as promised. There have been growing fears that Russia’s attacks on Ukraine could spill over to neighboring countries, such as Poland.

Harris reaffirmed that the United States would fulfill its obligation under NATO's Article 5 to defend member countries if they are attacked.

“The United States commitment for Article 5 is ironclad,” she said. “The United States is prepared to defend every inch of NATO territory. The United States takes seriously that an attack against one is an attack against all.”
