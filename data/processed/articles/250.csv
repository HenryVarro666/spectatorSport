The Russian attack on Ukraine: day 14

The military situation did not change significantly during the fourteenth day of the Russian aggression against Ukraine. The Ukrainian Armed Forces held back the offensive in all directions, and the fighting took place mainly on the outskirts of the towns & cities under attack. According to Kyiv, the Russian army will mobilise reserves it has at its permanent locations and move more units into Ukraine. The Ukrainians have emphasised the important role Belarus has played in securing the logistics of the attack.

In the Polessie direction, most clashes are taking place in the vicinity of Kyiv, and the forces prepared to defend the city remain ready to repel any possible strike. On 9 March, Russian troops regrouped to attack the capital and rotate their sub-units on the front line, which the Ukrainians took advantage of to launch attacks on Borodianka and Makariv. This assault ended with the opponent suffering some losses, but did not change the occupied positions. South-west of Kyiv, the aggressor’s troops continued their offensive actions in the Fastiv region, but the defenders were apparently able to repel the attack on Fastiv town.

In the Severny direction, the main battles are taking place on the north-eastern outskirts of Kyiv and in the town of Brovary. One of the invaders’ battalion tactical groups (BTGs) organised a crossing of the Trubizh River (the left tributary of the Dnieper) to block the E95 route (the main exit road from Kyiv to the northeast) 10 km from the capital’s borders. Particularly heavy clashes took place on the outskirts of Brovary. A Russian attack near the villages of Bohdanivka and Velyka Dymerka (30 km north-east of Kyiv’s city centre) was halted. Due to the losses suffered near Chernihiv, the aggressor engaged a reserve BTG from the 55th Mechanised Brigade of the 41st Combined Arms Army of the Central Military District. The towns of Sumy, Okhtyrka and Trostsyanets were bombed once again. All roads in the direction of Sumy and Trostsyanets were blocked due to the movement of the invader’s columns.

In the Slobodka direction, the Russian forces created a border along the Severodonetsk-Sumy line, from where operations are being launched westward to the line of the Dnieper and in the Kharkiv region. Particularly fierce fighting is taking place around the latter: the Russians have continued bombing and artillery fire, but the Ukrainian army regained full control of the town of Derhachi which borders it from the north. In the south, the aggressor expanded its attack zone to the west of Izyum (which was almost completely destroyed) up to the villages of Petrivske and Hrushuvakha.

In the Donetsk direction, Russian forces (numbering up to 7 BTGs) are continuing their efforts to push the Ukrainian forces to the western borders of Luhansk oblast and the northern borders of Donetsk oblast. After regrouping, they resumed their attacks on Severodonetsk and Rubizhne, and after taking control of the Starobelskiy region, they reached the town of Svativ (55 km north of Severodonetsk). Fearing encirclement, the defenders pulled out from the front line and retreated westwards. In Donetsk oblast, after partially reaching the border with Zaporizhzhia oblast, the aggressor moved its forces northwards and started firing at the villages north of Horlivka; fighting also took place in Maryinka (30 km west of Donetsk). In the vicinity of the besieged city of Mariupol, the most severe clashes took place along the ‘green corridors’, intended for the evacuation of the population.

In the Taurida direction, the line of the offensive has begun to move north. The aggressor’s troops were halted in Novovorontsivka on the right bank of the Dnieper, 60 km south-east of their target, the city of Kryvyi Rih. In the Zaporizhzhia region, the invaders reached Rozivka, 45 km north-west of Mariupol. Mykolaiv remains encircled, and Russian forces have occupied the northern districts of the city. To its northwest, the Ukraine Armed Forces have designated a new defence direction, the Southern Buzhany. Ukrainian troops are still holding back the Russians in the vicinity of Voznesensk; a Russian attempt to cross the Boh River failed, which forced them to stop their move towards the South Ukrainian Nuclear Power Plant.

The Ukrainian Defence Ministry has stated that the Russian offensive is being effectively checked. Some of the aggressor’s units have lost their combat effectiveness, which has forced them to call up additional reserves. The role of local territorial defence formations and voluntary units is growing in importance. The Ukrainian government is calling on the public to focus on destroying Russia’s electronic warfare and electronic reconnaissance systems, as well as fuel and supply columns. President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a law on ensuring the participation of civilians in the defence of Ukraine, which provides the legal basis for the spontaneous organisation of ‘total defence’, including the right of residents to receive firearms and ammunition. Civilians have been released from criminal liability for the use of firearms against the aggressor.

The foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba warned that as power to the closed Chernobyl power plant (where spent nuclear fuel is stored) has been cut, there is a risk of a radioactive leak. He called for a maintenance brigade to be admitted to the facility to restore power, as the standby diesel generators were designed to run only for 48 hours. The Ukrainian operator Ukrenerho has announced that it will start repairs to the transmission line, despite the risk of Russian shelling. Belarus’s president Alyaksandr Lukashenka, after talking with Vladimir Putin, said that Belarus was investigating the possibility of supplying Chernobyl with its own electricity.

The Russians are continuing their efforts to pacify the occupied territories; these moves will take the form of criminal operations supported by the FSB. In the Kherson region, the National Guard detained over 400 Ukrainians on charges of resisting and participating in anti-Russian demonstrations. Psychological actions to lower the morale of the civilian population are underway. In occupied Berdyansk, the locals are being offered the possibility to obtain Russian passports. Russian forces are terrorising local journalists and forcing them to spread disinformation. In Melitopol, it has been announced that the annual seeding campaign will be launched, with assurances that the local farmers will have access to the Russian market. Alleged receptions of Russian humanitarian aid are being staged, performed by stooges.

For the first time, Russia admitted that its military operation has been poorly prepared, and that it had sent soldiers to Ukraine from the autumn conscription, who were untrained for combat operations. It was confirmed that many young soldiers have been taken prisoner. This caused a sharp reaction from Putin, who ordered the recruits to withdraw from Ukraine, and instructed the military prosecutor’s office to indicate the persons responsible for making such a decision.

The Russian defence ministry claims that 2911 Ukrainian military infrastructure facilities, 97 aircraft, 107 unmanned aerial vehicles, 141 anti-aircraft missile systems, 86 radar stations, 986 tanks and other armoured combat vehicles, 107 multiple rocket launchers, 368 artillery & field mortars and 749 wheeled vehicles have been destroyed since the beginning of the operation.

More than 45,000 people were evacuated from zones affected by hostilities (including Sumy, Enerhodar, Hostomel, Borodianka, Bucha). They were taken to a refugee camp which has been set up at a training ground near Kyiv. According to their accounts, the Russians have been plundering stores, intimidating and murdering the inhabitants. The condition of the besieged city Mariupol is disastrous; people are dying due to the lack of water, electricity and food – the city authorities estimate that 1300 residents have died as a result of the blockade and shelling. Moreover, on 9 March the aggressors bombed a maternity hospital and are still preventing humanitarian convoys from entering the city, as well as blocking the evacuation of the population.

On 9 March, 117,000 people crossed into Poland; in total 1.43 million have entered the country since the beginning of the invasion. Evacuation trains run by Ukrainian Railways have already transported 1.8 million people from the east and south of Ukraine to its western regions, and a further 147,000 have been transported abroad. Once again, the number of connections to Poland and the Czech Republic has been increased. In Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk oblasts, as well as in Odesa, schools and universities are resuming work (remotely) as of 14 March.

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will provide Ukraine with €2 billion (deferred repayment of loans, liquidity support for companies, assistance in relocation), and will subsidise municipal services in the countries receiving refugees. The US House of Representatives has approved US$13.6 billion in support for Ukraine, which is to be allocated to military, economic and humanitarian aid (although this initiative must receive the backing of the Senate).

On 10 March, the foreign ministers of Russia and Ukraine, Sergei Lavrov and Dmytro Kuleba, met in Antalya in the presence of Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, the head of the Turkish foreign ministry, who acted as an intermediary. According to the Russian side, the talks were mainly about humanitarian problems, as Moscow insists that negotiations aimed at settling the conflict should only be conducted between the Ukrainian and Russian delegations in Belarus. Lavrov revealed that in these negotiations, the Russians handed the Ukrainian delegation a draft document defining the terms of the ceasefire, and are waiting for Kyiv’s response. He also reiterated his previous position regarding the need to ‘demilitarise and de-Nazify’ Ukraine, and at the same time stated that there was no Russian attack on Ukraine. When answering questions about the bombing of the Mariupol maternity hospital, he claimed that the building had been turned into a resistance point by the Azov battalion and other radicals, and that patients and staff had been evacuated. Kuleba announced that the most important things for the Ukrainian side at this time were to arrange an at least temporary ceasefire and agree upon humanitarian corridors. He also rejected any possibility of surrender. According to a poll conducted on 3-4 March, 79% of Ukrainians oppose recognising the occupied territories of Donbas as part of Russia, 75% oppose the formal cession of Crimea, and 56% reject the Russian demand that Ukraine cannot become a member of NATO.

On 24 February 2022, Ukraine was suddenly and deliberately attacked by land, naval and air forces of Russia, igniting the largest European war since the Great Patriotic War. The military buildup in preceeding months makes it obvious that the unprovoked and dastardly Russian attack was deliberately planned long in advance. During the intervening time, the Russian government had deliberately sought to deceive the world by false statements and expressions of hope for continued peace.

""To initiate a war of aggression... is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole."" [Judgment of the International Military Tribunal]

Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine in response to the appeal of the leaders of the ""Donbass republics"" for help. That attack is a blatant violation of the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. Putin stressed that Moscow's plans did not include the occupation of Ukrainian territories, the goal is the demilitarization and denazification of the country. As stated in the Russian Defense Ministry, the Russian military does not strike at cities, but disable only the military infrastructure, so nothing threatens the civilian population.

US intelligence chiefs said they thought China, which has refused to condemn Russia or call the attack an invasion, was ""unsettled"" by events in Ukraine. ""I do believe that the Chinese leadership, President Xi (Jinping) in particular, is unsettled,"" Central Intelligence Agency (CAI) Director William Burns said. ""By what he's seen, partly because his own intelligence doesn't appear to have told him what was going to happen.""

At the Senate Intelligence Committee's annual hearing on worldwide threats to US security, US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said Russian forces are operating with ""reckless disregard"" for civilians as they face stronger-than-expected resistance in Ukraine.""The Russian military has begun to loosen its rules of engagement to achieve their military objectives,"" said Haines. US intelligence agencies are tracking Russia's actions to hold them to account, Haines added.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he feared Russia would deploy chemical weapons in Ukraine. ""The stuff that you're hearing about chemical weapons, this is straight out of their playbook,"" Johnson said in an interview with Sky News. ""They start saying that there are chemical weapons that have been stored by their opponents or by the Americans, and so when they themselves deploy chemical weapons, as I fear they may, they have a sort of ... fake story, ready to go.""

On March 10, the Russian-inspired Readovka map ""became noticeably less red. This is due to the fact that the boundaries of the fronts in the north were clarified. However, this does not mean that the RF Armed Forces are retreating. On the contrary, significant progress can be seen in these areas.""

Ukrainian troops launched a counterattack to drive occupying Russian forces from a village in the Kyiv region. In the heart of Irpin, a satellite city located around 20 kilometres northwest of Kyiv, the entire city is mounting resistance against Russian forces advancing towards the Ukrainian capital. The situation in the area was relatively calm. The Russians continued to amass its forces in direction of Bucha, Hostomel and Yasnohorodka. The civilian evacuation from Irpin continued. According to British/US intel, Russian forces will launch a massive attack on Kyiv no later than Sunday 13 March 2022.

Reporting from the last checkpoint between Irpin, a northern suburb of Kyiv, and the Ukrainian capital, FRANCE 24s Cyril Payen said the Russian offensive is pushing on amid stiff Ukrainian resistance. Payen was able to enter Irpin, which he described as a ghost town amid desperate scenes, including bodies lying on the frontline since they could not be collected due to the heavy fighting. Russian tanks are around 200 meters away, I would say 50 percent of Irpin is taken by the Russian army and the other 50 percent is defended by Ukrainian troops, said Payen.

On the ground, the fighting continued as the Russian army attacked various Ukrainian cities in a slow-motion offensive, which might be part of Moscow's military strategy to tire Kievs forces to force them to surrender one by one. While the Russians have made substantial gains across southern Ukraine, claiming some crucial port cities across the Black Sea coast, slowly moving to encircle the countrys two biggest cities, Kiev and Kharkiv, they have not been able to implement a full-scale assault after two weeks of brutal fighting.

The civilian evacuation from Sumy successfully continued. Ukrainian sources reports up to 50 thousand civilians left the city in total. Romny was reportedly under siege, confirming that the Russian forces bypassed the city when moving from Sumy towards Pryluky.

In Kharkiv Oblast, Russian recon/sabotage group (DRG) attacked a Ukrainian checkpoint in the village of Andriivka at night. The assault was repelled by a Ukrainian Border Guard unit stationed there. Ukrainian forces conducted a successful counter-attack in the direction of Dernachi, liberating the settlement and lifting the enemy pressure in the area. The situation in Izium reached a critical stage. Some civilians were able to left towards Slovyansk, but most remained in the town. It was unclear if there were still some Ukrainian elements in Izium. The town is heavily damaged.

Russian forces shelling Mykolaiv from the north-east and north, Ukrainian forces continue to dig trenches and setting up barricades. The moment of Russian attack on the city was approaching. Meanwhile, the enemy pushed north of Mykolaiv, alongside Inhulets river and connected with its forces near Bashtanka. Fighting was also reported from Voznesensk, but Ukrainian forces are successfully holding the ground. In Kherson Oblast, Russian troops pushed north towards Kryvyi Rih from Nova Kakhovka. They captured Mylove, Dudchany and Bila Krynytsia, despite Ukrainian air strikes in the area. The cities of Nikopol and Kryvyi Rih prepares for defense.

Putin denied that Russia is using any conscripted soldiers and will not use them in combat operations. The Russian president also pointed out that Nor will there be any additional mobilisation of reserves against Ukrainian forces. The Red Cross said more than 400,000 people are trapped in Mariupol without humanitarian aid and evacuation corridors, and the city faces ""apocalyptic"" conditions. A key port city on the coast of the Sea of Azov, Mariupol is major transit point on the road to Crimea, and analysts have speculated that Russian might seek to seize the city as part of a ""land bridge"" to the occupied Crimea Peninsula.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba met with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, in Turkey. But the talks failed to produce a breakthrough. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba says a meeting with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, the first high-level talks between the two countries since Moscow launch an unprovoked invasion of its neighbor last month, failed to make progress on a cease-fire. Kuleba said after the meeting in the Turkish resort city of Antalya 15 days into the war, that Lavrov did not commit to ensuring a humanitarian corridor in the besieged city of Mariupol.

U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris accused Russia of committing ""atrocities of unimaginable proportions"" in Ukraine as she traveled to Warsaw amid controversy over a Polish plan to supply fighter jets to Ukraine. ""Absolutely, there should be an investigation and we should all be watching and I have no question that the eyes of the world are on this war and what Russia has done in terms of this aggression and these atrocities,"" Harris said.

Russia's defence ministry has denied bombing a maternity and children's hospital in Mariupol, accusing Ukraine of conducting a ""staged provocation"". The ministry said that Russia carried out no air strikes on ground targets in that area on that day, respecting an agreed ""silent regime"". Twitter removed content from Russian Embassy UK claiming the Mariupol maternity hospital bombing was staged. Moscow's claim that the attack -- which killed three people, including a child -- was a ""staged provocation"" sparked a Twitter storm. Twitter told the BBC: We took enforcement action against the Tweets you referenced as they were in violation of the Twitter Rules, specifically our Hateful Conduct and Abusive Behavior policies related to the denial of violent events.

Harris's trip, aimed at bolstering U.S. support for its Eastern European allies, has been overshadowed by an open disagreement between Warsaw and Washington over the Polish proposal, which called for sending MiG warplanes to Ukraine, by way of a U.S. military base in Germany. Asked at a joint news conference in Warsaw on March 10 with President Andrzej Duda about the jet dispute, Harris dodged a reporter's question. ""We're making deliveries every day, in terms of what we can do, in terms of assistance and, in particular, when you look at what we've been doing, as it relates to anti-tank and anti-defense systems,"" she said, according to a White House transcript.

The European Union should stop using Russian fossil fuels by 2027, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said, adding she would propose a plan for doing so in mid-May. ""Proposal for a RePowerEU plan to phase out our dependencies on Russian fossil fuels by 2027,"" she wrote as EU leaders met in Versailles to discuss the issue.

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said half the population of the Ukrainian capital has fled. But he warned that the city is now ""a fortress. Every street, every building, every checkpoint has been fortified."" Russias defence ministry said it would open humanitarian corridors from five cities: Kyiv, Suma, Kharkiv, Mariupol and Chernihiv. On Thursday, not a single civilian was able to leave the besieged city of Mariupol as Russian forces failed to respect a temporary ceasefire to enable evacuations, said Ukraines Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk.

The United Nations says that more than 2.3 million refugees have now left Ukraine since the start of Russia's invasion last month, with almost 161,7000 fleeing in the previous 24 hours. The head of the UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency, said that the agency needed about $500 million for its emergency work in Ukraine and neighboring countries, of which almost $300 million has been received so far, two-thirds of which came from private donations.

Most Ukrainian refugees have crossed into Poland, where their number now stands at more than 1.42 million. Poland's border guards said that some 117,600 people crossed the border the previous day. However, there are now signs that the exodus has peaked and the number of daily crossings is going down.",https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/russo-ukraine-2022-03-10.htm

POLICY

President of Ukraine

Information about the victims of yesterday's bombing of the maternity hospital and the children's hospital in Mariupol appeared last night. We lost three people, including a child, a girl. The number of wounded is 17. These are children, women, medical workers.

This topic was mentioned on Russian television. It was on their talk show. But not a word of truth was said. The Russians were lied to that there had been no patients in the hospital and no women or children in the maternity hospital. The Russians were lied to that ""nationalists"" had allegedly taken up positions there. They lie confidently, as always.

War crimes are impossible without the propagandists who cover them up. I want to tell them one thing: you will bear responsibility just as all those who give orders to bomb civilians. We will find all the property of the propagandists and their associates. We will do our best to confiscate it wherever it is. You love a rich life. Love prosperous countries. You will not have this anymore. And this is just the beginning.

You will definitely be prosecuted for complicity in war crimes. And then, it will definitely happen, you will be hated by Russian citizens. Everyone whom you have been deceiving constantly, daily, for many years in a row. When they feel the consequences of your lies in their wallets, in their shrinking possibilities. In the stolen future of Russian children.

War is never isolated. It always beats both the victim and the aggressor. The aggressor just realizes it later. But it always realizes and always suffers.

Today, we are once again providing humanitarian corridors for our cities. The buses have already departed, the trucks are already on their way - with food, water, medicine.

Mariupol, Volnovakha, Izyum, Sumy and the region. Cities and towns of the Kyiv region - Bucha, Borodyanka, Irpin, Hostomel... My heart is broken by what the invaders did to our cities, to our state! And by what they want to do to our people who need urgent help.

Russian troops have already created a humanitarian catastrophe in Ukraine. But for them it is part of the plan. They want to humiliate our people. Make them take bread and water from the hands of the invaders standing on their knees. So that Ukrainians can save their lives just by going to the occupied territories or to Russia. That's why they are blocking Mariupol, that's why they are blocking Volnovakha, blocking other cities.

The invaders specially organize this torture to give their propaganda channels new material. Just for that. Monsters.

Despite everything, updated information was received every hour yesterday about people whom we managed to evacuate to the free territory of Ukraine. In total, more than 60,000 of our citizens were rescued yesterday plus those who did not have time until night and continued the evacuation in the morning.

I spoke today, in particular about that, with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. About the torture of our cities, our people. I spoke with French President Macron.

I felt in a conversation with Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson that our anti-war coalition will soon become much stronger. Consequently, the pressure on Russia for peace will also be much stronger. For us, specifics in relations with world leaders, with European leaders are very important.

We are really fighting for our independence! For freedom, for equality for all on the continent! That is why we want to see from partners the decisions based on reality, not on declarations or abstract considerations.

These days, the EU leaders will convene to discuss Russia's war against Ukraine. To discuss our application for EU membership. We are waiting for a concrete signal. We look forward to strong support. Because it will be fair, real, human, European.

We know exactly the position of every leader. We know exactly who stands with us and who thinks that the European Union is just accounting, profits, expenses and nothing more. We will work, we will persuade. Life will convince them.

Ukrainians! Our defenders!

We all have been defending our state for the 15th day. We endured. The Ukrainian army is repelling attacks in key directions. Thanks to our military, National Guards, border guards, police, territorial defense and everyone who joined the defense of the state, we have not become slaves, and will never become!

Because this is our spirit, this is our destiny. Pride for our Armed Forces of Ukraine is boundless!

After the war, after our victory, we will rebuild everything that was destroyed.

Very quickly and with a very high quality. A special state program for reconstruction will be created for each affected city. I have already instructed the government to start the elaboration.

Chernihiv and Sumy, Okhtyrka and Zhytomyr, Izyum, Mariupol and all our beautiful cities to which evil has come will not see a single trace of the Russian invasion.

The best architects, the best companies, the best projects. For every city! I want to say this on the example of Kharkiv. Our Kharkiv, which is now experiencing the worst suffering since World War II.

Saltivka, Oleksiivka... Perhaps most Ukrainians know nothing about these names. But the people of Kharkiv will hear. Freedom Square will be such that everyone, all of us, all Europeans will be there!

Briefing of Counsellor of the Head of Presidential Office of Ukraine Oleksii Arestovych

After yesterday’s airstrike at the Mariupol maternity house and children's hospital, it became obvious that the enemy has totally changed the tactics, has turned to a “Syrian scenario” – encircling and terrorizing cities and towns to cause maximum suffering and psychological pressure to civilians. Currently, cities that suffer the most are Mariupol (which Russia is trying to wipe off the map), Kharkiv, Okhtyrka and in some sense Mykolaiv.

The military and political leadership of Ukraine, the leadership of all states in the world together with the international organizations are aware of the situation. There are daily attempts to establish the humanitarian corridors, and today they will be launched from many cities, including from Mariupol. However, the enemy is deliberately disrupting the evacuation from Mariupol. At the same time, the Ukraine’s army is defending the city and doing its best to ensure the evacuation.

The goal of Russia in Mariupol is to cause panic and frustration with the actions of the Ukrainian authorities by the citizens of Ukraine. He urged the citizens to remember that it is Russia that cause the war and is interested in the Ukrainian disunity. The developments during the war depend on actions from both sides.

When it comes to the general military situation, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have made at least 7 powerful strikes at the enemy, including the termination of two regimental commanders of the Russian army, near Brovary, Izyum, Nikopol and Kryvyy Rig. Our army near Kharkiv took control over Dergachi and have disconnected the part of Russian troops in the north from those located next to Izyum, and have created a serious tactical success.

Ukrainian aviation, rocket forces and artillery continue striking the enemy, and we expect the change of the situation in Ukraine’s favor in the closet time. Ukraine is doing much efforts to change the humanitarian situation in the blocked cities, as like it works on the elimination of the enemy from those and other cities of Ukraine.

Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine

On March 9, 2022 Ukraine evacuated 2000 foreign students from Sumy.

These are the first foreign students who managed to escape a horrible war zone, created by Russia on the territory of Ukraine.

Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba

In our meeting with FM Lavrov mediated by Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu I insisted on the urgent need to allow humanitarian help for Mariupol and a 24-hour ceasefire. Unfortunately, FM Lavrov seemed to have come to talk, not to decide. I hope he will convey Ukraine’s requests back in Moscow.

https://twitter.com/DmytroKuleba/status/1501907775013765124

Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba speaking to the media following the meeting with the foreign ministers of Turkey and the RF on Russia ceasing its war against Ukraine.

[The talks] were both easy and difficult. Easy because Minister Lavrov shared his traditional narratives about Ukraine. Difficult because I did my best to at least find a diplomatic solution to humanitarian tragedy unfolding on the battle ground near besieged cities. The most tragic situation is now in Mariupol on the Sea of Azov, which is bombarded and is subjected to artillery fire.

I came here with a humanitarian purpose. Mariupol is in the most difficult situation. I came here with a humanitarian mission to open humanitarian corridors out of Mariupol for the people wishing to leave the city, and to bring assistance into the city.

Unfortunately, Minister Lavrov was in a position to commit himself to it, but he will correspond with respective authorities on this issue.

We also raised an issue of a 24-hour ceasefire to resolve the most pressing humanitarian issues. We did not make progress on this since it seems there are other decision-makers on this matters in Russia.

We agreed to continue doing our best to seek a solution for humanitarian issues on the ground. I will be ready to meet again in this format if there will be prospect for a solution.

I believe that when Foreign ministers meet, they have by definition to negotiate issues of peace and security. I am ready to continue this engagement with the purpose of ending the war in Ukraine and stopping the suffering of Ukrainian people and liberating our territory from the Russian occupational force.

[In Ukrainian] – Thanked Turkish Foreign Minister for good will and professionalism. Underscored that had 2 tasks: to organize humanitarian corridors and 24-hours ceasefire.

I hope that Russia will demonstrate compassion to human suffering and allow the functioning humanitarian corridors from Mariupol and from Sumy to Poltava. We cannot stop the war if the country that started it does not want to stop it.

Today I heard that Russia will not allow ceasefire until Ukraine meets the demands that had been put forward by President Putin. In this regard I’d like to underscore that Ukraine did not surrender, is not surrendering and will not surrender. We are ready for diplomacy, we are looking for solutions, but until they are there, we will continue fighting to offset the Russian aggression.

I hope that today’s format will be continued. I am ready to continue talks if the Russian side will be ready to a serious talk, but not repetition of well-known clichés and narratives about Ukraine. What we need today a serious, subject-based talk without clichés. When the Russian side is ready, we’ll be ready. We’ll do everything for peace because saving human lives is a priority for us.

Q&A:

1) Did you get the impression that these attacks will continue? Have you received a promise about receiving military jets from the US?

No, we did not discuss military supplies to Ukraine. Upon my initiative we dedicated most of the time to discussing humanitarian issues on the ground. Because it is of the utmost priority for diplomacy to help everyone, who is suffering. I appealed to him in the most constructive way. It was not easy for me to listen to everything he was saying. But I several times requested to address urgently humanitarian issues.

My impression is that Russia is not in a position at this point to establish the ceasefire. They seek a surrender from Ukraine, but that is not what they are going to get.

Ukraine is strong, Ukraine is fighting, Ukraine will not surrender. We made we are ready to seek a balanced diplomatic solution to end this war but we will not surrender.

2) Peskov said the invasion will stop if there is a commitment from Ukraine not to join NATO. Did Russia ask you about it?

No, Minister Lavrov said that all these issues must be discussed at a different track, the Belarus talks. He did not go into details on these issues, but he conveyed to me that they will continue their repression until Ukraine meets their demands. And the list of those demands is a surrender. That is why it is unacceptable to us.

The last thing I want is to kill hope. I shared with Mr. Lavrov one episode in a hope that he will respond constructively based on simple human values and with respect to human life. I talked to him about a civilian, who was driving in a car and made a wrong turn and was immediately shot by a Russian solider. This must be stopped. This is a war crime. And everyone involved will bear responsibility, eventually.

I hope, I sincerely hope, that Mr. Lavrov will follow up these conversation with the Russian government and the Russian army and they will organize humanitarian passage for thousands of civilians, on whose behalf I spoke to him today, first and foremost from Mariupol, to allow provision of humanitarian aid to Mariupol.

3) Ukraine’s leadership has talked about pursuing some non-NATO models to resolve the conflict if it receives certain security guarantees. During your meeting with Mr. Lavrov did any issues about Ukraine’s status came up? Minister Lavrov set up any red lines, such as insisting Ukraine disarm or recognizes Russian sovereignty over the Donbas. What did you respond to it?

He mentioned it very briefly without going into discussion again. He insists this issue has to be discussed between delegations on the Belarus talks.

I told him that in my view the ministers are invested with the power to discuss these matters. However, he had a different understanding of the role of foreign ministers in these talks, so we did not engage into specific discussion on this matter.

4) Director General of MAGATE is in Antalya. Do you plan to meet with him? Has Minister Lavrov touched the issue of security of nuclear power plants? Does Russia continue threats of nuclear button?

[In Ukrainian] Yes, by the end of the meting Mr. Lavrov touched upon the issue of nuclear safety. He proposed to hold trilateral talks with MAGATE. I told him that before Russian soldiers came to Ukraine our nuclear power stations operated properly and that Ukraine has always been and is a reliable participant of all verifications models of MAGATE and reliable implementer of treaties on nuclear nonproliferation.

The lie that they are trying to spread – that they had found in Ukraine the traces of [Ukraine] developing nuclear weapons – this is a lie. Nothing of that sort ever happened in Ukraine.

So, the best Russia can do now is to take its soldiers out of Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plants and allow their personnel to service them.

5) [inaudible, signal lost] – Question on NATO membership

Yes, it is written in our Constitution that Ukraine will eventually join NATO as a full member and receive security guarantees.

However, we understand that this is not going to happen in the foreseeable future. We also see from the reaction of NATO, as an Alliance, to the Russian aggression against Ukraine that NATO is not ready to act collectively to stop the war and protect civilians from Russian raids. It [NATO] delegated the authority to help to member-states on the bilateral basis.

This poses a question: How to ensure Ukraine’s security between now and eventual NATO membership? This is the question. My Constitution says something and I can’t speak against my Constitution.

But if we could reach an agreement were a similar system of guarantees, as envisaged by NATO, charter would be granted to Ukraine – by permanent members of the UN Security Council, including Russia, by Turkey, by all our neighbors – this is something that we are ready to discuss.

The war is happening now. Ukraine exists in a security vacuum. We have to think creatively on how to address this issue and ensure our security. So far it is our Army that ensures our security and a list of partners, including Turkey, who are helping us with that.

State Service for Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine

Mobile operators and Internet providers in Ukraine work stably and continue to provide electronic communications services.

Following the request of the State Service for Special Communications, in large cities local governments, providers and operators work together on connecting bomb shelters to the Internet.

JSC Ukrtelecom resumed services in the Chernihiv region. But due to accidents on the main lines in Sumy, Kherson, Mykolaiv and parts of Kyiv regions, communication was disrupted. Work on the restoration of Internet services in Kyiv region continues. Also, the operator lifted restrictions on the speed of Internet access in all regions, except Chernihiv and Sumy, where priority is given to critical needs of the Armed Forces and critical social infrastructure facilities. The total number of regional communication nodes operating has increased to 77%.

Prosecutor’s General Office of Ukraine

On March 9, during a press conference on Russian crimes in Ukraine Prosecutor General of Ukraine Iryna Venediktova stated that more than 60 children have already been killed and more than 100 were injured by the criminal actions of the Russian Federation. ""This is Russia's war against Ukrainian children,"" the Prosecutor General said.

The Prosecutor’s General Office launched criminal proceedings on the first day of the invasion for infringement on the territorial integrity and inviolability of Ukraine and for waging a war of aggression. The Russian Defense Minister, the Chief of the General Staff, the Commander of the National Guard, the Director of the Foreign Intelligence Service, the Director of the FSB, the Minister of Internal Affairs and other high-ranking Russian officials have already been reported as suspected of committing deliberate acts that resulted in the death and injury of a large number of Ukrainians.

""The courts have issued permits for their arrest. We are taking measures to put them on the international wanted list. In total, more than 40 representatives of the government and the military and political leadership of the aggressor country are now criminally prosecuted. And there will be thousands of them,"" said Iryna Venediktova.

Iryna Venediktova, Prosecutor General of Ukraine

U.S. forms mobile justice expert teams to assist Russian war crimes investigations in Ukraine.

On 9 March we met with Kristina Kvien, U.S. Charge d'Affaires a.i. in Ukraine, and John Clint Williamson, the 3rd U.S. Ambassador for War Crimes and his team.

The support from the US for Ukraine is extraordinary right now. They will now assist us in the process of documenting war crimes. Mobile teams with international humanitarian law experts and military analysts with significant experience in international courts and tribunals will assist and support Ukrainian law enforcement in evaluating the evidence collected and their legal analysis. All of them will be used by us in national and international judicial institutions.

This is yet another confirmation that the international community is united to hold the military accountable.

ENERGY

Ministry of energy of Ukraine

Information on the operation of the Ukrainian power system

The frequency in the UES of Ukraine is maintained at 50 Hz.

Over the past day, sometimes - at the cost of incredible efforts, it was managed to restore electricity to about 72 thousand consumers, gas supply - 4828 consumers.

The most successful restoration works were carried out in Sumy region: electricity supply to 62.8 thousand subscribers in 263 settlements was restored.

At the same time, according to operative information, as of 17:00 CET 9 March 2022, more than 1,250 settlements and about 11,000 transformer substations in Ukraine were left without electricity (completely or partially) due to damage caused by hostilities. In total - more than 723 thousand consumers.

The most difficult situation remains in the Donetsk region - more than 235 thousand consumers remain without electricity; Mariupol is completely disconnected from the electricity supply.

The most difficult situation with gas supply is observed in Donetsk, Chernihiv, Zaporizhzhya, Kyiv, Mykolaiv regions. In total, as of 17:00 CET 9 March, about 233 thousand consumers in Ukraine are left without gas supply.

Despite the extremely critical situation, the emergency response crews continue to repair equipment and restore power supply around the clock.

Ukrainian energy companies tirelessly support the stable operation of the energy system and, despite the risk to life, make every effort to ensure energy supply to our citizens.

Data on the operational capabilities of the Ukrainian power grid

Ukrainian power system has been operating steadily for two weeks in a row in the face of fierce attacks by Russian invaders. Despite this, the frequency in the network is 50 Hz.

Repair crews of NEC Ukrenergo and distribution system operators (Oblenergo) are repairing damaged power lines and substations as soon as possible. Thanks to the heroism and kindness of today's people in the Sumy region, the light was restored in the homes of more than 50,000 consumers, part of Chernihiv and Kharkiv were healed. The high professionalism and devotion of regional power repairmen helped to restore electricity supply in Okhtyrka, where for several days the same enemy destroyed the local Okhtyrka CHP.

Ukrainian power plants generate enough electricity to meet the needs of the consumers. If you are safe, continue to use household appliances in the usual way - there is enough electricity in Ukraine for everyone.

But, unfortunately, the aggressors continue to destroy our energy infrastructure. Due to hostilities, Chornobyl NPP and the city of Slavutych (damage to the 750 kV line Chernobyl - Kyiv) were disconnected.

The outage of the Chornobyl nuclear power plant threatens Europe with environmental catastrophe, as apart from the reactor that exploded in 1986, there are spent fuel assemblies at the territory of the plant. The cooling system cannot work there without electricity. The storages are healed by diesel generators, but it is necessary to restore the power supply to their facilities as soon as possible.

Since the time Chornobyl NPP was seized, Ukrenergo was doing everything possible to keep its power supply on one power line instead of three, and had negotiations with the aggressors about the need to repair damaged lines. Once we got the consent, and our repair crew went for an inspection, but it all ended in brutal searches, shootings over the heads of our specialists and threats of execution. The brigade was not allowed to carry out repair work.

Ukrenergo calls on the IAEA, the EU and all civilised world not to remain silent, not to ignore Russia's nuclear terrorism, which the aggressor state is now targeting against Ukraine.

According to Energoatom, all two Ukrainian nuclear power plants are operating stably, despite the fact that the Zaporizhzhya NPP is also occupied by invaders. Ukrainian specialists take care of nuclear power units, so radiation, fire and environmental conditions at nuclear power plants and adjacent territories are within the current norms.",https://smallwarsjournal.com/blog/ukraine-war-bulletin-30-march-10-1030-est

""Kyiv and Mariupol, as well as advances in Kryvyi Rih, Kremenchuk, Nikopol and Zaporizhia, remain the main areas of concentration of the enemy's efforts. Unable to achieve success, the enemy continues to carry out missile and bomb attacks on cities located deep in the territory of Ukraine - Dnipro, Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk,"" it said on Facebook.

It is noted that the Armed Forces of Ukraine inflicted significant losses on Russian troops, which forced them to retreat from the previously captured settlements of Kyiv region.

In Siverske direction, active offensive actions are not carried out by the enemy. In some areas, the enemy carried out fire raids and reconnoitred the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

According to the General Staff, the formation of enemy reserves and their transfer to the areas of combat operations on the territory of Ukraine continues, the air defense system of the occupying troops in Donetsk and Tavriyske directions is being built up.

The West ramped up economic pressure on Russia, as the U.S. and its allies downgraded Russian’s trade status — the latest in efforts to further isolate Russia for the invasion.

The war has forced more than 2.5 million people to flee Ukraine, while others seek refuge in basements, subway stations and underground shelters.

Here are some key things to know about the war:

WHAT’S HAPPENING ON THE GROUND IN UKRAINE?

Zelenskyy said the mayor of the southern port city of Melitopol was kidnapped, equating it to the actions of “ISIS terrorists.”

“They have transitioned into a new stage of terror, in which they try to physically liquidate representatives of Ukraine’s lawful local authorities,” Zelenskyy said in a video address Friday evening.

Kirill Timoshenko, the deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential office, posted a video which he said shows armed men carrying Mayor Ivan Fedorov across a square. Russian forces captured Melitopol, with a population of 150,000, on Feb. 26.

The prosecutor’s office of the Luhansk People’s Republic, a Moscow-backed rebel region in eastern Ukraine, accused Fedorov on its website of “terrorist activities.”

The Biden administration, citing undisclosed American intelligence, had warned that Russia planned to detain and kill targeted people in Ukraine.

New areas in western Ukraine came under attack Friday, as Ukrainian authorities said Russian airstrikes hit in the western cities of Ivano-Frankiivsk and Lutsk — far from Russia’s main targets elsewhere in the country.

Russia said it used long-range weapons to put military airfields in the two cities “out of action.” Lutsk Mayor Ihor Polishchuk said four servicemen were killed and another six were wounded.

New commercial satellite images appeared to show Russian artillery firing on residential areas that lie between Russian forces and the capital. The images from Maxar Technologies show muzzle flashes as well as impact craters and burning homes in the town of Moschun, outside Kyiv, the company said.

Ukrainian officials accused Russia of damaging a cancer hospital and several residential buildings in the southern city of Mykolaiv with heavy artillery.

The hospital’s chief doctor, Maksim Beznosenko, said several hundred patients were in the hospital when windows were blown out but that no one had been killed.

Russia’s Defense Ministry also said Friday that an offensive, led by fighters from the separatist-held Donetsk region, was further squeezing the southern port city of Mariupol. The Mariupol mayor’s office said Friday that the number of people killed during the 12-day siege has risen to 1,582.

Three more Russian airstrikes hit the industrial city of Dnipro in eastern Ukraine on Friday, killing at least one person, according to the Ukrainian interior ministry.

Thousands of civilians and soldiers on both sides are believed to have been killed in the invasion.

WHAT HAS THE AP DIRECTLY WITNESSED OR CONFIRMED?

More shelling and airstrikes pummeled Mariupol on Friday, leaving apartment complexes on fire as temperatures hovered around freezing. The city of 430,000 has been without food, running water and electricity for 10 days.

A newborn girl nestled against her mother after Russian airstrikes hit the Mariupol maternity hospital where the woman was to give birth. Mariana Vishegirskaya had her baby, Veronika, via cesarean section in another hospital on the city’s outskirts a day after the Wednesday attack at hospital shocked the world.

In Baryshivka, a village east of Kyiv, people surveyed damage and boarded up windows after a Russian bombing reduced a restaurant and a cinema to hanging metal, dust, glass and other debris. Ivan Merzyk, a 62-year-old resident, said: “Putin created this mess, thinking he will be in charge here. Ukrainians are a free nation. We are not going away from here and we don’t want to see any Russian here.”

WHO ARE ‘VOLUNTEER’ FIGHTERS FOR RUSSIA AND UKRAINE?

Putin approved bringing “volunteer” fighters from Syria and other countries to join Russia’s offensive. Russia’s defense minister said there had been “more than 16,000 applications” from the Middle East. He said many were from people who fought alongside Russia against the Islamic State group.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed the recruits include fighters from Syria, where Russia intervened in the civil war in 2015 on the side of President Bashar Assad.

Meanwhile, the Ukrainian government says about 20,000 foreigners have joined the so-called International Legion for the Territorial Defense of Ukraine to fight the Russians.

The pro-Ukrainian fighters are given weapons when they arrive. About 100 Americans are among the fighters. The U.K. has warned veterans not to travel to Ukraine to fight there, saying those who do will be court-martialed.

ARE PEOPLE BEING SAFELY EVACUATED FROM UKRAINE?

Ukrainian authorities said there are plans for several evacuation and humanitarian aid delivery routes. The top priority remains freeing people from the city of Mariupol and getting aid to its desperate population.

Buses were being sent Friday to multiple Kyiv suburbs to bring people to the capital, where authorities say half of the metropolitan area’s population, or around 2 million, has already fled.

There were also efforts to create new humanitarian corridors around the cities of Kherson in the south, Chernihiv in the north and Kharkiv in the east. Russian forces were blockading Kharkiv and pushing their offensive in the south around three cities and towns, including the hometown of Ukraine’s president, Kryvyi Rih.

WHAT ABOUT RUSSIA’S CLAIMS THAT BIOWEAPONS ARE BEING DEVELOPED IN UKRAINE?

Russia requested a meeting of the U.N. Security Council to discuss its baseless claims that the U.S. was conducting “biological activities” in Ukraine — an allegation that has been denied by both Washington and Kyiv.

At Friday’s meeting, the United States accused Russia of “lying and spreading disinformation” as part of a potential false-flag operation — a scenario that U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned last month could happen as Putin seeks to justify his violent attack on Ukraine. U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Friday that the U.S. believes Russia could use chemical or biological agents.

The Pentagon said Friday it supports labs in Ukraine that are devoted to identifying and responding to biological threats. The labs are owned and operated by Ukraine. The work of the labs is not secret, and experts say they are not being used for bioweapons.

China, meanwhile, is amplifying the unsubstantiated and inflammatory claims.

WHAT’S THE VIEW FROM INSIDE RUSSIA?

Moscow is making more moves to restrict access to foreign social media platforms. On Friday, Russian’s communications and media regulator said it’s blocking access to Instagram because it’s being used to call for violence against Russian soldiers.

That comes after Facebook owner, Meta Platforms, which also owns Instagram, said it had “made allowances for forms of political expression that would normally violate our rules on violent speech, such as ‘death to the Russian invaders’.” Meta’s statement stressed it would not allow credible calls for violence against Russian civilians.

Russia has already blocked access to Facebook and limited access to Twitter, but Twitter has launched a privacy-protected version of its site to bypass surveillance and censorship.

Meanwhile, YouTube started blocking global access to channels associated with Russian state-funded media, and said it is removing content about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that violates its policy about minimizing or trivializing “well-documented violent events.”

Meta has barred Russian state media from Instagram and Facebook.

ARE MORE SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA HAPPENING?

U.S. President Joe Biden announced an agreement Friday with other nations to revoke Russia’s “most favored nation” trade status, which would allow for higher tariffs to be imposed on Russian imports.

The U.S. also banned imports of Russian seafood, alcohol and diamonds.

Western nations have been largely united in punishing Russia economically.

French President Emmanuel Macron said Friday the European Union will continue applying pressure to Moscow and consider all options for more sanctions if Putin intensifies bombing and lays siege to Kyiv.

Today, March 11, is the 16th day of the Russian military attack on Ukraine. We're telling about all the current events. The article will be constantly updated.

What is today?

Key points.

Operational information as of the morning of March 11, 2022.

In the Polissia direction , the enemy is trying to break through the defenses of Ukraine's defenders in the areas of Poliske, Kukhari, Zhovtneve, Andriivka, Kopyliv, Motyzhyn, Buzova, Horenychi, Bucha, Demydiv, and block Kyiv.

In the Siverskyi direction , the enemy was stopped while trying to break through the defense of Chernihiv. Further movement of the enemy in the direction of Brovary from the east is not riled out.

In the Kharkiv direction , the enemy continues unsuccessful attempts to blockade the city from the north. Rifle regiments formed at the expense of Russian reservists were involved in the fighting in the Kharkiv region.

In the Donetsk and Tavria directions , the occupiers are concentrating their efforts on capturing the Ukrainian cities of Mariupol and Severodonetsk.

In the Pivdennyi Buh direction , the occupiers tried to gain control of Mykolaiv and develop an offensive in the directions of Zaporizhzhia and Kryvyi Rih. The Russian occupiers were stopped, demoralized, and suffered heavy losses.

In the Kherson region in the temporarily occupied settlements, the enemy is trying to establish an administrative-police regime.

The aggressor's losses are growing!

The EU Council recognized Russia's ""special operation"" in Ukraine as war and called Belarus an accomplice. The EU promises to further increase sanctions on Russia and Belarus.

The Russian Armed Forces have launched 775 missiles of ""all colors and all types"" since the invasion of Ukraine, a senior US State Department official told CNN.

The seized $415 billion of Russia's reserves will be used to compensate Ukraine: the Cabinet of Ministers and other governments are looking for a mechanism to transfer to Ukraine the seized gold and foreign exchange reserves of the Central Bank, said First Deputy Economy Minister Denys Kudin.

A free transfer from Odesa to Moldova will be organized on March 12. This was reported in the press service of the Odesa regional organization of the Red Cross of Ukraine.

Chemical and biological threat

Russian media report that Russia has invited a meeting of the UN Security Council on US military-biological programs in Ukraine.

The President of Ukraine has already said in this regard: ""I am the President of an adequate country and an adequate people. And the father of two children. No chemical or any other weapons of mass destruction have been developed on my land. The entire world knows this. And if Russia does something similar against us, it will receive the harshest sanctions response,"" Zelenskyy promised in his address.

On March 8, graduates of the Moscow State University's bio faculty refuted their country's fake statement about ""biological weapons"" in Ukraine. ""The list of destroyed strains published by RIA Novosti and other Russian media outlets does not include any that are particularly dangerous. The list includes only strains common to microbiological and even epidemiological laboratories. General Konashenkov's statement about the existence of documented strains of 'plague, anthrax, tularemia, cholera' is pure fiction. The absolutely wild idea of ​​the existence of a special 'DNA of the Slavs, against whom special biological weapons were to be used,' according to Russian media, is a delusion for anyone who has studied a school biology course.

Such statements resonate with the theories of the German National Socialists with their cult of the 'Aryan higher race.' We demand to stop false statements about allegedly found evidence of the development of biological weapons in Ukrainian laboratories.""

Meanwhile, the WHO recommends that Ukraine destroy high-risk pathogens in medical laboratories to prevent spills.

Nuclear energy and facilities

Ukraine completely refuses to purchase Russian nuclear fuel, Energoatom says.

The nuclear subcritical unit, Neutron Source, which is located in the Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology in Piatyhatki, was blacked out as a result of shelling by Russian troops, according to the State Inspectorate for Nuclear Regulation of Ukraine.

It is impossible to deliver spare parts, equipment, and specialized personnel to the Zaporizhzhia NPP, which was captured by the Russians, to carry out scheduled repairs. Maintenance of Unit 1 has been reduced to the minimum allowable level, said IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi.

Importantly! According to available information, Putin ordered the preparation of a terrorist attack at the Chornobyl nuclear power plant. The Defense Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warns about it.

In the Russian-controlled Chornobyl nuclear power plant, Russian troops plan to create a man-made catastrophe, for which the occupiers will try to shift responsibility to Ukraine. Currently, the Chornobyl nuclear power plant is completely disconnected from the monitoring systems of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The station is blacked out. The service life of the available diesel generators is designed for 48 hours of maintenance of safety systems.

The occupiers refuse to grant access to the station to Ukrainian repairmen. Instead, ""Belarusian specialists"" went there on the instructions of Aleksandr Lukashenko. Among them, under the guise of nuclear power plants, Russian saboteurs also come to organize a terrorist attack.

To imitate the involvement of the Ukrainian military in the Chornobyl accident, the occupiers are trying to create fake ""evidence"" to confirm their version. In particular, Russian car refrigerators collecting the bodies of dead Ukrainian defenders were spotted near the Antonov airport in Hostomel. There is a possibility that they will be played off as saboteurs in the Chornobyl zone.

18:00 – Chornobyl NPP managed to provide an additional supply of diesel fuel for power plants that provide emergency power supply to spent nuclear fuel storage facilities, according to the State Inspectorate for Nuclear Regulation. Attempts are being made to restore the station's external power supply.

22:00 – Russian fascists use Zaporizhzhia NPP as a military base, Energoatom states.

Who's coming to Ukraine?

About financial aid, weapons, and volunteer fighters

Forty Republican senators are demanding that the Biden administration allow the transfer of Polish MiG-29 fighters to Ukraine.

The US Senate approved the allocation of $13.6 million to help Ukraine. About half of this amount is spent on arming and equipping Ukraine, as well as the Pentagon's spending on sending US troops to other Eastern European countries. The rest of the money should go to humanitarian and economic aid, strengthening Allied defenses in the region, and protecting their energy and cybersecurity needs. The bill has now been submitted to President Joe Biden for signature.

American actress Mila Kunis and her husband and actor Ashton Kutcher raised $20 million for Ukrainians in a week.

""Thank you to everyone who helped us raise $20 million in less than a week. We can do it. We can hit our target. Together. Because we are with Ukraine,"" Kutcher wrote on social media.

Unfortunately, there is no ""accelerated"" procedure for joining the EU for Ukraine, although many have already written about it. The Chancellor of Germany and the Prime Minister of the Netherlands have already spoken publicly about the impossibility of such a procedure. But even without it, Ukraine has never been so close to joining the EU.

Ukraine's membership in the EU remains a matter of time and no more.

Foreign Minister Kuleba is convinced that Ukraine will 100% join the ranks of the European Union.

Aleksandr Lukashenko flew to Moscow for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss, in particular, the war in Ukraine.

While the mustached man is voyaging, banks in Belarus refuse to accept Russian rubles. And in some Belarusian currency exchange offices, the purchase of Russian money has stopped altogether.

At a meeting with Putin, Lukashenko said that ""by the end of the year, people will forget about the conflict in Ukraine."" Don't even hope. Nobody will forget anything, neither Mariupol, nor Kharkiv, nor Kyiv region. Neither millions of refugees nor thousands, killed and wounded by the criminal racist regime.

The command of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine also reported the shelling of the settlements of Bukhlychi and Verkhniy Terebezhiv in Belarus.

It is impossible to read the comments of Russians under the photos of the bombed maternity hospital. They are so imbued with cynicism and hatred. These people really live in a distorted world and consider all the horrors of the war in Ukraine to be propaganda staging.

Last night Marianna gave birth to a baby girl. All is well with the child, we wish Marianna and her daughter good health and peace!

7,fea49e97-7dcb-4df2-955f-570c0852d792,"['Abc News', 'The Associated Press', 'March']",,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused Russia of kidnapping the mayor of a city, calling the abduction “a new stage of terror.”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia on Saturday of kidnapping the mayor of a city, calling it “a new stage of terror.” Russian forces expanded their offensive in Ukraine, hitting new areas in the country's west.

The West ramped up economic pressure on Russia, as the U.S. and its allies downgraded Russian's trade status — the latest in efforts to further isolate Russia for the invasion.

The war has forced more than 2.5 million people to flee Ukraine, while others seek refuge in basements, subway stations and underground shelters.

Here are some key things to know about the war:

WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE GROUND IN UKRAINE?

Zelenskyy said the mayor of the southern port city of Melitopol was kidnapped, equating it to the actions of “ISIS terrorists.”

“They have transitioned into a new stage of terror, in which they try to physically liquidate representatives of Ukraine’s lawful local authorities,” Zelenskyy said in a video address Friday evening.

Kirill Timoshenko, the deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential office, posted a video which he said shows armed men carrying Mayor Ivan Fedorov across a square. Russian forces captured Melitopol, with a population of 150,000, on Feb. 26.

The prosecutor’s office of the Luhansk People’s Republic, a Moscow-backed rebel region in eastern Ukraine, accused Fedorov on its website of “terrorist activities.”

The Biden administration, citing undisclosed American intelligence, had warned that Russia planned to detain and kill targeted people in Ukraine.

New areas in western Ukraine came under attack Friday, as Ukrainian authorities said Russian airstrikes hit in the western cities of Ivano-Frankiivsk and Lutsk — far from Russia’s main targets elsewhere in the country.

Russia said it used long-range weapons to put military airfields in the two cities “out of action."" Lutsk Mayor Ihor Polishchuk said four servicemen were killed and another six were wounded.

New commercial satellite images appeared to show Russian artillery firing on residential areas that lie between Russian forces and the capital. The images from Maxar Technologies show muzzle flashes as well as impact craters and burning homes in the town of Moschun, outside Kyiv, the company said.

Ukrainian officials accused Russia of damaging a cancer hospital and several residential buildings in the southern city of Mykolaiv with heavy artillery.

The hospital’s chief doctor, Maksim Beznosenko, said several hundred patients were in the hospital when windows were blown out but that no one had been killed.

Russia’s Defense Ministry also said Friday that an offensive, led by fighters from the separatist-held Donetsk region, was further squeezing the southern port city of Mariupol. The Mariupol mayor’s office said Friday that the number of people killed during the 12-day siege has risen to 1,582.

Three more Russian airstrikes hit the industrial city of Dnipro in eastern Ukraine on Friday, killing at least one person, according to the Ukrainian interior ministry.

Thousands of civilians and soldiers on both sides are believed to have been killed in the invasion.

WHAT HAS THE AP DIRECTLY WITNESSED OR CONFIRMED?

More shelling and airstrikes pummeled Mariupol on Friday, leaving apartment complexes on fire as temperatures hovered around freezing. The city of 430,000 has been without food, running water and electricity for 10 days.

A newborn girl nestled against her mother after Russian airstrikes hit the Mariupol maternity hospital where the woman was to give birth. Mariana Vishegirskaya had her baby, Veronika, via cesarean section in another hospital on the city's outskirts a day after the Wednesday attack at hospital shocked the world.

In Baryshivka, a village east of Kyiv, people surveyed damage and boarded up windows after a Russian bombing reduced a restaurant and a cinema to hanging metal, dust, glass and other debris. Ivan Merzyk, a 62-year-old resident, said: “Putin created this mess, thinking he will be in charge here. Ukrainians are a free nation. We are not going away from here and we don’t want to see any Russian here.""

WHO ARE ‘VOLUNTEER’ FIGHTERS FOR RUSSIA AND UKRAINE?

Putin approved bringing “volunteer” fighters from Syria and other countries to join Russia’s offensive. Russia's defense minister said there had been “more than 16,000 applications” from the Middle East. He said many were from people who fought alongside Russia against the Islamic State group.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed the recruits include fighters from Syria, where Russia intervened in the civil war in 2015 on the side of President Bashar Assad.

Meanwhile, the Ukrainian government says about 20,000 foreigners have joined the so-called International Legion for the Territorial Defense of Ukraine to fight the Russians.

The pro-Ukrainian fighters are given weapons when they arrive. About 100 Americans are among the fighters. The U.K. has warned veterans not to travel to Ukraine to fight there, saying those who do will be court-martialed.

ARE PEOPLE BEING SAFELY EVACUATED FROM UKRAINE?

Ukrainian authorities said there are plans for several evacuation and humanitarian aid delivery routes. The top priority remains freeing people from the city of Mariupol and getting aid to its desperate population.

Buses were being sent Friday to multiple Kyiv suburbs to bring people to the capital, where authorities say half of the metropolitan area's population, or around 2 million, has already fled.

There were also efforts to create new humanitarian corridors around the cities of Kherson in the south, Chernihiv in the north and Kharkiv in the east. Russian forces were blockading Kharkiv and pushing their offensive in the south around three cities and towns, including the hometown of Ukraine’s president, Kryvyi Rih.

WHAT ABOUT RUSSIA’S CLAIMS THAT BIOWEAPONS ARE BEING DEVELOPED IN UKRAINE?

Russia requested a meeting of the U.N. Security Council to discuss its baseless claims that the U.S. was conducting “biological activities” in Ukraine — an allegation that has been denied by both Washington and Kyiv.

At Friday's meeting, the United States accused Russia of “lying and spreading disinformation” as part of a potential false-flag operation — a scenario that U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned last month could happen as Putin seeks to justify his violent attack on Ukraine. U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Friday that the U.S. believes Russia could use chemical or biological agents.

The Pentagon said Friday it supports labs in Ukraine that are devoted to identifying and responding to biological threats. The labs are owned and operated by Ukraine. The work of the labs is not secret, and experts say they are not being used for bioweapons.

China, meanwhile, is amplifying the unsubstantiated and inflammatory claims.

WHAT'S THE VIEW FROM INSIDE RUSSIA?

Moscow is making more moves to restrict access to foreign social media platforms. On Friday, Russian's communications and media regulator said it's blocking access to Instagram because it’s being used to call for violence against Russian soldiers.

That comes after Facebook owner, Meta Platforms, which also owns Instagram, said it had “made allowances for forms of political expression that would normally violate our rules on violent speech, such as ‘death to the Russian invaders’.” Meta's statement stressed it would not allow credible calls for violence against Russian civilians.

Russia has already blocked access to Facebook and limited access to Twitter, but Twitter has launched a privacy-protected version of its site to bypass surveillance and censorship.

Meanwhile, YouTube started blocking global access to channels associated with Russian state-funded media, and said it is removing content about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that violates its policy about minimizing or trivializing ""well-documented violent events.”

Meta has barred Russian state media from Instagram and Facebook.

ARE MORE SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA HAPPENING?

U.S. President Joe Biden announced an agreement Friday with other nations to revoke Russia’s “most favored nation” trade status, which would allow for higher tariffs to be imposed on Russian imports.

The U.S. also banned imports of Russian seafood, alcohol and diamonds.

Western nations have been largely united in punishing Russia economically.

French President Emmanuel Macron said Friday the European Union will continue applying pressure to Moscow and consider all options for more sanctions if Putin intensifies bombing and lays siege to Kyiv.
