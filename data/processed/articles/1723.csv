“The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride,” Zelensky said, The Associated Press reported, citing a senior American intelligence official with direct knowledge of the conversation.

Zelensky, 44, instead chose to remain in Ukraine’s capital as Russian forces brought the fight to the city streets, where gunfire and explosions were heard overnight Friday into Saturday.

The besieged president said his family had been evacuated to safety.

“I am staying in the government quarters together with others,” Zelensky said in a video address early on Friday. “The enemy has designated me as target number one, and my family as target number two.”

Zelensky addressed his countrymen again on Friday night, telling them to brace for an overnight assault and urging unity and strength.

“The fate of Ukraine is being decided right now,” Zelensky said in the video. “This night will be very difficult, and the enemy will use all available forces to break the resistance of Ukrainians.”

“We can’t lose the capital,” he added, emphatically.

Zelensky, a former actor and comedian, has lead a considerable defense against the Russian incursion so far, slowing down the Russian advance, according to US defense officials. However, there is concern that could change quickly.

Russian troops attacked Kyiv from several directions, encircling the city of about 2.8 million.

The Ukrainian Armed Forces said “active combat” was taking place in Kyiv, as Russian forces tried to push toward the city center and faced heavy resistance from Ukrainian fighters.

Hundreds of casualties have been reported following intense fighting both within and around the city, however the Ukrainian forces appeared to have held onto the capital as of early Saturday, according to officials.

“We are stopping the horde as best as we can, the situation in Kyiv is under the control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and our citizens,” Security Council Secretary Danilov said on Saturday morning, according to the Kyiv Independent.

Zelensky also posted another video address from Kyiv on Saturday morning, in which he vowed to defend his country.

“There’s a lot of fake information online that I call on our army to lay down arms, and that there’s evacuation,” he said, according to a translation by the Kyiv Independent.

“I’m here. We won’t lay down our arms. We will defend our state.”

It was also revealed that Zelensky was given the option to evacuate from Kyiv at the behest of the U.S. government.

According to the Associated Press and other wires, Zelensky said in response to the offer:

""The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride”

A senior US official with direct knowledge of the conversation also described Zelensky as upbeat.

Zelensky had previously debunked Russian propaganda that he has fled the capital Kyiv by defiantly posting a video of him and his team standing out on the city streets at night.

More recently, he posted yet another video of him debunking false rumours that Ukraine is laying down arms.

Instead of moving to one of his bunkers for protection, he decided to leaad the fight from the frontlines and quickly became a folk hero for all Ukrainian citizens. Joining other great heroes of these tourbling times for the country such as the 'Ghost of Kyiv' or the 'Ukrainian Reaper', Zelensky also has a few interesting anecdotes to tell from his busy night in Kyiv. As the attackes kept coming from all fronts, it was clear that Vladimir Putin's main intention is to take the capital and capture Zelensky. Every other Government who is considered a Ukraine ally seemed Zelensky's decision to stay and fight as a major risk. But the president refused to flee, he wanted to stay and defend his country alongside his fellow citizens.

In the first reports from the media, it was stated that the United States offered to extract Zelensky from Kyiv but he immediately refused. After the entire night fighting off the opposition, there was a second and far more interesting report from him. AP took a direct quote from a U.S. official who offered this idea to the president. Zelensky was pretty clear in his response after their offered to extract him again: ""The fight is here. I need ammunition, not a ride,"" said the brave Ukrainian president. After the sun started to show, there was still heavy fighting in the streets of Ukraine but Zelensky and his fellow citizens managed to protect themselves from this first barrage of attacks. Many differente reports started coming from all over the place.

Zelensky shows his face after the fight.

Amid a lot of reports from Russia about Ukraine allegedly laying down their arms, president Zelensky decided to upload a new video on his Twitter account where he tells the truth. In the image, we can see a man who is tired of fighting all night but calm and relaxed. Here's the translation of what he says: ""There's a lot of fake information online that I call on our army to lay down arms, and that there's evacuation. I'm here. We won't lay down our arms. We will defend our state."" What ever happens to Ukraine after a few days of fighting, tonight will forever be remembered as the night in which Ukraine's heroes defended their homeland.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told President Joe Biden 'I need ammunition, not a ride,' when offered the chance of a US-backed evacuation.

Zelensky said in response to the offer of refuge: 'The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride,' according to a senior American intelligence official with direct knowledge of the conversation, who described Zelensky as upbeat.

Invading Russian forces closed in on Ukraine´s capital on Saturday, in an apparent encircling movement after a barrage of airstrikes on cities and military bases around the country.

A second Russian Ilyushin Il-76 military transport plane was shot down near Bila Tserkva, 50 miles south of Kyiv, according to two American officials with direct knowledge of conditions on the ground in Ukraine. Each of the two planes can carry up to 200 troops, although a death toll has not been shared.

Earlier, Zelensky said in a televised speech: 'This night they will launch an assault. The enemy will use all of their power on all fronts to break our defense. This night we have to stand our ground. The fate of Ukraine is being decided now.'

This came after a video showed him in his military tent drinking coffee with his men, he personally coordinated the defense of Kyiv.

He spoke Saturday morning in Kyiv, having survived the night, and said: 'There's a lot of fake news online that I called on our army to lay down arms, & that there's evacuation. I'm here. We will defend our state.'

On Friday night, Biden traveled home to Delaware for a weekend break as Ukraine burned after Russia invaded and the United States was condemned for appearing weak.

The president and First Lady Jill Biden were snapped exiting the White House on Friday evening to board their Marine One helicopter as Europe faces its biggest conflict since World War Two.

Biden has access to technology that allows him to work from his luxury home in Rehoboth Beach, and will be following the latest developments in Ukraine from there.

But critics will likely ask whether Biden should remain at the White House to help project the power and authority that comes with his office during a time that has left many across the United States and the wider world fearful for their safety.

The United States has imposed a raft of punitive financial sanctions against Russia in a bid to try and deter Vladimir Putin from continuing to invade Ukraine.

But thus far, the Russian premier - whose personal fortune has been estimated by Forbes to sit at $200 billion - has not been deterred.

The US has provided Ukraine with considerable military hardware, and thus far Zelensky's forces appear to have slowed the Russian onslaught.

But Kremlin troops had entered Ukraine in the early hours of Saturday morning, and it is feared the capital city could fall to Putin later on Saturday.

Pentagon efforts to try and stop the war from flaring were slick but ultimately unsuccessful.

US intelligence on Russian troops' movements ahead of the invasion was shared far more freely than normal, in an attempt to spook Putin.

America also warned of the sanctions Russia would face if Putin did invade, but the image-obsessed Russian leader ultimately decided to plow on anyway.

President Biden left for Delaware hours after the White House announced he is planning to impose sanctions directly on Vladimir Putin, the White House announced on Friday.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov will also be targeted.

The European Union and the United Kingdom announced they would introduce sanctions targeting Putin and Lavrov on Friday.

'In alignment with the decision by our European allies, the United States will join them in sanctioning President Putin and Foreign Minister Lavrov and members of the Russian national security team,' White House press secretary Jen Psaki said at her press briefing.

She said a travel ban 'would be a part of the US component' in sanctions on Putin and Lavrov.

Putin will become the highest target to be hit after the White House imposed measures on multiple Russian banks and oligarchs. Biden had been under pressure to target Putin personally for his attack on Ukraine.

The move will be largely symbolic as it remains unclear where Putin's money is and how much there is of it.

Their chopper took off into the mild Washington evening and flew over the iconic Washington monument.

Bloomberg notes Putin's latest financial disclosure reveals that his annual income is about 10 million rubles ($120,050), and he owns three cars and an apartment.

But there are also reports Putin owns a superyacht worth $100 million. And that his estimated worth is $200 billion.

Earlier Friday, Biden spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for about 40 minutes.

Zelensky said the two men discussed stronger sanctions on Russia and more support from the United States.

'Strengthening sanctions, concrete defense assistance and an anti-war coalition have just been discussed with @POTUS. Grateful to [United States] for the strong support to [Ukraine]!,' he wrote on Twitter.

Zelensky had pushed for Putin to be directly sanctioned.

The Ukrainian president took to the streets of Kyiv to say 'we are still here' while Ukrainian forces slowed down Russian advances and civilians took up arms to fight for the capital Kyiv.

Zelensky had been critical of a lack of support from the United States and its allies. He was also battling a Russian-disinformation campaign that he had fled Kyiv.

'We are here. We are in Kyiv. We are defending Ukraine,' Zelensky said in a video posted to Facebook. He spoke in the streets of Kyiv, the night sky visible behind him.

It's unclear what kind of support Biden offered to Zelensky, who said he is 'target number one' for Russian assassins and his wife and children are 'number two.'

There are fears he may be assassinated and replaced by a Putin puppet.

Before the phone call, Biden met virtually with fellow NATO members on Friday morning to reassure eastern allies they will be protected as Russian troops prepared to enter Kyiv.

U.S. intelligence officials are worried the Ukrainian capital could fall within days, CNN reported, as Russian forces are within 20 miles of its location and residents are being urged to make Molotov cocktails to help defend the city.

Amid reports the Kremlin is gunning for him, Zelensky had slammed the United States and its allies for leaving his country to fight alone.

'Who is ready to fight alongside us? I don't see anyone,' he said on Thursday night. 'Who is ready to give Ukraine a guarantee of NATO membership? Everyone is afraid.'

'We're defending our country alone. The most powerful forces in the world are watching this from a distance,' Zelensky said.

After the meeting, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the 30-nation organization will send parts of the NATO Response Force and elements of a quickly deployable spearhead unit to the alliance´s eastern flank. It´s the first time the force has been used to defend NATO allies.

'We are now deploying the NATO Response Force for the first time in a collective defense context. We speak about thousands of troops. We speak about air and maritime capabilities,' Stoltenberg said.

Ukraine´s military said it had shot down a Russian military transport plane with paratroopers on board.

According to a statement from the military´s General Staff, the first Il-76 heavy transport plane was shot down near Vasylkiv, a city 25 miles south of Kyiv. The Russian military has not commented on either incident so far, and the reports could not be immediately verified.

Kyiv officials are warning residents that street fighting is underway against Russian forces, and they are urging people to seek shelter.

The warning issued Saturday advised residents to remain in shelters, to avoid going near windows or on balconies, and to take precautions against being hit by debris or bullets.

The Ukrainian military said a battle was underway near a military unit to the west of the city center.

Kyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko said new explosions shook the area near a major power plant that the Russians were trying to attack.

Zelenskyy has released a video of himself and his senior aides earlier in Kyiv to reassure the nation as Russian troops were closing in on the capital.

In the video Zelenskyy recorded in the street outside the presidential office, he said he and his top officials are staying in the capital.

'Our troops are here, citizens are here,' Zelenskyy said, adding that 'All of us are here protecting our independence of our country. And it will continue to be this way. Glory to our defenders, Glory to Ukraine, Glory to Heroes.'

Russian troops bore down on Ukraine´s capital Friday, with gunfire and explosions resonating ever closer to the government quarter.

In the fog of war, it was unclear how much of Ukraine remains under Ukrainian control and how much or little Russian forces have seized. The Kremlin accepted Kyiv´s offer to hold talks, but it appeared to be an effort to squeeze concessions out of Ukraine´s embattled president instead of a gesture toward a diplomatic solution.",https://knews.kathimerini.com.cy/en/news/i-need-ammunition-not-a-ride-zelensky-blasts-biden-for-offering-to-evacuate-him-from-kyiv
5,e1218d14-37dd-427d-aca4-918fce568d55,['Luke Harding'],2022-02-26,"He looked gaunt and unshaven after another sleepless night under Russian attack and bombardment. But Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, struck a defiant tone in a video address on Saturday morning. “I’m here,” he said simply. And he was – in the centre of Kyiv, three days on from Vladimir Putin’s invasion, unbowed and going nowhere.

“Good morning everybody! Ukrainians: there’s a lot of fake information online that I call on our army to lay down arms, and that there’s an evacuation,” he said. “I’m here. We won’t lay down our arms. We will defend our state, our territory, our Ukraine, our children. That’s all I have to say. Glory to Ukraine!”

Zelenskiy had chosen a backdrop for his Telegram channel video: the capital’s House of Chimeras. The art nouveau building designed by the Polish architect Władysław Horodecki is immediately identifiable. It boasts mythical figures and elephant-head gargoyles. The address – Bankova – is Ukraine’s equivalent of Downing Street.

A hundred metres down the road is the presidential administration building. Zelenskiy had made another video address on Friday night, accompanied by his defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, the country’s PM, Denys Shmyhal, and senior advisers. “I am staying in the government quarters together with others,” he said.

He told his compatriots that it was likely to be another bruising night, as Russian forces tried to encircle and to seize Kyiv. “The enemy has designated me as target number one, and my family as target number two,” he said, urging citizens to resist with unity and strength.

The longer Zelenskiy manages to hold out, the more heroic a figure he appears, at least in the eyes of a growing number of Ukrainians. “I didn’t like him before and didn’t vote for him. But I now see him with new respect,” Olga Bileychuk said, speaking from the western city of Lviv. “He’s doing a good job.”

Kristina Berdynskykh, one of Ukraine’s top journalists, was also praising. “I have a lot of complaints against Zelenskiy over his domestic politics. But the way he behaves during the offensive of absolute evil against Ukraine is real political leadership and tremendous courage,” she tweeted late on Friday.

Zelenskiy, a former TV actor and comedian, won a landslide victory in the spring 2019 presidential election. He promised to bring peace to the east of the country and to negotiate with Putin. Three years later he finds himself at war with Russia and leading an against-the-odds struggle against Kremlin occupation and national extinction.

In the run-up to this week’s invasion, Zelenskiy’s ratings had fallen. One critique was that he had lagged behind events – offering to declare Ukraine a neutral country, for example, once it was too late and Russian bombs were already falling. There were disagreements with the international community too over the threat from Moscow.

For weeks, the Biden administration warned that Putin had assembled an invasion force on Ukraine’s borders and was preparing to go in. Zelenskiy demurred. He shrugged off predictions of doom and criticised London and Washington for removing their diplomats to Lviv. There was no reason to panic, he said.

“He’s always two or three steps behind what is happening. He can’t get out of his square box,” one former senior government official said. “It’s like it’s theatre, not fact. The situation is life and death, a real tragedy for thousands of people.” Zelenskiy’s chief of staff, Andrii Yermak, advised him badly, the official added.

And yet Zelenskiy has behaved with courage and extraordinary resilience in the dark hours since Russia’s military offensive began at 5am on Thursday. The US government and, according to sources, Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, have offered to get Zelenskiy out of Ukraine to prevent his capture by Russians. He has refused to go.

“The fight is here. I need ammunition, not a ride,” Zelenskiy said, according to US intelligence officials quoted in the Washington Post. The answer suggests the president has not lost his sense of humour, visible in his recent iPhone videos, delivered with a weary smile. His family has been taken to a place of safety, he said on Friday.

01:18 Kyiv apartment building hit as Ukrainians fight off Russian attacks – video report

Zelenskiy’s fate over the coming days is grimly uncertain. There is no doubt that Putin is determined to capture Kyiv and to remove Zelenskiy’s pro-western and pro-Nato administration. Moscow’s apparent goal is to install a Russian puppet regime, as in separatist Donetsk, and to annex de facto a vast area that Putin considers to be “historical Russia”.

When he sent in the tanks this week, Putin claimed he was undertaking a mission to “demilitarise and denazify” Ukraine. On Friday Putin called Ukraine’s leaders fascists and drug addicts. Ever since the Maidan uprising in 2014 against the then president, Viktor Yanukovych, Kremlin state channels have suggested the country is run by far-right extremists.

The claim is ridiculous. Zelenskiy is a native Russian speaker – something he showed off in his moving address to the Russian people on Wednesday evening, hours before the invasion began. He is also Jewish. He lost relatives in the Holocaust and his grandfather fought against Hitler. His friends and senior advisers come from TV show business.

For now, at least, Zelenskiy appears buoyant. In his video address on Saturday he said Ukraine had successfully fought off “enemy attacks”. “We are defending our country, our land,” he said, pointing out that Kyiv remained under government control. “The occupiers wanted to capture our capital and install their puppets like Donetsk. We broke their idea.”

He added: “I want everyone in Russia to hear me. Everybody. Hundreds of captured soldiers who are here in Ukraine don’t know why they were sent here to kill people or be killed. People need to tell the government why the war has to be stopped, more people from your country will stay alive.”

Kremlin brute force and air power may yet prevail. But Zelenskiy has already earned his place in history, as the leader of nation under fire, fighting for its survival.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/26/volodymyr-zelenskiy-ukraine-stands-defiant-in-face-of-russian-attack

Though death and destruction has abounded, it hasn’t gone as smoothly Putin may have expected. Soldiers have been met with strong Ukrainian resistance, not to mention denouncements from world leaders. Even as Russian forces entered the nation’s capital of Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has refused to stand down, even turning down an offer from U.S. President Joe Biden to help him evacuate.

Late last week US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said that Zelenskyy remains a “prime target for Russian aggression.” But this hasn’t scared Zelenskyy off. According to the Ukraine embassy in Britain, when the U.S. offered to swoop him out of Kyiv, he declined the offer. “The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride,” he reportedly responded.

Zelenskyy doubled down in a video posted on Twitter Saturday, which saw the president standing defiant in the nation’s populated city. “I’m here. We are not putting down any arms. We will protect our country, because our weapons are our truth,” he said. “That is it. That’s all I wanted to tell you. Glory to Ukraine.”

Zelenskyy’s bravery was praised on social media.

Meanwhile, former president Trump — whose attempts to allegedly pressure Zelenskyy into snooping on Joe Biden led to his first impeachment — has called Putin’s invasion “genius.” Tucker Carlson has also carried his water while others try to make bizarre arguments blaming this all on Biden.

7,e1218d14-37dd-427d-aca4-918fce568d55,['Russian State-Owned Media'],,"Russia ramped up its anti-Ukraine disinformation after President Vladimir Putin ordered his armed forces to attack. One triumphal piece by state-owned RIA Novosti news, two days into the invasion, even proclaimed Ukraine’s unconditional surrender. “Ukraine has returned to Russia,” it said.

The piece was later deleted.

In the fusillade of falsehoods from the Kremlin, one target stands out – Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukraine president whose charismatic effort to rally his country has won global renown. A far different Zelenskyy is portrayed in the Russian media.

The Kremlin's Zelenskyy is weak, a coward and untrustworthy, a mentally unstable leader who has betrayed the Ukrainian people.

According to the Russian state media, the West is disappointed in Zelenskyy and wants to replace him. At the same time, various Russian state media report that the West won’t let Zelenskyy flee, that the West has abandoned him, and that he has abandoned Ukraine and fled to Poland or elsewhere.

The reports are all false, as anyone following independent media reports of the war and Zelenskyy’s actions have seen. In fact, Zelenskyy famously declined a U.S. offer to provide a safe exit, saying: “I don’t need a ride; I need ammunition.”

In Russian media, the stream of falsehoods never ends.

In one of the most outrageous, Vyacheslav Volodin, the chairman of the Russian state Duma (lower House) said on February 26: “All videos Zelenskyy has been posting on social media from Kyiv have been pre-recorded,” and that Zelenskyy, who is Jewish, “is actually hiding under the protection of Nazi guards.”

Since the attack began, Zelenskyy has posted regular video updates on his Telegram channel. On February 26, he appeared in front of a building in Kyiv that has been identified as next to the presidential office.

""There's a lot of fake information online that I call on our army to lay down arms, and that there's evacuation,"" Zelenskyy said. ""I'm here. We won't lay down our arms. We will defend our country.""

Polygraph.info extracted the metadata from the February 26 video, and the creation date showed December 31, 1903, likely for security reasons. Zelenskyy has said he is the No. 1 target of the Russian forces. Western officials say Putin’s plan is to remove him and insert a puppet government. Zelenskyy has acknowledged danger but insisted he has no plans to leave.

Citing intelligence sources, the U.K. newspaper The Times reported February 28 that 400 Russian mercenaries are operating in Kyiv with orders to assassinate Zelenskyy.

The Russian tanks and missile launchers that rolled into Ukraine are marked with a large, white letter “Z” inside a square box. The mysterious sign has prompted fervid speculation on social media that it stood for Zelenskyy and signified his doom.

But writing in Tablet Magazine on February 28, author and filmmaker Bernard-Henri Lévy recounted Zelenskyy’s transformation from a stand-up comic to political novice, to president to a historic figure who may reshape Europe. In “Ukraine’s Hero President Z.”, Lévy offers this explanation:

“This man who prefers to die fighting than to suffer the dishonor of forced surrender, this comedian who yesterday seemed to say, ‘all is lost except honor,’ but who, this morning, after another night of bombings, finds the inner strength to inspire his people, and to tell them they are still free, is Putin’s nightmare.”",https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-zelenskyy-ru/31728916.html

Kramer']",2022-02-25,"KYIV, Ukraine — The Ukrainian defense forces, outmanned and outgunned, waged a ferocious resistance to the Russian invasion on Saturday, battling to keep control of the capital, Kyiv, and other cities around the country.

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine posted a video on Twitter, telling the public not to believe false reports.

He was alive. Kyiv had not fallen. Any reports of Ukraine laying down its arms was a lie, Mr. Zelensky said.

“I’m here,” he said. “We are not putting down any arms. We will protect our country, because our weapons are our truth. The truth is that this is our land, our country, our children, and we will protect them all.”

“That is it. That’s what I wanted to tell you. Glory to Ukraine.”

His comments, released before 9 a.m., came as fighting intensified in Kyiv. What until three days ago had been a thriving European metropolis has been transformed into a battle zone. Russian troops pressed in from all directions.

There was intense street fighting, and bursts of gunfire and explosions could be heard across the city, including its heart, Maidan square, where in 2014 Ukrainian protests led to the toppling of a pro-Moscow government.

The Russian military has a decisive edge in cyberwarfare, tanks, heavy weaponry, missiles, fighter planes and warships. In sheer numbers, its military dwarfs that of Ukraine.

Russia has established attack lines into three cities — Kyiv in the north, Kharkiv in the northeast and Kherson in the south — and Ukrainian troops are fighting to hold all three. The Pentagon reported late Friday that the Russians did not appear to be in control of a single major population center. Significantly, a senior U.S. defense official said, Ukrainian command and control remains intact.

The Ukrainian government reported that hundreds of Russian soldiers had been killed in the war, along with scores of their own soldiers, while the Russian defense ministry issued a statement on Saturday morning that made no mention of any casualties or anything about the fight for Kyiv.

The Russian invasion started with targeted airstrikes before dawn on Thursday, but on the third day of the war, bloody battles were often being waged in close quarters. Ukrainska Pravda, a Ukrainian news site, citing witnesses, reported combat 400 yards from Maidan Square in central Kyiv.

All Ukrainian men of fighting are being drafted into service, and tens of thousands are signing up. Ukrainians were asked to make Molotov cocktails. And there were tearful scenes at airports in western Ukraine as wives kissed their husbands goodbye before they headed to front.

The nation has rallied around its president, Mr. Zelensky, a former comedian.

To him and other officials, the objective of the Russian invasion of a neighboring country that possessed no military threat is to topple the government.

Mr. Zelensky has said that he is “target no. 1.”

As battles were waged around the city on Saturday morning, there were reports of clashes near the city’s train station and along a central thoroughfare, Bohdan Khmelnitsky Street, leading from Victory Square toward the city center, according to the witness accounts. Along that street, closer to the city center, bursts of gunfire could be heard through the night.

“We are stopping the horde, so far as we can,” the secretary of the Ukrainian Security and Defense Council, Oleksy Danilov, said around 7 a.m. “The situation is under control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and citizens of Kyiv.”

In dozens of interviews in the tense hours before the invasion and in the days after, Ukrainians struggled to understand how a country at peace so suddenly found itself at war. For many Ukrainians, the answer was found in Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin.

This is Mr. Putin’s war. But what frightened people perhaps as much as the threat of missiles and bombs was that they did not know what he wanted.

The fear was evident in the drive from Kyiv to a small village outside the city. Military convoys had replaced families going on vacation or visiting friends. Where once Kyiv was known as a city where the music played a touch too loud in its cafes, the incessant wail of air raid sirens drowned out all joy.

The fear was evident in the faces of the people seeking safety in Western Ukraine, after they emerged from 20-hour train rides in packed carriages that were kept pitch-black to avoid being targeting by Russian rockets.

From Lviv in the west to Odessa in the south and Kharkiv and nearly all points in between, people huddled in air raid shelters and lined up and bank machines and stocked up on essentials.

While the Russians, for the moment, were not in control of any city, it was only the first phase of a conflict that could stretch into weeks or longer.",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/02/25/world/russia-ukraine-war

Zelensky said in response to the offer of refuge: 'The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride,' according to a senior American intelligence official with direct knowledge of the conversation, who described Zelensky as upbeat.



He spoke as Biden authorized the release of $350million of military assistance to Ukraine after taking his latest weekend break to Delaware as Russian troops began to invade Kyiv.



Invading Russian forces closed in on Ukraine´s capital on Saturday, in an apparent encircling movement after a barrage of airstrikes on cities and military bases around the country.



A second Russian Ilyushin Il-76 military transport plane was shot down near Bila Tserkva, 50 miles south of Kyiv, according to two American officials with direct knowledge of conditions on the ground in Ukraine. Each of the two planes can carry up to 200 troops, although a death toll has not been shared.



Earlier, Zelensky said in a televised speech: 'This night they will launch an assault. The enemy will use all of their power on all fronts to break our defense. This night we have to stand ground. The fate of Ukraine is being decided now.'



This came after a video showed him in his military tent drinking coffee with his men, he personally coordinated the defense of Kyiv.



He spoke Saturday morning in Kyiv, having survived the night, and said: 'There's a lot of fake news online that I called on our army to lay down arms, & that there's evacuation. I'm here. We will defend our state.'
