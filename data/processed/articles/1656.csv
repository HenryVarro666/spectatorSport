Abramovich's superyachts docked in Turkish resorts

ISTANBUL, March 29 (Reuters) - Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, who is sanctioned by the West over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, made a surprise appearance in Istanbul on Tuesday at the first direct peace talks in weeks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators.

The two teams sat facing each other at a long table in the presidential office on an Ottoman palace grounds. The Russian oligarch sat in the front row of observers wearing a blue suit, a Turkish presidential video showed.

In the most tangible sign yet of progress towards ending the war, Russia emerged from the talks promising to scale down military operations around Kyiv and the country's north, and Ukraine proposed adopting a neutral status. read more

For Abramovich, signals have emerged since the war began that he has sought to encourage negotiations, and he has travelled to Ukraine, Russia, Turkey and Israel in March. Two of his superyachts are docked at Turkish resorts.

His presence initially baffled at least one Ukrainian diplomat, while Moscow said he was not formally negotiating but rather there as a go-between and had approval from the Ukrainian side. read more

A spokesman for Abramovich did not respond to a request for comment. Abramovich showed no signs of a reported suspected poisoning early this month.

The Wall Street Journal and investigative outlet Bellingcat, citing people familiar with the matter, said Abramovich and Ukrainian negotiators suffered symptoms of suspected poisoning after a meeting in Kyiv. read more

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the poisoning reports as untrue and part of an ""information war"".

NATO member Turkey shares a maritime border with Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea, has good ties with both and has offered to mediate the conflict. While calling Moscow's invasion unacceptable, Ankara has also opposed the Western sanctions.

In a speech ahead of the talks by the Bosphorus strait, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan told the delegations the time had come for concrete results and that progress would pave the way for a meeting of the countries' two leaders.

""It is up to the sides to stop this tragedy. Achieving a ceasefire and peace as soon as possible is to the benefit of everyone,"" he said.

Footage released by Kyiv showed Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov being warmly greeted by his Turkish counterpart ahead of the talks at the Dolmabahce palace grounds.

Reznikov, who was not wearing a face mask, joked with Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar that Ukraine had scrapped COVID-19 precautions when Russia invaded.

Russian forces invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. Putin called it a ""special military operation"" to demilitarize Ukraine. Ukraine and the West say Putin launched an unprovoked war of aggression.

SUPERYACHTS IN TURKEY

Commenting on Abramovich's presence, Ukrainian ambassador to Britain Vadym Prystaiko told the BBC: ""I have no idea what Mr Abramovich is claiming or doing. He is not a part of the negotiation team.""

Peskov told reporters on a conference call Abramovich was not an official member of the Russian delegation at the talks, but acknowledged his presence there to ""enable certain contacts"" between sides. read more

The Kremlin has said he played an early role in talks but the process was now up to negotiating teams. TV video showed he sat next to Erdogan's spokesman and adjusted his headphones to listen to the president's speech. read more

The West has imposed heavy sanctions on Abramovich and other Russian billionaires, Russian companies and officials, in a bid to force Putin to withdraw from Ukraine.

Abramovich had sought to sell his English soccer club Chelsea, a process that was taken out of his hands by the British government when it blacklisted him.

Superyachts linked to him, together worth an estimated $1.2 billion, have been docked at Bodrum and Marmaris in southwest Turkey since last week. Sources have said he and other wealthy Russians were looking to invest in Turkey given sanctions elsewhere. read more

Its potential as a safe haven for Russian investment raises risks for Turkey's government, banks and businesses that could face penalties if the United States and others pressure Moscow with broader ""secondary"" sanctions. read more

1,e3be7bfe-91ad-46fc-aed6-92b970fab2b4,['Anton Troianovski'],2022-03-29,"ISTANBUL — On Tuesday, for the first time in more than two weeks, Ukrainian and Russian negotiators came face to face. They did so over a white tablecloth at a long table inside a 19th-century Ottoman palace on the banks of the Bosporus, welcomed personally by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who greeted them in English with “good morning.”

After more than a month of talks — first in person in Belarus, then in recent weeks by video link — the diplomacy between Ukraine and Russia running in parallel to their war entered a new phase on Tuesday. The fact that the negotiations had become more serious was reflected in the setting, the palace where Mr. Erdogan — who has maintained ties with both Moscow and Kyiv — often holds major government events when in Istanbul.

“As the members of the delegations, you have shouldered a historic responsibility,” Mr. Erdogan told the delegates, addressing them from a podium before an artwork showing birds drifting over Istanbul landmarks. “All the world is expecting good news from you.”

David Arakhamia, the head of the nine-person Ukrainian delegation, said that holding the talks in Turkey was a “victory” in itself, because Turkey “is our friend and partner.” The earlier in-person rounds of talks had been held in Belarus, Russia’s closest ally.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/29/world/europe/russia-ukraine-peace-talks-istanbul.html
2,e3be7bfe-91ad-46fc-aed6-92b970fab2b4,"['Jon Henley', 'Pjotr Sauer', 'Shaun Walker']",2022-03-29,"Volodymyr Zelenskiy has dismissed Russia’s pledge to drastically cut back its military activity in northern Ukraine, saying “Ukrainians are not naive people” and vowing to continue defensive military efforts.

Zelenskiy said in a video address early on Wednesday: “Ukrainians have already learned during these 34 days of invasion and over the past eight years of the war in Donbas that only a concrete result can be trusted.”

Russia’s deputy defence minister Alexander Fomin said after talks in Istanbul on Tuesday that Moscow wanted to “increase mutual trust, create the right conditions for future negotiations and reach the final aim of signing a peace deal with Ukraine”, and that the Kremlin would “radically reduce military activity in the direction of Kyiv and Chernihiv”.

Ukraine’s president said that while there had been “positive” signals from the latest talks, “they do not drown out the explosions of Russian shells”. “The enemy is still in our territory,” he said. “The shelling of our cities continues. Mariupol is blocked. Missile and airstrikes do not stop. This is the reality. These are the facts.”

Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces said in its latest intelligence report on Tuesday night that Russian troops continued to withdraw from the territory of Kyiv and Chernihiv but the movement is merely “a rotation of individual units” and aims to “mislead the military leadership” of Ukraine.

The scepticism echoes that of experts and western diplomats and leaders, who expressed doubts that the move was more than a ploy to dress up setbacks on the ground.

An unconvinced Joe Biden said: “We’ll see. I don’t read anything into it until I see what their actions are.”

While Moscow presented its move as a goodwill gesture, it came as Russia’s advance appeared to have stalled on several fronts, with the Kremlin’s forces thwarted by stiff Ukrainian resistance, heavy losses and logistical and tactical failings.

Having failed to seize the Ukrainian capital and force an early capitulation, Moscow said last week it was shifting its focus to expanding the territory held by pro-Russia separatists in the eastern Donbas region. The defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said hours before the talks the “main goal” was now the “liberation” of Donbas.

The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said he had not seen anything indicating that talks were progressing in a “constructive way” and suggested Russian indications of a pullback could be an attempt by Moscow to “deceive people and deflect attention”.

Speaking on a visit to Morocco, Blinken said that there was “what Russia says, and what Russia does, and we’re focused on the latter. What Russia is doing is the continued brutalisation of Ukraine.”

A spokesperson for Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, said the UK had seen signs of “some reduction” in Russian bombardment around Kyiv, but added: “We will judge Putin and his regime by his actions, not by his words … We don’t want to see anything less than a complete withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukrainian territory.”

The UK’s Ministry of Defence (MoD) said in its latest updated that “it is almost certain that the Russian offensive has failed in its objective to encircle Kyiv”. The UK defence attaché Mick Smeath in a statement: “Russian statements regarding a reduction in activity around Kyiv, and reporting indicating the withdrawal of some Russian units from these areas, may indicate Russia’s acceptance that it has now lost the initiative in the region.” He added: “It is highly likely that Russia will seek to divert combat power from the north to their offensive in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in the east.”

Western officials were “very wary” about the promises, saying the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, could be temporising. “Certainly in terms of the negotiations, nothing that we have seen so far has demonstrated to us that Putin and his colleagues are particularly serious,” one said. “It’s more of a tactical exercise in playing for time.”

John Kirby, press secretary at the Pentagon, warned against “fooling ourselves” over the Kremlin’s claims. “Has there been some movement by some Russian units away from Kyiv in the last day or so? Yeah, we think so, small numbers,” he said. “But we believe that this is a repositioning, not a real withdrawal, and that we all should be prepared to watch for a major offensive against other areas of Ukraine.”

Ukraine presented Russian negotiators in Istanbul with a framework for peace under which it would remain neutral with its security guaranteed by third-party countries including the US, the UK, France, Turkey, China and Poland, in an arrangement similar to Nato’s article 5, which commits members to defend one another.

It also said it would be willing to agree to a 15-year consultation period on the status of Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, with both countries agreeing not to use their militaries to resolve the issue in the meantime, and called for Russia to drop its objection to Ukrainian membership of the EU.

The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, said “both sides are getting closer at every stage”, adding that the Istanbul talks could lead in the first instance to a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers.

However, analysts warned that the demands were unlikely to be readily accepted by the Kremlin. “I would be very careful about getting too optimistic. We have only heard the Ukrainian proposals. We need to wait for Russia’s responses,” said Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Centre.

Gabuev said Kyiv’s proposals “would look like a loss to Putin, who in his mind already settled the Crimean question a long time ago”. Russia’s military pullback “could just be a temporary strategic move”, he added.

The senior Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak described Kyiv’s proposal on guaranteed neutrality as “an effective tool for protecting our territory and sovereignty”, with “the leading armies of the world becoming guarantors and assuming specific legal obligations” to intervene in the event of aggression.

The proposal on Crimea was also “revolutionary”, Podolyak said, not only because it meant “the return of the topic of Crimea to the negotiating agenda” but because it would “allow us to preserve the current legal interpretations of Crimea, since Crimea is, of course, a part of Ukraine for us”.

Even as the peace negotiators began their work, however, Zelenskiy, said in a speech to the Danish parliament that at least seven people had been killed and 22 injured in a Russian strike on a regional government building in the southern port of Mykolaiv. “People are still going through the rubble,” he said.

Zelenskiy also called the Russian bombardment and siege of the port city of Mariupol, where local officials have said at least 5,000 people have died, a “crime against humanity … happening in front of the eyes of the whole planet, in real time”.

Russia’s foreign ministry said in a Telegram post on Tuesday night that Putin had told Emmanuel Macron in a phone call that “Ukrainian nationalist militants” in Mariupol must lay down their weapons in order to resolve the humanitarian crisis there.

Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, which began on 24 February, has killed an estimated 20,000 people, forced more than 10 million from their homes – including more than 3.8 million who have fled the country – and triggered an unprecedented range of western economic sanctions against Russia.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/29/ukraine-russia-peace-talks-istanbul-war-kyiv

Ukrainian and Russian Negotiators Meet in Turkey

Diplomats from Ukraine and Russia are meeting in Istanbul today for another round of negotiations. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan opened the talks by calling for an immediate cease-fire and saying that “we should expect solid outcomes.”

Although major breakthroughs aren’t expected, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has expressed his willingness to discuss some of the Kremlin’s demands: declaring neutrality, staying out of NATO, and pledging not to develop its own nuclear arsenal. Even so, Zelensky has said that a potential deal would need to be determined in a national referendum and would require security guarantees and the removal of Russian forces.

“Security guarantees and neutrality, the non-nuclear status of our state—we’re ready to do that,” Zelensky said on Sunday. “That’s the most important point … they started the war because of it.”

Russian President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, is reportedly no longer pushing to “de-Nazify” Ukraine and is now willing to allow Kyiv to join the European Union as long as it practices military nonalignment, according to the Financial Times.

But officials and Russia experts remain skeptical of whether Putin is actually seeking a diplomatic resolution to the war, especially as Russian forces continue to intensify their missile strikes on Ukrainian cities, worsening the war’s humanitarian fallout.

“The Russians are still looking for a battlefield victory, and Ukrainians are not willing to cave,” Daniel Fried, a distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council and former U.S. ambassador to Poland, told Foreign Policy.

If negotiations fail to produce diplomatic breakthroughs, as many experts expect, what could come next? After consulting more than a dozen Western officials, military analysts, and regional experts, my colleagues Amy Mackinnon, Jack Detsch, and Robbie Gramer have outlined five broad outcomes that could emerge from the war: a bloody stalemate, the partition of Ukraine, a decisive victory, a peace agreement, or a black swan event like a Russian nuclear attack or Putin’s fall from power.

Until then, they write, many analysts fear that the conflict will only deepen as Putin continues his assault on Ukrainian cities and civilian targets—and shows little signs of giving in.

“I’m encouraged by the fact that there’s negotiations,” said Paul Stronski, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. But as long as the fighting intensifies and the shelling of civilian areas continues, he said, “I don’t have high hopes.”

“I think the worst could still be ahead of us,” he added.

What We’re Following Today

Shanghai’s sweeping lockdown. As cases of the omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus surge in China, the country has imposed a lockdown in half of Shanghai—its biggest since the pandemic first began two years ago. Shanghai has been grappling with a staggering spike in largely asymptomatic COVID-19 cases: On Sunday, the city reported 3,500 new cases, 50 of which were symptomatic.

To curb the spread of the virus, the city—home to 25 million people—will implement a two-phase lockdown based around the Huangpu River, which divides the city. From Monday to Friday, the eastern side of the river will be under lockdown; those west of the river will face the same restrictions in the four days after.

El Salvador cracks down on gang violence. After El Salvador was rocked by a severe wave of gang violence—at least 62 people were killed on Saturday, the country’s deadliest day in three decades—the government has declared a 30-day state of emergency. Under this order, the government can suspend several constitutional guarantees and lift certain arrest restrictions, while prisons are locked down.

“All the cells locked 24/7, nobody goes out even to the yard,” El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele tweeted on Sunday. “Message to the gangs: Because of your actions, now your ‘homeboys’ won’t be able to see a ray of sunshine.”

Historic security summit. Top diplomats from the United States, Israel, Bahrain, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and Morocco convened in a historic security summit in Israel on Monday. At the summit—the first such meeting to be held in Israel—the participants worked to coordinate efforts against Iran, while also urging Israel to revive talks with Palestinian leaders. “We have to be clear that these regional peace agreements are not a substitute for progress between Palestinians and Israelis,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.

Keep an Eye On

Indian workers strike. Since Monday, millions of workers across India have been taking part in a two-day nationwide strike to demand greater rights and protest the government’s economic policies, which they say hurt workers and farmers. With both public and private sector workers marching, their demonstrations have blocked roads, highways, and railway tracks across states.

Massacre in Mexico. Armed gunmen attacked an illegal cockfighting arena in western Mexico on Sunday night, killing 20 people. Although it’s still unclear who was behind the attack—or what their motive was—witnesses report seeing a massacre in which gunmen equipped with assault rifles opened fire late on Sunday night. Outside, two parked trucks blocked the highway to the cockfighting pit.

Odds and Ends

Four Chinese badminton players have been charged with a peculiar crime: failing to play their best during a doubles match at the 2018 Fuzhou Open.

During the match, observing Danish players told the referee they didn’t believe the players—a world-ranked No. 2 pair and a No. 17-ranked pair—were playing seriously. After the referee stepped in and asked all of the players to try their best during the second game, the match’s intensity improved—but they were ultimately charged after the No. 17 pair won.

In March, a Badminton World Federation disciplinary panel announced that the players were found guilty of failing to try their best. As a punishment, all will face temporary bans and have to hand over their prize money from the competition.",https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/03/29/russia-ukraine-turkey-erdogan-war-peace-talks-negotiations-diplomacy/
5,e3be7bfe-91ad-46fc-aed6-92b970fab2b4,[],,"ISTANBUL, Turkey — Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called for a ceasefire as Russian and Ukrainian delegations met face to face in Istanbul on Tuesday, resuming their talks on Russia’s invasion of its neighbor last month.

In a speech he delivered at the start of negotiations, Erdogan said progress in the talks could pave the way for a meeting between the leaders of the two countries.

“We believe that there will be no losers in a just peace. Prolonging the conflict is not in anyone’s interest,” he said. “As members of the delegations you have taken on a historic responsibility. The whole world is awaiting the good news that will come from you.”

“The two parties have legitimate concerns, it’s possible to reach a solution acceptable to the international community,” Erdogan said. “It’s up to the two parties to put an end to this tragedy,” he insisted, adding that the “extension of the conflict is in no one’s interest.”

It is the first time that the two countries’ delegations, which arrived in Turkey on Monday, met after several rounds of talks by videoconference.

The delegations are scheduled to hold two days of talks in a government building adjacent to the 19th-century Ottoman palace, Dolmabahce, on the shores of the Bosporus.

Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu was also due to meet the Ukrainian and Russian delegations on Tuesday.

Earlier talks between the sides, held in person in Belarus or by video, failed to make progress on ending the monthlong war that has killed thousands and driven more than 10 million Ukrainians from their homes — including almost 4 million from their country.

Turkey previously hosted on March 10 a first meeting between the Ukrainian and Russian foreign ministers following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24. Those talks in the southern city of Antalya failed to produce a ceasefire or make any other visible progress.

Turkey, which shares a Black Sea coast with both Russia and Ukraine, is seeking to maintain good relations with both and has offered to mediate since the start of the war.

Ankara is a traditional ally of Kyiv’s and has supplied the country with Bayraktar drones, which Ukraine has deployed in the conflict.

But it is also seeking to stay on good terms with Russia, on which Turkey relies heavily for gas imports and tourism revenues.

Turkey is also working with France and Greece on a “humanitarian operation” to evacuate people from the devastated Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, which has been pounded by Russian forces.

Ahead of the current talks in Istanbul, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country was prepared to declare its neutrality, as Moscow has demanded, in comments that might lend momentum to negotiations.

Zelensky said over the weekend that compromise might be possible over “the complex issue of Donbas,” the hotly contested region in the country’s east. It’s unclear how that might be reconciled with his stance that “Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are beyond doubt.”

Russia has long demanded that Ukraine drop any hope of joining NATO, which Moscow sees as a threat. Zelensky, for his part, has stressed that Ukraine needs security guarantees of its own as part of any deal.

As fighting raged throughout the country, the mayor of Irpin, which has been the scene of some of the heaviest fighting, said late Monday that the city had been “liberated” from Russian forces.

A senior US defense official said the US believes the Ukrainians have also retaken the town of Trostyanets, south of Sumy, in the east.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss US intelligence assessments, said Russian forces largely remained in defensive positions near the capital, Kyiv, and were making little forward progress elsewhere in the country.

The official said Russia appeared to be deemphasizing ground operations near Kyiv and concentrating more on the Donbas, the predominantly Russian-speaking region where Moscow-backed rebels have been waging a separatist war for eight years.

Late last week, with its forces bogged down in parts of the country, Russia seemed to scale back its war aims, saying its main goal was gaining control of the Donbas.

The possible face-saving exit strategy for Russian President Vladimir Putin has raised Ukrainian fears the Kremlin aims to split the country, forcing it to surrender a swath of its territory.

In recent days, Ukrainian troops have pushed the Russians back in other sectors.

In the city of Makariv, near a strategic highway west of the capital, Associated Press reporters saw the carcass of a Russian rocket launcher, a burned Russian truck, the body of a Russian soldier and a destroyed Ukrainian tank after fighting there a few days ago.

In the nearby village of Yasnohorodka, the AP witnessed positions abandoned by Ukrainian soldiers who had moved farther west, but no sign of Russian troops.

Russia has destroyed more than 60 religious buildings across the country in just over a month of war, with most of the damage concentrated near Kyiv and in the east, Ukraine’s military said in a post on Tuesday.

It said the Orthodox church – the country’s majority religion – was the most affected but that mosques, synagogues, Protestant churches and religious schools were also destroyed.

A cyberattack knocked Ukraine’s national telecommunications provider Ukrtelecom almost completely offline on Monday. The chief of Ukraine’s state service for special communication, Yurii Shchyhol, blamed “the enemy” without specifically naming Russia and said most customers were cut off from telephone, internet and mobile service to ensure coverage for Ukraine’s military.

Also Monday, an oil depot in western Ukraine’s Rivne region was hit by a missile, the governor said, in the second attack on oil facilities in the region near the Polish border.

In other developments, Ukraine’s prosecutor general said at least 144 children have died in the war so far, most in Kyiv. The tally did not give a number for the besieged eastern city of Mariupol.

Meanwhile, Bloomberg News said it has suspended its operations in Russia and Belarus. Customers in both countries won’t be able to access any Bloomberg financial products and trading functions for Russian securities were disabled in line with international sanctions, it said. Bloomberg Philanthropies pledged $40 million, meanwhile, in support of Ukrainians and refugees.

Also, The Group of Seven major economies rejected a Kremlin demand that some countries pay in rubles for Russia’s natural gas. That demand appeared designed to support the Russian currency, which is under pressure from Western sanctions.

Putin’s ground forces have become bogged down because of stronger-than-expected Ukrainian resistance, combined with what Western officials say are Russian tactical missteps, poor morale, shortages of food, fuel and cold weather gear, and other problems. Moscow has resorted to pummeling Ukrainian cities with artillery and airstrikes.

The Pentagon may have to ask Congress for additional money to support Ukraine’s battle against Russia’s invasion, including replenishing America’s arsenal for weapons sent to Kyiv, officials said Monday.

Rolling out the Defense Department’s $773 billion request for fiscal 2023, Pentagon leaders said the budget was finalized before the invasion so it has no specific money for the war. Congress approved a $13.5 billion emergency funding package in early March.

The leaders said it was too early to predict how quickly Ukrainian forces will use up the weapons and ammunition already being provided, and how much the US will need to replace what it sends to Ukraine, such as Stinger and Javelin missiles or body armor and other equipment.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/as-ukraine-russia-peace-talks-kick-off-in-istanbul-erdogan-urges-end-to-tragedy/

7,e3be7bfe-91ad-46fc-aed6-92b970fab2b4,['Dorian Jones'],,"Peace talks between Russia and Ukraine ended Tuesday with both sides stressing the importance of the negotiations and indicating a willingness to compromise.

Istanbul, Turkey's largest city, hosted the fifth round of Ukrainian and Russian peace talks. The Russian delegation described the more than four hours of talks as positive. Speaking to reporters after the talks, Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin pledged a reduction in military operations.

To increase mutual trust and aid negotiations, he said, a decision was made to reduce military activity in the Kyiv and Chernihiv areas.

The Russian delegation said further steps on reducing military operations would be discussed on their return to Moscow. Tuesday's talks focused on Russia's demand that Ukraine should become neutral and end its aspirations to join NATO. The Ukrainian delegation proposed that eight countries should guarantee its security, including Poland, Israel, and Turkey, in exchange for neutrality.

Ukrainian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak, speaking to reporters, said international guarantors are key to accepting neutrality.

He said intensive consultations are underway on various issues, the most important of which is agreement on international security guarantees for Ukraine. That agreement, Podolyak added, is necessary to end the war.

The delegations also discussed proposals on the disputed status of the self-proclaimed breakaway republics of Luhansk, Donetsk and Crimea, which Russia annexed.

Ukraine demands their return, while Moscow calls for their international recognition as independent states and Crimea as Russian sovereign territory. Among the proposals discussed was that Crimea's status would be subject to a 15-year consultation period.

But the Ukrainian delegation insisted such a step would only be possible in the event of a complete cease-fire. Expectations had been low ahead of Tuesday's meeting, but Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu claimed the talks had achieved the most progress since the start of the war.

Analyst Sinan Ulgen said the Ukrainian-Russian negotiations in Istanbul underline the importance of Turkey, which has been careful to maintain good ties with both sides during peace efforts.

""As a result of this balanced policy, Turkey is one of few actors that can play a constructive diplomatic role right now. That diplomatic role can be best described as 'good office,' which is more than a facilitator but less than a mediator,"" Ulgen saud.

But analysts suggest that a meeting of the Ukrainian and Russian presidents is key to ending the conflict. While Kyiv says it's ready for such a summit, Moscow insists it would only be possible if there are concrete proposals to discuss. Tuesday's meeting may turn out to be the first step in that process.",https://www.voanews.com/a/ukrainian-russian-delegations-send-positive-messages-after-istanbul-talks/6506651.html
