Chernobyl staff have reportedly been taken hostage as Russian troops stormed the nuclear waste storage facility.

Mirror Online reports that Russian troops in Ukraine have seized Chernobyl power station and taken staff as hostages.

Advisors to the Ukrainian president have reportedly admitted they ""do not know"" the condition of its nuclear waste storage facility.

It is understood that a battle had broken out earlier today near the remains of the nuclear plant, around 60 miles from Kyiv, between Ukrainian and Russian forces.

According to Mirror Online, it now appears that Moscow has seized the site of the worst nuclear accident in world history, with experts suggesting it is a key location as soldiers can now march directly to the country's capital city.

Mykhailo Podoliak, adviser to the head of the president’s office, said: ""After a fierce battle, our control over the Chernobyl site has been lost.

""The condition of the facilities of the former Chernobyl nuclear power plant is unknown. This is one of the most serious problems in Europe today.

""It is impossible to say that the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is safe.

""This is one of the most serious threats to Europe today. Knowing the habits of the Russians, they are probably already preparing provocative things at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.

""Either they will use the damage received by the facilities during the attack to blame Ukraine for this, or they will damage these undoubtedly most dangerous facilities themselves.""

The Chernobyl disaster in then-Soviet Ukraine sent clouds of nuclear material across much of Europe in 1986 after a botched

safety test in the fourth reactor of the atomic plant.

Russian soldiers are said to have attacked the radioactive area from the side of Belarus before engaging local forces in fierce fighting.

Videos from the scene showed Russian tanks stood outside an administration building to the east of the ruined plant which remains highly radioactive.

Earlier presidential advisor Alena Shevtsova confirmed the Russians are in control of the area and are holding the personnel hostage.

Their condition is currently unknown.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President of Ukraine, said Russia declared war on the whole of Europe by storming into the radioactive zone of Chernobyl.

He put on Twitter: ""Russian occupation forces are trying to seize the #Chornobyl_NPP.

""Our defenders are giving their lives so that the tragedy of 1986 will not be repeated. Reported this to @SwedishPM. This is a declaration of war against the whole of Europe.""

“We’re outraged by credible reports that Russian soldiers are currently holding the staff of the Chernobyl facilities hostage,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on 24 February.

“This unlawful and dangerous hostage-taking which could upend the routine civil service efforts required to maintain and protect the nuclear waste facility is obviously incredibly alarming and incredibly concerning, and we request their release,” she said.

Mykhailo Podolyak, an aide of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said on Thursday: “It is impossible to say the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is safe after a totally pointless attack by the Russians.”

“This is one of the most serious threats in Europe today,” Podolyak said.

Mr Zelenskyy said earlier today that troops were “giving their lives” so that the “tragedy of 1986 will not be repeated.”

He added on Twitter that “this is a declaration of war against the whole of Europe.”

The plant was the site of a devastating nuclear accident when a reactor exploded in April 1986, spewing radioactive waste across Europe. The plant lies 80 miles north of the capital of Kyiv.

The exploded reactor has been covered by a protective shelter to prevent radiation leak and the entire plant has been decommissioned.

A Ukrainian official told Associated Press that Russian shelling hit a radioactive waste repository and an increase in radiation levels was reported. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter.

It was not immediately possible for experts to access the repository to assess damage before Russian forces overtook the site.

Fighting in the region came hours after Mr Putin launched a wide-ranging assault on Ukraine on Thursday.

Russian forces have hit cities and bases with airstrikes or shelling, as Ukrainians piled into trains and cars to flee the country.

Ukraine’s government said Russian tanks and troops rolled across the border in a “full-scale war” whose fallout already reverberated around the world.

The chief of the Nato alliance said the “brutal act of war” shattered peace in Europe, joining a chorus of world leaders who decried the attack.

British prime minister Boris Johnson was among those who spoke out against the invasion on Thursday.

“I am appalled by the horrific events in Ukraine and I have spoken to president Zelensky to discuss next steps,” he said.

“President Putin has chosen a path of bloodshed and destruction by launching this unprovoked attack on Ukraine. The UK and our allies will respond decisively.”

Mr Johnson also announced the “largest and most severe package of economic sanctions that Russia has ever seen”.

They will block Aeroflot from landing flights in the UK, and hit more than 100 business and individuals as Britain seeks to cripple Russian banks’ access to London’s financial institutions and curtail oligarchs luxury lifestyles in the capital.

“They come to Harrods to shop, they stay in our best hotels when they like, they send their children to our best public schools, and that is what’s being stopped,” a diplomatic source said.

“So that these people are essentially persona non grata in every major western European capital in the world. That really bites.”

Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden also unveiled a package of new sanctions against Russia and its ability to do business in the world’s major currencies.

He told reporters at the White House: “This is a premeditated attack. Putin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war. And now he and his country will bear the consequences.”

Mr Biden said the sanctions would limit Russia’s ability to do business in dollars, euros, pounds and yen.

He added that Nato would meet on Friday to map out further measures and did not rule out targeting Mr Putin personally over the invasion.

Mr Zelenskyy has cut diplomatic ties with Moscow and declared martial law in the country.

“As of today, our countries are on different sides of world history,” Mr Zelensky tweeted.

“Russia has embarked on a path of evil, but Ukraine is defending itself and won’t give up its freedom.”

The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making “the most important decision of their life -- to fight.”

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.”

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the major developments on Russia's invasion, how Kyiv is fighting back, the plight of civilians, and Western reaction. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.

Zelenskiy noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.”

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

Radiation levels increasing

Radiation levels are rising in the area of the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone in Ukraine, hours after Russian forces seized it during their invasion of the country, Ukrainian officials say - though not yet to concerning levels.

There were fears that the Russian invasion of Ukraine could endanger the wreckage of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, the source of one of the worst man-made disasters in history.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted Friday morning that Russian forces were trying to seize the plant and the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, the area around the plant left radioactive after the 1986 disaster.

Less than 3 hours later, Zelensky advisers said the Russians had succeeded in taking the plant and surrounding areas.

By late on Friday, Ukraine’s parliament tweeted that radiation levels had exceeded monitoring thresholds at a number of sites to the north and west of the region. It was not immediately clear, though, if there was any damage to the wrecked plant, nor had the radiation risen to dangerous levels.

Vsevolod Chentsov, head of Ukraine’s mission to both the EU and the continent’s atomic energy authority, said Friday that gamma radiation was rising in the area.

Reports suggested the spike might have been from Russian tanks kicking up radioactive dust around the plant.

Why Did Russia Take Chernobyl?

Why would Russia make a radioactive wasteland one of its very first targets in Ukraine?

While the full answer may be known only to top officials in Moscow, the site happens to lie along one of the most direct paths to Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital.

“The location is important because of where it sits,” retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, former commanding general of US Army Europe, said in an interview with NBC News. “If Russian forces were attacking Kyiv from the north, Chernobyl is right there on the way, almost in the way.”

The nuclear disaster

In 1986, more than 30 people died after an explosion ripped through one of the Chernobyl power station’s reactors. In the years and months that followed, many more people died from radiation symptoms.

In the immediate aftermath, a steel and concrete sarcophagus was constructed to cover the damaged reactor and contain the radioactive material, but it has deteriorated since then — leaking radiation.

In 2016 the New Safe Confinement arch was put in place to seal off the aging and hastily-constructed sarcophagus. In 2020 the facility was handed over to Ukrainian authorities, according to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.",https://7news.com.au/news/ukraine/chernobyl-power-plant-employees-held-hostage-by-russian-forces-radiation-levels-rising-c-5845948
7,91dda702-0cdc-4bd1-aa75-8556526bf8b0,['Melissa Quinn'],,"An adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the country has lost control of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant after Ukrainian forces fought to defend it from Russian troops, according to reports.

The adviser, Myhailo Podolyak, was quoted by The Associated Press and other news agencies as saying that after a ""senseless attack of the Russians… it is impossible to say that the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is safe.""

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) also said it has been informed by Ukraine that ""unidentified armed forces"" have taken control of all plant facilities, with no casualties or destruction at the site.

The agency is following the Ukraine situation with ""grave concern"" and is calling for ""maximum restraint"" to avoid actions that could put Ukraine's nuclear facilities at risk, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said on Thursday, according to a statement. The IAEA said it was told that Ukraine's operational nuclear power plants are operating securely and safely.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Thursday that the White House is ""outraged"" by what she said are ""credible reports"" that Russian troops are holding staff at the site hostage.

""This unlawful and dangerous hostage taking, which could upend the routine civil service efforts required to maintain and protect the nuclear waste facilities, is obviously incredibly alarming and greatly concerning,"" she said. ""We condemn it and we request their release.""

Zelensky warned earlier that Russian troops were attempting to seize the abandoned and sealed-up Chernobyl nuclear site, an effort he called ""a declaration of war against the whole of Europe.""

""Our defenders are giving their lives so that the tragedy of 1986 will not be repeated,"" he tweeted, hours after Russia began its invasion of Ukraine.

The plant disaster in 1986 was the world's worst nuclear accident. An explosion and fires at the site — about 80 miles north of Ukraine's capital — sent radiation into the air, with large amounts carried over Belarus, Russia and Ukraine.

Scores of people were evacuated from the area following the meltdown, and at least 32 people died because of the blast and its immediate aftermath. Roughly 11,000 cases of thyroid cancer may be linked to the disaster, according to a 2016 report from the World Health Organization.

The plant has been decommissioned and a protective shelter covers the reactor to prevent radiation from leaking. The area around the reactor is off-limits to the public.

Ukrainian and Russian forces clash on multiple fronts - live updates

Why would Russia want to capture Chernobyl?

Russian and Ukrainian troops have clashed across multiple cities since the invasion began, with US and Ukrainian intelligence suggesting the Kremlin wants to quickly move on Kyiv.

With that in mind, it's been proposed that Chernobyl has been taken because it offers the shortest route to Kyiv from staunch Russian ally Belarus, where Moscow has staged troops.

Sky News reported from the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone just last month, as Ukraine had been increasing military deployments to the zone due to fears over this potential Russian strategy coming to fruition.

Is the site still dangerous - and should we be worried about further damage?

The devastating reactor explosion at Chernobyl happened more than 35 years ago, and it remains one of the most radioactive places in the world.

It spewed radioactive waste across Europe, and it's still leaking decades later. The exploded reactor had since been covered with a protective shelter, and it's not known whether that has been damaged.

But a Ukrainian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, revealed that an increase in radiation levels had been reported after a Russian shelling hit a radioactive waste repository.

The Chernobyl disaster - a brief history Reactor Number Four at the power plant exploded and caught fire deep in the night on 26 April 1986, shattering the building and spewing radioactive material high into the sky. Soviet authorities made the catastrophe worse by failing to tell the public what had happened, angering the people and European governments. The two million residents of Kyiv were not informed despite the fallout danger, and the world learned of the disaster only after heightened radiation was detected in Sweden.

According to a leading expert in nuclear power safety, it would not be in the interests of Moscow - which issued the evacuation order all those years ago - to damage the site.

Edwin Lyman, of the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington, said if the power to cooling pumps is disrupted or fuel-storage tanks are damaged, the results could be catastrophic.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said it is following the situation in Ukraine ""with grave concern"" and appealed for maximum restraint to avoid any action that may put Ukraine's nuclear facilities at risk.

General director Rafael Mariano Grossi said it is ""of vital importance that the safe and secure operations of the nuclear facilities in that zone should not be affected or disrupted in any way"".
