The Armed Forces of Ukraine have issued an upbeat assessment of their defense of Kyiv, saying Russia’s two main routes for attacking the capital city have been blocked.

In the face of a campaign to apparently encircle the capital ahead of a possible attempt to take it, Russian forces on both sides of the Dnipro river — which divides the city north to south — have been stopped, according to Oleksandr Hruzevych, deputy chief of staff.

“As of today, the enemy has been stopped at a distance of almost 70 kilometers (about 43 miles) from the city’s right bank, which makes it impossible to carry out fire, except for rocket fire. On the left bank, the advance has [also] been stopped. The enemy is cynically shooting at our infrastructure facilities. [But] the main ways of attack are blocked,” he said Friday.

Russian forces had abandoned offensive actions around Brovary to the northeast of Kyiv, and Boryspil to the southeast, Hruzevych said. After creating two lines of defense to protect the capital, Hruzevych said Ukraine’s army was now “working on strengthening a third, distant line of defense.”

Addressing the threat posed by cruise missiles, the brigadier general said an air defense system was still in operation around Kyiv, but admitted missiles intercepted over the city still posed a threat. One person was killed in such an incident Friday morning in the northwestern district of Podilskyi, the city council said earlier.

On Friday morning, four cruise missiles fired from warplanes over the Black Sea had smashed into an aircraft parts plant in the western city of Lviv. Two further missiles had been intercepted by air defense systems before they could hit their target.

""The Black Sea and Belarus are two difficult directions from which the enemy launches missile strikes,” Hruzevych acknowledged. But, he continued: “An effective system has been developed where the missiles are to be destroyed on approach. We are now working on a system that will minimize the impact of missiles for civilians.""

He also said a campaign to remove the threat of saboteurs in the capital had already resulted in the elimination of more than 100 people.",https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-18-22/h_da2bb04b93e356439224e8fe54cb9df9

In a tweet on Friday, Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkēvičs confirmed that the decision “has been coordinated with #Lithuania and #Estonia.”

Lithuania declared four employees of the Russian Embassy to be persona non grata, while Latvia and Estonia have each done the same for three Russian Embassy staff.

“Current activities of those persons under diplomatic cover are incompatible with their diplomatic status and are causing detriment to the Republic of Latvia,” Latvia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Friday.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has raised fears of direct conflict between the US and Moscow.

Advocates of more aggressive US responses cite previous military encounters to play down the risks.

But experts warn that Russia's involvement raises the stakes and that a clash could quickly escalate.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Western efforts to resupply Ukraine's military and reinforce NATO's eastern flank have raised concerns that a close encounter or accident could escalate into a broader war.

Proponents of increased US assistance or of direct US involvement have played down the likelihood or likely severity of a Russian response, but Russia has shown it's willing to strike near NATO territory. Russian missiles hit a base near Ukraine's border with Poland on Sunday and an aircraft-repair facility in Lviv, also near the border, on Friday.

""The Russians used missiles to hit targets that are very close to the Polish border. One of those missiles hits Poland, President Biden has made very clear that it'll be considered an attack on NATO, and then you do have a world war on your hands,"" Leon Panetta, a former secretary of defense, said this week at George Mason University event.

""I think this is a dangerous moment,"" Panetta said, adding that the risk isn't ""just a missile that goes astray. It's bad judgment. It's somebody who makes a lousy decision.""

Experts and former officials say the nature of the conflict, with uniformed troops from a nuclear-armed power in combat near NATO forces, mean even a limited clash carries more risk.

Others argue a clash with Russia wouldn't necessarily escalate, citing previous encounters — including the Battle of Khasham, an hours-long firefight between US-led and Russian-led forces in northeastern Syria.

The clash on February 7, 2018, was sparked by a pro-Assad regime force, including mercenaries from Russia's Wagner Group, advancing on an outpost manned by US special operators and their Kurdish partners.

Story continues

That night, the pro-regime force opened fire on the outpost with a mix of tanks and large artillery and mortars, according to documents seen by The New York Times. The US force at the outpost — made up of US Army Delta Force, Special Forces, and Rangers — took cover and returned fire with anti-tank missiles and machine guns.

The US and Russia had used a de-confliction line to avoid encounters as they operated in Syria, and US officials used it again at the outset of the attack, asking Russian officials to stop the attack but without success.

When Wagner personnel began to bracket the US position, firing artillery on either side to pinpoint their aim, other US forces were ""cleared hot"" and opened fire, an official told Aaron Stein, director of research at the Foreign Policy Research Institute.

The strikes by US drones, fighter jets, bombers, gunships, attack helicopters, and artillery that followed are believed to have killed 200 to 300 pro-regime fighters, including many Russians. Russian jets were in the air but were held at bay by US aircraft, according to Stein's account.

""The Russian high command in Syria assured us it was not their people,"" then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told senators in April 2018. ""My direction to the Chairman [of the Joint Chiefs] was the force then was to be annihilated. And it was.""

Moscow has close ties to Wagner Group and is Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad's main backer, but it chose to stand aside at Khasham, Stein told Insider.

""The Russians claimed they weren't theirs, and so those guys got lit up and lit up badly,"" Stein said.

The Soviets acted similarly in Cold War conflicts, according to Noel Maurer, a professor of international affairs at George Washington University.

""Some pundits have averred that because the Soviet Union sent its pilots to engage with American air forces in 1951 Korea, then NATO can send its pilots to engage in 2022 Ukraine,"" Maurer said Wednesday, pointing to a New York Times op-ed.

But during that war, Maurer added, Joseph Stalin ""went out of his way to plausibly deny Soviet involvement"" and to signal a desire to avoid escalation ""no matter what.""

""Needless to say, Putin is not maintaining discreet silence, claiming that only proxies are invading Ukraine, or signaling a willingness to lose,"" Maurer said.

Asked about Khasham by Sen. Tom Cotton during a hearing this week, Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, head of US Central Command, said it ""tells you a lot"" about US capabilities and showed that mercenaries would have ""a qualitative disadvantage.""

""Also if they're fighting against an extremely determined people that are digging their heels within their homeland, like the Ukrainian army, that maybe we shouldn't think that they or even Russian regulars are 10 feet tall,"" Cotton said, drawing agreement from McKenzie.

Stein, who has researched and written about the air war over Syria and the Battle of Khasham, said Russia's response to an attack on its forces in Ukraine would differ from its response at Khasham.

""I think the two issues are not comparable in the slightest bit,"" Stein said. ""If you have NATO forces come across that border, the Russians are going to do something. It may not necessarily lead to direct escalation right away, but it's not going to help things.""

He says Russians are preventing supplies from reaching surrounded cities in the center and southeast of the country.

“This is a totally deliberate tactic,” Zelenskyy said in his nighttime video address to the nation, filmed outside in Kyiv, with the presidential office in the lamplight behind him.

He said more than 9,000 people were able to leave besieged Mariupol in the past day, and in all more than 180,000 people have been able to flee to safety through humanitarian corridors.

He again appealed to Russian President Vladimir Putin to hold talks with him directly. “It’s time to meet, time to speak,” he said. “I want to be heard by everyone, especially in Moscow.”

He noted that the 200,000 people Putin gathered in and around a Moscow stadium on Friday for a flag-waving rally was about the same number of Russian troops sent into Ukraine three weeks ago.

Zelenskyy then asked his audience to picture the stadium filled with the thousands of Russians who have been killed, wounded or maimed in the fighting.

OTHER DEVELOPMENTS TODAY:

NEW YORK — Three Russian cosmonauts have arrived at the International Space Station wearing flight suits in yellow and blue colors that match the Ukrainian flag.

The men were the first new arrivals on the space station since the start of the Russian war in Ukraine last month.

Video of one of the cosmonauts taken as the capsule prepared to dock with the space station showed him wearing a blue flight suit. It was unclear what, if any, message the yellow uniforms they changed into were intended to send.

Oleg Artemyev was asked about the yellow flight suits when the newly arrived cosmonauts were able to talk to family back on Earth.

He said every crew chooses its own flight suits, so that they are not all the same.

“It became our turn to pick a color. But in fact, we had accumulated a lot of yellow material so we needed to use it. So that’s why we had to wear yellow,” he said.

Artemyev, Denis Matveyev and Sergey Korsakov blasted off successfully from the Russia-leased Baikonur launch facility in Kazakhstan in their Soyuz MS-21 spacecraft at 8:55 p.m. Friday (11:55 a.m. EDT). They smoothly docked at the station just over three hours later, joining two Russians, four Americans and a German on the orbiting outpost.

LVIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine lost access to the Azov Sea during Russia's siege of the southern port city of Mariupol, the Ukrainian General Staff said late Friday.

Mariupol is the key commercial port on the Azov Sea, which is connected to the much larger Black Sea by a narrow strait.

The General Staff said the Russian forces were still trying to storm Mariupol and the fighting was ongoing. It was unclear from its statement whether the Russians have seized the city.

KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine’s interior minister said Friday that it will take years to defuse unexploded ordnances after the Russian invasion.

Speaking to The Associated Press in the besieged Ukrainian capital, Denys Monastyrsky said that the country will need Western assistance to cope with the massive task once the war is over.

“A huge number of shells and mines have been fired at Ukraine and a large part haven’t exploded, they remain under the rubble and pose a real threat,” Monastyrsky said. “It will take years, not months, to defuse them.”

In addition to the unexploded Russian ordnances, the Ukrainian troops also have planted land mines at bridges, airports and other key infrastructure to prevent Russians from using them.

“We won’t be able to remove the mines from all that territory, so I asked our international partners and colleagues from the European Union and the United States to prepare groups of experts to demine the areas of combat and facilities that came under shelling,” Monastyrsky told the AP.

He noted that another top challenge is dealing with fires caused by the relentless Russian barrages. He said there’s a desperate shortage of personnel and equipment to deal with the fires amid the constant shelling.

UNITED NATIONS — Russia’s first deputy U.N. ambassador says Twitter has blocked his account, accusing him of “abuse and harassment,” due to a tweet about the maternity hospital in the besieged southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol.

“This is very deplorable,” Dmitry Polyansky told reporters after a U.N. Security Council meeting Friday, “and this clearly illustrates how much alternative view and free press, and free information is valued by Twitter and in this country.”

Polyansky, who had more than 22,000 followers and was a prolific Twitter user, said he received a message earlier Friday from Twitter’s cloud service saying he was violating Twitter’s rules and was “engaged in abuse and harassment.”

He said Twitter referred to his warning in a tweet on March 7 “that the hospital in Mariupol had been turned into a military object by radicals. Very disturbing that UN spreads disinformation without verification.”

Associated Press journalists, who have been reporting from inside blockaded Mariupol since early in the war, documented the March 10 attack on the maternity hospital and saw the victims and damage firsthand. They shot video and photos of several bloodstained, pregnant mothers fleeing the blown-out maternity ward as medical workers shouted and children cried.

PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday asked Russian President Vladimir Putin to lift the siege of Mariupol, allow humanitarian access and order an immediate cease-fire, Macron’s office said.

Macron spoke with the Russian leader on the phone for 70 minutes. Earlier in the day, Putin had a conversation with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who also pressed for an immediate cease-fire.

Macron, who has spoken numerous times with Putin, revisited complaints over repeated attacks on civilians and Russia’s failure to respect human rights in Ukraine, the presidential Elysee Palace said.

It said that Putin, in turn, laid the blame for the war on Ukraine.

Macron, who is campaigning to renew his mandate in April elections, said during a town hall-style meeting shortly before the call that he talks to Putin because he believes there is a way toward peace, between the Ukrainian resistance, tough Western sanctions and diplomatic pressure. “We must do everything to find it,” he said.

KYIV, Ukraine — A Ukrainian officer in charge of defending the region around the country’s capital says his forces are well positioned to defend the city.

Maj. Gen. Oleksandr Pavlyuk said in an interview with The Associated Press that “the enemy is halted,” adding that “we are improving this system of defensive lines” to make Kyiv “inapproachable for the enemy.”

Despite three weeks of Russian bombardment, Ukraine has kept up a stiff defense of its cities. Fighting continued in Kyiv’s suburbs, depriving thousands of heat and clean water.

“From time to time, the enemy tests our defenses,” said Pavlyuk, a battle-hardened officer who earned his rank by leading Ukrainian troops in the conflict with Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine that erupted in 2014. “But our boys are strong in their positions and also play an active role in preventing the enemy to fulfill their plans.”

Pavlyuk, who has been put in charge of Kyiv’s defenses earlier this week, said that the Russians are using the same tactics as they used in the east to target civilian structures to try to break Ukraine’s resistance.

“That’s why now that war has been transformed into killing civilians, destroying civilian infrastructure, to frighten our people to the maximum,” he said. “But we will never give up. We will fight until the end. To the last breath and to the last bullet.”

UNITED NATIONS — Six Western nations have accused Russia of using the U.N. Security Council to launder disinformation, spread propaganda, and justify its unprovoked attack on Ukraine. And the U.S. is again warning that Moscow’s claim that the U.S. has biological warfare laboratories in Ukraine “is really a potential false flag effort in action.”

Friday’s council meeting was supposed to be for a vote on Russia’s draft resolution on humanitarian relief for Ukraine which has been widely criticized for making no mention of Moscow’s invasion of its neighbor. Russia instead raised allegations again of U.S. involvement in biological warfare activities, which have been repeatedly denied by both the United States and Ukraine.

The six Western nations — U.S., U.K., France, Albania, Ireland and Norway — delivered a joint statement just before the council session, saying: “This meeting and these lies are designed for one purpose, to deflect responsibility for Russia’s war of choice and the humanitarian catastrophe it has caused.”

They stressed that Russia has long maintained a biological weapons program in violation of international law and has a well-documented history of using chemical weapons — not Ukraine.

“There are no Ukrainian biological weapons laboratories — not near Russia’s border, not anywhere,” U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said.

Reiterating the Biden administration’s serious concern of a potential false flag effort, the U.S. envoy said, “We continue to believe it is possible that Russia may be planning to use chemical or biological agents against the Ukrainian people.”

MOSCOW — The head of the Russian delegation in talks with Ukrainian officials says the parties have come closer to an agreement on a neutral status for Ukraine.

Vladimir Medinsky, who led the Russian negotiators in several rounds of talks with Ukraine, including this week, said Friday that the sides have narrowed their differences on the issue of Ukraine dropping its bid to join NATO and adopting a neutral status.

“The issue of neutral status and no NATO membership for Ukraine is one of the key issues in talks, and that is the issue where the parties have made their positions maximally close,” Medinsky said in remarks carried by Russian news agencies.

He added that the sides are now “half-way” on issues regarding the demilitarization of Ukraine. Medinsky noted that while Kyiv insists that Russia-backed separatist regions in Ukraine’s east must be brought back into the fold, Russia believes that people of the regions must be allowed to determine their fate themselves.

Medinsky noted that a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is possible after the negotiators finalize a draft treaty to end the hostilities and it receives a preliminary approval by the countries’ governments.

Medinsky also bristled at a recent statement by Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Zelenskyy, who called for disrupting railway links to supply Russian troops in Ukraine, saying it could undermine the talks.

LVIV, Ukraine — The president of Belarus, who has allowed Russia to use his country's territory to invade Ukraine, says he has no intention to host Russian nuclear weapons.

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has beefed up military ties with Moscow after Western sanctions over his crackdown on protests after his reelection to a sixth term in an August 2020 vote that the opposition and the West rejected as rigged. He has

Lukashenko had previously offered to host Russian nuclear weapons, but in an interview with Japanese broadcaster TBS released by his office on Friday, he said he has no such plans.

“I’m not planning to deploy nuclear weapons here, produce nuclear weapons here, create and use nuclear weapons against anyone,” he said, dismissing the allegations of such plans as an “invention by the West.”

Lukashenko said that he had made an earlier statement about a possible deployment of Russian nuclear weapons to Belarus in response to the talk in the West about a possible redeployment of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons from Germany to Poland.

The Belarusian leader noted that the constitutional amendments approved in a vote last month that shed Belarus’ neutral status has no relation to nuclear weapons.

GENEVA — The U.N. migration agency estimates that nearly 6.5 million people have now been displaced inside Ukraine, on top of the 3.2 million refugees who have already fled the country.

The estimates from the International Organization for Migration suggests Ukraine is fast on a course in just three weeks toward the levels of displacement from Syria’s devastating war – which has driven about 13 million people from their homes both in the country and abroad.

The findings come in a paper issued Friday by the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. It cited the IOM figures as “a good representation of the scale of internal displacement in Ukraine — calculated to stand at 6.48 million internally displaced persons in Ukraine as of March 16.”

WASHINGTON — There have been no indications that Russia is moving troops out of Syria to bolster its forces in Ukraine, or that any more than a few Syrian fighters have been recruited to join the war, the top U.S. commander for the Middle East said Friday.

Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie told reporters that he has seen little change in Russian military activities in Syria. And he added that the U.S. military still has and uses a deconfliction phone line with the Russians in Syria, in contrast to the mixed success the U.S. has had in maintaining such contact in connection with the Ukraine war.

“We can always contact them if we have a problem. They’ll always pick up the phone, and we feel that we respond in kind to them,” said McKenzie about the Russians, whose forces in Syria support the regime of President Bashar Assad. “That relationship has been very, very professional.”

McKenzie, who is retiring after three years at the head of U.S. Central Command, said he also has seen no indication that Russia is moving any troops or assets from Syria or central Asian countries such as Tajikistan, to Ukraine. And he said he also has seen no evidence that “the temperature is rising” between Russia and the U.S. in Syria as a result of the Ukraine war.

LONDON — Britain’s defense intelligence chief says Russia is shifting to a ”strategy of attrition” after failing to reach its goals in the invasion of Ukraine.

Chief of Defense Intelligence Lt. Gen. Jim Hockenhull says Russian forces have changed their approach after failing to take major Ukrainian cities during the three-week invasion.

He said Friday that the battle of attrition “will involve the reckless and indiscriminate use of firepower. This will result in increased civilian casualties, destruction of Ukrainian infrastructure and intensify the humanitarian crisis.”

Western officials say Russian forces have enough artillery ammunition to keep up the bombardments for weeks or even longer.

Despite the fact that there have been thousands of Ukrainian civilian casualties, Russia denies targeting civilians during what it calls a special military operation in Ukraine.

ROME — For the second time this week, Italy’s financial police have carried out measures to freeze luxurious assets of Russian magnates being sanctioned by the European Union for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The latest action on Friday involved the seaside villa, valued at some 105 million euros ($116 million) and located in the Sardinian town of Portisco, belonging to Alexei Mordaschov, a steel baron, the Italian government said.

Just a few days earlier, a sprawling real estate complex on Sardinia’s coast belonging to Petr Aven, a close associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was sequestered. A yacht moored off the Italian Riviera and belonging to Mordaschov was sequestered earlier this month by Italian authorities. That vessel is valued at 27 million euros ($30 million).

ATLANTA — NASA Administrator Bill Nelson on Friday played down recent comments by the head of Russia’s space agency that the United States would have to use broomsticks to fly to space after Russia said it would stop supplying rocket engines to U.S. companies.

“That’s just Dmitry Rogozin. He spouts off every now and then. But at the end of the day, he’s worked with us,” Nelson told The Associated Press. “The other people that work in the Russian civilian space program, they’re professional. They don’t miss a beat with us, American astronauts and American mission control.”

The war has resulted in canceled spacecraft launches and broken contracts, and many worry Rogozin is putting decades of a peaceful off-planet partnership at risk, most notably at the International Space Station.

NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei is due to leave the International Space Station with two Russians aboard a Soyuz capsule for a touchdown in Kazakhstan on March 30.

NASA has said Vande Hei’s homecoming plans remain unchanged.

WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden and China’s Xi Jinping spoke Friday for nearly two hours via a video call as the White House looks to deter Beijing from providing military or economic assistance for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

China’s Foreign Ministry was the first to issue a readout of the conversation, deploring “conflict and confrontation” as “not in anyone’s interest,” without assigning any blame to Russia.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying in a Twitter message called the U.S. position “overbearing.”

Ahead of the call, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden would question Xi about Beijing’s “rhetorical support” of Putin and an “absence of denunciation” of Russia’s invasion.

LVIV, Ukraine — Satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press show the Russian strike on the Lviv airport Friday destroyed the repair hangar just to the west of the north end of its runway. Firetrucks stood parked amid the rubble.

A row of fighter jets near the hangar appeared intact, though an apparent impact crater sat right in front of them. Two other buildings nearby the hangar also appear to have taken direct hits in the strike, with debris littered around them.

The early morning attack on Lviv’s edge was the closest strike yet to the center of the city, which has become a crossroads for people fleeing from other parts of Ukraine and for others entering to deliver aid or fight. The war has swelled Lviv’s population by some 200,000.

BERLIN — Switzerland is adopting the latest round of European Union sanctions against Russia targeting luxury goods and banning rating agencies from working with Russian clients.

The Swiss government said Friday that it will echo the EU’s fourth package of sanctions imposed on Russia following its attack on Ukraine.

It said that “the ban on the export of luxury goods contained in the new sanctions affects only a small portion of Switzerland’s global exports of such goods.”

However, it said that “specific companies could be seriously affected,” without naming them.

Unlike the EU and the United States, Switzerland has not yet decided whether to remove Russia from its list of “most favored” trading partners.

MARIUPOL, Ukraine — Officials say 130 people have been rescued from the ruins of a theater that served as a shelter when it was blasted by a Russian airstrike Wednesday in the besieged southern city of Mariupol.

Ludmyla Denisova, the Ukrainian parliament’s human rights commissioner, said Friday that 130 people had survived the theater bombing.

“As of now, we know that 130 people have been evacuated, but according to our data, there are still more than 1,300 people in these basements, in this bomb shelter,” Denisova told Ukrainian television. “We pray that they will all be alive, but so far there is no information about them.”

ATHENS, Greece — Greece’s prime minister is offering to rebuild the maternity hospital in Mariupol that was bombed by Russian forces last week.

Kyriakos Mitsotakis tweeted Friday that “Greece is ready to rebuild the maternity hospital in Mariupol, the center of the Greek minority in Ukraine.”

Some 100,000 people of Greek origin were living in the besieged city before the Russian invasion.

Mitsotakis called Mariupol “a city dear to our hearts and symbol of the barbarity of the war.”

Associated Press journalists documented the attack and saw the victims and damage firsthand. They shot video and photos of several bloodstained, pregnant mothers fleeing the blown-out maternity ward as medical workers shouted and children cried.

COPENHAGEN, Denmark — The Finnish government has begun posting information in Russian about the invasion of Ukraine.

“We ... want to provide Russian speakers with fact-based information from the authorities,” the Finnish government tweeted Friday.

The move comes in the face of a Russian propaganda and disinformation campaign that aims to strengthen domestic support for the invasion and undermine the resolve of Ukrainians.

The website of the Finnish government is available in Finnish and Swedish — the Nordic country’s two official languages — and in English.

President Vladimir Putin appeared at a huge patriotic rally Friday at a Moscow stadium on the eighth anniversary of the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine.

Putin, speaking to a crowd of tens of thousands of people waving Russian flags at the Luzhniki Stadium, praised the Russian military for its actions in Ukraine.

“Shoulder to shoulder, they help and support each other,” Putin said in a rare public appearance. “We have not had unity like this for a long time,” he added to cheers from the crowd.

Before Putin spoke, bands played patriotic Soviet songs about national identity and speakers praised Putin as fighting “Nazism” in Ukraine, a claim flatly rejected by leaders across the globe.

Some people, including presenters at the event, wore T-shirts or jackets with a “Z” — a symbol seen on Russian tanks and military vehicles in Ukraine and embraced by supporters of the war.

ROME — Pope Francis has denounced the “perverse abuse of power” on display in Russia’s war in Ukraine. He is calling for aid to Ukrainians who he said had been attacked in their “identity, history and tradition” and were “defending their land.”

Francis’ comments, in a message Friday to a gathering of European Catholic representatives, marked some of his strongest yet in asserting Ukraine’s right to exist as a sovereign state and to defend itself against Russia’s invasion.

It came just days after Francis told the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, that the concept of a “just war” was obsolete since wars are never justifiable and that pastors must preach peace, not politics.

I never had any thought that when I set up the CIA that it would be injected into peacetime cloak and dagger operations."" President Harry Truman ""For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence - on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations. Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed."" President John_F._Kennedy, speech on April 27, 1961

While the rank-and-file military are among the most patriotic of Americans and show unwavering support for the Constitution, there is a class of elite national security establishment who, whatever they may say on ceremonial occasions, believe they are above the Constitution. The ""national security establishment"" is colloquially known as the Deep State. In the past military leaders were part of the ruling class, intelligence agencies did not exist and there were no danger of a rogue national security establishment in 1789. That why for all their brilliance, the Framers of the Constitution did not foresee the emergence this treat. JFK assassination was the Rubicon, they crossed, and the tail started wagging the dog. Brennan 2016 elections machinations were yet another vivid demonstration that the national security establishment spinned out of control.

This threat emerged only after WWII and national security state when Truman established intelligence agencies which comprise the core of the Deep State ( CIA, NSA FBI and Pentagon. Add to this State Department and you get what is called ""Trumanites"". They brought with them the three cornerstone of the USA foreign policy

Exceptionalism - our unique status should exempt us from the rules we expect others to follow.

- our unique status should exempt us from the rules we expect others to follow. Militarism - favor the use of force to advance US security and priority matters of national interest.

- favor the use of force to advance US security and priority matters of national interest. Hegemony - America ought to fight hard not to let any other power challenge our post WWII position.

Gradually the national security bureaucracy became so large and omnipotent that the Madisonian branches of government became mainly ceremonial institution providing legitimacy to the ruling elite via national election. Something like the British House of Lords, symbolically important but in reality without much power. Intelligence agencies Nomenklatura, not Trump, are moving the nation toward autocracy, operated at an increasing removed from constitutional limits and restraints manner (Welcome to the Potemkin Village of Washington Power The American Conservative)

Tufts law professor Michael Glennon points out in a recent essay in Humanitas that the Cold War brought something new and ominous in military-civilian relations. The national security bureaucracy became so large and omnipotent that the Madisonian branches of government became something like the British House of Lords, symbolically important but in reality without much power. The executive, legislature, and judiciary became a kind of Potemkin village, with real national security power lodged in, as Glennon describes it, “a largely concealed managerial directorate, consisting of the several hundred leaders of the military, law enforcement and intelligence departments.” As this bureaucracy grew, Glennon argues, “those managers…operated at an increasing remove from constitutional limits and restraints, moving the nation slowly toward autocracy.” Glennon also points out that, prior to Trump, there was an unwritten pact between the bureaucracy and the Madisonian government: never publicly disagree. While national security policies have long been crafted and maintained by deep state bureaucracies, everyone played along and told the public these were the result of “intense deliberations.” Yet a few people noticed that, whether under Republican or Democrat administrations, national security policies never really changed, intelligence operations were never disrupted, and even peacenik-seeming presidential candidates became warlike presidents. For decades, neither elected officials nor bureaucratic leaders publicly acknowledged that American national security policy was being run by what Glennon describes as a “double government,” with elected officials largely impotent. However, with the staggering intelligence failure that was 9/11 and two protracted and losing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, some have begun to question whether the “grown-ups” in the national security bureaucracy are even competent. Trump gave voice to those concerns in the 2016 campaign, and the result has been a breakdown in the Cold War truce between the two components of the double government. Leaders of the national security establishment, who know they have real power, took precautions in the unlikely event of a Trump victory and then proceeded to try to overturn Trump’s election. When they failed, they partnered with Congress to have Trump removed through impeachment, taking full advantage of the fractured nature of civilian control of national security institutions. Impeachment witnesses, such as Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, have been unanimous in their implicit belief that the foreign policy of the United States should be managed by a professional class of bureaucrats, not by the elected president. The American constitutional order is thus in great peril. Those obsessed with getting rid of the president should consider that, were Trump to be removed, it could be the constitutional equivalent of Julius Caesar’s crossing of the Rubicon.

In the mind of ordinary American the term ""Deep State"" and ""democracy"" happily coexist. Most do not even understand that they are infected with what in famous George Orwell novel 1984 is called ""Doublethink."" The existence of uncontrollable elite in the form of the ""Deep State"" that core of which constitute Wall Street bankers, MIC and the top brass of the intelligence agencies is incompatible with the existence of the democracy, unless we assume that democracy exists for the top 1% or even less of the population. It is something like modernized feudalism for all the rest. This strange, but stable combination is called neoliberalism. As neoliberalism came to power with coup d'état facilitated by thinks tanks specifically created for this purpose (the army of ""professional revolutionaries"" in Bolsheviks terms ;-) neoliberalism and Deep State are closely interrelated. This interrelation is reflected in the Sheldon Wolin term ""Inverted totalitarianism"" which is the actual name of the somewhat strange social order established in the USA since 70th which US propaganda calls democracy.

In a way, the concept of Corporatism and the concept of ""deep state"" are very close. Corporatism presuppose the merger of government and corporations. It can be done openly as was the case in Mussolini Italy, or via back door including the ""revolving door"" mechanism as it was done in the USA. In both case corporations control the government, although in Mussolity case thier absolute power is moderated by the esitable of the fascist party with its program. In the latter case, the case of the USA inverted totalitarism regime a tiny part of power of the ""surface state"" is preserved. But enough to provid the legitimacy to the rule of the ""Deep State"" or ""Inner Party in terms of Orwell dystopia 1984.

Deep State just adds another component to pre-existing since the end of WWII concept of military industrial complex (see Eisenhower warning about MIC which is a warning about the victory of corporatism in the USA ) -- intelligence agencies. With this addition elections became simply device to legitimize the governance of the current elite, with undesirable for the elite candidates filtered before they can compete in election by various means, including radical as was the case with JFK assassination. Elections serve just of Potemkin village legitimizing the candidate that was chosen by tiny elite (the top 1% or 0.1% depending on how you count).

With the exception of deep social crisis like was the case with election of Trump, who definitely was less preferred by the deep state candidate then Hillary Clinton but manage to win )or more correctly the faction of the elite that tanded behind Trump managed to win) due to the crisis of neoliberalism in the USA due to which the current elite lost legitimacy in the eyes of the majority of population. And, especially, working people and lower middle class which constitute the majority of voters. As many observers pointed out, the election of Trump was essentially a middle finger shown to the current neoliberal elite in the USA, particularly the Clinton's wing of Democratic Party which betrayed working class as a part of ""Clintonization"" of the Party in early 90th duing which it became the party of Wall Street and later, under Obama, the second war party. The same happened with Labor Party in the UK under war criminal Blair.

Elections serve just of Potemkin village legitimizing the candidate that was chosen by tiny elite, an important part of which are now intelligence agencies, which acquired political role. The problem of control by the civil society of intelligence agencies so far is unresolved.

We can say that Deep State emerged simultaneously with powerful intelligence agencies after WWII. In case of the USA it was Truman who created added CIA to the roster of intelligence agencies and as such he can be called a godfather of the US deep state. This concept became more well known recently in view of color revolution against Trump launched by Clinton wing of Democratic party (so called ""soft neoliberal"" wing) in association the supporting them elements of intelligence agencies such as State Department, CIA and FBI.

The concept of the Deep State is related to the answer the another fundamental question: Can democracy exists in a state with powerful intelligence agencies like NSA, CIA, FBI (which plays the role of counterintelligence agency in the USA; look at Russiagate) and the State Department (which has functions, which duplicate those of CIA). Thus the concept of the ""deep state"" can be viewed as a reformulation of the iron law of oligarchy on a new level (state level), explaining the role of intelligence agencies as an immanent part of the ruling elite. For example, the neoliberals elite which rules the USA since late 70th (Carter not Reagan was the first neoliberal president of the USA).

The concept of the Deep State is related to the answer the another fundamental question: Can democracy exists in a state with powerful intelligence agencies like NSA, CIA, FBI

Intelligence agencies acquired a special status under corporatism. They became the backbone and the intellectual center of the Media-Military-Industrial Complex (MIC) which also now includes major Wall Street banks (which historically have very close ties with CIA; CIA was formed by lawyers which served their interests such as Allen Dulles). Under neoliberalism the financial oligarchy became an important part of MIC (especially oligarchy of such banks as Goldman Sachs and Citibank)becaue the power of the US military secure their global expansion. Recently Silicon Valley mega corporations also joined it. And all of them are closely connected to NSA and CIA (especially Amazon, Google and Facebook). In a way, military-industrial complex mutated into Media-Military-Financial-Industrial-Silicon Valley complex.

This is a new unelected aristocracy with huge financial resources and zero accountability. Members of this clan stand above law and can't be easily demotes from their positions by civil authorities. They now are a new incarnation of the ""royal court"", or in more modern term Nomenklatura, which can, like in old times, to depose a monarch (or Supreme Leader) or even kill him.

This is a new unelected aristocracy with huge financial resources and zero accountability. Members of this clan stand above law and can't be easily demotes from their positions by civil authorities (on intelligence agencies level, J. Edgar Hoover who managed to die in his official position, much like the USSR members of Politburo, is an excellent example here). They now are a new incarnation of the ""royal court"", or in more modern term Nomenklatura, which can, like in old times, to depose a monarch (or Supreme leader) or even kill him.

So in a way the concept of ""deep state"" implies and emphasizes the hypertrophied role of three letter agencies among unelected government bureaucracy. They are joined at the heap with financial oligarchy, MIC and Silicon Valley in national politics. Especially in formulating foreign policy. Influence of MIC on the US foreign policy is nothing new and power of neocon, who are, in essence, lobbyists of MIC attests that. They dominate the USA foreign policy since then end of WWII. After all one of the most plausible hypotheses of why JFK was killed ( most probably via CIA plot ) because his policies limited the power of intelligences agencies (especially CIA which he hated) and international expansion which Wall Street and MIC depended upon to maintain the current rate of profits.

But devil is always in details and some features of the USA Deep State are unique and different the deep state in other neoliberal countries such as EU, GB, Turkey, or Russia. BTW the term ""deep state"" originated in Turkey.

The ""deep state"" victory over voters and political dominance is always ""incomplete."" The ""surface state"" is still keeping some positions and periodically even try to counterattack deep state in certain areas (Church Committee.) Second, the merger of interests of three letter agencies like CIA/NSA/ FBI also has its own internal contradictions. For example NSA and CIA competes for funds. State Department, which is forth most important intelligence agency in the USA (and the oldest of all four) now lost its independence and can generally be viewed as a subsidiary of CIA, see Emailgate and Strzogate for details ). Alliance of CIA and Wall Street also can never be absolute. They have somewhat different worldviews on both the USA foreign policy priorities and methods of achieving them. Also there is a fierce competition between intelligence agencies for state resources, which pitch, for example, CIA against NSA and both of then against DIA (just look at Sacrifice of Michael Flynn to neocons story). As we can see from Syria war such differences can lead to essentially supporting hostile to each other groups of insurgent while trying to achieve the same color revolution based ""regime change"" in the country.

The statement that relations between three letter agencies are far from harmonious are supported by leaked story about how CIA (' humint "") was very concerned about recent rise of status and capabilities of NSA ("" sigint "") and tried to duplicate its capabilities ( Vault 7 scandal) They lie to each other and try to poach funds from the other agencies. Vault 7 scandal is a strong confirmation that CIA brass is very concerted about increased role and influence of NSA in the era on Internet communications and is trying to counterattack and undermine it.

Add to this a special, more independent, status and role of military intelligence which also now is not in best relations with both CIA and NSA. Destiny of General Flynn, who served as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, and in 2017 was entrapped by FBI with the help of NSA and CIA is a strong sign there not much love left between DIA and other agencies (with DIA probably being the most competent of them all three). So in certain areas they are more like spiders in the cage with CIA perfectly capable attacking NSA and DIA and vise versa. That gives us some hope.

The rise of intelligence agenizes inevitably led to conversion of the state into national security state and we can talk about ""election democracy"" in such state only with great reservations. Yes some freedom to chose candidatures still exist (as Sanders and, possibly, Trump emergence in 2016 elections attests), but the final choice is more often then not is determined by intelligence agencies, not so much by voters (FBI derailing of Sanders in favor of establishment candidate -- Hillary Clinton -- quite vividly attests this fact; not that Sanders fought a good fight in this respect serving more like a sheep dog in the elections).

Two party system invented by elite of Great Britain proved to be perfect for inverted totalitarism type of regimes, including the US neoliberalism. But there is second trend here which increase the elite control of the county: this is dramatic transfer of power to institutions of ""deep state"", which in certain sense now like TBTF are beyond civil control. As well as a secret alliance between Wall Street and CIA and other three letter agencies.

All those factors essentially make Presidential and Congress election in the USA truly optional, serving mostly ceremonial, decorative function. Yes elections still continue to exist and sometime provide good theater, within the strict rules of an emasculated ""two parties, winner takes all"" system, which if you think about it is not that different from one party elections in the USSR.

They still have a role in legitimizing the current rulers, although actual rules are not the same as those who were elected. This is especially true about the two recent US Presidents: George W Bush and Barack Obama. And that explains why Barack Obama foreign policy is essentially a continuation of policy of George W Bush with minor tweaks. Just the fact that neocon Victoria Nuland who worked for Cheney was promoted to the key role of the Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs tells that Obama controls very little in foreign policy area and that 'deep state"" is functioning autonomously and without control of ""surface state"".

The USA political system does not have a single government. It actually has two distinct governments. They are called ""surface state"" or Madisonians and ""deep state"" or Trumanites (national security establishment in alliance with selected members of financial oligarchy, media owners and technocrats). The latter term emerged because it was Harry Truman who signed National Security Act of 1947 which created major three letter agencies (CIA, DOD, FBI and NSA).

Simplifying the complex relation between those two US governments (sometimes Madisonians fight back and have Trumanites to make a temporary retreat) we can say that:

The ""surface state"" exists mainly to provide legitimacy and the illusion of democracy and consist of traditional three branches of government (the Congress, the presidency, and the courts.). elections does not change anything they just a tool for providing legitimacy to government. That explains strange continuity between foreign policies of different presidents (for example Bush and Obama; in the latter case Obama foreign policy was completely opposite is election promised)

(the Congress, the presidency, and the courts.). elections does not change anything they just a tool for providing legitimacy to government. That explains strange continuity between foreign policies of different presidents (for example Bush and Obama; in the latter case Obama foreign policy was completely opposite is election promised) The ""deep state"" is represented by unelected alliance by top level government bureaucrats (and first of intelligence brass of three major intelligence agencies), selected members of financial oligarchy, think tanks, manufactures and media. Its institutions (and first of all three letter agencies and military-industrial complex in general) actually create and implement country foreign policy without any feedback from electorate (Trump complete betrayal of three key foreign policy election promises (detente with Russia, finishing foreign wars and dissolution of NATO) is a nice example of the power and efficiency of this mechanism). A large part of domestic policies (especially national security policy) also created and implemented without any control of electorate and with very little control, if any, of traditional three branches of government. Just look at PATRIOT Act.

In other words, the ""Deep state"" represent the actual government of the society by unelected elite, which is composed of high-level officials within the intelligence services, military, law enforcement, judiciary and, often, organized crime. It should be viewed as an extended and more realistic variant of military industrial complex dominance (see Media-Military-Industrial Complex) as it includes selected members of financial oligarchy along with industrialists, Internet moguls, and media owners. In British author John le Carré’s latest novel, A Delicate Truth, a character describes the Deep State as

“… the ever-expanding circle of non-governmental insiders from banking, industry and commerce who were cleared for highly classified information denied to large swathes of Whitehall and Westminster.”

Conversion of system of governance to ""deep state"" which happened in the USA almost immediately after 1947 essentially made large part of federal elections including Presidential elections optional, but they still continue to exist as a ceremonial function for the sake of providing the legitimacy of the government in an emasculated ""two parties system"" form. While relationship is more complex then simple dominance, in essence ""deep state"" is the tail that wags the dog. And JFK assassination (Nov 22, 1963) meant first of all the triumph of ""deep state"" over ""surface state"". In this sense 9/11 was just the last nail in the coffin of democracy.

The term “Deep State” was coined in Turkey (and actually Wikipedia discusses only it) but it is widespread modern phenomenon which is a typical model of governance in all major neoliberal states, including the USA, GB and France. For example, it able to govern the United States without reference to the consent of the governed as expressed through the formal political process. That's why elected candidates swiftly perform ""bat and switch"" maneuver and conduct polices radically different from those for which they were elected. As any elite dominance project it is deeply anti-democratic although it uses fig leaf of democracy for foreign expansion via color revolutions and wars.

Like in Third Reich, this dominance is supported by relentless propaganda and brainwashing with mechanisms polished since Reagan to perfection. There is now no problem to create an ""enemy of the people"" when the elite wants and it does not matter which country or individual is selected as an enemy. The essence of elite politics in this area was best formulated by Hermann Goering, President of the Reichstag, Nazi Party, and Luftwaffe Commander in Chief

Naturally the common people don't want war: Neither in Russia, nor in England, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the peacemakers for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country.

In other words this is a hidden set of political actors and powerful institutions that are concealed within the wider, “visible” state which, essentially, took over the functions of traditional state, leaving such organization of Executive branch, President, congress and courts mainly ceremonial role. Such transformation is well explained by the Iron Law of Oligarchy and in various forms happened in Third Reich, the USSR, Turkey, China and many other countries.

“When I asked the military advisors if they could assure me that holding fast would not result in the death of five hundred million human beings, they looked at me as though I was out of my mind, or what was worse, a traitor. The biggest tragedy, as they saw it, was not that our country might be devastated and everything lost, but that the Chinese or the Albanians might accuse us of appeasement or weakness. So I said to myself, “To hell with these maniacs. If I can get the United States to assure me that it will not attempt to overthrow the Cuban government, I will remove the missiles.” That is what happened, and now I am reviled by the Chinese and the Albanians.… They say I was afraid to stand up to a paper tiger. It is all such nonsense. What good would it have done me in the last hour of my life to know that though our great nation and the United States were in complete ruins, the national honor of the Soviet Union was intact? “ “When I asked the military advisors if they could assure me that holding fast would not result in the death of five hundred million human beings, they looked at me as though I was out of my mind, or what was worse, a traitor.

Daniel Ellsberg The Doomsday Machine Talks at Google was very interesting talk in which he described why Washington establishment is pro-war as it is (full transcript is availbe from The Singju Post ). In it he addresses how the regime of secrecy allows to built multi-layer lies, which justify of even make noble any criminal action by the US government:

But what made that dangerous at any time, then or now? And the answer was that the government secrets that they were holding onto were secrets about criminal activity, actions that would be extremely embarrassing to a president, because they were illegal or unconstitutional or simply incredibly reckless, dangerous, horrible priorities, unlikely ever to succeed in any sense or to end. The public would not have applauded if they understood the actual strategy and the actual prospects. ... ... ... Every member of Congress has taken that oath. Every member of the Executive Department has taken that same oath. The president’s wording is a little bit different, protect, preserve and defend or something. But support and defend, everybody else takes it.



And all of us violated it every day. we heard the president lying to Congress and lying to the public about what he intended, where the prospects were, what he was going to do in Vietnam, elsewhere. We all heard the president lying the public into a war, keeping the war going, letting him know the costs would be much less than internal estimates all indicated. And no one broke.



There were no leaks, including me. So was I observing that oath or violating it, when I knew that Congress, which has the exclusive authority to take us to war, at least that’s the best interpretation, I think, controverted by president’s men, was entirely delegating that secretly to a president who was determined to enlarge the war. That’s how you get wars that go on 10 years or 11 years, whatever.



The truth is the United States, as I learned from the Pentagon Papers, when I read all of them, had begun the war in 1945 and ’46, supporting a French effort to reconquer a colony which had declared its independence in August and September of 1945. And actually Ho Chi Minh had been recognized as a head of state, at least of the north, in Paris when they were negotiating in ’45, ’46.

... ... ... But in terms of American traditions, we thought of ourselves as– we didn’t think– of having run the first war of national liberation. But it could have been called that, the first war of separation for an empire. And we thought of ourselves as anti-imperial. And we still think of ourselves that way, as not an empire like the others. That’s false. That’s very clear from the Pentagon Papers where we’re deciding who should run Vietnam this year or next year or how they should stay in power, what criminal acts they’re entitled to take, how much we need to support them. And so it’s very obviously the documents of an empire. In fact, that’s what I said to my wife, when she said, at one point, before they came out, does it really matter to get this history out? And I said, well, among other things, it’s the first real history of imperial operations since the Nuremberg documents were discovered, covered after the Second World War. And before that, it probably goes back to Punic times, to the Syrian empire, to Sumerian empire, and so probably all the same, but we don’t have the documents for it. And here they are. And yet, even so, I managed to think of it as an aberration. We had somehow gotten ourselves into acting like an empire. Let me say just very briefly now– I could spend the whole time on this. But I’ll just say, I’ve come recently to see what we are as a covert empire. And covert refers to plausibly denial covert operations.



Covert operations, I should say, are defined as operations that are not just secret, that you’re not just keeping it safe, but that you lie about plausibly. And to make it plausible, you provide in advance evidence, false evidence, misleading evidence as to what’s really going on and who’s running it and why it’s happening and who did it and so forth, a false flag in some cases, whatever.



But you provide several layers of cover for what’s being done to protect the president from the notion that he is murdering, overthrowing governments, installing coup governments in democracies and so forth, as so often in the third world then and now, up until now. Well, you don’t want the US to be associated with that. It’s happening over there.



And if somehow a US hand surfaces, he or she wasn’t working for any agency. And if you find the agency, it wasn’t the CIA. And if it was the CIA, it wasn’t the president. So you have layer after layer of cover stories with documents. I didn’t know this. It didn’t come to my attention. This so-and-so did it and so forth. The Vietnam War was run from beginning to end like that. That’s how we run our empire. We deny that we are an empire. And what is an empire? A country that determines the regime of other countries, decides who the police chief was, who shall live and who shall die, what the basic foreign policies are. We do that throughout Central America and always have, often many other parts of the world as far apart as Indonesia, now the Middle East. In general, we decide: Who do we want? Is this guy OK? We don’t decide every detail but any more than you decide every detail of a military commander’s operations. But generally, they work. If they don’t do what we want, we replace them with somebody else. We deny that we’re an empire. We’re against empire. When other people do the same sort of thing, they’re empires. They’re acting imperially. First level of denial on the American part. And then second, how do they get in power? Who has to be killed? What paramilitary forces have to be paid and go in, as into Nicaragua, for example, and other places? So the efforts are also plausibly denied OK, I could spend time. And I don’t know if people have it in mind. ... ... ... And, by the way, “The Day After” is just a tiny, little sliver of what the actual consequences of a nuclear war would look like. Movies that have come closer to that, there’s one called “Threads” in England that they’ve never allowed to be on BBC, to be shown. And again, it really just focuses on the long-term degradation and disintegration of everything, like Cormac McCarthy’s “The Road,” pretty much.



So no nuclear state has ever been willing to tell its own people or to hold others accountable to the risks we are posing over their head. And a movie like that today would be very worthwhile. But I don’t know what prospect there is of it.





Here is how The American Conservative covers this topic:

Steve Sailer links to this unsettling essay by former career Congressional staffer Mike Lofgren, who says the “deep state” — the Washington-Wall-Street-Silicon-Valley Establishment — is a far greater threat to liberty than you think. The partisan rancor and gridlock in Washington conceals a more fundamental and pervasive agreement. Excerpts: These are not isolated instances of a contradiction; they have been so pervasive that they tend to be disregarded as background noise. During the time in 2011 when political warfare over the debt ceiling was beginning to paralyze the business of governance in Washington, the United States government somehow summoned the resources to overthrow Muammar Ghaddafi’s regime in Libya, and, when the instability created by that coup spilled over into Mali, provide overt and covert assistance to French intervention there. At a time when there was heated debate about continuing meat inspections and civilian air traffic control because of the budget crisis, our government was somehow able to commit $115 million to keeping a civil war going in Syria and to pay at least £100m to the United Kingdom’s Government Communications Headquarters to buy influence over and access to that country’s intelligence. Since 2007, two bridges carrying interstate highways have collapsed due to inadequate maintenance of infrastructure, one killing 13 people. During that same period of time, the government spent $1.7 billion constructing a building in Utah that is the size of 17 football fields. This mammoth structure is intended to allow the National Security Agency to store a yottabyte of information, the largest numerical designator computer scientists have coined. A yottabyte is equal to 500 quintillion pages of text. They need that much storage to archive every single trace of your electronic life. Yes, there is another government concealed behind the one that is visible at either end of Pennsylvania Avenue, a hybrid entity of public and private institutions ruling the country according to consistent patterns in season and out, connected to, but only intermittently controlled by, the visible state whose leaders we choose. My analysis of this phenomenon is not an exposé of a secret, conspiratorial cabal; the state within a state is hiding mostly in plain sight, and its operators mainly act in the light of day. Nor can this other government be accurately termed an “establishment.” All complex societies have an establishment, a social network committed to its own enrichment and perpetuation. In terms of its scope, financial resources and sheer global reach, the American hybrid state, the Deep State, is in a class by itself. That said, it is neither omniscient nor invincible. The institution is not so much sinister (although it has highly sinister aspects) as it is relentlessly well entrenched. Far from being invincible, its failures, such as those in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya, are routine enough that it is only the Deep State’s protectiveness towards its higher-ranking personnel that allows them to escape the consequences of their frequent ineptitude.

More: Washington is the most important node of the Deep State that has taken over America, but it is not the only one. Invisible threads of money and ambition connect the town to other nodes. One is Wall Street, which supplies the cash that keeps the political machine quiescent and operating as a diversionary marionette theater. Should the politicians forget their lines and threaten the status quo, Wall Street floods the town with cash and lawyers to help the hired hands remember their own best interests. The executives of the financial giants even have de facto criminal immunity. On March 6, 2013, testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Attorney General Eric Holder stated the following: “I am concerned that the size of some of these institutions becomes so large that it does become difficult for us to prosecute them when we are hit with indications that if you do prosecute, if you do bring a criminal charge, it will have a negative impact on the national economy, perhaps even the world economy.” This, from the chief law enforcement officer of a justice system that has practically abolished the constitutional right to trial for poorer defendants charged with certain crimes. It is not too much to say that Wall Street may be the ultimate owner of the Deep State and its strategies, if for no other reason than that it has the money to reward government operatives with a second career that is lucrative beyond the dreams of avarice — certainly beyond the dreams of a salaried government employee. [3] The corridor between Manhattan and Washington is a well trodden highway for the personalities we have all gotten to know in the period since the massive deregulation of Wall Street: Robert Rubin, Lawrence Summers, Henry Paulson, Timothy Geithner and many others. Not all the traffic involves persons connected with the purely financial operations of the government: In 2013, General David Petraeus joined KKR (formerly Kohlberg Kravis Roberts) of 9 West 57th Street, New York, a private equity firm with $62.3 billion in assets. KKR specializes in management buyouts and leveraged finance. General Petraeus’ expertise in these areas is unclear. His ability to peddle influence, however, is a known and valued commodity. Unlike Cincinnatus, the military commanders of the Deep State do not take up the plow once they lay down the sword. Petraeus also obtained a sinecure as a non-resident senior fellow at theBelfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard. The Ivy League is, of course, the preferred bleaching tub and charm school of the American oligarchy. Lofgren goes on to say that Silicon Valley is a node of the Deep State too, and that despite the protestations of its chieftains against NSA spying, it’s a vital part of the Deep State’s apparatus. More: The Deep State is the big story of our time. It is the red thread that runs through the war on terrorism, the financialization and deindustrialization of the American economy, the rise of a plutocratic social structure and political dysfunction. Washington is the headquarters of the Deep State, and its time in the sun as a rival to Rome, Constantinople or London may be term-limited by its overweening sense of self-importance and its habit, as Winwood Reade said of Rome, to “live upon its principal till ruin stared it in the face.” Read the whole thing. Steve Sailer says that the Shallow State is a complement to the Deep State. The Shallow State is, I think, another name for what the Neoreactionaries call “The Cathedral,” defined thus: The Cathedral — The self-organizing consensus of Progressives and Progressive ideology represented by the universities, the media, and the civil service. A term coined by blogger Mencius Moldbug. The Cathedral has no central administrator, but represents a consensus acting as a coherent group that condemns other ideologies as evil. Community writers have enumerated the platform of Progressivism as women’s suffrage, prohibition, abolition, federal income tax, democratic election of senators, labor laws, desegregation, popularization of drugs, destruction of traditional sexual norms, ethnic studies courses in colleges, decolonization, and gay marriage. A defining feature of Progressivism is that “you believe that morality has been essentially solved, and all that’s left is to work out the details.” Reactionaries see Republicans as Progressives, just lagging 10-20 years behind Democrats in their adoption of Progressive norms. You don’t have to agree with the Neoreactionaries on what they condemn — women’s suffrage? desegregation? labor laws? really?? — to acknowledge that they’re onto something about the sacred consensus that all Right-Thinking People share. I would love to see a study comparing the press coverage from 9/11 leading up to the Iraq War with press coverage of the gay marriage issue from about 2006 till today. Specifically, I’d be curious to know about how thoroughly the media covered the cases against the policies that the Deep State and the Shallow State decided should prevail. I’m not suggesting a conspiracy here, not at all. I’m only thinking back to how it seemed so obvious to me in 2002 that we should go to war with Iraq, so perfectly clear that the only people who opposed it were fools or villains. The same consensus has emerged around same-sex marriage. I know how overwhelmingly the news media have believed this for some time, such that many American journalists simply cannot conceive that anyone against same-sex marriage is anything other than a fool or a villain. Again, this isn’t a conspiracy; it’s in the nature of the thing. Lofgren: Cultural assimilation is partly a matter of what psychologist Irving L. Janis called “groupthink,” the chameleon-like ability of people to adopt the views of their superiors and peers. This syndrome is endemic to Washington: The town is characterized by sudden fads, be it negotiating biennial budgeting, making grand bargains or invading countries. Then, after a while, all the town’s cool kids drop those ideas as if they were radioactive. As in the military, everybody has to get on board with the mission, and questioning it is not a career-enhancing move. The universe of people who will critically examine the goings-on at the institutions they work for is always going to be a small one. As Upton Sinclair said, “It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.” A more elusive aspect of cultural assimilation is the sheer dead weight of the ordinariness of it all once you have planted yourself in your office chair for the 10,000th time. Government life is typically not some vignette from an Allen Drury novel about intrigue under the Capitol dome. Sitting and staring at the clock on the off-white office wall when it’s 11:00 in the evening and you are vowing never, ever to eat another piece of takeout pizza in your life is not an experience that summons the higher literary instincts of a would-be memoirist. After a while, a functionary of the state begins to hear things that, in another context, would be quite remarkable, or at least noteworthy, and yet that simply bounce off one’s consciousness like pebbles off steel plate: “You mean the number of terrorist groups we are fighting is classified?” No wonder so few people are whistle-blowers, quite apart from the vicious retaliation whistle-blowing often provokes: Unless one is blessed with imagination and a fine sense of irony, growing immune to the curiousness of one’s surroundings is easy. To paraphrase the inimitable Donald Rumsfeld, I didn’t know all that I knew, at least until I had had a couple of years away from the government to reflect upon it. When all you know is the people who surround you in your professional class bubble and your social circles, you can think the whole world agrees with you, or should. It’s probably not a coincidence that the American media elite live, work, and socialize in New York and Washington, the two cities that were attacked on 9/11, and whose elites — political, military, financial — were so genuinely traumatized by the events. Anyway, that’s just a small part of it, about how the elite media manufacture consent. Here’s a final quote, one from the Moyers interview with Lofgren: BILL MOYERS: If, as you write, the ideology of the Deep State is not democrat or republican, not left or right, what is it? MIKE LOFGREN: It’s an ideology. I just don’t think we’ve named it. It’s a kind of corporatism. Now, the actors in this drama tend to steer clear of social issues. They pretend to be merrily neutral servants of the state, giving the best advice possible on national security or financial matters. But they hold a very deep ideology of the Washington consensus at home, which is deregulation, outsourcing, de-industrialization and financialization. And they believe in American exceptionalism abroad, which is boots on the ground everywhere, it’s our right to meddle everywhere in the world. And the result of that is perpetual war. This can’t last. We’d better hope it can’t last. And we’d better hope it unwinds peacefully. I, for one, remain glad that so many of us Americans are armed. When the Deep State collapses — and it will one day — it’s not going to be a happy time. Questions to the room: Is a Gorbachev for the Deep State conceivable? That is, could you foresee a political leader emerging who could unwind the ideology and apparatus of the Deep State, and not only survive, but succeed? Or is it impossible for the Deep State to allow such a figure to thrive? Or is the Deep State, like the Soviet system Gorbachev failed to reform, too entrenched and too far gone to reform itself? If so, what then?

The second important thinker in this area is Professor Michael J. Glennon who wrote the book “National Security and Double Government.”. The strong point of his views on the subject is that he assumes that there is an internal struggle between those two forms of government, not just passive submission one to another, but in most cases deep state prevails. This move led the USA ""beyond a mere imperial presidency to a bifurcated system — a structure of double government — in which even the President now exercises little substantive control over the overall direction of U.S. national security policy.""

The ""deep state"" (call by Professor Michael J. Glennon) The Trumanites, exercise their power due to alliance with Wall Street, almost unlimited funding (with many hidden sources belong US budget), higher efficiency, abuse of secrecy, exaggerated threats, peer pressure to conform, and corruption of the key decision-makers.

Here is how Amazon reviewer Mal Warwick summarized the book in his review written on December 22, 2014

Who makes national security decisions? Not who you think! Why does Barack Obama's performance on national security issues in the White House contrast so strongly with his announced intentions as a candidate in 2008? After all, not only has Obama continued most of the Bush policies he decried when he ran for the presidency, he has doubled down on government surveillance, drone strikes, and other critical programs. Michael J. Glennon set out to answer this question in his unsettling new book, National Security and Double Government. And he clearly dislikes what he found. The answer, Glennon discovered, is that the US government is divided between the three official branches of the government, on the one hand — the ""Madisonian"" institutions incorporated into the Constitution — and the several hundred unelected officials who do the real work of a constellation of military and intelligence agencies, on the other hand. These officials, called ""Trumanites"" in Glennon's parlance for having grown out of the national security infrastructure established under Harry Truman, make the real decisions in the area of national security. (To wage the Cold War, Truman created the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Department of Defense, the CIA, the NSA, and the National Security Council.) ""The United States has, in short,"" Glennon writes, ""moved beyond a mere imperial presidency to a bifurcated system — a structure of double government — in which even the President now exercises little substantive control over the overall direction of U.S. national security policy. . . . The perception of threat, crisis, and emergency has been the seminal phenomenon that has created and nurtures America's double government."" If Al Qaeda hadn't existed, the Trumanite network would have had to create it — and, Glennon seems to imply, might well have done so. The Trumanites wield their power with practiced efficiency, using secrecy, exaggerated threats, peer pressure to conform, and the ability to mask the identity of the key decision-maker as their principal tools. Michael J. Glennon comes to this task with unexcelled credentials. A professor of international law at Tufts and former legal counsel for the Senate Armed Services Committee, he came face to face on a daily basis with the ""Trumanites"" he writes about. National Security and Double Government is exhaustively researched and documented: notes constitute two-thirds of this deeply disturbing little book. The more I learn about how politics and government actually work — and I've learned a fair amount in my 73 years — the more pessimistic I become about the prospects for democracy in America. In some ways, this book is the most worrisome I've read over the years, because it implies that there is no reason whatsoever to think that things can ever get better. In other words, to borrow a phrase from the Borg on Star Trek, ""resistance is futile."" That's a helluva takeaway, isn't it? On reflection, what comes most vividly to mind is a comment from the late Chalmers Johnson on a conference call in which I participated several years ago. Johnson, formerly a consultant to the CIA and a professor at two campuses of the University of California (Berkeley and later San Diego), was the author of many books, including three that awakened me to many of the issues Michael Glennon examines: Blowback, The Sorrows of Empire, and Nemesis. Johnson, who was then nearly 80 and in declining health, was asked by a student what he would recommend for young Americans who want to combat the menace of the military-industrial complex. ""Move to Vancouver,"" he said.

Another good summary of the book can be found is review by Bruce Morgan (Shadow Government )

October 28, 2014 | Tufts Now Elected officials are no longer in charge of our national security—and that is undermining our democracy, says the Fletcher School's Michael Glennon ""We are clearly on the path to autocracy,"" says Michael Glennon. ""There's no question that if we continue on that path, [the] Congress, the courts and the presidency will ultimately end up . . . as institutional museum pieces."" Photo: Kelvin Ma Michael Glennon knew of the book, and had cited it in his classes many times, but he had never gotten around to reading the thing from cover to cover. Last year he did, jolted page after page with its illuminating message for our time. The book was The English Constitution, an analysis by 19th-century journalist Walter Bagehot that laid bare the dual nature of British governance. It suggested that one part of government was for popular consumption, and another more hidden part was for real, consumed with getting things done in the world. As he read, Glennon, a professor of international law at the Fletcher School, where he also teaches constitutional law, saw distinct parallels with the current American political scene. He decided to explore the similarities in a 30-page paper that he sent around to a number of his friends, asking them to validate or refute his argument. As it happens, Glennon's friends were an extraordinarily well-informed bunch, mostly seasoned operatives in the CIA, the U.S. State Department and the military. ""Look,"" he told them. ""I'm thinking of writing a book. Tell me if this is wrong."" Every single one responded, ""What you have here is exactly right."" Expanded from that original brief paper, Glennon's book National Security and Double Government (Oxford University Press) takes our political system to task, arguing that the people running our government are not our visible elected officials but high-level—and unaccountable—bureaucrats nestled atop government agencies. Glennon's informed critique of the American political system comes from a place of deep regard. Glennon says he can remember driving into Washington, D.C., in the late spring of 1973, at the time of the Senate Watergate hearings, straight from law school at the University of Minnesota, to take his first job as assistant legislative counsel to the U.S. Senate. Throughout his 20s, he worked in government, culminating in his position as legal counsel to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee under Sen. Frank Church from 1977 to 1980. Since entering academic life in the early 1980s, Glennon has been a frequent consultant to government agencies of all stripes, as well as a regular commentator on media outlets such as NPR's All Things Considered, the Today show and Nightline. In his new book, an inescapable sadness underlies the narrative. ""I feel a great sense of loss,"" Glennon admits. ""I devoted my life to these [democratic] institutions, and it's not easy to see how to throw the current trends into reverse."" Tufts Now spoke with Glennon recently to learn more of his perspective. Tufts Now: You've been both an insider and an outsider with regard to government affairs. What led you to write this book? Michael Glennon: I was struck by the strange continuity in national security policy between the Bush administration and the Obama administration. Obama, as a candidate, had been eloquent and forceful in criticizing many aspects of the Bush administration's national security policies, from drone strikes to Guantanamo to surveillance by the National Security Agency—the NSA—to covert operations. Yet as president, it turned out that he made very, very few changes in these policies. So I thought it was useful to explain the reason for that. Were you surprised by the continuity? I was surprised by the extent of it. I knew fundamentally from my own experience that changing national policies is like trying to change the course of an aircraft carrier. These policies in many ways were set long ago, and the national security bureaucracy tends to favor the status quo. Still, I thought that a president like Obama would, with the political wind in his sails and with so much public and congressional support for what he was criticizing, be more successful in fulfilling his promises. You use the phrase ""double government,"" coined by Walter Bagehot in the 1860s. What did he mean by that? Walter Bagehot was one of the founders of the Economist magazine. He developed the theory of ""double government,"" which in a nutshell is this. He said Britain had developed two sets of institutions. First came ""dignified"" institutions, the monarchy and the House of Lords, which were for show and which the public believed ran the government. But in fact, he suggested, this was an illusion. These dignified institutions generate legitimacy, but it was a second set of institutions, which he called Britain's ""efficient"" institutions, that actually ran the government behind the scenes. These institutions were the House of Commons, the Cabinet and the prime minister. This split allowed Britain to move quietly from a monarchy to what Bagehot called a ""concealed republic."" The thesis of my book is that the United States has also drifted into a form of double government, and that we have our own set of ""dignified"" institutions—Congress, the presidency and the courts. But when it comes to national security policy, these entities have become largely for show. National security policy is now formulated primarily by a second group of officials, namely the several hundred individuals who manage the agencies of the military, intelligence and law enforcement bureaucracy responsible for protecting the nation's security. What are some components of this arrangement? The NSA, the FBI, the Pentagon and elements of the State Department, certainly; generally speaking, law enforcement, intelligence and the military entities of the government. It's a diverse group, an amorphous group, with no leader and no formal structure, that has come to dominate the formation of American national security policy to the point that Congress, the presidency and the courts all defer to it. You call this group the ""Trumanite network"" in your book. What's the link to Harry Truman? It was in Truman's administration that the National Security Act of 1947 was enacted. This established the CIA and the National Security Council and centralized the command of the U.S. military. It was during the Truman administration as well that the National Security Agency [NSA] was set up, in 1952, although that was a secret and didn't come to light for many years thereafter. In contrast to the Trumanites you set the ""Madisonians."" How would you describe them? The Madisonian institutions are the three constitutionally established branches of the federal government: Congress, the judiciary and the president. They are perceived by the public as the entities responsible for the formulation of national security policy, but that belief is largely mistaken. The idea is driven by regular exceptions. You can always point to specific instances in which, say, the president personally ordered the killing of Osama bin Laden or Congress enacted the War Powers Resolution. But these are exceptions. The norm is that as a general matter, these three branches defer to the Trumanite network, and that's truer all the time. So the trend is toward increased power on the Trumanite side of the ledger. Correct. If that's true, why has there not been a greater outcry from the public, the media—all the observers we have? I think the principal reason is that even sophisticated students of government operate under a very serious misunderstanding. They believe that the political system is self-correcting. They believe the framers set up a system of government setting power against power, and ambition against ambition, and that an equilibrium would be reached, and that any abuse of power would be checked, and arbitrary power would be prevented. That is correct as far as it goes, but the reality is that's only half the picture. The other half is that Madison and his colleagues believed that for equilibrium to occur, we would have an informed and engaged citizenry. Lacking that, the entire system corrupts, because individuals are elected to office who do not resist encroachments on the power of their branches of government, and the whole equilibrium breaks down. What role, if any, have the media played? The media have pretty much been enablers. Although there are a handful of investigative journalists who have done a heroic job of uncovering many of the abuses, they are the exception, for a number of reasons. Number one, the media are a business and have a bottom line. It takes a huge amount of money to fund an investigative journalist who goes about finding sources over a period of years. Very few newspapers or television concerns have those sorts of deep pockets. Second, access for the press is everything. There is huge incentive to pull punches, and you don't get interviews with top-ranking officials at the NSA or CIA if you're going to offer hard-hitting questions. Look, for example, at the infamous 60 Minutes puff piece on the NSA, a really tragic example of how an otherwise respectable institution can sell its soul and act like an annex of the NSA in order to get some people it wants on the TV screen. What is the role of terror in this environment? The whole transfer of power from the Madisonian institutions to the Trumanite network has been fueled by a sense of emergency deriving from crisis, deriving from fear. It's fear of terrorism more than anything else that causes the American people to increasingly be willing to dispense with constitutional safeguards to ensure their safety. Madison believed that government has two great objects. One object of a constitution is to enable the government to protect the people, specifically from external attacks. The other great object of a constitution is to protect the people from the government. The better able the government is to protect the people from external threats, the greater the threat posed by the government to the people. You've been involved with the U.S. government for 40 years. How has your view of government changed? Double government was certainly a factor in the 1970s, but it was challenged for the first time thanks to the activism stemming from the civil rights movement, Vietnam and Watergate. As a result, there were individuals in Congress—Democrats and Republicans like William Fulbright, Frank Church, Jacob Javits, Charles Mathias and many others—who were willing to stand up and insist upon adherence to constitutionally ordained principles. That led to a wave of activism and to the enactment of a number of pieces of reform legislation. But there is no final victory in Washington. Those reforms have gradually been eaten away and turned aside. I think today we are in many ways right back where we were in the early 1970s. NSA surveillance is an example of that. The Church Committee uncovered something called Operation Shamrock, in which the NSA had assembled a watch list of antiwar and civil rights activists based upon domestic surveillance. Church warned at the time that NSA capabilities were so awesome that if they were ever turned inward on the American people, this nation would cross an abyss from which there is no return. The question is whether we have recently crossed that abyss. To what degree are we still a functioning democracy? I'm sure you know that President Jimmy Carter told a German reporter last year that he thought we no longer qualified as a democracy because of our domestic surveillance. We are clearly on the path to autocracy, and you can argue about how far we are down that path. But there's no question that if we continue on that path, America's constitutionally established institutions—Congress, the courts and the presidency—will ultimately end up like Britain's House of Lords and monarchy, namely as institutional museum pieces.

Here is how Christopher Bellavita in Homeland Security Watch summarize an interesting discussion at Cato think tank which I highly recommend to watch:

That’s the question Michael J. Glennon asks in his book “National Security and Double Government.”

His answer: national security policy is determined largely by “the several hundred managers of the military, intelligence, diplomatic, and law enforcement agencies who are responsible for protecting the nation and who have come to operate largely immune from constitutional and electoral restraints.” The president, congress and the courts play largely a symbolic role in national security policy, Glennon claims. You can read a Harvard National Security Journal article that outlines Glennon’s argument at this link: http://harvardnsj.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Glennon-Final.pdf. The paper is not an especially easy read, but I found it to be well researched and – for me – persuasive. His book adds more analysis to the argument, using (from Graham Allison’s Essence of Decision) the rational actor model, the government politics model, and the organizational behavior model. Glennon extends that framework by discussing culture, networks, and the myth of alternative competing hypotheses. The book is richer, in my opinion. But the core of Glennon’s position is in the paper. This link takes you to a video of Glennon talking about his book at the Cato Institute: http://www.cato.org/events/national-security-double-government (the talk starts at the 5:20 mark). From the Cato site: In National Security and Double Government, Michael Glennon examines the continuity in U.S. national security policy from the Bush administration to the Obama administration. Glennon explains the lack of change by pointing to the enervation of America’s “Madisonian institutions,” namely, the Congress, the presidency, and the courts. In Glennon’s view, these institutions have been supplanted by a “Trumanite network” of bureaucrats who make up the permanent national security state. National security policymaking has been removed from public view and largely insulated from law and politics. Glennon warns that leaving security policy in the hands of the Trumanite network threatens Americans’ liberties and the republican form of government. Some blurb reviews: “If constitutional government is to endure in the United States, Americans must confront the fundamental challenges presented by this chilling analysis of the national security state.”

“Glennon shows how the underlying national security bureaucracy in Washington – what might be called the deep state – ensures that presidents and their successors act on the world stage like Tweedledee and Tweedledum.” John J. Mearsheimer

“National Security and Double Government is brilliant, deep, sad, and vastly learned across multiple fields–a work of Weberian power and stature. It deserves to be read and discussed. The book raises philosophical questions in the public sphere in a way not seen at least since Fukuyama’s end of history.” David A. Westbrook

is brilliant, deep, sad, and vastly learned across multiple fields–a work of Weberian power and stature. It deserves to be read and discussed. The book raises philosophical questions in the public sphere in a way not seen at least since Fukuyama’s end of history.” “In our faux democracy, those we elect to govern serve largely ornamental purposes, while those who actually wield power, especially in the realm of national security, do so chiefly with an eye toward preserving their status and prerogatives. Read this incisive and richly documented book, and you’ll understand why.” Andrew J. Bacevich

“…Michael Glennon provides a compelling argument that America’s national security policy is growing outside the bounds of existing government institutions. This is at once a constitutional challenge, but is also a case study in how national security can change government institutions, create new ones, and, in effect, stand-up a parallel state….” Vali Nasr

“Instead of being responsive to citizens or subject to effective checks and balances, U.S. national security policy is in fact conducted by a shadow government of bureaucrats and a supporting network of think tanks, media insiders, and ambitious policy wonks. Presidents may come and go, but the permanent national security establishment inevitably defeats their efforts to chart a new course….”Stephen M. Walt, Robert and Renee Belfer I’ve spoken to three people I consider to be members of the “shadow national security state.” One person said Glennon’s argument is nothing new. The second told me he’s got it exactly right. The third said it’s even worse.

If Michael Glennon conceded defeat, but still has some hope, here we enter perfect Dante hell picture along the lines ""Leave all hopes those who dare to enter""

Professor Peter Dale Scott book and article represent probably the most comprehensive coverage, especially his book. But the article in the Asia-Pacific journal represents fair summary of his views on the subject (The State, the Deep State, and the Wall Street Overworld (Updated March 13, 2014):

In the last decade it has become more and more obvious that we have in America today what the journalists Dana Priest and William Arkin have called two governments: the one its citizens were familiar with, operated more or less in the open: the other a parallel top secret government whose parts had mushroomed in less than a decade into a gigantic, sprawling universe of its own, visible to only a carefully vetted cadre – and its entirety…visible only to God.1 And in 2013, particularly after the military return to power in Egypt, more and more authors referred to this second level as America’s “deep state.”2 Here for example is the Republican analyst Mike Lofgren: There is the visible government situated around the Mall in Washington, and then there is another, more shadowy, more indefinable government that is not explained in Civics 101 or observable to tourists at the White House or the Capitol. The former is traditional Washington partisan politics: the tip of the iceberg that a public watching C-SPAN sees daily and which is theoretically controllable via elections. The subsurface part of the iceberg I shall call the Deep State, which operates according to its own compass heading regardless of who is formally in power.3 At the end of 2013 a New York Times Op-Ed noted this trend, and even offered a definition of the term that will work for the purposes of this essay: DEEP STATE n. A hard-to-perceive level of government or super-control that exists regardless of elections and that may thwart popular movements or radical change. Some have said that Egypt is being manipulated by its deep state.4 The political activities of the deep state are the chief source and milieu of what I have elsewhere called “deep politics:” “all those political practices and arrangements, deliberate or not, which are usually repressed rather than acknowledged.”5 Others, like Tom Hayden, call the deep state a “state within the state,” and suggest it may be responsible for the failure of the Obama administration to follow the policy guidelines of the president’s speeches: We have seen evidence of a ""state within the state"" before, going back as far as the CIA's operations against Cuba. In Obama's time, the president correctly named the 2009 coup in Honduras a ""coup"", and then seemed powerless to prevent it.6 This development of a two-level or dual state has been paralleled by two other dualities: the increasing resolution of American society into two classes – the “one percent” and the “ninety-nine percent” – and the bifurcation of the U.S. economy into two aspects: the domestic, still subject to some governmental regulation and taxation, and the international, relatively free from governmental controls.7 All three developments have affected and intensified each other – particularly since the Reagan Revolution of 1980, which saw American inequality of wealth cease to diminish and begin to increase.8 Thus for example we shall see how Wall Street – the incarnation of the “one percent” – played a significant role in increasing the deep state after World War Two, and how three decades later the deep state played a significant role in realigning America for the Reagan Revolution. In earlier books I have given versions of this America-centered account of America’s shift into empire and a deep state. But another factor to be mentioned is the shift of global history towards an increasingly global society dominated by a few emergent superpowers. This trend was accelerated after the Industrial Revolution by new technologies of transport, from the railroad in the 19th century to the jet plane and space travel in the 20th.9 In the fallout from this rearrangement we must include two world wars, as a result of which Britain ceased to act as the dominant superpower it had been since Napoleon. Not surprisingly, the Soviet Union and the United States subsequently competed in a Cold War to fill the gap. It was not however predetermined that the Cold War would be as thuggish and covertly violent as for decades it continued to be. For that we should look to more contingent causes on both sides of the Iron Curtain – starting with the character of Stalin and his party but also including the partly responsive development of the American deep state. The Deep State, The Shadow Government and the Wall Street Overworld The “deep state” was defined by the UK newsletter On Religion as “the embedded anti-democratic power structures within a government, something very few democracies can claim to be free from.”10 The term originated in Turkey in 1996, to refer to U.S.-backed elements, primarily in the intelligence services and military, who had repeatedly used violence to interfere with and realign Turkey’s democratic political process. Sometimes the definition is restricted to elements within the government (or “a state-within-the state”), but more often in Turkey the term is expanded, for historical reasons, to include “members of the Turkish underworld.”11 In this essay I shall use “deep state” in the larger sense, to include both the second level of secret government inside Washington and those outsiders powerful enough, in either the underworld or overworld, to give it direction. In short I shall equate the term “deep state” with what in 1993 I termed a “deep political system:” “ one which habitually resorts to decision-making and enforcement procedures outside as well as inside those publicly sanctioned by law and society.”12 Like myself, Lofgren suggests an ambiguous symbiosis between two aspects of the American deep state: 1) the Beltway agencies of the shadow government, like the CIA and NSA, which have been instituted by the public state and now overshadow it, and 2) the much older power of Wall Street, referring to the powerful banks and law firms located there. In his words, It is not too much to say that Wall Street may be the ultimate owner of the Deep State and its strategies, if for no other reason than that it has the money to reward government operatives with a second career that is lucrative beyond the dreams of avarice - certainly beyond the dreams of a salaried government employee.13 I shall argue that in the 1950s Wall Street was a dominating complex. It included not just banks and oil firms but also the oil majors whose cartel arrangements were successfully defended against the U.S. Government by the Wall Street law firm Sullivan and Cromwell, home to the Dulles brothers. This larger complex is what I mean by the Wall Street overworld. The Long History of the Wall Street Overworld Lofgren’s inclusion of Wall Street is in keeping with Franklin Roosevelt’s observation in 1933 to his friend Col. E.M. House that “The real truth … is, as you and I know, that a financial element in the larger centers has owned the Government ever since the days of Andrew Jackson.”14 FDR’s insight is well illustrated by the efficiency with which a group of Wall Street bankers (including Nelson Rockefeller’s grandfather Nelson Aldrich and Paul Warburg) were able in a highly secret meeting in 1910 to establish the Federal Reserve System – a system which in effect reserved oversight of the nation’s currency supply and of all America’s banks in the not impartial hands of its largest.15 The political clout of the quasi-governmental Federal Reserve Board (where the federal Treasury is represented but does not dominate) was clearly demonstrated in 2008, when Fed leadership secured instant support from the successive administrations of a Texan Republican president, followed by a Midwest Democratic one, for public money to rescue the reckless management of Wall Street banks: banks Too Big To Fail, and of course far Too Big To Jail, but not Too Big To Bail.16 Wall Street and the Launching of the CIA Top-level Treasury officials, CIA officers, and Wall Street bankers and lawyers think alike because of the “revolving door” by which they pass easily from private to public service and back. In 1946 General Vandenberg, as Director of Central Intelligence (DCI), recruited Allen Dulles, then a Republican lawyer at Sullivan and Cromwell in New York, ""to draft proposals for the shape and organization of what was to become the Central Intelligence Agency in 1947."" Dulles promptly formed an advisory group of six men, all but one of whom were Wall Street investment bankers or lawyers.17 Dulles and two of the six (William H. Jackson and Frank Wisner) later joined the agency, where Dulles proceeded to orchestrate policies, such as the overthrow of the Arbenz regime in Guatemala, that he had previously discussed in New York at the Council on Foreign Relations.18 There seems to be little difference in Allen Dulles’s influence whether he was a Wall Street lawyer or a CIA director. Although he did not formally join the CIA until November 1950, he was in Berlin before the start of the 1948 Berlin Blockade, “supervising the unleashing of anti-Soviet propaganda across Europe.”19 In the early summer of 1948 he set up the American Committee for a United Europe (ACUE), support of what became by the early 1950s “the largest CIA operation in Western Europe.”20 The Deep State and Funds for CIA Covert Operations Wall Street was also the inspiration for what eventually became the CIA’s first covert operation: the use of “over $10 million in captured Axis funds to influence the [Italian] election [of 1948].”21 (The fundraising had begun at the wealthy Brook Club in New York; but Allen Dulles, still a Wall Street lawyer, persuaded Washington, which at first had preferred a private funding campaign, to authorize the operation through the National Security Council and the CIA.)22 Dulles’s friend Frank Wisner then left Wall Street to oversee an enlarged covert operations program through the newly created Office of Policy Co-ordination (OPC). Dulles, still a lawyer, campaigned successfully to reconstruct Western Europe through what became known as the Marshall Plan.23 Together with George Kennan and James Forrestal, Dulles also “helped devise a secret codicil [to the Marshall Plan] that gave the CIA the capability to conduct political warfare. It let the agency skim millions of dollars from the plan.”24 This created one of the earlier occasions when the CIA, directly or indirectly, recruited local assets involved in drug trafficking. AFL member Irving Brown, the assistant of AFL official Jay Lovestone (a CIA asset), was implicated in drug smuggling activities in Europe, at the same time that he used funds diverted from the Marshall Plan to establish a ""compatible left"" labor union in Marseilles with Pierre Ferri-Pisani. On behalf of Brown and the CIA, Ferri-Pisani (a drug smuggler connected with Marseilles crime lord Antoine Guerini), hired goons to shellack striking Communist dock workers.25 An analogous funding source for the CIA developed in the Far East: the so-called ""M-Fund,"" a secret fund of money of enormous size that has existed in Japan [in 1991] for more than forty years. The Fund was established by the United States in the immediate postwar era for essentially the same reasons that later gave rise to the Marshall Plan of assistance by the U.S. to Western Europe, including the Federal Republic of Germany….. The M-Fund was used not only for the building of a democratic political system in Japan but, in addition, for all of the purposes for which Marshall Plan funds were used in Europe.26 For at least two decades the CIA lavishly subsidized right-wing parties in countries including Japan and Indonesia, possibly still using captured Axis funds.27 (One frequently encounters the claim that the source of the M-fund was gold looted by Japan during World War Two (“Yamashita’s gold”).28 As a general rule the CIA, rather than assimilating these funds into its own budget, appears to have left them off the books in the hands of cooperative allied powers – ranging from other U.S. agencies like the Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA. set up in 1948 to administer the Marshall Plan) to oil companies to powerful drug kingpins.29 The CIA never abandoned its dependency on funds from outside its official budget to conduct its clandestine operations. In Southeast Asia, in particular, its proprietary firm Sea Supply Inc., supplied an infrastructure for a drug traffic supporting a CIA-led paramilitary force, PARU.30 The CIA appears also to have acted in coordination with slush funds from various U.S. government contracts, ranging from the Howard Hughes organization to (as we shall see) the foreign arms sales of U.S. defense corporations like Lockheed and Northrop.31 ... ... ....

So the voting system should be treated as a black box fully controlled by Dominion staff, right? That's an interesting turn of the events.

Jul 23, 2021 | www.zerohedge.com JUL 22, 2021 Authored by Mimi Nguyen Ly via The Epoch Times, Pennsylvania 's top election official has decertified the voting system of rural Fulton County for future elections, saying that an election assessment by a third party had violated the Keystone State's election code, according to a release on Wednesday. Acting Secretary of State Veronica Degraffenreid, an appointee of Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf, informed the Fulton County Board of Elections that she ""did not arrive at this decision lightly."" Wake Technology Services Inc. (Wake TSI), a software company based in West Chester, Pennsylvania, had carried out an election assessment that involved its workers visiting Fulton County in December 2020 and in early February. The company in May released a report that concluded the election was ""well-run"" and did not indicate any signs of fraud in Fulton County. However, five ""issues of note"" were uncovered , three of which are related to Dominion Voting Systems , whose electronic voting system was used in the county for the 2020 election. ""While these may seem minor, the impact on an election can be huge,"" Wake TSI said of the five issues. At the time, Dominion disputed the report's findings. The Pennsylvania Department of State said in a statement on Wednesday that Wake TSI's access to the Fulton County's voting system ""undermined the chain of custody requirements and strict access limitations necessary to prevent both intentional and inadvertent tampering with electronic voting systems."" It added that the ""unauthorized access"" prevents the vendor -- Dominion -- from ""affirming that the system continues to meet state and federal certification standards."" Fulton county officials had allowed Wake TSI to ""access certain key components of its certified system, including the county's election database, results files, and Windows systems logs,"" and to ""use a system imaging tool to take complete hard drive images of these computers and other digital equipment,"" the department noted. ""These actions were taken in a manner that was not transparent,"" Degraffenreid said in her letter to Fulton County officials on Tuesday. She said the access given to Wake TSI has caused Fulton County's voting system to be ""compromised,"" and that neither the county, state officials, nor Dominion could now ""verify that the impacted components of Fulton County's leased voting system are safe to use in future elections."" ""I have no other choice but to decertify the use of Fulton County's leased Dominion Democracy Suite 5.5A voting system last used in the November 2020 election,"" Degraffenreid wrote. The Fulton County Board of Elections and Wake TSI did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Pennsylvania Department of State previously said that a risk-limiting audit of the 2020 election has confirmed the state's election results. The Pennsylvania Capital-Star reported that Fulton County needed to pay $25,000 to lease new equipment for its municipal elections in May, because Dominion refused to let the county use the voting machines that Wake TSI had accessed. According to the outlet, Dominion told the county that it violated its contract in letting a unaccredited and non-certified company inspect the machines. Wake TSI's assessment in Fulton County was ""set"" by Pennsylvania Sen. Doug Mastriano, a Republican, according to a Dec. 31, 2020 document signed by the company that was obtained and published by the Arizona Mirror and The Washington Post. Wake TSI said in its report that Mastriano and Pennsylvania Sen. Judy Ward, also a Republican, ""were aware of our efforts."" The document also said that Wake TSI was ""contracted to Defending the Republic,"" a nonprofit founded by lawyer Sidney Powell, who has alleged that widespread fraud occurred in the 2020 election. Mastriano earlier this month issued letters to York, Tioga, and Philadelphia counties requesting that they voluntarily submit information and materials by July 31, to enable what he calls a ""forensic investigation"" of the 2020 and 2021 elections. He told The Epoch Times that he seeks for an investigation that would be ""a big deep dive, like we saw in Arizona, but even deeper."" Wake TSI was also involved in the election audit still underway in Arizona's Maricopa County up until its contract expired in May. The audit in Maricopa County was ordered by the Arizona state Senate's Republican majority. Dominion machines in Maricopa County will also be replaced . Arizona Senate President Karen Fann, a Republican, said the machines were not tampered with during the audit and questioned the Board of Supervisors' decision to get new machines. ""If their experts can't prove the machines have not been tampered with, then how does the [Secretary of State's office] or County Elections certify the machines before every audit to make sure the machines haven't been tampered with?"" she asked in June.

Jul 21, 2021 | www.moonofalabama.org Lysander , Jul 17 2021 11:31 utc | 2 ...WaPo columnist George Will then asserts: Henry Kissinger has said, not unreasonably, that we are in ""the foothills"" of a cold war with China. And Vladimir Putin, who nurses an unassuageable grudge about the way the Cold War ended, seems uninterested in Russia reconciling itself to a role as a normal nation without gratuitous resorts to mendacity. It is, therefore, well to notice how, day by day, in all of the globe's time zones, civilized nations are, in word and deed, taking small but cumulatively consequential measures that serve deterrence. If arrogance were a deadly disease, George Will would be dead. George Will has been an ass clown since I first had the displeasure of watching him in the 1970s. Age has not brought an ounce of wisdom. Nevertheless, this total lack of self reflection and ability to project American sins on others is unfortunately not unique to our man George. It seems a habit throughout the entire US political spectrum. The ability to view, for example, the invasion of Iraq as perfectly normal behavior, while viewing any resistance to US/Israeli dominance as beyond the pale is the character of the decaying American superpower. George Will is but one manifestation of it. It was once infuriating. But now it's simply like listening to the ravings of a schizophrenic. More pathetic than anything else. Dao Gen , Jul 17 2021 11:35 utc | 3 What do you expect from George Swill? He is a pathetic, disoriented refugee from his home in Victorian England, when barbarism never set for a single instant on the British Empire. Donbass Lives Matter , Jul 17 2021 11:45 utc | 4 There's a way to get the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth from the mainstream news media. Just look at their propaganda and ask yourself, ""Why do they want me to believe this particular lie?"" If you can figure that you, you will have the truth. alaff , Jul 17 2021 11:52 utc | 5 Well, you know, the white man's burden...

The funny thing is that they seriously consider themselves a ""superior race"", while behaving like wild barbarians.

Such opinions/articles of ""Western civilized people"" cause only a condescending smile, nothing more. So let's let George Will entertain us. Midville , Jul 17 2021 11:57 utc | 7 I find it pretty bizzarre how western media obsessively try to portray the Defender incident as a some sort of ""victory"" for ""civilized nations"".

What exactly is the victory here? The fact that Russia only resorted to warning fire and didn't blow up the ship? Perimetr , Jul 17 2021 12:16 utc | 11 Decades of propaganda masquerading as news has led most ""educated"" Americans into a Matrix of false narratives. Should you dare mention election fraud or question the safety of COVID vaccines in the presences of anyone who considers the NY Times and Wash Post as the ""papers of record"", they will be happy to inform you that you are ""captured"" by false news. Dialogue with these true believers has become almost impossible. We are the indispensable, civilized nation, don't you understand basic facts? My sister, who is truly a good-hearted person, unfortunately keeps CNN and MSNBC on most of the day in her small apartment, and lives for The NY Times, which she pours over, especially the weekend edition. She knows that Putin is evil and Russia is a bad place to live, etc etc. I got rid of my TV ten years ago and started looking elsewhere for my information. I live in a rural area of a Red state, she lives in Manhattan. We have to stick to topics that revolve around museums, gardening, and food. Ayatoilet , Jul 17 2021 12:50 utc | 16 This is precisely the type of arrogance that has led to US leaving Afghanistan with their pants down - having spent untold Trillions of dollars and having nothing to show for it. And soon, leaving Iraq and Syria too. It reminds me of how the US left Vietnam and Cambodia. The 'White' establishment in Washington and across the US military industrial complex, has an air of superiority and always seem to feel that they can subjugate via throwing money at people! This in effect turns everyone they deal with into Whores (yes, prostitutes). Its fundamentally humiliating, and sews the seeds of corruption - both economic and moral. Then, they are shocked that there's a back clash! The Taliban succeeded not with arms - but by projecting a completely different narrative of ""Morality (i.e. non-corruption), honor, and even intermingled nationalism with their narrative"". They projected a story that suggested that new Afghan daughters would not turn into Britney Spears or porn stars. And, believe it or not, the Chinese see themselves as having been fundamentally humiliated by the West and couch their efforts as a struggle for their civilization (its not ideological or even economic) - they are fighting for honor and respect. Western Civilization (and western elite) on the left and right are fundamentally materialistic. They worship money, and simply don't understand it when others don't. When they talk about superiority, they are basically saying the worship of money rules supreme. You sort of become dignified in the west if you have a lot of wealth. They want to turn the whole world into prostitutes. Policy and laws are driven by material considerations. Now, I am not saying that spirituality or religion is good; and in fact, the Chinese are not driven by religious zeal (they are, on the whole, non-religious). What I am saying is that - no matter how its expressed - be it through religion, through culture, through rhetoric, etc. - all this back clash is really a struggle for respect, 'honor' and thus a push back to Western Arrogance, and the humiliation it has caused. The West simply doesn't understand that there are societies - especially in the east, that value honor over other things. When Trump calls other people losers, he is basically saying he is richer, they are poorer. In his mind, winning, is all about money. When people write articles about the superiority of a civilization - they are implicitly putting other people down. That's not just arrogant, its rude and disrespectful. Its basically like a teenager judging their parents. How dare a newly formed nation (the US), judge or differentiate or even pretend to be superior to the Chinese, Persians etc.? Our foreign policy (and rhetoric) in the West has to completely change. We have to be really careful, because, (honestly), it won't be very long before these other (inferior) civilizations actually take over global leadership. Then how will we want to be treated? Don't for a second think these folks can't build great gadgets that go to Mars! Oh, did China just do that? Does Iran have a space program? Did they just make their own vaccines? Once they start trading among themselves without using the USD greenback, we are finished. We need them, they don't need us. Et Tu , Jul 17 2021 13:07 utc | 18 Some notable recent achievements of 'civilised' nations include: -Illegal invasion and bombing of multiple non-aggressor nations

-Overthrowing of democratically elected Governments

-Support of extremist and oppressive regimes

-Sponsoring of terrorism, including weapon sales to ISIS

-Corruption of once trusted institutions like the UN and OPCW Oh, the civility... Petri Krohn , Jul 17 2021 14:05 utc | 26 HOW DID RUSSIA BECOME THE ENEMY? ...when all she did was offer slight resistance to Western aggression? The key event was the August 2013 false-flag gas attack and massacre of hostages in Ghouta in Damascus. What really angered the West was the Russian fleet in the Mediterranean that prevented the NATO attack on Syria. (You will not find a single word of this in Western media.) This is why Crimea needed to be captured by the West. As revenge and deterrence against the Russian agression. I wrote about these events in 2016: The standoff was first described by Israel Shamir in October 2013:

""The most dramatic event of September 2013 was the high-noon stand-off near the Levantine shore, with five US destroyers pointing their Tomahawks towards Damascus and facing them - the Russian flotilla of eleven ships led by the carrier-killer Missile Cruiser Moskva and supported by Chinese warships. Apparently, two missiles were launched towards the Syrian coast, and both failed to reach their destination."" A longer description was published by Australianvoice in 2015:

""So why didn't the US and France attack Syria? It seems obvious that the Russians and Chinese simply explained that an attack on Syria by US and French forces would be met by a Russian/Chinese attack on US and French warships. Obama wisely decided not to start WW III in September 2013."" Can Russia Block Regime Change In Syria Again? In my own comments from 2013 I tried to understand the mission of the Russian fleet. This is what I believed Putin's orders to the fleet were: To sink any NATO ship involved in illegal aggression against Syria. You have the authority to use tactical nuclear weapons in self-defense. I am sure NATO admirals understood the situation the same way. I am not sure of the American leadership in Washington. Billb , Jul 17 2021 14:15 utc | 28 Insulting language aside, the narrative they are trying to create is that there is an anti-Russia, anti-China trend developing and that those sitting on the fence would be wise to join the bandwagon. This will be particularly effective on the majority of folks who barely scan headlines and skim articles. Falun Gong/CIA mouthpiece Epoch Times is on board with this, based on recent headlines.

April 15, 2022 This Week at the State Capitol FRANKFORT – It wasn’t until 1992 that a constitutional amendment removed the lieutenant governor as head of the Kentucky Senate and made the General Assembly a fully independent branch of state government.



Since then, few legislative sessions have demonstrated that independence more than the one that concluded this week in Frankfort.



Lawmakers closed out the year by overriding more than two dozen gubernatorial vetoes during a final sprint toward sine die on Wednesday and Thursday. That capped off an intensive 60 days of work that began in January and resulted in new laws on nearly every prominent issue facing the commonwealth.



Education, abortion, redistricting, drugs, gambling, elections, cannabis research and athletics were just a few of the topics that earned a tap from the gavel this year.



Lawmakers revamped the state income tax and passed major overhauls to unemployment benefits and public assistance. They channeled millions in disaster relief to Western Kentucky. They debated nearly all facets of Kentucky’s response to COVID-19 and ultimately voted to end the state’s emergency declaration in March.



Sports fans may remember the 2022 session for the “NIL” bill, a measure that sets the stage for college athletes to generate income off their name, image and likeness.



But Capitol observers will remember it as the year that the House unveiled a landmark biennial budget plan weeks earlier than any session in memory – one of the clearest signs of legislative independence this session.



When counting up the general fund, capital costs and operating expenses, the two-year spending plan totaled an historic $114 billion.



Like all sessions, debates were common – debates on funding, on social issues, on public health and religion and the government’s role in it all. But bipartisanship also found a foothold in many important areas, especially on issues like tornado recovery and the war in Ukraine.



When the gavel fell for a final time on Thursday night, legislators had sent more than 240 bills to the governor’s desk this year, and here’s a partial list of some of the most discussed legislation.



Abortion: House Bill 3 bans abortions in Kentucky at 15 weeks of gestation and requires minors to obtain consent from their parents before undergoing the procedure. The omnibus bill also bans online sales of abortion-inducing drugs and regulates the disposal of fetal remains.



Anti-SLAPP bill: House Bill 222 seeks to protect freedom of speech. It would offer those who speak out against a matter of public interest protection from strategic lawsuits against public participation, known as SLAPP lawsuits.



Budget: House Bill 1, the new executive branch budget, increases to the state’s per pupil funding formula for schools and includes funding for state employee raises and full-day kindergarten. It will also make major investments in public pensions, state parks, clean drinking water and the state fairgrounds.

Transgender athletes: Senate Bill 83 will prevent male-to-female transgender students from participating in girls’ sports, starting in the sixth grade and continuing through college.

END April 13, 2022 Senate approves bill to prohibit gray machines in Kentucky Senate Majority Floor Leader Damon Thayer, R-Georgetown, speaks on House Bill 608, which would prohibit “gray machines” in Kentucky. A high-res version of this photo is available here. FRANKFORT — Legislation advanced out of the Senate on Wednesday to prohibit certain gambling machines, often known as “gray machines,” from operating in Kentucky.



The measure, House Bill 608, cleared the Senate with a 24-13 vote after lawmakers approved an amendment to the bill on the chamber floor. It now returns to the House, where lawmakers could vote to concur with the changes Thursday – the last day of the 2022 legislative session.



Senate Majority Floor Leader Damon Thayer, R-Georgetown, said the legislation would explicitly ban gray machines that have become prevalent across the state. He said they fall outside the three forms of gambling that are currently legal, which include pari-mutuel wagering, charitable gaming and the lottery.



“They are illegal and operating outside the law,” Thayer said.



But the bill, sponsored by Rep. Killian Timoney, R-Lexington, generated some debate before the vote.



Supporters of HB 608 said gray machines are operating without regulation and creating competition with charitable gaming. Critics of the bill said the machines provide much-needed income for mom-and-pop stores.



Sen. Paul Hornback, R-Shelbyville, said some operators of locally owned stores depend on the extra money to help keep their doors open. Those who have the machines want them to be taxed and regulated, he said.



“In rural Kentucky, it makes a huge difference,” Hornback said.



Sen. Philip Wheeler, R-Pikeville, agreed that while he is not personally a fan of using the machines, the income they generate is helping business owners. Wheeler said the machines could be “brought into the fold” in time, and he urged lawmakers to step back and consider the issue more.



“To ban them outright is overkill,” he said.



Senate Majority Whip Mike Wilson, R-Bowling Green, called the gaming machines unregulated and untaxed. He said he first learned about them from local service organizations for veterans that depend on revenue from charitable gaming machines.



“A vote against this is a vote against our veterans,” he said.



Wilson added that the action is not unprecedented. He pointed to simulated slot machines on computers that were once common in Kentucky but have since been outlawed.



The amendment to the bill was sponsored by Sen. Whitney Westerfield, R-Crofton. He cited concerns that language in the bill could have expanded the definition of gambling and said his amendment would address the issue. END April 13, 2022 General Assembly overrides gubernatorial vetoes House Majority Floor Leader Steven Rudy, R-Paducah, makes a motion to override a gubernatorial veto to a bill on the House floor. A high-res version of this photo is available here. FRANKFORT— The Kentucky General Assembly spent the second to last day of the 2022 legislative session overriding gubernatorial vetoes related to the state budget, taxes, education and more.



Lawmakers voted to override 17 of Gov. Andy Beshear’s vetoes on the executive branch budget for the next biennium outlined in House Bill 1.



The five areas of the budget that lawmakers allowed vetoes to stand included 13 line items. In his veto message, Beshear wrote some of those line items contained technical errors.



Some highlights of HB 1 that were not vetoed include:



– 8% raises for state workers on July 1, 2022, and additional raises based on a pay study for the following fiscal year

– $250 million in federal American Rescue Plan Act funds for clean drinking water

– Hundreds of millions of dollars to fully fund state pensions

– Funds to provide social workers with a $2,400 pay increase in addition to the across-the-board raises

– Funds to increase the SEEK formula from the current $4,000 per student to $4,100 per student in the first fiscal year and to $4,200 in the second year

– Funds to cover the full cost of all-day kindergarten at every public school district in the Commonwealth

– Funds to cover 70% of transportation costs for public schools

– $25 million in grants for county clerks for elections and deed recording online

– $150 million in fiscal year 2023-24 for a major overhaul of the state parks system



The legislation was originally approved by a 31-0 vote in the Senate and a 93-3 vote in the House on March 30.



Other veto overrides:



Senate Bill 1 – The measure calls for local superintendents – rather than school councils – to determine educational curriculum. The Teaching American Principles Act, which would require instruction in social studies to align with a list of core concepts and documents that supporters say are central to American civics, is also included in the bill.



House Bill 3 – This bill would require minors to have parental consent before undergoing an abortion procedure. It would also ban the online sale of abortion medication and limit abortion to 15 weeks of pregnancy.



House Bill 7 – This legislation aims to revamp public assistance benefits and combat fraud. HB 7 would create new rules around the presumptive eligibility for benefit recipients and seek more accountability from the state Cabinet for Health and Family Services. It would also establish penalties for fraudulent sales of benefit cards.



Another provision seeks to encourage participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program – known as SNAP – to make good nutritional choices.



House Bill 8 – This is a tax modernization bill that aims to reduce the state income tax rate and diversify the state tax base. Using a special formula, the state will look at the budget reserve trust fund and compare it to the general fund to make sure the state can afford to reduce the state income tax by .5%. If certain conditions are met, the income tax reduction will take place in the second January after that fiscal year.



In order to reduce the income tax rate, the state plans to expand the sales tax base.



Another provision of HB 8 imposes a 6% use tax on nonessential services such as, nonessential cosmetic surgery, body modifications, photography, research polling, bodyguard services, marketing and more. Another section of the bill imposes a tax on ridesharing services, such as Uber and Lyft, and electric vehicles.



Electric vehicle owners will pay an annual $120 ownership fee. Owners of hybrid vehicles and electric motorcycles will be a $60 annual fee.



House Bill 9 – Following legislation from 2017, HB 9 codifies the funding mechanism for charter schools, authorizes two pilot charter school projects in Northern Kentucky and the West End of Louisville, and makes changes to the appeal process if a charter school application is denied by a local school board.



Senate Bill 83 – Senate Bill 83 would prevent male-to-female transgender students from participating in girls’ sports, starting in the sixth grade.



House Bills 241 – The Transportation Cabinet budget contained in HB 241 appropriates nearly $3 billion toward road projects across the Commonwealth for the next two fiscal years.



House Bill 243 – This bill is the biennium spending plan for the legislative branch.



All of these bills go into effect 90 days after the end of the 2022 legislative session, unless the bill has an emergency clause or a provision that sets a different effective date.



The Kentucky General Assembly will convene for its final day of the 2022 legislative session at 10 a.m. on Thursday. END April 1, 2022 This Week at the State Capitol Legislators consider bills for concurrence in the Senate. A high-res version of this photo is available here. FRANKFORT – The Kentucky General Assembly gaveled out for a 10-day veto recess after passing a landmark state budget and a volley of other prominent bills this week on tax reform, charter schools, abortion, gambling, elections and changes to public assistance.



In all, lawmakers delivered 140 bills to the governor’s desk over a two-day marathon of voting and debate on the chamber floors. The action wrapped up close to midnight on Wednesday.



The governor now has until the end of the day on April 11 to sign the bills, let them become law without his signature or issue vetoes. Lawmakers will have an opportunity to override any vetoes when the General Assembly reconvenes on April 13-14 for the final two days of the session.



Here are some of the bills that received final passage before both chambers adjourned:



Budget: House Bill 1 would provide an historic two-year spending plan for the state executive branch with funding for employee raises, full-day kindergarten and increases to the state’s per pupil funding formula. It would also provide major investments in public pensions, state parks, clean drinking water projects and the state fairgrounds.



Abortion: House Bill 3 would ban abortions in Kentucky at 15 weeks of gestation and require minors to obtain consent from their parents before undergoing the procedure. The omnibus bill would also ban online sales of abortion-inducing drugs and regulate the disposal of fetal remains.



Tax reform: House Bill 8 seeks to gradually reduce and eliminate state taxes on personal income over several years while simultaneously expanding and diversifying the state’s overall tax base. Once state revenue exceeds certain thresholds, the measure would trigger reductions in the income tax rate of half a percentage point, starting with an initial drop in 2023.



Charter schools: House Bill 9 would establish a funding model for charter schools, building on legislation from 2017 that first allowed charters in Kentucky. It would also authorize two pilot charter school projects in Louisville and Northern Kentucky and change the appeals process if education officials deny an application for a new charter school.



Pari-mutuel wagering: House Bill 607 would tax every pari-mutuel wager at a standard 1.5% rate, including advance-deposit wagers and bets on simulcasts. It would also direct more money to the general fund, eliminate breakage, make the Kentucky Racing Commission responsible for self-funding, create a self-exclusion list for problem gamblers and eliminate the track admissions tax.



Public assistance: House Bill 7 aims to revamp public assistance benefits and combat fraud with new rules around benefit eligibility. It also seeks to increase accountability from the state Cabinet for Health and Family Services and encourage healthy choices for those receiving nutritional assistance.



School resource officers: House Bill 63 calls on local school districts to place a school resource officer in each school by Aug. 1 if they can afford the cost. It would also allow local school boards to establish a police department for the district.



Nursing shortages: Senate Bill 10 would make it easier for nurses from outside Kentucky to practice here, helping address major workforce shortages in the profession. It would also remove predetermined numbers for admission to nursing programs.



Porch pirates: Senate Bill 23 would crack down on people who steal packages off front porches, often referred to as porch pirates. The bill would make it a Class D felony to steal or destroy packages from common carriers and delivery services such as Amazon or FedEx.



Fentanyl: Known as Dalton’s Law, House Bill 215 would require those convicted of trafficking fentanyl, carfentanil or fentanyl derivatives to serve at least 85% of their criminal sentences, up from the current 50%. It would also make importing those drugs from another state or country a Class C felony and make offenders ineligible for a pretrial diversion.



School board meetings: House Bill 121 would require a public comment period of at least 15 minutes at local school board meetings, unless no one is signed up to speak. It would also require that any board rules and policies regarding conduct apply during the comment period.



Coroner training: Senate Bill 6, also known as Nathan’s Law, would require coroners to attend eight hours of training on the grieving process and procedures for death notifications. It would also establish certain procedures that coroners must follow in providing death notifications.



Crimes during emergencies: Senate Bill 179 would enhance penalties for crimes committed during a declared emergency related to a natural or man-made disaster. It would apply to assault, burglary, criminal trespass, criminal mischief, theft, receiving stolen property and robbery.



Election security: Senate Bill 216 seeks to enhance election security through multiple changes in law including a provision to prevent voting machines from being connected to the internet, among other provisions.



Swatting: House Bill 48 would make falsely reporting an incident that results in an emergency response – commonly called “swatting” – a Class D felony.



Due process: House Bill 290 calls on state colleges and universities to adopt a student code of conduct for non-academic disciplinary procedures and provide students with due process protections that are similar to those in criminal and civil courts.

END March 30, 2022 Bill to overhaul public assistance clears final hurdle Sen. Ralph Alvarado, R-Winchester, speaking on House Bill 7, which would revamp public assistance benefits. A high-res version of this photo is available here. FRANKFORT — A bill that aims to revamp public assistance benefits and combat fraud is headed to the governor’s desk after it received final approval from the Kentucky General Assembly on Wednesday.



House Bill 7 would create new rules around the presumptive eligibility for benefit recipients and seek more accountability from the state Cabinet for Health and Family Services. It would also establish penalties for fraudulent sales of benefit cards.



Another provision seeks to encourage participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program – known as SNAP – to make good nutritional choices, supporters say.



“It tries to make sure that public assistance benefits go to the people that actually really need it,” said Sen. Ralph Alvarado, R-Winchester. “It tries to increase accountability, decrease fraud in the system and protect funds for those who need it the most.”



Alvarado presented the legislation on the Senate floor. However, House Speaker Pro Tempore David Meade, R-Stanford, is the bill’s primary sponsor.



“We actually do have a major problem in this state, and that is what we are going to try to start taking care of,” Meade told members in the House.



The measure includes a waiver that can be used at the state health cabinet to expand SNAP for the elderly and the disabled. HB 7 also calls for creation of community engagement programs at the cabinet by April 2023.



Other provisions would set rules around self-attestation and determination of Medicaid eligibility and verification. The bill would also establish the Benefits Cliff Task Force and require the cabinet to develop an online benefits cliff calculator.



“That’s been something that’s been talked about quite a bit through many of our interim meetings. You know that a lot of folks have a hard time transitioning off of public assistance into the private employment, and as a result this is going to hopefully help them as we develop a task force to deal with that issue,” Alvarado said.



The legislation would also require the cabinet to contract with a third party to review presumptive eligibility and compliance, and it would prohibit the cabinet from seeking new waivers or renewing waivers without authorization from the General Assembly with a few exceptions, he said.



HB 7 has undergone changes since the bill was first filed earlier this session.



Senate Minority Floor Leader Morgan McGarvey, D-Louisville, said changes have improved it, but the bill still has shortcomings.



“I think the overall bill is still lacking. I think it is still punishing people, potentially punishing people just for being poor,” he said.



McGarvey said no one likes fraud, but he pointed to estimates showing that instances of fraud in the nutrition program are around 0.002% of cases. He added that, on a per capita basis, Kentucky has the highest rate of investigating and charging intentional program violations of any state in the southeast.



“We are going to spend more money than we are going to save by taking food off of people’s plates. That’s not what we should do,” he said.



House Minority Whip Angie Hatton, D-Whitesburg, also told representatives there are many lawmakers who are relieved to see recent changes that make the bill more agreeable. However, she said she still doesn’t support many of the measures.



“I think it’s just a matter of what keeps you up at night,” she said. “For me, it doesn’t keep me up at night worrying that there is a tiny percentage of people who might get benefits and didn’t deserve them. What keeps me up at night is worrying that there might be people hungry who couldn’t jump through hoops and get benefits.”



Meade told members in the House that the University of Kentucky’s Gatton College of Business and Economics has done several studies on the issue.



He said the college’s latest statistics show that improper enrollments in Medicaid cost the federal government $186 million a year in Kentucky and that Kentucky ranks third in the nation for the biggest increase in improper Medicaid enrollments since the passage of the Affordable Care Act.



“It is not simply just a small percentage of folks who have been improperly enrolled,” he said.



The House voted 70-22 on final passage after the Senate approved HB 7 with a 24-12 vote. It now goes to the governor, who can sign it, allow it to become law without his signature or issue a veto. END March 30, 2022 General Assembly sends historic state budget to governor's desk Rep. Jason Petrie, R-Elkton, speaks on House Bill 1, the proposed executive branch budget, on the House floor. A high-res version of this photo is available here. FRANKFORT— After countless months of planning and negotiations, the state budget for the next biennium is finished.



House Bill 1, the executive branch budget, received final passage by the Kentucky General Assembly on Wednesday, hours before the beginning of the veto recess period.



Chair of the Senate Appropriations and Revenue Committee Christian McDaniel, R-Ryland Heights, said the biggest items in the budget reflect a conscious decision to address operational deficits in the state’s workforce.



Some of the highlights McDaniel and House Appropriations and Revenue Committee Chair Jason Petrie, R-Elkton, mentioned include:



—8% raises for state workers on July 1, 2022, and additional raises based on a pay study for the following fiscal year

—$250 million in federal American Rescue Plan Act funds for clean drinking water

—Hundreds of millions of dollars to fully fund state pensions

—Funds to provide social workers with a $2,400 pay increase in addition to the across-the-board raises

—Funds to increase the SEEK formula from the current $4,000 per student to $4,100 per student in the first fiscal year and to $4,200 in the second year

—$23 million to assist Kentucky State University with ongoing financial challenges along with a second appropriation of $15 million

—Funds to cover the full cost of all-day kindergarten at every public school district in the Commonwealth

—Funds to cover 70% of transportation costs for public schools

—$25 million in grants for county clerks for elections and deed recording online

—$150 million in fiscal year 2023-24 for a major overhaul of the state parks system

—Enough funds to cover 40 days of operations in the event of an emergency On the House floor, Petrie said the budget makes “historic” investments in K-12 education, and higher education.



“It puts us at a little over 52% of our entire general fund budget being allocated in education,” Petrie said.



In the Senate, McDaniel said Kentucky must remain competitive with other states and invest in people’s ability to succeed.



“Budgets are about discipline and restraint; and they get to the fact that in government, we cannot be here to guarantee anyone’s success, but rather set the environment for people to succeed to the maximum of their God-given potential,” he said.



Senate Majority Floor Leader Damon Thayer, R-Georgetown, said the bill underscores differences in the chamber. He praised the plan as a “conservative budget” that reflects tough decisions and sets aside money for the budget reserve trust fund.



“Just because we have a surplus doesn’t mean when have to spend it all,” Thayer said. “We have to remember where this money comes from. It comes from the taxpayers. It comes from the hard working people of Kentucky who every week have money taken out of their paycheck.”



While many members of the House and Senate said they liked HB 1, a few expressed disappointment in some of the educational funding choices.



Rep. Rachel Roberts, D-Newport, said her district in Northern Kentucky is losing teachers to Cincinnati. She said she’s afraid the SEEK increases and other education appropriations may not be enough for school districts to give competitive raises.



In the Senate, Minority Floor Leader Morgan McGarvey, D-Louisville, praised many of the expenditures, but he criticized the budget for not funding universal pre-kindergarten. He said when adjusted for inflation, spending on education remains below levels prior to the 2008 recession, and called the budget a “missed opportunity” overall.



“This is our opportunity to make investments in the state that will reverberate 25 years from now,” he said. “This budget is the opportunity for people to look back 25 years from now and say, ‘that’s when they got this done. That’s when we got Kentucky moving in the right direction.’”



Back in the House, Speaker Pro Tempore David Meade, R-Stanford, said HB 1 is an “excellent budget.”



“I think this is the best one I have ever seen in my 10 years,” he said, calling special attention to “record” funding in education, pensions, and economic projects and more.



Although Rep. Patti Minter, D-Bowling Green, said she has concerns about the transportation funding for school districts, she was “happy to see creative use of ARPA funds.” “It’s the best budget that I’ve ever had the privilege to vote on, and I hope that we will be able to work with this moving forward into the next biennium,” Minter said.



The House approved the executive branch budget by a 93-3 vote while the Senate approved the budget unanimously in a 35-0 vote.



Both chambers also approved House Bill 243, the legislative branch budget, and House Bill 244, the judicial branch budget on Wednesday.



All three bills will now be sent to the governor for his signature or veto. END March 29, 2022 Senate approves “Dalton’s Law” to combat fentanyl traffickers FRANKFORT — Named after Dalton Bishop who passed away from ingesting fentanyl, House Bill 215 received final approval Tuesday on the Senate floor.



The bill would increase from 50% to 85% the minimum time served before those guilty of trafficking can be eligible for probation, shock probation, conditional discharge or parole. It would also make them ineligible for a pretrial diversion, Sen. Jason Howell, R-Murray, said.



“House Bill 215 deals with enhancing sentencing for those that are trafficking in fentanyl. For those of us that are involved in this area, fentanyl has become a new, big thing that we’re having to deal with from a drug standpoint,” Howell said.



Rep. Chris Fugate, R-Chavies, is the bill’s primary sponsor. However, Howell presented the measure on the Senate floor, where it was approved for final passage with a 30-3 vote.



Senate Majority Whip Mike Wilson, R-Bowling Green, said his community has not been spared from deaths stemming from fentanyl.



“This bill came about, I think, as a result of a lot of the deaths that have happened in regards to fentanyl laced drugs,” he said. “And when it happens in your community, that’s when it starts to hit home. We’ve had one family we know have two sons. They no longer have any sons. They’ve lost both of them. Overdose.”



Not only did Wilson recall that family, but also the family of Bishop, who died after taking just one pill.



“If anybody knows anything about the drug and how dangerous it is, it’s a killer” he said, referring to Dalton Bishop.



Sen. Robin L. Webb, D-Grayson, said legislators appear to be piecemealing the criminal justice system even further and moving toward mandatory minimums like “the archaic federal system.” She also expressed concern about costs associated with the legislation.



“But this has a significant fiscal impact and it enhances aggravated trafficking to include heroin. So it’s going to come at a cost, and I have not had the opportunity to digest whether or not the budget will accommodate this, but we probably need to give corrections a little more money,” Webb said.



Sen. Danny Carroll, R-Benton, said fentanyl and its derivatives are scourges.



“When you look at the society today and you look at the drugs that are being trafficked, there is no other deadlier drug at this point than fentanyl, carfentanil and the derivatives,” he said.



Carroll said it’s not just users at risk, but also first responders who attend to overdoses and end up in the hospital themselves. Carroll stressed that he has no sympathy for traffickers of deadly drugs.



“They are trafficking death, and as we are being more accommodating on the lower end for users. I think we need to be every bit harsher on the higher end of those who are trafficking and making money off of killing our citizens,” he said. END March 29, 2022 Senate advances bill to codify funding for charter schools Senate President Pro Tem David P. Givens, R-Greensburg, speaks on House Bill 9, which would codify funding for charter schools. A high-res version of this photo is available here. FRANKFORT — Legislation to establish charter schools in Kentucky became law in 2017, but the Senate gave final passage Tuesday to a bill that would codify a funding model for such schools moving forward.



House Bill 9 would also authorize two pilot charter school projects in Louisville and Northern Kentucky and change the appeals process if education officials deny an application for a new charter school.



The measure received final passage with a 22-14 vote and now heads to the governor’s desk. It cleared the House floor last week.



House Majority Whip Chad McCoy, R-Bardstown, is the bill’s primary sponsor. However, Senate President Pro Tem David P. Givens, R-Greensburg, presented the measure on the Senate floor.



“What we have before us here in House Bill 9 is an opportunity for us to excel in those places where the students deserve to be in robust programs of excellence,” he said.



Givens emphasized the issue of charter schools is not new to the state. He said the matter was under discussion when he arrived as a newly elected legislator in 2009 and that HB 9 builds on the original measure that passed in 2017.



“This is not something that has been rushed,” he said. “That’s 13 years’ worth of conversation here in Kentucky.”



If an application for a new charter school is denied, HB 9 allows the applicant to ask why and receive technical assistance from the Kentucky Department of Education to improve it. The department is required to provide the assistance.



Another provision allows school districts with less than 7,500 students a way to “veto” a charter school appeal.



Givens said that a small number of students moving out of a small district can have a significant economic impact on a school district. That’s why “there are protections written in the bill for the smallest of districts,” he said.



Lawmakers debated the bill for more than an hour on the Senate floor.



Supporters said the bill will help spur long-needed innovation to the education system while helping close outcome gaps among students. They argued that Kentucky has fallen behind other states in providing the option.



Critics, however, said charters will channel funds away from public schools and into private hands. They also argued that charter schools have a mixed record elsewhere and raised concerns that charters will be exempt from important standards like qualifications for administrators.



Senate Minority Caucus Chair Reginald Thomas, D-Lexington, voted against the measures and said it will allow private entities to buy textbooks, desks and buildings – all with public funds.



“From Pikeville to Paducah, our school leaders are opposed to this bill,” he said. “This is a money grab, so I say follow the money and watch your public dollars go to private hands. And the person who will really pay the price for this will be your child.”



Sen. Robin L. Webb, D-Grayson, also voted against the legislation. She said those affiliated with charter schools might see school funding as a lucrative opportunity.



“They’ve made no secret about it. They’ve said they wanted it. And who are these people,” she asked. “Well, it’s rich donors and billionaires and foundations. What’s the goal here? Well, to get some of the money and also set curriculum, bring people in to teach so they can set the agenda that goes with their agenda.”



Several others, like Senate Majority Whip Mike Wilson, R-Bowling Green, spoke in favor of HB 9.



“As I have said when I carried this bill three different times, it’s a pilot project,” Wilson said. “It’s a tool in the toolbox of education. It’s not looking to take over all of education. It’s just looking to be a tool to be used where needed,” he said.



Sen. Donald Douglas, R-Nicholasville, said he would hate to wake up every morning thinking that the only reason people do things in Kentucky is for profit. “The word ‘change’ scares the dickens out of a lot of people because it may force them to think a little differently when they get up in the morning or go to bed at night,” he said. “We have educational woes because of people who hate that word ‘change.’” END March 29, 2022 Bill increasing criminal penalties for crimes during natural, man-made disasters advances House Majority Caucus Chair Suzanne Miles, R-Owensboro, presents Senate Bill 179 alongside Rep. C. Ed Massey, R-Hebron, on the House floor. A high-res version of this photo is available here. FRANKFORT— Thieves looking to steal property in an area impacted by a natural or man-made disaster will face harsher penalties under Senate Bill 179.



The Kentucky House of Representatives approved the measure Tuesday. House Majority Caucus Chair Suzanne Miles, R-Owensboro, presented SB 179 on the House floor on behalf of the bill’s sponsor, Sen. Danny Carroll, R-Benton.



During a declaration of emergency due to a natural or man-made disaster, those guilty of assault, burglary, criminal trespass, criminal mischief, theft, receiving stolen property and robbery, will face harsher penalties under SB 179.



Miles said the legislation is for those “people preying upon people at their worst time.”



For example, first-degree burglary would become a Class A felony, second-degree burglary would become a Class B felony, and third-degree burglary would become a Class C felony during a declaration.



Rep. C. Ed Massey, R-Hebron, successfully amended SB 179 on the House floor to define impact areas. Massey said the amendment is necessary because a natural or man-made disaster often does not impact the entire state.



Rep. Keturah Herron, D-Louisville, also attempted to amend SB 179 on the House floor, but the amendment failed by a 29-58 roll call vote. Herron wanted to amend the bill to allow a sentencing judge or jury to decline to impose the enhanced penalties.



“This safety net ensures that juries and judges in disaster areas can determine who truly deserves the enhanced penalties based on the facts established at trial,” Herron said.



The House approved an amended version of SB 179 by an 84-10 vote. The Senate approved the original version of SB 179 by 34-1 vote on March 8. The Senate will have to vote to concur on the changes made to the bill by the House before it can be sent to the governor’s desk for his signature or veto. END March 25, 2022 This Week at the State Capitol Work gets underway in the House of Representatives. A high-res version of this photo is available here. FRANKFORT — The Kentucky General Assembly spent the last full week of the 2022 legislative session considering a torrent of bills on elections, abortion, religion and gambling. But no issue appeared to capture more of the spotlight than public schools.



Lawmakers sent two major bills on education to the governor’s desk this week, including one on early childhood literacy and a separate, much-debated package on academic standards.



Another measure on transgender athletes also received final passage, while a bill on charter schools cleared the House floor and several others related to education continued to move forward.



Only four days remain in this year’s regular session, and lawmakers are working to finalize bills before breaking next week for a 10-day veto recess. That gives the General Assembly time to override any vetoes from the governor before adjourning for the year.



Bipartisanship ran high on Tuesday when legislation on early childhood literacy – Senate Bill 9 – received a final nod in the Senate.



Known as the Read to Succeed Act, the bill calls for evidence-based learning techniques and intensive interventions to improve literacy outcomes and help struggling students in kindergarten through the third grade. It won final passage with unanimous support.



However, lawmakers faced steep divides throughout the week on Senate Bill 1.



The measure calls for local superintendents – rather than school councils – to determine educational curriculum. It was amended in the House to also include language from the Teaching American Principles Act, which would require instruction in social studies to align with a list of core concepts and documents that supporters say are central to American civics.



SB 1 cleared the House floor on Tuesday and secured final passage in the Senate on Thursday, but not before sparking lengthy debates in both chambers.



The vote on Senate Bill 83 was likewise split. The legislation would prevent male-to-female transgender students from participating in girls’ sports, starting in the sixth grade and running through college. It received final passage in the Senate on Thursday following similar debate.



Legislation related to charter schools – House Bill 9 – also moved off the House floor on Thursday with a divided vote. That bill would change the appeals process if a charter school application is denied by a local school board. It would also codify the funding mechanism for charters and authorize two pilot charter school projects.



At the beginning of the week, both the House and Senate voted to override gubernatorial vetoes on two measures.



The first, Senate Joint Resolution 150, officially ends the COVID-19 state of emergency in Kentucky. The other, House Bill 4, changes the benefits and the job search requirements for unemployment.



Meanwhile, many other bills continued to advance through the process this week. That includes legislation related to:



Serving alcohol: House Bill 252 would clear the way for 18-year-olds to sell and serve alcoholic beverages. It received final passage in the Senate on Monday and has been delivered to the governor.



Pari-mutuel wagering: House Bill 607 seeks to tax every pari-mutuel wager – including advance-deposit wagers and bets on simulcasts – at a standard 1.5%. It cleared the House floor on Monday.



Gray machines: House Bill 608 would prohibit certain gambling machines, often called “gray” machines, in Kentucky. It advanced out of Senate Licensing and Occupations Committee on Tuesday.



Religious services: House Bill 43 calls for equal treatment of religious organizations during a state of emergency. The legislation was sent to the governor after receiving final passage in the Senate on Wednesday.



Parental rights: Senate Bill 40 calls on Kentucky courts to apply a strict scrutiny standard when considering the interests of parents in the care, custody and control of their children. It cleared the Senate floor on Wednesday.



Abortion: House Bill 3 would require physicians to seek permission from a minor’s parent or legal guardian before allowing the minor to undergo a chemical or surgical abortion. It passed out of the Senate Health and Welfare Committee on Wednesday.



Porch pirates: Senate Bill 23 would make it a class D felony to steal or destroy packages from common carriers and delivery services – similar to the penalty for stealing U.S. mail. The House Judiciary Committee advanced the bill out of committee on Wednesday.



Moment of silence: House Bill 102 would require public schools to implement a moment of silence or reflection at the start of each school day. It cleared the House floor on Wednesday.



School breakfasts: Senate Bill 151 calls on schools in the Federal School Breakfast Program to offer students up to 15 minutes to eat breakfast during instructional time. It received final passage in the House on Thursday.



Elections: Senate Bill 216 seeks to strengthen election security through multiple changes to state law. That includes preventing voting machines from being connected to the internet and eliminating credit and debit cards as a form of identification. It cleared the House floor on Thursday with changes.



Constables: House Bill 239 would require newly elected constables to undergo professional law enforcement training before performing certain peace officer duties. It won final passage in the Senate on Friday.



Death penalty: House Bill 269 would add serious mental illness to the list of disabilities that disqualify offenders from execution if symptoms were occurring at the time of the offense. The Senate gave the bill final passage on Friday.



The General Assembly is scheduled to gavel back into session on Tuesday and Wednesday next week before breaking for the veto recess.

END March 24, 2022 House committee approves unemployment for domestic violence victims bill Rep. Nima Kulkarni, D-Louisville, testifies on House Bill 83 in the House Economic Development and Workforce Investment Committee. A high-res version of this photo is available here. FRANKFORT— A bipartisan initiative to extend unemployment benefits to domestic violence victims is on the move in the Kentucky House of Representatives.



The House Economic Development and Workforce Investment Committee approved House Bill 83 on Thursday. Rep. Nima Kulkarni, D-Louisville, said she and Rep. Samara Heavrin, R-Leitchfield, have worked with stakeholders on the legislation for a couple of years.



“What this bill does is allow victims of domestic, dating, sexual and stalking violence who leave work, are unable to work, or separated from employment due to circumstances directly relating to that violence, to be eligible for unemployment benefits….” Kulkarni said.



HB 83 would apply in cases where the victim fears violence at or on route to the workplace, Kulkarni added. A victim would also be eligible if he or she wishes to relocate to another area to avoid future violence or protect the safety and health of themselves, their family or co-workers.



Kulkarni cited several studies that show domestic violence is linked to unemployment, with 83% of domestic violence survivors reporting their ability to work was negatively impacted by an abusive partner. Kulkarni said this legislation is necessary because Kentucky has a rate of intimate partner violence higher than the national average.



“Intimate partner violence impacts 1 in 4 women and 1 in 9 men in their lifetime. In Kentucky, that number is higher,” Kulkarni said. “One in 3 women and 1 in 8 men experienced partner abuse. Nearly 1 in 2 women in Kentucky and 1 in 5 men have reported sexual violence at some point in their lives.”



HB 83 would require claimants to provide documentation to prove eligibility, Kulkarni added. The documentation could be police records, court records, sworn statements or other documentation of violence provided by the victim, shelter workers, members of the clergy, medical professionals or other professionals from whom the victim has sought assistance.



“This evidence would be kept confidential under this legislation,” Kulkarni said.

The bill would also direct the Education and Workforce Development Cabinet secretary to develop a confidential verification process designed to detect fraudulent claims and train employees.



Under HB 83, benefits would be paid from a pooled account and not from the employer’s reserve account.



“In addition, nothing in this bill will impact an employer’s experience rating for purposes of calculating the employer’s unemployment insurance tax rate,” Kulkarni added.



The measure would also direct the cabinet to train employees to process the claims and provide a report by Sept. 30 each year to the Legislative Research Commission detailing the number of claims filed.



During discussion, Rep. Kim Banta, R-Ft. Mitchell, and Rep. Matt Lockett, R-Nicholasville, both told Kulkarni they like the bill. Lockett asked Kulkarni about the pooled account that would be used.



“The pooled account is something that employers contribute to, and it reduces essentially the burden for each individual employer from paying out for unemployment benefits,” Kulkarni clarified. “And so this is not going to be charged to an employer’s reserve account, which would be individual to an employer.”



Rep. Lynn Bechler, R-Marion, said he also likes the idea of the bill, but he has concerns about the fear aspect in the legislation.



“It seems to me that we may be going a bit too far,” he said.



Kulkarni said the fear of violence language in the bill means it has to be something that is currently happening and can be proved with documentation and “not the fear of future violence or abuse.”



In explaining their “no” votes, Rep. Josh Calloway, R-Irvington, and Rep. Scott Sharp, R-Ashland, said they have concerns about the potential of fraud. Calloway said he would like to talk with Kulkarni and Heavrin more about his concerns.



HB 83 now goes to the full House for consideration. END March 23, 2022 Senate approves bill that would strengthen parents’ rights Sen. Stephen West, R-Paris, speaks on Senate Bill 40, which seeks to strengthen parents’ rights. A high-res version of this photo is available here. FRANKFORT — A bill designed to reinforce parents’ rights received approval Wednesday from the Senate.



The bill’s sponsor, Sen. Stephen West, R-Paris, said Senate Bill 40 states that Kentucky courts must apply a strict scrutiny standard when considering the interests of parents in the care, custody and control of their children.



“The purpose of this bill is to protect the fundamental rights of Kentucky parents to direct the upbringing, education and care of their children as guaranteed under Fifth, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution,” he said.



The care, custody and control of parents’ children is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by the courts, West said.



“In fact, this right of parents to direct upbringing, education and care of their children predates the court itself. It is a right that was already understood and acknowledged long before the United States came to be as a country” he said.



West said these rights were recognized in English common law and by the commonwealth’s forefathers. He added that the bill does not affect existing state statutes, which have been under this standard for many years.



“This bill simply protects an idea and a standard that has been in operation since the founding of this state and even before that in order for the state to enact laws affecting our fundamental right to parent our children,” he said.



An amendment was added to legislation on the Senate floor Wednesday to except instances of child abuse and neglect. It passed 23-14 and now heads to the House.



Senate Minority Floor Leader Morgan McGarvey, D-Louisville, was one of the lawmakers who voted in opposition. He said his most important job is being a parent, but the bill is a solution in search of a problem.



McGarvey also expressed concern for children who are being raised by those who are not their biological parents. He pointed to a section of the bill that would define parents as the biological or adoptive mother or father of a child.



“Again, I’m thrilled that I get to be a parent to my kids,” he said. “That is not the reality for every child in Kentucky. In fact, there are 67,000 children in Kentucky who reside in households where the primary caregiver is not that definition of parent. There are 9,000 additional children in Kentucky who are in the foster care system.”



McGarvey said lawmakers should be talking about what they can do for children, not what can be done to them.



“What rights do parents not have in Kentucky right now? I ask as one of them. I don’t feel any threat to help raise my children in the way I see best fit. But this bill could create a problem for kids who do not have their biological parent as their primary caregiver,” he said.



West said the legislation will not negatively impact the right to “step into the shoes” of parents for children who have had issues, whether it’s foster care or another arrangement.



Sen. Johnnie Turner, R-Harlan, said he was going to vote for the measure.



“This bill kind of raises that standard that should have been placed the whole time. We should protect parents’ rights,” he said. “Nothing disrespectful of aunts, uncles, grandpas, brothers and sisters that help take care of them when needed. But this bill raises the bar to where you as a parent now have rights.” END March 23, 2022 House bill to protect genetic data advances in committee Rep. Danny Bentley, R-Russell, testifies on House Bill 502, which would help ensure data gathered by direct-to-consumer genetic testing services remains private. A high-res version of this photo is available here. FRANKFORT — The Senate Health and Welfare Committee took steps Wednesday to help ensure data gathered by direct-to-consumer genetic testing services remains private.



Sponsored by Rep. Danny Bentley, R-Russell, House Bill 502 would put consumers in control of their genetic data from start to finish when they use genetic testing services.



Bentley said the state legislation is needed to strengthen the federal regulations and rules laboratories follow, and it is meant to protect Kentuckians by putting up “guardrails.” The measure is known as the Genetic Information Privacy Act.



“DNA theft can result in exposure of medical information such as AD (Alzheimer’s disease) or predisposition to cancer,” he said, adding that it can also reveal information about your family relations. “We need to protect that for all Kentuckians.”



The measure defines a biological sample as items such as tissue, blood, urine or saliva known to contain DNA.



The legislation calls for consumers to have a process to access their genetic data, delete their account and genetic data, and request and obtain the destruction of their biological samples.



It would also restrict how law enforcement personnel use DNA records that are voluntarily submitted to eliminate suspects.



Ritchie Engelhardt, Head of Government Affairs at Ancestry, said the bill has had broad stakeholder and bipartisan support in the states where similar legislation has already passed.



“That includes Arizona, California, Utah and Wyoming,” he said.



Similar legislation was taken up at The Council of State Governments’ meeting last fall, and the organization opted to include it in its state bill book on model legislation.



Sen. Ralph Alvarado, R-Winchester, said he is in favor of the bill because it’s good legislation and it’s important to protect the state’s citizens.



The measure was approved with a 10-0 vote. It will now go to the full Senate for consideration. END March 22, 2022 Charter schools bill advances off House floor House Majority Whip Chad McCoy, R-Bardstown, presents charter school bill, House Bill 9, on the House floor. A high-res version of this photo is available here. FRANKFORT— It’s now the Kentucky Senate’s turn to consider a House bill on charter schools after the measure advanced off the House floor on Tuesday.



House Bill 9 would make changes to the appeal process if a charter school application is denied by a local school board. It would also codify the funding mechanism for charter schools and authorize two pilot charter school projects.



House Majority Whip Chad McCoy, R-Bardstown, is the primary sponsor of the bill. He said HB 9 builds on charter school legislation from the 2017 legislative session.



Under current law, local school boards hold the power to authorize a charter school, and charter schools may appeal that decision to the Kentucky Department of Education (KDE). McCoy said HB 9 does not change that. Instead, the bill requires the department to explain its decision.



“(The bill) says that the KDE has to tell you why they’re denying you or approving you and say why this is or is not something good for the local community,” McCoy said. “In addition, we’ve changed and asked the KDE to offer technical assistance to an applicant.”



According to McCoy, another provision of HB 9 would give school districts with less than 7,500 students a way to “veto” a charter school appeal.



“If you are a school district with less than 7,500 kids, part of the application process requires that you submit a memorandum of understanding with your application from the local school district. If you can’t get that, then your application is deemed incomplete, thus you don’t have an appeal,” McCoy said.



Under HB 9, two charter school pilot projects would be authorized to open by 2023 in the West End of Louisville and in Northern Kentucky. McCoy said the hope is the pilot projects will reveal to the legislature what changes need to be made, if any, to how charter schools operate in the Commonwealth.



Rep. Tina Bojanowski, D-Louisville, who is a public school educator, spoke in opposition to HB 9 on the House floor. She also proposed five floor amendments to make various changes to the measure. All five of the amendments failed to gain enough votes to be eligible for consideration.



In a House floor speech, Bojanowski criticized the charter school industry and said she believes “using public dollars to fund charter schools in Kentucky is unconstitutional.”



“The driving force here is not innovation. It is profits, and selling our children’s education for a profit is wrong,” she said.



Rep. Timmy Truett, R-McKee, who is a public school principal, said while school choice sounds “great,” he has also concerns.



“I’m all for parents having a choice, but I’m not for giving certain schools unfair advantages,” Truett said. “In my opinion, House Bill 9 is a vote against public education, and I encourage you to think about that before you make that vote.”



In a nearly two and a half hour debate, many legislators spoke against HB 9 on the House floor, including Rep. Cherlynn Stevenson, D-Lexington. In her speech, she cited data that showed out of 116 charter schools in Tennessee, only five have a success rate of more than 20%.



McCoy said he does not think the claim that charter schools have a high failure rate “holds water.” He cited data that shows the charter school failure rate at 2.8%. He also said he does not believe local school boards would allow a charter school to come in to a community and do the “horrible things” some lawmakers expressed concerns about.



“Look, I’ll be the first to tell you that there are bad charter schools out there, and I think everybody would agree with me that there are bad public schools out there too,” McCoy said. “That’s not an indictment on the whole process one way or another. This is about parents. Parents need choice, and this bill gives choice in our public school system.”



Rep. Kevin D. Bratcher, R-Louisville, joined several voices speaking in favor of HB 9 on the House floor. He said parents want a choice when it comes to their child’s education, and he believes the legislature should “give them a little bit of choice.”



Rep. Scott Sharp, R-Ashland, agreed HB 9 is a bill about giving parents a choice.



“I’ve got to do what I think is best for the parents of my district to give them an option of something different, to give them more options than what they have,” he said.



The House approved HB 9 by a 51-46 vote. It will now go before the Senate for consideration. END March 22, 2022 House committee approves Teaching American Principles Act Sen. Max Wise, R-Campbellsville, testifies on Senate Bill 138 during the House Education Committee on Tuesday. A high-res version of this photo is available here. FRANKFORT— A Senate bill seeking to improve civics education in public schools is one step closer to becoming law.



The House Education Committee approved Senate Bill 138, or the Teaching American Principles Act, on Tuesday.



“The purpose of this bill is to preserve the alignment of middle and high school standards with American principles of equality, freedom and personal agency,” said Sen. Max Wise, R-Campbellsville, the bill’s primary sponsor.



Under SB 138, public schools would have to provide instruction in social studies that aligns with a list of concepts such as “all individuals are created equal” and “Americans are entitled to equal protection under the law,” among several others.



It also requires instruction to be “within the range of knowledge, understanding, age, and maturity of the students receiving the instruction.”



Another provision of SB 138 would provide a list of documents for the Kentucky Department of Education to incorporate into grade-level appropriate academic standards for middle and high school social studies classes.



Those documents include, “The Mayflower Compact,” the U.S. Constitution, the U.S. Supreme Court opinion in Plessy v. Ferguson, the “Declaration of Rights of the Women of the United States,” Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech, “A Time for Choosing” by Ronald Reagan and more.



Wise said SB 138 is necessary because less than 25% of U.S. students graduating high school can pass a U.S. civics or citizenship examination.



“We are facing a civics crisis in not just the Commonwealth of Kentucky, but the United States,” Wise added. “I do not blame the teachers for that, but I look at things that get cut many times from our standards and it is civics education.”



Kate Miller with the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky was one of many to testify against SB 138 during the committee meeting. She was joined by students who also spoke against the bill.



“Senate Bill 138 first serves as a way to censor speech,” Miller said. “It is a government censorship bill. There’s a long history of these types of bills, and we should remember that First Amendment rights do not stop for teachers or students at the schoolhouse gate.”



During Wise’s testimony, he said the intention of SB 138 is not to dictate what can and cannot be said in the classroom.



“There is nothing in the bill that tells an educator what you can or cannot teach. It does not discipline teachers,” Wise said. “It does not tell a student what you can and cannot say. It simply looks at the foundations of our country and allows educators to go back and use those documents.”



During discussion of the bill, Rep. Attica Scott, D- Louisville, said she has an issue with the bill’s “erasure of women” in the core documents list. She also questioned language in the bill regarding the teaching of slavery, the Civil War and racial segregation and discrimination. In explaining her “no” vote, Scott expressed concerns about censorship.



“I just can’t vote for something that takes away the voice of so many people that I represent back home in District 41,” she said.



Rep. Myron Dossett, R-Pembroke, spoke in favor of SB 138 while explaining his “yes” vote. He mentioned his granddaughter and conversations they have about American History.



“Things that I have taught her about the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, things that I have brought into her mind on this to let her know that equality does exist in this nation,” Dossett said. “Maybe in some instances we could do better, but that we have learned from our past and that she has a chance of a very good life.”



SB 138 will now go before the full House for consideration. END March 22, 2022 Senate advances bill to allow 18-year-olds to sell, serve alcohol FRANKFORT — Kentucky is on its way to joining many states where 18-year-olds can sell and serve alcoholic beverages.



Currently, Kentucky sets the minimum age to sell and serve alcohol at 20, but House Bill 252 would lower the threshold. The Senate on Monday gave final passage to the bill with a 23-10 vote. It now heads to the governor’s desk.



Supporters said the legislation would not only help the beleaguered restaurant industry, but also young people who seek employment.



“So when you go into a restaurant today there are empty tables, and it’s not because of COVID or six feet of distancing requirements,” said Senate Majority Caucus Chair Julie Raque Adams, R-Louisville. “It’s because restaurants do not have enough staff. House Bill 252 is an attempt to correct that part of our workforce shortage.”



The legislation is sponsored by Rep. Killian Timoney, R-Lexington. However, Adams presented the bill on the Senate floor.



By allowing restaurants to hire 18-year-olds, restaurants gain a larger employment pool and opportunities expand for young job seekers, she said.



“In comparing Kentucky’s laws to surrounding states, all of them allow a person to be employed before the age of 20, and today this leads many of our young Kentuckians to work across the borders. So, the challenges caused by COVID still reverberate throughout the restaurant industry including workforce shortages,” she said.



The bill would also offer “immediate and significant” relief to distribution companies, according to Adams.



Sen. Wil Schroder, R-Wilder, voted for the bill and said he is in agreement about young job seekers who look for opportunities in surrounding states.



“We’ve seen when people have the ability to choose – that are under 21 – whether to take a job in the restaurant industry in Ohio or in Kentucky,” he said. “This plays a factor because this plays a factor in their tips. So this will play a factor in workforce retention for some of our restaurants in Northern Kentucky.”



Sen. Brandon Smith, R-Hazard, said he would normally vote against this type of legislation. But if it becomes problematic, the law could be changed next year, he said. “I hate to think I would do something to knock one of these young people out of getting a job that they desperately need only because of something like this,” he said. “It doesn’t create an opportunity for them to drink any more than they have on their own.” END March 21, 2022 Pari-mutuel wagering modernization bill clears House floor Rep. Adam Koenig, R-Erlanger, left, confers with Rep. Ken Upchurch, R-Monticello, on House Bill 607 on the House floor. A high-res version of this photo is available here. FRANKFORT— The Kentucky House of Representatives approved a bill Monday that seeks to tax every pari-mutuel wager at 1.5%.



Rep. Adam Koenig, R-Erlanger, is the primary sponsor of House Bill 607. He said the bill will modernize the pari-mutuel wagering industry.



“We’re going to make Kentucky the most desirable place if you want to wager on horses in North America,” Koenig said. “That’s going to create more revenue. That’s going to create more opportunities for our tracks and provide a lot of success.”



HB 607 follows reforms to pari-mutuel wagering in the 2021 Regular Session. It is also the product of the Pari-Mutuel Wagering Taxation Task Force. Koenig said the task force met five times during the 2021 interim.



Currently, advance-deposit wagering is taxed at .5%, and bets on simulcasts are taxed at 3%, Koenig said. HB 607 would tax every pari-mutuel wager at 1.5%, the same rate for races happening at a track.



“I’m sure all of those tax rates made sense at one point, but we don’t think they make sense anymore,” Koenig said.



HB 607 also directs more money to the general fund, eliminates breakage, makes the Kentucky Racing Commission responsible for self-funding, creates a self-exclusion list for problem gamblers, eliminates the track admissions tax and more.



Koenig said pari-mutuel wagering brings in millions of revenue to the state already, and if passed, the changes proposed in HB 607 are expected to bring in more.



“In 2016, the general fund saw $4 million from (historical horse racing) machines. In 2021, it saw $41 million, so it went up 10 times in a span of four years,” Koenig said. “And this year, we’re estimating it to be $62 million, which will be a 50% increase. So those increases are happening whether we pass this bill or not.”



During discussion of the bill, several lawmakers said they would like to see a higher tax rate on pari-mutuel wagering.



Rep. Josh Calloway, R-Irvington, proposed a floor amendment to raise the tax to 6%.



“I believe that gambling is an irresponsible way to raise revenue,” Calloway said. “…. And so my thought process is that if we are going to do this, and we continue to move forward with it, that we should benefit as much as possible from this and try to get as much for the state as we can.”



Speaking against the amendment, Koenig said it would “put an end to the historical horse racing machine (HHR) system in Kentucky.” Calloway’s floor amendment failed by a 32-39 vote.



Rep. Nima Kulkarni, D-Louisville, also urged the House to consider a higher tax rate on pari-mutuel wagering.



“I will be voting no on this bill because we as a body should be looking at ways to fairly tax HHR revenues instead of continuing to subsidize and bailout corporations with record breaking, soaring profits,” she said.



Rep. Matthew Koch, R-Paris, who was a member of the Pari-Mutuel Wagering Taxation Task Force, spoke in favor of HB 607.



“I think the task force did exactly what it set out to do,” he said.



In explaining his “yes” vote, Rep. Jim DuPlessis, R-Elizabethtown, said although he would like to see a higher tax rate on pari-mutuel wagering, he likes that the bill in its current form will still generate more revenue for the state.



The House approved HB 607 by an 81-14 vote. It will now go before the Senate for consideration. END March 18, 2022 House votes to take a gamble on sports betting Rep. Adam Koenig, R-Erlanger, presents House Bill 606 on the House floor on Friday. A high-res version of this photo is available here. FRANKFORT— A bill many Kentuckians have spent years asking for advanced off the House floor on Friday.



House Bill 606 would legalize in-person and online sports betting in Kentucky.



“House Bill 606 brings activities that go on in every corner of this state out of the darkness and into the light,” said primary bill sponsor Rep. Adam Koenig, R-Erlanger. “It legalizes sports wagering and regulates it. It regulates the daily fantasy sports, which goes on openly on U.S. companies today, and it legalizes and regulates online poker.”



Koenig said sports betting is legal in most of the states surrounding Kentucky. He also cited a statistic from American Gaming Association that estimates $2 billion is illegally wagered on sports in Kentucky each year.



The bipartisan bill would tax sports betting by implementing a 9.75% tax on the adjusted gross revenue for in-person sports betting and a 14.25% tax on the adjusted gross revenue for online sports betting. The money would go toward the state’s pension fund.



Koenig said the state estimates that legalizing sports betting in Kentucky would bring in $22.5 million in revenue for the state.



“Given how many states have exceeded their projections, I think $22.5 million is probably a minimum,” Koenig added.



Rep. Josh Calloway, R-Irvington, called a floor amendment to set a $1,000 limit on how much a bettor can lose in a 24-hour period online.



“For instance, if you are a bartender and you see someone that is (drunk), you would stop and not serve them anymore, and I believe that we could put these same types of limits on this if this is going to move forward,” he said.



Koenig said he “trusts adults to make adult decisions,” and he could not support the amendment because it would be easy to avoid the limit by going to another state. Koenig also mentioned he knows of people in Kentucky who already make their livelihood on sports betting.



Calloway’s amendment failed by a voice vote.



While voting on HB 606, several lawmakers explained their “no” votes.



Rep. Daniel Elliott, R-Danville, said while he is a “big believer in personal responsibility,” he would not be voting in favor of HB 606.



“I think the appropriate way to deal with this issue and all issues of gaming in Kentucky and gambling is through a constitutional amendment. That I would support,” Elliott said.



Rep. David Hale, R-Wellington, said he was voting “no” on the bill because he does not like that the purpose of the bill is to generate revenue and that it would hurt vulnerable people.



Rep. Rachel Roberts, D-Newport, voted “yes” on HB 606. She said she was proud to co-sponsor the measure.



“I, like many others have said, received so many messages from constituents in District 67 who overwhelmingly want this,” Roberts added.



Rep. Cherlynn Stevenson, D-Lexington, also voted in favor of HB 606. She said the bill is “without a shadow of a doubt” the issue she has received the most phone calls and emails about in her four years in the House with 99% of those messages being in favor of sports betting in Kentucky.



HB 606 cleared the House by a 58-30 vote. It will now go before the Senate for consideration. END March 18, 2022 This Week at the State Capitol Lawmakers from the House and Senate met in conference committee Thursday night to negotiate the state’s next two-year budget. A high-res version of this photo is available here. FRANKFORT — The final days of the 2022 legislative session are well in sight, and lawmakers are redoubling efforts to count votes and move bills, including some high-profile measures this week on gambling and medical cannabis.



The Kentucky General Assembly has nine days left in the 60-day session, and many of the most watched bills from this year are hanging in the balance, including the state’s historic executive branch budget, which is poised to top $100 billion.



Lawmakers met in conference committee on Wednesday and Thursday night to begin negotiating a budget deal between the House and Senate, and talks are expected to continue next week.



The late meetings foreshadow even longer hours ahead as legislators debate, amend and otherwise prepare dozens of additional bills for final passage.



This week started with a jolt as the House advanced 22 bills during a marathon floor session on Monday. Measures related to juvenile justice, unemployment insurance, and penalties for trafficking fentanyl, among many others, all cleared the floor.



The Senate also kicked off the week by giving final passage to House Bill 263 – known as Kami’s Law – which would increase the penalties for abusing children under 12 years of age.



Much of the attention shifted toward medical cannabis and gambling as the week continued.



The House advanced a massive package out of committee on Wednesday that included four separate measures on gambling. Two of those bills, which would legalize most forms of sports betting and ban electronic “gray” machines, advanced off the House floor Friday.



The medicinal cannabis bill – House Bill 136 – also cleared the House floor on Thursday after a long and impassioned debate.



It would legalize some forms of cannabis as a treatment option for people with cancer, chronic pain, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, chronic nausea and post-traumatic stress disorder.



The legislation also calls on officials to track cannabis prescriptions through the Kentucky All Schedule Prescription Electronic Reporting (KASPER) system.



In addition to those measures, many other bills were moving through the process this week. That includes legislation related to:



Fentanyl: House Bill 215, called “Dalton’s Law,” would make importing fentanyl, carfentanil or fentanyl derivatives a Class C felony. Offenders would be required to serve at least 85% of their sentence and would not be eligible for pretrial diversion under the bill. It cleared the House floor on Monday.



Felon student aid: Senate Bill 163 would allow some inmates and felons to access state aid for college, including funds from the Kentucky Educational Excellence Scholarship, known as KEES. The bill passed off the Senate floor Wednesday.



Refugee relief funds: Senate Bill 195 would earmark $50 million to assist refugees from Ukraine and other countries. That includes grants to help families relocate. The Senate Appropriations and Revenue Committee approved the bill on Wednesday.



Abortion: With some exceptions, Senate Bill 321 would prohibit abortions at 15 weeks of gestation and redefine the term “pain-capable unborn child” in state law. It moved off the Senate floor on Wednesday.



KSU Board: Senate Bill 265 would direct the governor to name replacements for the Kentucky State University Board of Regents by April 4. The bill received final passage on Thursday and was sent to the governor.



School boards: House Bill 121 calls on school boards to provide a public comment period of at least 15 minutes during each regular meeting. It would also require rules around civility to remain in effect during comment periods. The bill cleared the Senate floor on Thursday.



Child abuse: House Bill 270 seeks to combat child abuse by teaching young students in Kentucky schools to speak up when they are victimized. The Senate Education Committee advanced the measure Thursday.



Religious freedom: House Bill 43 would prevent houses of worship and other religious organizations from being singled out for closure during a state of emergency. The bill passed the Senate State and Local Government Committee on Thursday.



Transgender athletes: Senate Bill 83 would prevent male-to-female transgender students from participating in girls’ sports, starting in the sixth grade. It moved off the House floor on Thursday.



Public assistance: House Bill 7 calls for a major overhaul of Kentucky’s public assistance programs with a focus on work requirements and battling fraud. It passed off the House floor on Thursday.



The General Assembly will return Monday for day 52 of the session, and Kentuckians can track the action through the Legislative Record webpage, which allows users to follow a bill’s progression through the chambers.

END March 17, 2022 Senate advances bill to require comment period at school board meetings Sen. Max Wise, R-Campbellsville, speaks on House Bill 121, which would require at least 15 minutes for public comment at school board meetings. A high-res version of this photo is available here. FRANKFORT —A bill that would require civility and public comment periods during school board meetings advanced Thursday on the Senate floor.



House Bill 121 calls on school boards to provide a public comment period of at least 15 minutes, or until comment ends, at each regular meeting. The comment period could be passed over if no one has made a request to speak.



Sen. Max Wise, R-Campbellsville, presented the bill on the Senate floor and told lawmakers that parents were sometimes shut out of school board meetings in Kentucky and many other states.



“I think it would be an understatement to say that for the past two years, there’s probably not been more attendance, passion, debate, … dialogue that’s been expressed in local school board meetings in a long, long time.”



HB 121 is sponsored by Rep. Regina Huff, R-Williamsburg; Rep. Thomas Huff, R-Shepherdsville; and Rep. Brandon Reed, R-Hodgenville. It received approval in the Senate with a 25-10 vote after lawmakers adopted two amendments. The bill will now return to the House.



One amendment was sponsored by Sen. Gerald A. Neal, D-Louisville. It would require that any board rules and policies related to conduct during meetings remain in effect during the public comment period.



“That’s to make sure that we maintain the civility and the order that obviously anyone conducting a hearing of any kind, a board meeting of any kind, must maintain,” he said.



The second amendment – sponsored by Sen. Adrienne Southworth, R-Lawrenceburg – clarified that the public comment period could last longer than 15 minutes if needed.



Senate Minority Floor Leader Morgan McGarvey, D-Louisville, stood in opposition to HB 121 after noting that he too is a parent.



“I believe in having parents’ voices involved in education,” he said. “Let’s make no mistake about what we are doing here today though. We are telling locally elected officials how to run their meetings.”



Wise concluded by thanking parents and school officials, who he said never expected to be dealing with the issues that have come their way.



“In the times of strife, in the times of compassion and passion, we appreciate the work that each one of our local officials have displayed,” he said. END March 17, 2022 Bill legalizing medicinal cannabis clears House floor Rep. Jason Nemes, R-Louisville, presents House Bill 136, a bill to legalize medicinal cannabis on the House floor. A high-res version of the photo can be found here. FRANKFORT— Doctors may soon be permitted to prescribe medicinal cannabis to Kentuckians with certain medical conditions.



House Bill 136 would legalize medicinal cannabis as a treatment option for people with cancer, chronic pain, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, chronic nausea, cyclical vomiting, and post-traumatic stress disorder.



The bill’s primary sponsor, Rep. Jason Nemes, R-Louisville, has carried similar legislation in the House before, but the measures failed to receive approval from both chambers. Nemes said he’s worked with many people over the years to make changes to the legislation that more lawmakers could support.



“When I took this bill and grabbed it by the horns and made it tighter, I worked with a lot of you, a lot of senators and made it to where this is truly a bill for people who are just trying to be and just trying to be better,” Nemes told lawmakers on the House floor.



Nemes added he does not support recreational marijuana and was originally against medicinal marijuana, but had a change of heart after hearing about the benefits of medicinal cannabis.



HB 136 would not allow people to grow their own marijuana or smoke cannabis, aside from vaping. Nemes said only Kentuckians 21 and older would be permitted to vape medicinal cannabis.



Another provision of the bill would create four different licenses to prevent just one person or company from being able to grow, process, dispense and test medicinal cannabis for safety. Prescriptions would also be tracked through the Kentucky All Schedule Prescription Electronic Reporting (KASPER) system.



On the House floor, Nemes successfully amended the bill to require legislative approval for conditions to be added or removed from the approved list. Rep. Rachel Roberts, D-Newport, also successfully amended the bill to add post-traumatic stress disorder to the list of approved conditions. She said out of the 37 other states that have legalized medicinal cannabis, all of them allow it as a treatment for PTSD. A clinical diagnosis would be required for a patient to be eligible for a medicinal cannabis prescription.



Rep. Al Gentry, D-Louisville, spoke on the House floor in favor of HB 136 by sharing how medicinal cannabis has helped people he knows.



“I know real people that have had their lives turned around by these products, and a lot of them are living in the closet or living in secrecy because they feel like they’re a criminal,” Gentry said.



Rep. Chris Fugate, R-Chavies, said he understands and has compassion for people who are in pain, but he has legal concerns about the bill.



“The fact of the matter is marijuana, whether medical or recreational, is still illegal in the federal government,” Fugate said, adding doctors and pharmacists risk losing their United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) license by prescribing medicinal cannabis. Fugate also expressed concerns about addiction.



Nemes said while marijuana is illegal under federal law, the federal government has said it would not prosecute against cannabis use for medicinal purposes in states where it is legal.



Rep. Matt Lockett, R-Nicholasville, also expressed concerns about HB 136. He believes medicinal cannabis needs more research.



“I do believe that it can be a great tool in our tool belt in the medical community. However, I do believe that it deserves a lot more time,” Lockett said.



In explaining her “yes” vote, Rep. Norma Kirk-McCormick, R-Inez, said she has also seen how medicinal cannabis helps people with chronic medical conditions.



Rep. Patti Minter, D-Bowling Green, also voted in favor of HB 136 with her constituents in mind.



“I’ve cast many votes in support of medicinal marijuana before because the people of District 20 asked me to do it — people from every walk of life,” Minter said.",https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/publicservices/pio/release.html
