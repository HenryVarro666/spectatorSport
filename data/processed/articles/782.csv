Born two months premature to American parents, the twins were moved from Kyiv to Poland in a rescue evacuation on Monday.

On the day Russia invaded Ukraine, Max and his wife drove from their home in Germany to Poland, and then crossed the border into Ukraine. With fear, they moved in the opposite direction of the long line of cars that intended to flee the country and that was snarling the roads for miles.

Traveling diagonally across the country on Feb. 24, they encountered unmistakable signs of possible violence to come, from dozens of Ukrainian military checkpoints, tanks patrolling the roads and sandbags piled high on the street.

Not venturing to the country would have broken the couple’s decade-old dream to have a family. Their Ukrainian surrogate mother was soon expected to give birth to their twin daughters.

“Just our children not being with us was something we couldn’t live with,” Max said.

Now when his daughters smile at him, the war fades away. They were born prematurely on March 4. But he knows that any day, war could be coming closer to his family. Air raid sirens sound day and night, and much of the twins’ first days in the world have been spent in the hospital’s underground shelter.

Max said he didn’t know if, when and how his new family of four would be able to return home to safety. He spoke on the condition that his last name not be used because many of his relatives did not know he and his wife had turned to surrogacy.

The Russian war in Ukraine has devastated cities and killed more than 500 Ukrainian civilians, with no end to the fighting in sight. The war has also engulfed the lives of foreign couples seeking to become parents. Nearly every day, Ukrainian surrogates give birth to the children of foreign couples, and these parents are struggling to evacuate their children or even meet them for the first time.

Commercial surrogacy is legal in Ukraine for heterosexual married couples who are medically unable to have children or who have unsuccessfully tried to become pregnant several times using in vitro fertilization. The country’s favorable laws — biological parents are listed on the baby’s birth certificate — and affordable prices, generally around $40,000, have attracted many aspiring parents.

Most parents visit Kyiv, the capital, once before their child’s birth, to visit agencies, potentially undergo in vitro fertilization and sign a surrogacy contract. Then, the process of a surrogate becoming pregnant may take multiple attempts over years.

At least a dozen companies offer surrogacy in Ukraine, and BioTexCom, one of the leading agencies in Kyiv, estimates that it arranges at least a thousand births each year. The agency had expected to have 100 babies born by month’s end. Many of these newborns will be born in Kyiv, where fighting has neared hospitals, far from the parents who wait anxiously from outside Ukraine’s borders to take them home.

Sam Everingham, the founder of Growing Families, a nonprofit based in Australia that supports people navigating surrogacy, said that he had heard from about 90 panicked couples with newborns or babies soon expected in Ukraine. Surrogacy agencies, many of them based in Kyiv, once courted parents with images of chubby-cheeked babies and sonograms. Now, the agencies’ social media pages are filled with grim updates of the staff members’ upended lives and their attempts to keep surrogates and newborns safe in bleak shelters.

Some agencies, like New Hope Surrogacy, have relocated pregnant surrogates to safer regions of the country, or outside of it altogether. However, if these women give birth in neighboring countries with different laws about paid surrogacy, the biological parents’ rights could be jeopardized.

The number of stranded babies is growing. Denis Herman, BioTexCom’s legal adviser, said the agency was caring for 30 newborns, most of them in Kyiv.

“We have a lot of babies born during this time,” Mr. Herman said. “We cannot stop this process. We have to find some ways to deal with it.”

BioTexCom believes that the babies are safer in the bomb shelters in Kyiv than being transferred in haste, Mr. Herman said.

Mr. Everingham has heard about “an ongoing flow” of parents traveling into Ukraine despite the risk.

Televised scenes of Russian strikes have terrified parents, including a new Canadian father who spoke on the condition of anonymity because his religion forbade surrogacy. His son was born in Kyiv shortly before the war began. He and his wife are in Turkey, trying to figure out a plan to extract their son, mired by deep stress and depression as they follow the news.

“I don’t know what to do and where to go,” said the 41-year-old man, who lives in Toronto. “The joy of our child has taken over by the fear we might never get to hold him and lose him forever.”

The parents who have managed to extract their children through a combination of luck, connections and timing, say they feel immense responsibility to help evacuate their surrogates and others left behind in Ukraine.

Sasha Spektor, who lives in Chicago with his partner, Irma Nuñez, met his twin boys, Lenny and Moishe, for the first time on Tuesday. His sons had just traveled from Kyiv to Poland, a journey that took about 18 hours.

They were born two months prematurely in Kyiv at the beginning of war, on Feb. 25. The couple, their friends and supporters made hundreds of calls to locate resources in Kyiv, like baby formula and medical equipment, and to find the twins a way out of the war zone. The couple previously told their story of bringing their sons to safety to The Washington Post and NPR.

Eventually, they were able to secure an evacuation with the help of a volunteer Ukrainian ambulance crew and Project Dynamo, a nonprofit based in Tampa, Fla., conducting rescue missions out of Ukraine.

Meeting their sons was amazing, the new father said, adding that they were so gentle, and so tiny.

Their surrogate, Katya, crossed into Poland with the twins and another baby and its parents. Several days later, she returned to Ukraine, to reunite with her 6-year-old son in Lviv with the hopes of fleeing the country together.

“There are other people I feel responsible for,” Mr. Spektor said. “It was just as hard for me to part with her and just let her go back into Ukraine. She is one of us.”",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/03/11/world/ukraine-russia-news

Kramer'],2022-03-12 00:00:00,"One of the Ukrainian fighters trying to hold the Russians at bay on Saturday, a man named Vitaly, had taken up a position outside what would once have been an unlikely spot for combat: a gas station mini-market, its windows now blown out by shelling, on the town’s eastern edge. This is his hometown, and he joined the volunteer forces called the Territorial Defense Forces to try to protect it just two weeks ago.

“We are trying to push them back,” he said, “but we don’t control the town.”

The battle for the northwestern suburb of Irpin — about three miles from Kyiv’s city limits — literally echoed in the capital, where the low rumble of sustained fire was close enough to be heard now in most parts of the city. Artillery duels between Ukrainian and Russian forces in the suburbs that had intensified on Friday continued throughout the day Saturday.

Ukrainian forces were firing volleys of Grad rocket artillery, shot from truck-mounted boxes of rockets, typically with a dozen or more fired at a time. Although the artillery was out of view, the whooshing noises of the rockets blasting off, followed a few seconds later by the distant thuds of impacts, could be heard every 20 minutes or so.

So far on Saturday, the rockets flew over Irpin, rather than crashing into it.

Vadim Kovalchuk, 33, a construction engineer who had also stayed as a volunteer soldier, described the Irpin he has known as a “wonderful town,” a perfect place for people who wanted to be close to Kyiv and its job market and schools.

Real estate was cheaper than in the city center, he said, and the town had grown over the past two decades as newcomers were attracted to its location. Many people had commuted by car to work in the city center until the peace was shattered.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/12/world/europe/ukraine-russia-forces-battle-kyiv.html

While the Russian military strategy is not a categorical failure in Ukraine as some are portraying, Moscow may have underestimated the resistance.

Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers met each other today in Türkiye’s Antalya for the first time since Moscow’s assault on Kiev began on February 24. It was a positive sign that the Russians and Ukrainians could finally talk about their differences at a high level despite the negotiations ending without concrete results.

On the ground, the fighting continues as the Russian army attacks various Ukrainian cities in a slow-motion offensive, which might be part of Moscow's military strategy to tire Kiev’s forces to force them to surrender one by one, according to experts.

Edward Erickson, a former American military officer and a retired Professor of Military History from the Department of War Studies at the Marine Corps University, is not necessarily a fan of the Western media’s coverage of the ongoing Russian offensive “sympathetic to the defenders”.

“Frankly, I just do not believe that the Russians are doing as badly as the western media is reporting,” Erickson told TRT World in a previous interview. But he also thinks that fighting is not going on course as the Russians had predicted prior to the assault.

“There is no question that the Russians thought that they would make rapid progress and, perhaps, reach an end state quickly,” the American military analyst says, referring to Ukrainian resistance across the country.

“The Russians surely underestimated Ukraine's will to fight and underestimated Zelenskyy's commitment as a genuine war leader of his people,” the well-known American military academic tells TRT World. Not many, including Western media initially expected that the Ukrainians would fight so fiercely against the Russian onslaught.

Also a lot of people questionedwhether a former comedian, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, will have the will to face a Russian offensive and a leader like Vladimir Putin, a former KGB agent and a man who knows how to use sheer power in military conflicts.

While the Russians have made substantial gains across southern Ukraine, claiming some crucial port cities across the Black Sea coast, slowly moving to encircle the country’s two biggest cities, Kiev and Kharkiv, they have not been able to implement a full-scale assault after two weeks of brutal fighting.

“Prior to the ongoing attack, Russians had an expectation that they would not face a resistance against their army in eastern Ukraine. But it did not happen as the Russians expected,” says Esref Yalinkilcli, a Moscow-based Eurasia political analyst.

Kharkiv, an eastern Ukrainian city with a large Russian population, is not far away from the Russian border, only at a distance of 40 kilometers - but the Russians still did not just walk in and claim it.

“No one in Kharkiv, Kherson, Sumy and Mariupol greeted the Russians with flowers,” Yalinkilicli tells TRT World, referring to eastern Ukrainian cities with substantial Russian populations. Except for Kherson, none of these cities have not fallen to Russian hands yet.

There is also fierce fighting in Mariupol, a Black Sea city crucial to Russia’s aim to connect the separatist-held Donbass region with the Russian annexed Crimean Peninsula in southern Ukraine.

Also Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, is not too far from Belarus, a pro-Russian state, which allowed Moscow to deploy troops into its territory. The distance between Kiev and the Belarus border is about 150 kilometres. In Kiev, which was the capital of the first Russian state in the 9th century, Russians are also facing fierce resistance preventing them from claiming it.

Russian expectations

Despite not meeting their initial expectations, Russia, the world’s second biggest army, still has a lot of military power to overcome Ukraine. But using more forces might also indicate a weakness.

“Regarding Russian physical capacity, they have the ability to mobilise substantial reserves and to bring in forces from elsewhere. They can use these to backfill occupied territory while the ‘tip of the spear’ combat forces push forward,” Erickson says, meaning Moscow can make up its losses with fresh forces from home while maintaining its main operations.

But the Russian military's need for greater forces to push its army further across Ukraine might indicate that its initial planning miscalculated troop levels.

“At the operational level, the Russians chose to fight a war giving the Ukrainians the advantage of ‘interior lines of communications’ while Russia is disadvantaged with ‘exterior lines of communications’. This is strong evidence that Putin thought this war would be easier and more rapid,"" Erickson says, pointing out another sign of Russian expectations.

Interior lines and exterior lines are referring to two critical strategies in the war doctrine. “Interior lines are those of an army centrally situated acting against divided hostile forces; exterior lines those adopted by divided armies acting against a centrally placed opponent,” according J. C. Dundas, a prominent British expert.

Despite Russia’s strategic disadvantage, Putin might be willing to use more force, according to Erickson.

“We do not know what additional forces and resources that Putin will bring to bear. There is certainly additional Russian capacity available in the form of reserve forces and forces in the Baltic/Saint Petersburg area (as well as west of the Urals) which can be redeployed to reinforce the Russian army fighting in Ukraine,” the analyst says.

But Putin has recently denied that Russia is using any conscripted soldiers and will not use them in “combat operations”. The Russian president also pointed out that “Nor will there be any additional mobilisation of reserves” against Ukrainian forces.

But why did the Russians expect a short military engagement?

It might be related to Putin’s historical and political understanding of the Ukraine issue.Putin, a Russian nationalist, believes that Ukrainians and Russians are part of the same nation. “When I was asked about Russian-Ukrainian relations, I said that Russians and Ukrainians were one people—a single whole,” Putin wrote in a long article last year.

Like the old Tsars of Russia, Putin believes that Ukraine is just “Little Russia”, being part of “the greater Russian nation which united” Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians. (Sputnik/Mikhail Klimentyev/Kremlin / Reuters)

Believing that Ukrainians feel the same way some Russians may feel about their national identity might have misled Putin and his circle to expect a short military conflict and little Ukrainian resistance, according to Yalinkilicli. Other experts also thought that Putin believed “the inhabitants of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Lviv (sic) yearn for Moscow’s rule.”

Like the old Tsars of Russia, Putin believes that Ukraine is just “Little Russia” (Malorussia), being part of “the greater Russian nation which united” Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians.

As a result, at a crucial moment in history, Putin believed that Ukrainians would side with Moscow rather than Western nations, according to Yalinkilicli.

There could also be a Russian underestimation and lack of respect in regard to Ukrainian military capabilities. The Kremlin might think that Ukraine, which is not qualified to be a sovereign nation if it’s not allied with Russia according to Putin, cannot give a serious fight to Moscow no matter how much it is armed and backed by the US-led Western bloc.

Ioannis Koskinas, a senior fellow at the international security program of New America, an American think-tank, believes that the real issue is not whether Russia underestimated the Ukrainian resistance or overestimated their own capability.

“The real questions are how much damage is Russia willing to inflict on Ukraine (civilian and military) and how much is it willing to accept (militarily, economically, and in terms of domestic politics). To answer these questions we must go beyond the mirror image of what we would find acceptable,” Koskinas, a former US military officer, tells TRT World.

“Many policy miscalculations occur due to mirror imaging.”

On 24 February 2022, Ukraine was suddenly and deliberately attacked by land, naval and air forces of Russia, igniting the largest European war since the Great Patriotic War. The military buildup in preceeding months makes it obvious that the unprovoked and dastardly Russian attack was deliberately planned long in advance. During the intervening time, the Russian government had deliberately sought to deceive the world by false statements and expressions of hope for continued peace.

""To initiate a war of aggression... is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole."" [Judgment of the International Military Tribunal]

Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine in response to the appeal of the leaders of the ""Donbass republics"" for help. That attack is a blatant violation of the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. Putin stressed that Moscow's plans did not include the occupation of Ukrainian territories, the goal is the demilitarization and denazification of the country. As stated in the Russian Defense Ministry, the Russian military does not strike at cities, but disable only the military infrastructure, so nothing threatens the civilian population.

US intelligence chiefs said they thought China, which has refused to condemn Russia or call the attack an invasion, was ""unsettled"" by events in Ukraine. ""I do believe that the Chinese leadership, President Xi (Jinping) in particular, is unsettled,"" Central Intelligence Agency (CAI) Director William Burns said. ""By what he's seen, partly because his own intelligence doesn't appear to have told him what was going to happen.""

At the Senate Intelligence Committee's annual hearing on worldwide threats to US security, US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said Russian forces are operating with ""reckless disregard"" for civilians as they face stronger-than-expected resistance in Ukraine.""The Russian military has begun to loosen its rules of engagement to achieve their military objectives,"" said Haines. US intelligence agencies are tracking Russia's actions to hold them to account, Haines added.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he feared Russia would deploy chemical weapons in Ukraine. ""The stuff that you're hearing about chemical weapons, this is straight out of their playbook,"" Johnson said in an interview with Sky News. ""They start saying that there are chemical weapons that have been stored by their opponents or by the Americans, and so when they themselves deploy chemical weapons, as I fear they may, they have a sort of ... fake story, ready to go.""

On March 10, the Russian-inspired Readovka map ""became noticeably less red. This is due to the fact that the boundaries of the fronts in the north were clarified. However, this does not mean that the RF Armed Forces are retreating. On the contrary, significant progress can be seen in these areas.""

Ukrainian troops launched a counterattack to drive occupying Russian forces from a village in the Kyiv region. In the heart of Irpin, a satellite city located around 20 kilometres northwest of Kyiv, the entire city is mounting resistance against Russian forces advancing towards the Ukrainian capital. The situation in the area was relatively calm. The Russians continued to amass its forces in direction of Bucha, Hostomel and Yasnohorodka. The civilian evacuation from Irpin continued. According to British/US intel, Russian forces will launch a massive attack on Kyiv no later than Sunday 13 March 2022.

Reporting from the last checkpoint between Irpin, a northern suburb of Kyiv, and the Ukrainian capital, FRANCE 24s Cyril Payen said the Russian offensive is pushing on amid stiff Ukrainian resistance. Payen was able to enter Irpin, which he described as a ghost town amid desperate scenes, including bodies lying on the frontline since they could not be collected due to the heavy fighting. Russian tanks are around 200 meters away, I would say 50 percent of Irpin is taken by the Russian army and the other 50 percent is defended by Ukrainian troops, said Payen.

On the ground, the fighting continued as the Russian army attacked various Ukrainian cities in a slow-motion offensive, which might be part of Moscow's military strategy to tire Kievs forces to force them to surrender one by one. While the Russians have made substantial gains across southern Ukraine, claiming some crucial port cities across the Black Sea coast, slowly moving to encircle the countrys two biggest cities, Kiev and Kharkiv, they have not been able to implement a full-scale assault after two weeks of brutal fighting.

The civilian evacuation from Sumy successfully continued. Ukrainian sources reports up to 50 thousand civilians left the city in total. Romny was reportedly under siege, confirming that the Russian forces bypassed the city when moving from Sumy towards Pryluky.

In Kharkiv Oblast, Russian recon/sabotage group (DRG) attacked a Ukrainian checkpoint in the village of Andriivka at night. The assault was repelled by a Ukrainian Border Guard unit stationed there. Ukrainian forces conducted a successful counter-attack in the direction of Dernachi, liberating the settlement and lifting the enemy pressure in the area. The situation in Izium reached a critical stage. Some civilians were able to left towards Slovyansk, but most remained in the town. It was unclear if there were still some Ukrainian elements in Izium. The town is heavily damaged.

Russian forces shelling Mykolaiv from the north-east and north, Ukrainian forces continue to dig trenches and setting up barricades. The moment of Russian attack on the city was approaching. Meanwhile, the enemy pushed north of Mykolaiv, alongside Inhulets river and connected with its forces near Bashtanka. Fighting was also reported from Voznesensk, but Ukrainian forces are successfully holding the ground. In Kherson Oblast, Russian troops pushed north towards Kryvyi Rih from Nova Kakhovka. They captured Mylove, Dudchany and Bila Krynytsia, despite Ukrainian air strikes in the area. The cities of Nikopol and Kryvyi Rih prepares for defense.

Putin denied that Russia is using any conscripted soldiers and will not use them in combat operations. The Russian president also pointed out that Nor will there be any additional mobilisation of reserves against Ukrainian forces. The Red Cross said more than 400,000 people are trapped in Mariupol without humanitarian aid and evacuation corridors, and the city faces ""apocalyptic"" conditions. A key port city on the coast of the Sea of Azov, Mariupol is major transit point on the road to Crimea, and analysts have speculated that Russian might seek to seize the city as part of a ""land bridge"" to the occupied Crimea Peninsula.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba met with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, in Turkey. But the talks failed to produce a breakthrough. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba says a meeting with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, the first high-level talks between the two countries since Moscow launch an unprovoked invasion of its neighbor last month, failed to make progress on a cease-fire. Kuleba said after the meeting in the Turkish resort city of Antalya 15 days into the war, that Lavrov did not commit to ensuring a humanitarian corridor in the besieged city of Mariupol.

U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris accused Russia of committing ""atrocities of unimaginable proportions"" in Ukraine as she traveled to Warsaw amid controversy over a Polish plan to supply fighter jets to Ukraine. ""Absolutely, there should be an investigation and we should all be watching and I have no question that the eyes of the world are on this war and what Russia has done in terms of this aggression and these atrocities,"" Harris said.

Russia's defence ministry has denied bombing a maternity and children's hospital in Mariupol, accusing Ukraine of conducting a ""staged provocation"". The ministry said that Russia carried out no air strikes on ground targets in that area on that day, respecting an agreed ""silent regime"". Twitter removed content from Russian Embassy UK claiming the Mariupol maternity hospital bombing was staged. Moscow's claim that the attack -- which killed three people, including a child -- was a ""staged provocation"" sparked a Twitter storm. Twitter told the BBC: We took enforcement action against the Tweets you referenced as they were in violation of the Twitter Rules, specifically our Hateful Conduct and Abusive Behavior policies related to the denial of violent events.

Harris's trip, aimed at bolstering U.S. support for its Eastern European allies, has been overshadowed by an open disagreement between Warsaw and Washington over the Polish proposal, which called for sending MiG warplanes to Ukraine, by way of a U.S. military base in Germany. Asked at a joint news conference in Warsaw on March 10 with President Andrzej Duda about the jet dispute, Harris dodged a reporter's question. ""We're making deliveries every day, in terms of what we can do, in terms of assistance and, in particular, when you look at what we've been doing, as it relates to anti-tank and anti-defense systems,"" she said, according to a White House transcript.

The European Union should stop using Russian fossil fuels by 2027, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said, adding she would propose a plan for doing so in mid-May. ""Proposal for a RePowerEU plan to phase out our dependencies on Russian fossil fuels by 2027,"" she wrote as EU leaders met in Versailles to discuss the issue.

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said half the population of the Ukrainian capital has fled. But he warned that the city is now ""a fortress. Every street, every building, every checkpoint has been fortified."" Russias defence ministry said it would open humanitarian corridors from five cities: Kyiv, Suma, Kharkiv, Mariupol and Chernihiv. On Thursday, not a single civilian was able to leave the besieged city of Mariupol as Russian forces failed to respect a temporary ceasefire to enable evacuations, said Ukraines Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk.

The United Nations says that more than 2.3 million refugees have now left Ukraine since the start of Russia's invasion last month, with almost 161,7000 fleeing in the previous 24 hours. The head of the UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency, said that the agency needed about $500 million for its emergency work in Ukraine and neighboring countries, of which almost $300 million has been received so far, two-thirds of which came from private donations.

Most Ukrainian refugees have crossed into Poland, where their number now stands at more than 1.42 million. Poland's border guards said that some 117,600 people crossed the border the previous day. However, there are now signs that the exodus has peaked and the number of daily crossings is going down.",https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/russo-ukraine-2022-03-10.htm
4,0a928c54-cea6-4e1f-9435-a54086ad7346,['Analysis Tim Lister'],2022-03-10 00:00:00,"Kyiv, Ukraine (CNN) Two weeks after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine , Russia's ""precision strikes"" have become much less precise and its ground forces are laboring to seize territory.

On the eve of the offensive, some US officials predicted Kyiv would fall within 48 to 72 hours of hostilities beginning. Yet the blue-and-yellow flag of Ukraine still hangs from its buildings. There was glib talk of the Ukrainian state being ""decapitated;"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky still proclaims defiance.

If, as Putin asserted, Ukraine was not a real country, it would surely have collapsed by now. But even with 150,000 Russian troops inside its borders, according to US assessments, they control at most about 10% of Ukraine.

Traveling around Ukraine in the three weeks before the invasion, it seemed many people were in denial. ""We are certain there will be no war,"" was the refrain -- in Mariupol, Zaporizhzia and Kyiv. The Ukrainian government also played down the build-up of Russian forces, anxious not to panic its citizens and the markets.

Then, on February 24, it was as if a switch had been flicked. Overnight, denial became defiance.

Now the refrain is: ""I'm going to war. It's my land.""

Serious defenses and countless checkpoints have popped up around Kyiv. Ukrainian forces -- to the surprise of many observers -- have been nimble and effective against Russian armor that has struggled to make progress. Small, mobile units that know the territory have cut down Russian convoys. The anti-tank weapons acquired mainly from the US and UK have left smoking hulks on roads across the country. Turkish-made attack drones have been deployed to precise effect.

In the few areas occupied by Russian forces -- even those that are predominantly Russian-speaking -- crowds of hundreds have hurled abuse at bewildered Russian soldiers . They have built mountains of tires to defend their towns and painted over street signs.

Not that the Ukrainians have the upper hand. They can't defeat a vastly superior Russian force, but the evidence so far suggests that -- fortified by weapons and other help flowing across the border from Poland -- they may yet deny Putin victory.

The longest fortnight

A British Prime Minister once observed that a week is a long time in politics. The two weeks of this conflict seem like an eternity, in terms of how they have changed the world.

Four Ukrainians I was sitting with in Kyiv looked on in horror during the early hours of February 24, as Putin's address announcing a ""special military operation"" was broadcast on Russian television -- imagining that the freedoms they had come to enjoy were about to be crushed.

Minutes later, the sky lit up as ballistic missiles slammed into Boryspil airport outside Kyiv. Russian forces poured across the border, from Crimea, Belarus and western Russia.

And then, not exactly nothing, but nothing overwhelming. The supposedly awe-inspiring 40-mile column of Russian troops driving in from Belarus sat still, going nowhere -- more trucks than tanks. Ukraine's venerable air defenses did a better-than-expected job in taking out cruise missiles and Russian fighter jets.

And crucially, Russian efforts to seize bridgeheads to the north and south of Kyiv in the first days of the campaign failed.

Even in the south of the country, where Russian units have met less resistance, they have yet to take the port of Mariupol -- half an hour's drive from the border.

In explaining the invasion, Putin argued that Ukraine would otherwise become a platform for the West to invade and destroy Russia. He may have miscalculated the likely response to his attempt to swallow a country that, in his dark rewriting of history, had no right to exist.

""In taking this extraordinary gamble, he seems to have failed to recall the events that set in motion the end of the Russian empire,"" write Liana Fix and Michael Kimmage in Foreign Affairs.

""The final Russian tsar, Nicholas II, lost a war against Japan in 1905. He later fell victim to the Bolshevik Revolution, losing not just his crown but his life. The lesson: autocratic rulers cannot lose wars and remain autocrats.""

Perhaps lulled by the anemic Western response to the annexation of Crimea in 2014, Putin underestimated the galvanizing effect of his ""war of choice.""

NATO itself has rarely seemed so focused, a far cry from the carping that characterized the alliance during Donald Trump's presidency. Truckloads of anti-tank weapons have trundled to Ukraine's border.

Before this invasion, as a raft of international sanctions against Russia was debated, even hawks could only dream of cutting off Russian institutions from the international banking system, hunting down the assets of Russian oligarchs, ending or reducing imports of Russian oil and gas and mothballing the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. All have now happened.

Ukrainians demonstrate in Kherson on March 5, to protest Russia's occupation.

One company after another, from McDonalds to Zara to Apple, has severed links with the country -- depriving Russians of the consumer goods they had come to love since the end of communism. The ruble is worth less than half what it was in mid-February.

Outmaneuvered on the battlefield, the Kremlin has also taken a beating in the court of public opinion -- not that that has ever bothered Putin. Zelensky, comic actor turned President, has risen to the challenge with pithy defiance and direct demands for a no-fly zone.

As speculation swirled about how Zelensky might be evacuated from Ukraine, he said he needed ammunition -- not a ride. He recorded an almost cheeky video message from the Presidential Palace, saying he wouldn't hide.

Zelensky -- and Ukraine's resilience in the face of overwhelming odds -- has struck a chord across the world. Football stadiums across Europe have been decked in the Ukrainian colors, the Eiffel Tower has shone blue and yellow. The seemingly endless flow of video messages from Zelensky has brought crowds to the streets of Prague and Tbilisi and drawn standing ovations in the British and European parliaments.

By contrast, Putin has seemed isolated, snapping at subordinates, recording wooden rambling speeches or surrounding himself with Aeroflot flight attendants.

The great question now is whether a furious Russian leader, despite asserting that the ""operation"" continues to schedule, doubles down with the vast arsenal at his disposal: ballistic and cruise missiles, devastating rocket systems and thermobaric bombs. Will he turn Kyiv into another Grozny, the Chechen capital razed to the ground during his first year in power?

CIA Director William Burns assessed Tuesday that Putin is ""determined to dominate and control Ukraine,"" and predicted an ""ugly next few weeks"" with ""scant regard for civilian casualties,"" in the face of opposition from the Ukrainian people.

Thursday's talks in Turkey between the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers may give us the first clue as to whether there is an alternative to those ugly weeks.

The Kremlin has demanded that Ukraine recognize Russian sovereignty in Crimea, annexed in 2014, the independence of two puppet republics in eastern Ukraine and the country's neutrality.

Ukraine has said no, though Zelensky now seems to acknowledge that Ukraine's dream of joining NATO, enshrined in its constitution, may be even more distant than it was before. For its part, Moscow appears to have dropped its demand for what it has called the de-Nazification and de-militarization of Ukraine -- its absurd phraseology for regime change.

In the meantime, the daily suffering of Ukrainian civilians goes on. Some are killed in missile strikes that flatten apartment buildings, others caught by those less-then-precise artillery attacks. The number is already in the many hundreds, but there is no official toll.

Two million have fled the country altogether -- overwhelmingly women and children. If and when they come back they will find cities like Kharkiv, Sumy, Mariupol and Chernihiv almost unrecognizable.

Absent some breakthrough in the days to come, a much longer list is inevitable.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/10/europe/russia-military-ukraine-analysis-lister-intl-cmd/index.html

The governor of the Kharkiv region, on the Russian border, said a psychiatric hospital had been hit, and the mayor of the city of Kharkiv said about 50 schools there had been destroyed.

In the besieged southern city of Mariupol, the city council said at least 1,582 civilians had been killed as a result of Russian shelling and a 12-day blockade that has left hundreds of thousands trapped with no food, water, heat or power.

Russia’s defence ministry said the Black Sea port was now completely surrounded and Ukrainian officials accused Russia of deliberately preventing civilians getting out and humanitarian convoys getting in.

A new effort to evacuate civilians along a humanitarian corridor from Mariupol appeared to have failed, with Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk saying Russian shelling prevented them from leaving.

“The situation is critical,” Ukrainian interior ministry adviser Vadym Denysenko said.

Western countries meanwhile took more economic steps to try to force Russian President Vladimir Putin to end his assault.

U.S. President Joe Biden said the G7 industrialised nations would revoke Russia’s “most favoured nation” trade status. He also announced a U.S. ban on imports of Russian seafood, alcohol and diamonds. Washington later sanctioned more oligarchs and elites in addition to a dozen lawmakers and the family of previously sanctioned Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.

European Union leaders meeting in France said they were ready to impose harsher economic sanctions on Russia and might give Ukraine more funds for arms. But they rejected Ukraine’s request to join the bloc.

At a meeting with Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, Putin said there were “certain positive shifts” in talks with Kyiv, but did not elaborate.

GEARING UP

With the Russian assault now in its third week, Zelenskiy, who has rallied his people with a series of addresses, said Ukraine had “already reached a strategic turning point”.

“It is impossible to say how many days we still have (ahead of us) to free Ukrainian land. But we can say we will do it,” he said. “We are already moving towards our goal, our victory.”

Russia’s main attack force has been stalled on roads north of Kyiv, having failed in what Western analysts say was an initial plan for a lightning assault.

But images released by private U.S. satellite firm Maxar showed armoured units manoeuvring in and through towns close to an airport on Kyiv’s northwest outskirts, the site of fighting since Russia landed paratroopers there in the first hours of the war.

Other elements had repositioned near Lubyanka just to the north, with artillery howitzers in firing positions, Maxar said.

Britain’s defence ministry said Russia appeared to be gearing up for new offensive activity in the coming days that would probably include operations against Kyiv.

However, the Russian ground forces were still making only limited progress, hampered by logistical problems and Ukrainian resistance, it said in its intelligence update.

The Ukrainian general staff said Russian forces were regrouping after taking heavy losses. Ukrainian troops had pushed some back to “unfavourable positions” near the Belarus border to the rear of the main Russian column, it said.

Kyiv’s mayor, former heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, said the capital had enough essential supplies to last a couple of weeks. Supply lines remained open for now.

‘WRONG ASSUMPTIONS’

Ukrainian authorities said a psychiatric hospital near the eastern town of Izyum had been hit. Emergency services said no one was hurt as the patients were already sheltering in the basement.

Kharkiv governor Oleh Synegubov called the attack a war crime. Reuters could not verify the report.

Moscow denies it has been targeting civilians in what it calls a “special operation” to disarm and “de-Nazify” Ukraine. Ukraine and its allies say this was a baseless pretext for Russia’s invasion of the democratic country of 44 million.

Three air strikes near a kindergarten in the central city of Dnipro killed at least one person on Friday, state emergency services said.

The mayor of Lutsk said four people had been killed and six wounded in an attack on an airfield – a rare strike on a target deep in western Ukraine, far from the battlefields in the north, east and south.

In Kharkiv, hundreds of people were sheltering in metro stations. Nastya, a young girl lying on a makeshift bed on the floor of a train carriage, said she had been there for more than a week, unable to move around much and ill with a virus.

“I’m scared for my home, for the homes of my friends, very scared for the whole country, and scared for myself of course,” she said.

Moscow said its separatist allies in the southeast had captured the town of Volnovakha, north of Mariupol.

But Mathieu Boulegue, an expert at London’s Chatham House think tank, said Moscow might not have sufficient troops to achieve its goals.

“You can’t invade a country on a one-on-one ratio (of troops). Nobody has done it, which means that either something was wrong or they had very wrong assumptions moving into this war,” he told Reuters.

Ukraine also raised the prospect of Moscow’s ally Belarus throwing its troops into the war, accusing Russia of staging “false flag” air attacks on Belarus from Ukraine to provide an excuse for an offensive.

Belarus has served as a staging post for Russian forces both before and after the Feb. 24 invasion. The Kremlin did not respond to a request for comment.

Putin and Lukashenko agreed on Friday that Moscow would supply its smaller neighbour with up-to-date military equipment and on mutual support against Western sanctions, including on energy prices, the official Belarus Belta news agency said.

NO EU MEMBERSHIP

Away from the battlefields, EU leaders meeting near Paris agreed to spend more on defence and cut reliance on Russian energy supplies by 2027. But, wary of angering Moscow further, they declined Ukraine’s call for a speedy admission to the EU.

Western countries have swiftly moved to isolate Russia from the global financial system.

The Russian rouble ended a third week of hefty losses. The currency has lost a third of its value in Moscow exchanges since Russia invaded Ukraine, as the local economy buckles under the pressure of sanctions imposed across the world.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that on Saturday the bloc would suspend Moscow’s privileged trade and economic treatment; crack down on its use of crypto-assets; and ban the import of iron and steel goods from Russia as well as the export of luxury goods in the other direction.

“Tomorrow, we will take a fourth package of measures to further isolate Russia and drain the resources it uses to finance this barbaric war,” she said in Brussels.

7,0a928c54-cea6-4e1f-9435-a54086ad7346,['Associated Press'],2022-03-12 23:00:20+00:00,"MARIUPOL, Ukraine (AP) — Russian forces pounded the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol on Saturday, shelling its downtown as residents hid in its iconic mosque and elsewhere to avoid the explosions. Fighting also raged in the outskirts of the capital, Kyiv, as Russia kept up its bombardment of other cities throughout the country.

Mariupol has endured some of Ukraine’s worst punishment since Russia invaded. Unceasing barrages have thwarted repeated attempts to bring food, water and medicine into the city of 430,000 and to evacuate its trapped civilians. More than 1,500 people have died in Mariupol during the siege, according the mayor’s office, and the shelling has even interrupted efforts to bury the dead in mass graves.

The Ukrainian government said Saturday that the Sultan Suleiman Mosque was hit, but an unverified Instagram post by a man claiming to be the mosque association’s president said the building was spared when a bomb fell about 750 yards (700 meters) away. About 80 residents, including children, were reportedly hiding inside.

A Ukrainian official said Russian soldiers pillaged a humanitarian convoy that was trying to reach Mariupol and blocked another. And Ukraine’s military said Russian forces captured Mariupol’s eastern outskirts, tightening their siege of the strategic port. Taking Mariupol and other ports on the Azov Sea could allow Russia to establish a land corridor to Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.

“They are bombing it (Mariupol) 24 hours a day, launching missiles. It is hatred. They kill children,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said during a video address.

An Associated Press journalist in Mariupol witnessed tanks fire on a nine-story apartment building and was with a group of hospital workers who came under sniper fire on Friday. A worker shot in the hip survived, but conditions in the hospital were deteriorating: electricity was reserved for operating tables, and people with nowhere else to go lined the hallways.

Among them was Anastasiya Erashova, who wept and trembled as she held a sleeping child. Shelling had just killed her other child as well as her brother’s child, Erashova said, her scalp crusted with blood.

“We came to my brother’s (place), all of us together. The women and children went underground, and then some mortar struck that building,” she said. “We were trapped underground, and two children died. No one was able to save them.”

In Irpin, a suburb northwest of Kyiv, bodies lay out in the open Saturday on streets and in a park.

“When I woke up in the morning, everything was covered in smoke, everything was dark. We don’t know who is shooting and where,” resident Serhy Protsenko said as he walked through his neighborhood as explosions sounded in the distance. “We don’t have any radio or information.”

Some Irpin residents sheltered in a pitch-dark basement, unsure where they could go or how they would get food if they left. Others toted luggage across planks across a waterway where a bridge had been damaged.

Meanwhile, French and German leaders spoke Saturday with Russian President Vladimir Putin in a failed attempt to reach a cease-fire. According to the Kremlin, Putin laid out terms for ending the war, including Ukraine’s demilitarization and its ceding of territory, among other demands.

Zelenskyy encouraged his people to keep up their resistance, which many analysts said has prevented the rapid military victory the Kremlin likely expected.

“The fact that the whole Ukrainian people resist these invaders has already gone down in history, but we do not have the right to let up our defense, no matter how difficult it may be,” he said. Later Saturday, Zelenskyy reported that 1,300 Ukrainian soldiers had died since the Russian invasion began Feb. 24.

Zelenskyy again deplored NATO’s refusal to declare a no-fly zone over Ukraine and said Ukraine has sought ways to procure air defense assets, though he didn’t elaborate. U.S. President Joe Biden announced another $200 million in aid to Ukraine, with an additional $13 billion included in a bill that has passed the House and should pass the Senate within days.

Zelenskyy also accused Russia of employing “a new stage of terror” with the alleged kidnapping the mayor of Melitopol, a city 192 kilometers (119 miles) west of Mariupol. After residents of the occupied city demonstrated for the mayor’s release Saturday, the Ukrainian leader called on Russian forces to heed the calls.

“Please hear in Moscow!” Zelenskyy said. “Another protest against Russian troops, against attempts to bring the city to its knees.”

In multiple areas around the capital, artillery barrages sent residents scurrying for shelter as air raid sirens wailed. Britain’s Defense Ministry said Russian forces that had been massed north of Kyiv had edged to within 25 kilometers (15 miles) of the city center and spread out, likely to support an attempted encirclement.

Ukraine’s military and volunteer forces have been preparing for an all-out assault. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said Thursday that about 2 million people, half the metropolitan area’s inhabitants, had left and that “every street, every house … is being fortified.”

Zelenskyy said Saturday that Russia would need to carpet-bomb Kyiv and kill its residents to take the city.

“They will come here only if they kill us all,” he said. “If that is their goal, let them come.”

Putin held a 90-minute call with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Saturday. Putin spoke about “issues related to agreements under discussion to implement the Russian demands” for ending the war, the Kremlin said without providing details.

For ending hostilities, Moscow has demanded that Ukraine drop its bid to join NATO and adopt a neutral status; acknowledge the Russian sovereignty over Crimea, which it annexed from Ukraine in 2014; recognize the independence of separatist regions in the country’s east; and agree to demilitarize.

Zelenskyy told Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett on Saturday that he would be open to meeting Putin in Jerusalem to discuss an end to the war, but that there would first have to be a cease-fire. Bennett recently met in Moscow with Putin, who has ignored previous offers of talks from Zelenskyy.

As U.S. and Western companies announced they are leaving Russia over the invasion, Putin threatened to seize their assets.

The Ukrainian Embassy in Turkey said 86 Turkish nationals, including 34 children, were among the people who had sought safety in Mariupol’s mosque of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent and his wife Roksolana, which was modeled on one of the most famous and largest mosques in Istanbul.

Before Mariupol became a target of the biggest land conflict in Europe since World War II, the city promoted the white-walled building and its towering minaret as a scenic attraction.

With Mariupol’s electricity, gas and water supplies knocked out, aid workers and Ukrainian authorities described an unfolding humanitarian catastrophe. Aid group Doctors Without Borders said Mariupol residents are dying from a lack of medication and are draining heating pipes for drinking water.

Russian forces have hit at least two dozen hospitals and medical facilities, according to the World Health Organization.

The Russian invaders appear to have struggled far more than expected against determined Ukrainian fighters. Still, Russia’s stronger military threatens to grind down Ukrainian forces, despite an ongoing flow of weapons and other assistance from the West for Ukraine’s westward-looking, democratically elected government.

A senior Russian diplomat warned that Moscow could attack foreign shipments of military equipment to Ukraine. Speaking Saturday, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Moscow has warned the United States “that pumping weapons from a number of countries it orchestrates isn’t just a dangerous move — it’s an action that makes those convoys legitimate targets.”

Thousands of soldiers on both sides are believed to have been killed along with many civilians, including at least 79 Ukrainian children, its government says. Most victims were in the Kyiv, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Sumy, Kherson and Zhytomyr regions, the office said, noting that the numbers aren’t final because the fighting is ongoing.

At least 2.5 million people have fled the country, according to the United Nations refugee agency.
