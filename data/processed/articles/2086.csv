Multiple sources reported that the loss of Hostomel Airport forced a much larger Russian follow-on force to abort a full-scale airborne assault that could have put approximately 2,000 troops on the ground only minutes from downtown Kyiv.

After a day of fighting, Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to the Ukrainian president, posted on Facebook that Hostomel (also known as Gostomel) had been retaken, posting: “Now we’ve definitely hit it off. Gostomel Airport is ours. Russian paratroopers have been destroyed.”

Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s Ministry of Internal Affairs, also said Ukrainian troops had retaken the airport, calling it “the first big victory.” The 4th Rapid Response Brigade’s Facebook page published a celebratory post: “Our guardsmen with their flag, torn to pieces after today’s battle. Congratulations to all of you and say that we will win!”

Hostomel sits roughly 10 miles northwest of Kyiv and normally services cargo flights. Russian forces appeared to have identified the field as a primary invasion target to allow large numbers of forces to be flown in.

A journalist with the open-source investigative website Bellingcat and several Russian flight trackers reported that, with the airport in Russian hands, 18 IL-76 cargo planes — roughly equivalent to American C-17s — were airborne and inbound to Hostomel.

If accurate, that many IL-76s could have delivered 2,000 troops and supporting vehicles.

!!! Ukrainian government sources tell me 18 Il-76 planes have left Pskov direction Kyiv, will arrive in about an hour — Christo Grozev (@christogrozev) February 24, 2022

However, a Ukrainian counterattack pushed the small Russian force off the airfield before the large aircraft arrived. A British citizen who joined the fighting on the Ukraine side provided Coffee or Die Magazine’s Nolan Peterson cell phone footage that captures the sound of the fighting.

Several reports said the unit that reclaimed the airport was Ukraine’s 4th Rapid Reaction Brigade, a special operations-style unit based near Kyiv.

An unconfirmed but stunning video appears to show a Ukrainian fighter jet “hunting” the fleeing Russians, firing rockets within feet of civilian homes.

The invasion began Thursday morning with a large-scale air assault. Videos show more than a dozen Mi-17 transport helicopters and Ka-52 and Ka-50 attack helicopters rushing toward the field over Kyiv, carrying paratroopers that the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense identified as being from the 11th Guards Air Assault Brigade, a Russian paratroop unit based in Ulan Ude, a city in the eastern portion of the country near Mongolia.

By midmorning, a CNN reporter interviewed Russian troops at the airport who appeared to have secured the grounds.

Pictures and videos taken during the assault showed at least two of the helicopters being shot down.

She said her family and their four cats were able to escape to Lviv thanks to “good people” who helped them on a four-day journey.

Conditions in Mariupol are desperate, she said.

“No infrastructure, no potable water — no water at all — no electricity. And there was constant bombing. And not only artillery, they were also using UAVs and some aircrafts. They are dropping bombs all over the city,"" Hayetska told CNN's John Berman.

""People were carrying those who were killed closer to the road and covering them with blankets. They were waiting for someone to collect the bodies. Some people buried the bodies in the yard because they knew no one would come to them. This is all true,"" she said.

Her mother, Halyna Zhelezniak, expressed gratitude to her daughter for making sure everyone evacuated together.

""I'm 84, and this was the first time in my life when I felt horror. I couldn't believe it happened. It was just a shock. I couldn't believe it. But this is the reality my family and I had to face. I'm grateful to my daughter Natalia for saving us. She simply saved us. She didn't leave us behind,"" she said.

Her father, Ihor Zhelezniak, said that he doesn't expect to see his city rebuilt again in his lifetime.

""The Mariupol I left will maybe be back in the year 3000, but I'm not going to live that long. Because there are only ruins,"" he said.

Ukrainian towns and cities that are withstanding Russia’s attempts to conquer them are being hammered by artillery fire in response, according to local officials.

In the far east of the country, close to two breakaway pro-Russian statelets, the city of Rubizhne is under constant shelling, regional head Serhii Haidai said in a social media post.

""The enemy was unable to 'blitzkrieg' Rubizhne, so they are destroying the town, targeting hospitals, schools, and residential buildings,"" Haidai said.

Emergency services and ambulances are often unable to reach the wounded, he said, due to the risk of coming under fire.

Two days ago, Haidai reported the deaths of 56 elderly care home residents in a town about 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) from Rubizhne. The regional official said a Russian tank had opened fire on the building on March 11, but it had taken several days to confirm the fatalities due to the dangers of constant shelling.

Meanwhile, the head of the Kharkiv region, Oleh Syniehubov, said the city was shelled 84 times overnight, marking an increase in the rate of attacks on the city.

Kharkiv is Ukraine’s second largest city, sits close to the Russian border, and is a key target for Putin’s invading forces.

Syniehubov said city neighborhoods and outlying towns had come under fire from Derhachi to the northwest, through Saltivka and Tsyrkuny in the northeast, to the city’s huge tractor plant to the southeast.",https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-22-22/h_23abbf22b4a020f64cae1a937e7c13d4

A Ukrainian MP for Odesa, Oleksiy Honcharenko, has told the BBC: We understand that clearly Odesa is a strategic aim of this war, but the Russian army can’t go on land there, our army is holding ground. There are hundreds of international journalists in Kyiv, and some in Odesa, who saw that these attacks are in residential areas with no military targets. They are planning a land operation against Odesa, we see their ships full of marines. I think the idea is to attack Odesa from several destinations.

Leaders from the 27-nation bloc meet in Brussels on Thursday for a two-day summit focused on dealing with the fallout from the Kremlin’s assault on Ukraine. “Bearing in mind the destruction and enormous losses brought upon Ukraine by Russia’s military aggression, the European Union is committed to provide support to the Ukrainian government for its immediate needs and, once the Russian onslaught has ceased, for the reconstruction of a democratic Ukraine,” the draft conclusions for the meeting said. “To that end, the European Council agrees to set up a Ukraine Solidarity Trust Fund and calls for preparations to start without delay.” The draft, still under negotiation, gave no further details on the planned size or working of the fund. The EU has already agreed €1.2bn euros ($1.3bn) in emergency funding to help the Ukrainian authorities.

22 Mar 2022 06.20 The fall of Mariupol would be an economic blow to Ukraine and a symbolic victory for Russia, writes Bermet Talant for us today. Mariupol is a metallurgical centre for iron and steelworks, heavy machinery manufacturing, and ship repairs. Ukraine’s largest steel plants owned by the country’s leading metallurgical group, Metinvest, are located in Mariupol. One of them, Azovstal, was badly damaged by Russian shelling this week. Mariupol is also home to the largest trading port in the Azov Sea from which Ukraine exports grain, iron and steel. Not only does Mariupol lie in the territory that is claimed by the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic, an area recognised by Russia before the full-scale invasion, but it is also part of Vladimir Putin’s vision of “Novorossiya” – a territory stretching across eastern and southern Ukraine along the Black Sea coastline that is viewed by Putin as “historically Russian lands”.
