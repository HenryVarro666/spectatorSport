BERLIN, March 10 (Reuters) - Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder is meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow for talks on ending the war in Ukraine, political news website Politico reported, citing sources familiar with the matter.

The visit comes after talks in Istanbul with a Ukrainian politician who is a member of the country's delegation for peace talks with Russia, the sources told Politico.

Asked about the reports of the visit, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz told reporters on the sidelines of a summit of European leaders in France that he did not wish to comment on the matter. Scholz has sought to distance himself from his fellow Social Democrat in recent weeks.

The German government has not agreed to any meeting nor been involved in one, two government sources told Reuters.

Schroeder, German chancellor from 1998 to 2005, has been under the microscope over his links to Russian companies.

He is on the board of Russian oil giant Rosneft (ROSN.MM) and is chairman of the shareholders' committee of the company that is in charge of building the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and which is being sanctioned by the United States.

He has faced calls from some German government politicians to step down from such roles as the other former leaders announced they were leaving positions on the boards of Russian companies over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

BERLIN, March 12 (Reuters) - Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder met Russian President Vladimir Putin for several hours on Thursday evening in a bid to end the war in Ukraine, Germany's Bild am Sonntag (BamS) reported, although it was unclear what was achieved.

Citing a person with detailed insight into Schroeder's activities, the weekly newspaper said Schroeder had also had a long talk with one of Putin's closest advisers.

He left Moscow early on Saturday morning with his wife and flew to Istanbul, the paper said, without disclosing any further details of the conversations.

The former chancellor, who is a personal friend of Putin and has links to Russian companies, had met a group of Ukrainians with links to the country's delegation for peace talks with Russia in Turkey on Monday evening, reported BamS.

The source told BamS that Schroeder was currently the only person to have had direct contact with both Putin and top Ukrainian officials.

News website Politico first reported that Schroeder was flying to Moscow for talks with Putin, and German government sources said it had not agreed to any meeting nor been involved in one. read more

The government's press office referred to remarks made by Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Friday when he declined to comment on the meeting beyond saying that he would take note of any results and include them in other efforts he was involved in.

Scholz, who travels to Turkey on Monday, spoke to Putin in a three-way phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday.

Schroeder, Social Democrat (SPD) chancellor from 1998 to 2005, is on the board of Russian oil giant Rosneft and is chairman of the shareholders' committee of the company in charge of building the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which has been shelved.

He has faced calls from some German government politicians to step down from his roles over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Nobody was immediately available at Schroeder's office.

The meeting between the two ended Thursday evening but details of the discussions weren’t immediately available. Schröder’s wife, Soyeon Schröder-Kim, subsequently posted a photograph of herself in prayer with the Kremlin in the background on Instagram.

Schröder has come under fierce criticism at home and abroad for refusing to sever his close ties to Moscow following Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Even several of his office staff quit last week after he insisted on keeping his senior roles at Kremlin-linked energy giants Rosneft and Gazprom.

Schröder, a Social Democrat, served as German chancellor from 1998 to 2005. He has since enjoyed a lucrative business career thanks to his Russian energy roles.

Schröder’s Moscow visit followed talks in Istanbul with a Ukrainian politician who is a member of the country’s delegation for peace talks with Russia, according to a detailed account of the initiative provided to POLITICO by a person closely involved.

“Ukraine wanted to see if Schröder could build a bridge for dialogue with Putin,” the person said.

Last week, Ukraine’s ambassador to Germany, Andrij Melnyk, suggested Schröder could try to mediate between Moscow and Kyiv.

German government officials said they had not been informed in advance of Schröder’s initiative.

Since Russia launched its invasion on February 24, Ukrainian and Russian negotiators have held three rounds of talks in Belarus but those discussions have yielded little.

According to the account provided to POLITICO, the Ukrainian overture to Schröder came last Friday via Swiss publisher Ringier, for whom the ex-chancellor worked as a consultant — until that arrangement was suspended after Putin launched his invasion.

A Ukrainian politician in Kyiv contacted Ringier Chief Executive Marc Walder and asked him to get a message to Schröder that his government would like to use him as a mediator.

He informed Schröder, who agreed and flew together with his wife to Istanbul on Monday. The meeting was organized with the help of Turkey’s foreign ministry.

Schröder met in Istanbul’s Dolmabahçe Palace on Monday afternoon with a Ukrainian delegation, led by Rustem Umerov, a Ukrainian MP who took part in the recent cease-fire talks with Moscow in Belarus. (Umerov has not commented on Schröder’s initiative.)

Umerov told Schröder that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy would like the chancellor to use his relationship with Putin to try to negotiate at least a cease-fire.

A senior Ukrainian diplomat confirmed Umerov’s meeting with Schröder had been coordinated with Zelenskyy’s office.

Schröder said he wasn’t sure if Putin would receive him in Moscow, but he would try. The Ukrainians gave Schröder guidance on several key points they would be willing to negotiate about, including Ukraine’s NATO aspirations, the status of Crimea and the future of the Donbas region that Russia recognized as independent just days before its most recent invasion.

The meeting adjourned after just over two hours. On his way to the airport, Schröder contacted a person close to Putin in Moscow and explained what had transpired in Istanbul. He asked if Putin would meet him. Ten minutes later, Schröder received a green light but was told to wait in Istanbul until Wednesday when a Russian plane would arrive to collect him.

4,208ae5b3-9eb8-42fa-8198-7cdd29df4e12,"['Deutsche Welle', 'Www.Dw.Com']",,"Gerhard Schröder, who was German chancellor from 1998 to 2005, has had a close relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin for more than two decades. Now the news portal Politico and the German mass-circulation Bild newspaper report he traveled to Moscow and met with the Russian president on Thursday evening.

The trip was not coordinated with the German government, which is headed by Schröder's party, the center-left Social Democrats (SPD). SPD co-leader Lars Klingbeil said he had received no information on such a trip, but said that in his view any attempt to stop the war was good.

It was only a few days ago that Soyeon Schröder-Kim, Schröder's wife, wrote on Instagram, ""You can be sure that whatever my husband can do to help end the war, he will do.""

On Thursday evening, Schröder-Kim posted a photo showing her praying by a window overlooking St. Basil's Cathedral in Moscow.

Schröder's surprise trip is another twist in the recent drama surrounding the former chancellor.

Russia has been at war with Ukraine for more than two weeks — two weeks in which Schröder has refused to distance himself from Putin and give up his lucrative supervisory board positions in the Russian gas industry.

Since the war began, the former chancellor has spoken out publicly only once. Two days after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Schröder took to LinkedIn to call on Russia to end the war as quickly as possible. However, the 77-year-old avoided holding Putin responsible. Instead, he wrote of ""many mistakes"" that had been made ""on both sides.""

Schröder makes a lot of money in Russia

The former chancellor has opposed tough sanctions on the Kremlin, and urged world leaders not to completely cut the ""remaining political, economic and civil society ties that exist between Europe and Russia."" He had already rejected sanctions after the annexation of Crimea in 2014, which he had, however, called illegal under international law in a 2021 interview.

Schröder has never made a secret of the fact that he makes good money in Russia. Immediately after he lost the 2005 federal election to Angela Merkel, he switched from politics to the Russian gas business.

Schröder masterminded the Nord Stream project together with Putin while he was still chancellor. Then he became head of the supervisory board at the Russian state energy company Rosneft and chairman of the shareholders' committee of Nord Stream AG, which built and owns the two parallel gas pipelines connecting Russia and Germany across the Baltic Sea.

Is Putin instrumentalizing Schröder?

About three weeks before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Schröder was also nominated for the supervisory board of the Russian energy giant Gazprom. Roderich Kiesewetter, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the Bundestag, Germany's parliament, suspected Kremlin calculations behind Schröder's nomination. He said it was ""to be seen as a move by Russia to divide the German government in its stance on stopping Nord Stream 2 as a potential sanction tool and thus to discredit Germany as a whole.""

Critics saw it as a special way of saying thank you for the prospect of another lucrative supervisory board post when Schröder then accused Ukraine of ""saber-rattling.""

In mid-February, when Chancellor Olaf Scholz was in Moscow for talks with Putin, the Russian president praised Schröder as a ""decent person"" whose nomination to the Gazprom supervisory board he supported. The work of such an ""independent expert"" would only benefit cooperation with Germany, he said.

Putin, the 'flawless democrat'

Schröder and Putin's friendship has now endured for more than two decades, and deepened despite mounting criticism of Putin's expansionist policies over the years.

In 2012, when Putin had himself reelected as Russian president and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe pointed to significant irregularities in the election, the former chancellor defended his friend as a ""flawless democrat."" Two years later, Schröder celebrated his 70th birthday with Putin in Moscow.

Many SPD lawmakers have been skeptical about the friendship between Schröder and Putin for years. That skepticism has given way to growing horror in recent weeks, with many of his old companions trying to influence the former chancellor. Scholz has called on Schröder to resign from all Russian firms.

SPD co-chairman Klingbeil is particularly under pressure. He began his political career as an employee in Schröder's constituency office in Hanover, and a personal friendship grew out of that collaboration. But after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Klingbeil wrote in a social media post: ""You don't do business with an aggressor, with a warmonger like Putin. As a retired German chancellor, you never act completely privately. Especially not in a situation like the current one.""

In early March, Klingbeil and co-chair Saskia Esken, along with eight former SPD leaders, drafted an unequivocal letter. ""Act and say clear words,"" they wrote, ultimately calling on Schröder to make a public statement ""unequivocally opposing President Putin's bellicose actions as well.""

The letter went on to say: ""The gaze of many people is directed at you. And you decide for yourself these days, dear Gerhard, whether you want to remain a respected Social Democrat in the future.""

There was no response from Schröder.

Schröder's refusal to distance himself from Putin has sparked protest in Germany

Rank-and-file SPD members have increasingly been calling for the party to expel the former chancellor, and some local chapters have already filed motions to that effect.

Many of Schröder's German business partners have already parted ways with him — including companies for which the former chancellor had worked as a consultant for years, and on whose supervisory boards or executive committees he sat for years.

Few have given a reason, though Berlin project developer Gröner is an exception: ""Mr. Schröder's mandates by Russian companies and companies associated with the Russian state, whose business activities contribute extensively to the financing of the Russian state and its military actions, stand in the way of further cooperation with Mr. Schröder,"" reads a press release from the company.

The University of Göttingen is considering revoking Schröder's honorary doctorate. The German Soccer Association wants to revoke the honorary membership of the former chancellor, who is a soccer enthusiast, and the Bundesliga club Borussia Dortmund has already done so.

Can Schröder mediate on Ukraine?

Whether Schröder can really influence Putin is difficult to assess. However, the Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, has suggested the former chancellor as a mediator.

""He is one of the few here in Germany who may still have a direct line to Mr. Putin. There is no one who has such a thing in Germany and the other European countries,"" Melnyk told the mass-circulation Bild newspaper.

Melnyk said Thursday that he knew nothing about the former chancellor's actual travel plans. ""I find it hard to imagine that my government asked Schröder to do this,"" he said.

Schroeder and Putin became close while Schroeder was Chancellor from 1998 until 2005 and followed a policy of pushing German business interests in Russia during the boom years of the noughties. Germany now has literally ten times more companies registered in Russia than any other European country.

After leaving office Schroeder took a job as chairman of the shareholders committee of the Nord Stream gas pipeline operating company indecently quickly, bringing down widespread criticism. He was appointed in 2017 as chairman of Rosneft, Russia’s largest oil company and in February, Gazprom nominated him to join its board of directors.

In recent weeks Schroeder has faced mounting pressure to give up his board seats at Russian energy companies, in light of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

Schroeder reportedly travelled to Moscow with his wife to speak with his friend Putin, at the urging of Ukraine. The federal government apparently knew nothing about the project, reports Politico and the German daily Bild.

The two men met on March 10 but it remains unclear if more meetings are planned.

On the sidelines of the EU summit in Versailles, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz refused to comment on Schroeder’s trip to Russia.

Schroeder’s wife Soyeon Schroeder-Kim published a photo of herself with her hands folded and her eyes closed on her Instagram page in the evening, with St. Basil's Cathedral on Red Square in Moscow in the background. According to dpa, Schroeder and Schroeder-Kim travelled to Moscow via Istanbul.

Since the start of the war Schroeder’s left-leaning SPD party has put heavy pressure on the former Chancellor to quit his lucrative Russian jobs. The leadership of the party has already sent an ultimatum to Schroeder to resign his mandates. A ""prompt"" answer is expected, party leader Lars Klingbeil said a week ago. A local SPD association has already tabled a motion to have Schroeder to be expelled from the party.

Klingbeil was cautiously positive about the trip on Germany’s ZDF evening news, saying that “anything that can bring the conflict to an end is welcome. We will see if it is of any use.”

Klingbeil said he didn't know anything about Schroeder's visit to Russia. ""He is neither on behalf of the SPD nor on behalf of the federal government."" Government officials with whom he spoke also knew nothing about a meeting.

According to Politico the trip was arranged by a Ukrainian politician. On March 7, the couple first travelled to Istanbul, where the former Chancellor met a Ukrainian delegation. His subsequent request for a meeting with Putin is said to have been answered positively within ten minutes. The couple were then taken to Moscow on a Russian plane on on March 9.

There has been no comment on the trip to Moscow from the Ukrainian government. The Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, told the German Press Agency: ""I don't know anything about it."" However, Melnyk endorsed Schroeder's attempt at mediation in an interview a week ago. ""He is one of the few here in Germany who may still have a direct line to Mr Putin. There is no one who has something like that in Germany and the other European countries,"" said the ambassador to Bild.

Schroeder has said little about the Russian invasion of Ukraine since the beginning of the war. He called on Russia to end the war and the associated suffering for the people of Ukraine as soon as possible on the LinkedIn on February 24, the day of the invasion. At the same time, he emphasised that the political, economic and civil society ties between Europe and Russia should not be completely severed if sanctions are necessary.",https://www.bne.eu/former-german-chancellor-schroeder-meets-with-putin-in-moscow-to-call-for-peace-in-ukraine-237759/
