WASHINGTON, March 12 (Reuters) - The United States on Saturday said it would rush up to $200 million in additional small arms, anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons to Ukraine, as Ukrainian officials pleaded for more equipment to defend against heavy shelling by Russian forces.

President Joe Biden on Saturday authorized the additional security assistance, the White House said, paving the way for the ""immediate"" shipment of fresh military equipment to Ukraine, a senior administration official said.

Biden's decision brings total U.S. security aid provided to Ukraine to $1.2 billion since January 2021, and to $3.2 billion since 2014, when Russia annexed the Crimea region of Ukraine, according to senior administration officials.

In a memorandum to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Biden directed that up to $200 million allocated through the Foreign Assistance Act be designated for Ukraine's defense.

Blinken said he had authorized a fourth drawdown of U.S. defense stocks, in line with Biden's directive, ""to help Ukraine meet the armored, airborne, and other threats it is facing"" as the war entered a third week. read more

He lauded the ""great skill, iron will and profound courage"" being shown by the Ukrainian armed forces and citizens, and said the United States would also continue to provide humanitarian assistance to those in need.

""The United States and our allies and partners stand in solidarity with the people and government of Ukraine in the face of the Kremlin’s aggression,"" he said in a statement. ""The international community is united and determined to hold (Russian President Vladimir) Putin accountable.""

Russia says it is engaged in a ""special military operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its neighbour's military capabilities and ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine.

The funds ""will provide immediate military assistance to Ukraine, including anti-armor, anti-aircraft systems, and small arms in support of Ukraine’s front-line defenders,"" one of the U.S. officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Ukraine has been asking for more Javelin anti-tank weapons and Stinger missiles to shoot down aircraft.

Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, on Saturday underscored Ukraine's need for additional military supplies in an interview with the non-profit Renew Democracy Initiative. read more

The United States has drawn from U.S. weapons stocks to supply Ukraine repeatedly, beginning in the fall of 2021 and then again in December and February.

The last batch of U.S. weapons provided in February included anti-armor, small arms, body armor and various munitions, according to the Pentagon, as well as anti-aircraft systems.

On Thursday night the U.S. Congress approved $13.6 billion in emergency aid for Ukraine as part of a $1.5 trillion measure to fund the U.S. government through September.

1,04b52df1-0830-4ecd-9e10-1224ac9fa5f4,['The Washington Post'],2022-03-13 00:00:00,"The Biden administration is working with European allies to expedite more sophisticated air-defense systems and other armaments into the Ukrainian war zone, U.S. officials said Friday.

Discussions were ongoing ahead of Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's planned trip this week to meet with NATO allies in Brussels and Slovakia, which along with Poland and Romania has indicated a willingness to transfer military aid to its embattled neighbor. Slovakia also possesses the S-300 surface-to-air missile system, which is used to shoot down enemy aircraft and is familiar to the Ukrainians.

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters that the United States is committed to arming the government in Kyiv with ""the kinds of capabilities that we know the Ukrainians need and are using very well.""

""Some of that material we have and are providing. Some of that material we don't have but we know others have, and we're helping coordinate that as well,"" Kirby said.

The administration is facing backlash over its decision last week to scuttle Poland's proposal that would have sent a number of its MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine via a transfer ""free of charge"" to the United States. Washington, citing concerns that Russia would view the move as a provocation from Washington, said the offer from Warsaw was not ""tenable.""

Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have pleaded for the MiG-29 transfer. And while they have support from a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers, the Biden administration, citing assessments from senior American military commanders in Europe, has said the additional aircraft would offer only minimal value to Ukraine given the contested nature of its airspace.

""We believe the most effective way to support the Ukrainian military in their fight against Russia is to provide increased amounts of antitank weapons and air-defense systems, which is ongoing with the international community,"" said Air Force Gen. Tod Wolters, the chief of U.S. European Command. ""The Ukrainians are making excellent use of these weapons now.""

NATO countries have been limited in what they can send to Ukraine due in part to the Ukrainian military's training, which centers heavily on Soviet- or Russian-made weapons that exist in dwindling stock.

Ukraine has sought the S-300 surface-to-air missile system, said a senior European official familiar with the situation. There are ongoing talks about that possibility, the official said, but questions remain about whether there are any that can be spared.

""Nobody wants to mishandle expectations,"" said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Ukrainian troops also are trained on the Buk surface-to-air missile system. Some eastern European countries possess both systems, but in small numbers, the European official said.

Austin's upcoming visit to Slovakia could be used to secure additional agreements to use its railways to facilitate faster transfers of humanitarian aid and fuel into Ukraine, the European official said. Unlike some other countries nearby, Slovakia has a shipping hub that operates on both European standard-gauge rail and the wider-gauge rail used in Ukraine.

Assessments of how long the Ukrainians can continue to hold out against the Russian onslaught are intertwined with what weapons they already have.

On Friday, a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the United States sent a letter to President Joe Biden asking him to transfer manned and unmanned aircraft to Ukraine, saying that ""despite heroic and skilled resistance,"" the Russians had achieved air superiority over the Ukrainians. U.S. defense officials noted the Russians have a significantly larger air force but had been unable to control the skies over Ukraine.

""Russia's advantage in this domain could soon develop into air dominance if the Ukrainians do not receive necessary military aid,"" the lawmakers said.

The lawmakers called for the continued delivery of Stinger missiles, man-portable anti-aircraft weapons, but also called for the United States to facilitate the transfer of S-300 systems.

""Providing Soviet-era platforms that Ukrainian servicemembers have previously operated and maintained will be essential to their success on the battlefield and will also protect U.S. defense technology from falling into the hands of the Russians,"" lawmakers said in the letter.

They also urged the president to reconsider the Polish MiG decision and said the Biden administration should look for ways to send more armed drones and Su-25 aircraft to Ukraine. The jet is used by a handful of U.S. allies and partners, including Bulgaria, a NATO nation.

The lawmakers signing the letter Friday included numerous U.S. veterans.

Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., a former Army Ranger who is among the signatories, said the administration was drawing a nonsensical distinction between acceptable weapons and those it considers potentially too escalatory.

""I don't believe there is a distinction between providing a MiG and providing a Javelin and a Stinger,"" he said. ""These are defensive systems; we are not providing offensive capabilities because Ukraine is not on the offense, all they're doing is fighting for their survival and trying to maintain their democracy against a Vladimir Putin invasion.""

Crow also said that while the provision of Javelins and Stingers has been useful thus far, the West must step up its contributions to give Ukraine a chance to sustain its resistance -- particularly in the skies, where Zelenskyy's forces are trying to prevent Russia from achieving superiority.

""Short of MiGs, they need more advanced ground-to-air missile systems,"" Crow said, noting that the Stingers provided to Ukraine work well against helicopters and planes conducting low-altitude bombing runs, but aren't enough to ground the Russian air force. ""They need something that can reach out and conduct regional air defense, higher altitude air defense.""

Rep. Michael Waltz, R-Fla., who has served in Special Forces units, said that transferring S-300 systems and components of them, such as radar, could be helpful.

Among Western weapons, the Ukrainians also could benefit from the Avenger system, which allows Stinger missiles to be mounted to vehicles, he said. Other American air-defense systems, including Patriot missiles, require too much training to make them practical in the near term.

The Ukrainians could benefit, too, from counter-battery radar systems, which scan for the originating locations of incoming artillery fire, and its equipment they've asked for before, Waltz said.

""At a minimum, once the Russians know you have that, they won't be able to just sit there and lob round after round after round,"" Waltz said. ""It degrades their ability to just sit there and pummel you. They have to move, obviously, because now you have the ability to counter-battery.""

The Ukrainian military has 56 fighter jets left and is using them just five to 10 hours per day, a senior U.S. defense official said Friday. The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, cited that as one reason the administration had decided against transferring the MiGs to Ukraine, noting that Russian surface-to-air missile systems can reach just about anywhere over the war zone.

U.S. officials continue to speak to the Ukrainians regularly, the defense official said, and the ""things they need the most"" are anti-aircraft and anti-armor weapons, such as Javelin missiles. For items the Ukrainians need that the United States does not have, the administration is working with allies and partners ""who might have inventory.""

""We're trying to help them further that defense in ways and with systems that they know how to use already,"" the official said. ""They're good at it, and it's having effect on the Russians.""

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

The decision comes one day after U.S. officials rejected a proposal from Poland to have the United States and NATO transfer Polish MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine.

“There's no discussion about putting a Patriot battery in Ukraine. In order to do that you have to put U.S. troops with it to operate it,” a senior defense official said Thursday. “It is not a system that the Ukrainians are familiar with and as we have made very clear, there will be no U.S. troops fighting in Ukraine.”

A Patriot missile battery usually has about 90 U.S. soldiers attached to it. Each system includes a phased array radar, a control station, and eight launchers, each of which can hold four missiles. Patriot “is the only operational air defense system that can shoot down attacking missiles,” according to the Army.

It would likely take months to train the Ukrainian military how to operate the system, according to people familiar with the technology.

“It takes a long time to be a Patriot operator,” said Thomas Karako, a missile defense expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, or CSIS, a think tank in Washington.

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urged the West to send additional surface-to-air defenses. Russia has escalated a brutal assault on Ukrainian civilians and military targets that is relying heavily on long-range missiles and rockets, partly because of the local resistance and logistical failures their ground forces encountered.

As of Thursday, Russia had launched approximately 775 missiles into Ukraine, increasingly targeting civilians and devastating residential areas, according to U.S. officials.

“The Kremlin bombs schools, hospitals and maternity wards. Moscow does not protect anyone. She's the destroyer,” the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine wrote on its official Facebook page. “They are not capable of fighting with our army, guard, territorial defense forces This is why the most vulnerable are attacked.”

Ukraine’s military already operates the Russian-made S-300 air defense system. Some newer variants of the S-300 are capable of “providing some cruise and ballistic missile defense capability,” according to CSIS.

Don't miss:

“The Russian air defense units … operated by the Ukrainians, they're pretty capable systems,” Gen. Mark Kelly, the head of the U.S. Air Force’s Air Combat Command, said Wednesday at the McAleese and Associates Defense Programs conference in Washington.

Sending additional Soviet-era S-300 interceptors owned by NATO allies to Ukraine is one of the options under consideration, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. Bulgaria and Slovakia possess S-300s, according to Military Periscope, a weapons database owned by Defense One parent GovExec.

“Lethality is the top priority for the Ukrainians right now,” said Josh Kirshner, a former State Department official now with Beacon Global Strategies. “But at the same time they need systems that they can learn to use quickly and are ready to ship. Clearly, they don’t have the personnel to spare for long training efforts or time to waste.”

Israel reportedly blocked the United States from giving Iron Dome missile interceptor systems to Ukraine out of fear upsetting Moscow. Iron Dome has been widely effective in shooting down thousands of rockets fired from Gaza, but Israel historically has balked at sharing the technology with other countries, including South Korea.

In the meantime, the Ukrainian military has successfully attacked Russian forces using Turkish TB2 drones.

“At this point, they need everything they can get,” Karako said.

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Wednesday that the U.S. was exploring other ways to better enable Ukraine to defend against the air assault, after rejecting a proposal by Poland to take its Soviet-era MiG-29s and get them into Ukrainian hands.

“Alternative options are working with other allies and partner nations around the world who may have additional air defense capabilities and systems at their disposal who might be willing to provide them to Ukraine,” Kirby said. “And so we're having discussions with many countries right now about some of those capabilities, surface-to-air missiles for instance, that the Ukrainians are more trained and more equipped [on].”

Russia warned earlier this week that any country that took part in transferring jets to Ukraine would be seen as party to the conflict, and Kirby said Wednesday that the U.S. intelligence community had assessed that a jet transfer would be “high risk” for escalating into a direct war between NATO and Russia, while not making an appreciable difference in the air war.

Some lawmakers on the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday demanded to know the intelligence behind the Biden administration’s claims that providing Ukraine with more advanced weapons would cause Russia to escalate the war.

On Thursday, the Pentagon said that Ukrainian pilots “are not flying their fixed wing aircraft very much on a daily basis” because Russia has almost the entire country covered by its own surface-to-air missile defense systems.",https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2022/03/why-us-wont-give-patriot-interceptors-ukraine/363042/
5,04b52df1-0830-4ecd-9e10-1224ac9fa5f4,['Michael Jacobson'],2022-04-15 07:50:53+00:00,"While the Russian military is on the back foot in Ukraine, its shifting operations reveal severe shortcoming in Ukraine’s arsenal and capabilities — one that NATO member states could fix. Washington has recognized this and President Joe Biden has approved a new arms package for Ukraine that includes artillery and more sophisticated anti-air systems, including more sophisticated and heavier weapons and platforms than have been provided thus far. As a defense professional who has focused on artillery for most of his career, I am encouraged by this decision. These systems will allow Ukrainian forces to continue to press the fight against Russia’s military.

After failing in the first phase of the war, Russian forces seem intent on using artillery and air-delivered munitions to create a zone of destruction in the Donbas. While Ukraine has extensive Soviet-era field and air defense artillery, augmented by shoulder-launched capabilities from NATO member states, it lacks the logistical resilience and range necessary to stand toe-to-toe with Russia in this next phase of the war. The integration of air-defense artillery with surface-to-surface artillery would enable Ukrainian forces to take out the most effective remaining weaponry in Russia’s arsenal: artillery.

Destroying Russian artillery is the key to Ukrainian success in the next phase of the war. There are readily available artillery systems in NATO member and partner arsenals that would allow Ukraine to thwart Russian objectives. Some might be concerned that Ukraine will be unable to field and maintain such weapon systems, but these concerns should not be overstated. While supplying these weapons would require a short period of time for training and equipping, upgraded Ukrainian batteries and battalions could begin taking the field as early as May — if Western policymakers act with urgency, which they seem to be interested in doing.

A Shifting Campaign

Russian forces have all but withdrawn from areas in northern Ukraine. Russian ground offensives are concentrated in the south and east of Ukraine. The next phase of the war will likely be a war of attrition focused on the Donbas, with the possibility of Russia re-opening its front north of Kyiv. Withdrawing Russian forces have left a path of destruction in their wake. As Russia shifts its posture, it has conducted a relentless bombardment of built-up areas, most notably in Mariupol. Artillery is the weapon of choice in Russia’s campaign of destruction, which seems intended to denude areas of the basic infrastructure necessary to sustain a viable population. Artillery, precision aircraft strikes, and long-range missiles continue to target Ukrainian infrastructure.

Ukrainian forces have done an outstanding job denying air superiority to the Russian air force using man-portable air-defense systems provided by NATO. They have also succeeded in using Javelins to stop tanks in their tracks. However, Ukraine has no effective options to counter a prolonged Russian artillery offensive. This should trouble those who want to see Ukraine prevail as Russia can rely upon an extensive supply of artillery platforms and munitions that it will likely use to lay waste to large swaths of eastern Ukraine and thwart a Ukrainian counter-offensive to retake the country.

The State of Ukrainian Artillery and Air Defense

The Ukrainian army has made good use of its legacy equipment over the past eight years of combat in the Donbas and during the first seven weeks of the Russian invasion, but that equipment is largely destroyed, run-down, ineffective, or outdated. As the campaign goes on, this legacy equipment will continue to breakdown and be destroyed in combat. Logistics and maintenance for this equipment will become ever more difficult as Ukraine’s supply of lethal munitions for equipment on hand dries up. The Ukrainian army lacks sufficient counter rocket, artillery, and mortar capabilities, which is particularly critical in defending its own counter-fire radar systems. Perhaps the most effective capabilities the Ukrainians do have in their inventory are Russian air-defense systems. The S-300, gifted to Ukraine by Slovakia, is an effective long-range system, but even with outside help provided thus far, Ukraine does not have the right systems and missile magazine depth for this to be a viable long-term option.

Ukrainian artillery such as BM-21, 2S1, and D-30, as well as air-defense capabilities such as the SA-6 and the SA-13, stem primarily from lower-tech Soviet, domestic, or regional production. Ukraine does not have the latest technology in self-propelled howitzers. While older systems are useful for imprecise area fires, the latest NATO systems and their munitions are faster, more lethal, and more survivable. They would allow Ukraine to do things it cannot currently do well: quickly determine locations of enemy artillery and target them with counter-battery fire, and destroy tanks and other armored vehicles with artillery, rather than only with anti-tank guided missiles and other tanks.

Further, these newer artillery systems are fully digitized and integrated with precision equipment based on internal, gyroscopic, self-locating devices supplemented by GPS updating. They also have modular components that can be swapped out, thus simplifying repairs. This is important because Ukraine currently lacks the ability to produce munitions and repair parts, especially as Russian forces bombard Ukrainian industrial facilities. Most newer systems require a relatively brief period of training on individual weapon systems and munitions. They are easy to use and employ for artillerymen already trained in basic field craft.

More Western Kit for Ukraine

As Russia reconstitutes its combat-ineffective maneuver units, most of its artillery units remain operational and in the fight. Russian artillery is engaging hundreds of targets a day in the Donbas and more than a thousand long-range missiles have been fired over the course of the campaign.

What specific systems should be considered for provision to Ukraine?

Sweden produces the Archer, a wheeled self-propelled howitzer with a range of 30 kilometers. The system is in production and a battalion’s worth of guns (12 to 18) could probably be provided immediately. It has on-board fire control computation, auto-loading and resupply, and requires only a three-man crew. France produces a similar howitzer, the CAESAR II. This is an extremely capable, wheeled, self-propelled, 155-milimeter howitzer that can integrate with NATO command and control systems.

These two howitzer systems are arguably the best in the world today. They are fully digitized and boast fully automated unmanned cannon turrets, power-assisted resupply systems, and onboard fire-solution computation systems. That means they can quickly receive and integrate all the data needed for counter-battery fire. These individual howitzers can fire a platoon’s worth of projectiles in a single fire mission and then drive to another location less than five minutes later to avoid Russian counter-battery fire. Both of these systems can fire the latest sensor-fuzed munitions, meaning each projectile can kill a vehicle that might be a tank, a self-propelled howitzer, and enemy radar system, or a logistics vehicle. In artillery, the ability to shoot, move, and shoot again is key to survivability. Both systems are highly mobile wheeled systems built on common truck chassis from Volvo and Tatra that can move quickly across road systems and have sufficient range to reach equivalent Russian cannon artillery systems from relative safety behind the forward line of troops. They are equipped with auto-loader systems and emplacement/displacement times measured in a handful of minutes. That gives them high rates of fires that enable them to do something called “multiple rounds, simultaneous impact” — one howitzer can have three to six rounds it fires land on a target area at the same time.

The U.S.-produced High Mobility Artillery Rocket System is also one of the best in the world. In addition to being highly mobile and digitized like the Archer and CAESAR, it can fire the full suite of sophisticated Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System rockets and eventually the long-range Precision Strike Missile, when it comes online. This system and the associated rockets and missiles require minimal train-up for basic artillerymen to employ. To complete the Ukrainian artillery kill-chain, the United States currently produces a long-range, highly accurate, counter-fire radar, the Q-53, which the Ukrainian army is already somewhat familiar with.

Outfitting with NATO howitzers and rocket launchers provides Ukrainian forces with the ability to employ NATO projectiles, rockets, and missiles, which include the best in sensor-fused weapons (such as the German SMArt155mm and the Swedish BONUS), GPS-guided precision rockets, and high-yield precision missiles. Integrating multi-mission radars and the counter-battery Q-53 radar would allow Ukrainian forces to identify Russian artillery systems, defeat incoming rounds by blasting them out of the sky using NATO or Russian counter-rocket systems, and provide counter-battery fire using sensor-fused munitions and area effects rockets to decimate Russian artillery forces. Finally, the United States should consider providing Ukraine with the Patriot Air Defense system to complete an integrated air-defense complex.

How to Set Ukraine Up for Cannon-Fed Success

The United States and its allies should also support Ukraine’s artillery arsenal with the necessary doctrine, materiel, and training, as well as logistical support in terms of maintenance and supply. Those NATO countries that produce many of the artillery systems have the industrial base to continue to supply repair parts and munitions for the foreseeable future. The United States and its NATO allies often use contracted logistics support as a stop-gap measure. This essentially involves personnel from Western defense firms going into theater, including forward positions in a conflict zone, in order to perform important maintenance and logistics activities for newly fielded weapons systems. Due to recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, there are many professionals and technicians from Western defense companies who have experience working in war zones. While this happens, Ukrainian military personnel can train and become familiar with the new equipment both at forward locations and in the rear. For major repairs and overhauls, the systems would be transported back to neighboring NATO countries.

Adapting and integrating NATO techniques and systems will enable the Ukrainian army to benefit from speed and data already enjoyed by its NATO partners. Training on many of the tactical systems can be completed in as little as a month since many of the fire-control complexities are accomplished by onboard computers. Training on sustaining and repairing these complex systems will take longer but can be supplemented by contracted logistics support while sustainers are in training. Fielding NATO-developed and integrated equipment will enable NATO member states to aid with targeting and battle-damage assessments from outside the combat zone. The secure nature of much of the NATO equipment will also stymie Russian efforts to gather intelligence on Ukrainian tactical activity.

As time goes on, individual NATO countries have begun considerations to supply various advanced western weapon systems on their own. Rumors have been circulating that Slovakia is considering sending Zuzana II howitzers, while the German arms consortium Krauss-Maffei Wegmann has flown trial balloons regarding the Panzerhaubitze 2000. Both systems represent advances over current Ukrainian systems, but the initiatives are disjointed and don’t take into account the important aspect of counter-battery radar, digital input to firing data, and the lethal munitions associated with the platforms.

The Artillery Fight is Here

Much has been written and said in recent weeks about the need to field weapons to the Ukrainians that can be immediately employed to stop the Russian offensive. That was wise counsel and has achieved its ends. Those weapons should continue to flow. The argument that more sophisticated weapons aren’t viable because of the associated training and follow-on logistics support simply isn’t correct given where Ukraine now finds itself in the fight. As the war settles in for a longer-term artillery duel, more appropriate and sustainable weapons systems should be brought to bear. The training to use those systems is not overly complex and can be accomplished in neighboring NATO countries in relatively brief periods of time. The maintenance and other tasks above the operator level can be performed by contracted logistics support in the operational environment as well as in neighboring countries for depot-level maintenance. Most importantly, the precision, lethality, and efficiency to be successful against Russian artillery systems is best provided by the more sophisticated capabilities available from NATO. Just as NATO has provided sophisticated systems — such as the Javelin, the Next generation Light Anti-tank Weapon, Stinger, Starstreak, and Panzerfaust 3 — NATO should provide similar levels of sophistication for Ukraine to succeed in this next phase and mitigate the human suffering there as much as possible.

Now is the time to transition to NATO artillery and air-defense systems before Ukraine loses the momentum it has gained.

Hennigan'],,"As Russian forces prepare for a renewed and expanded armor assault in eastern and southern Ukraine, the Biden Administration on Wednesday authorized a massive $800-million military aid package to help Kyiv fend off Moscow’s unprovoked invasion.

The newly announced assistance includes a wide range of weapon systems for the Ukrainian military designed to help them fight off the superior heavy forces Russia is putting into the field. The transfer includes Howitzer artillery, armored personnel carriers and Mi-17 helicopters, and a dozen advanced radar systems. It also sends the Ukrainians multiple tank-killing systems, including 500 Javelin missiles, 300 Switchblade drones and thousands of other anti-armor weapons.

The inventory of weapons and equipment was made after several conversations between U.S. and Ukraine officials regarding what was needed on the battlefield, administration officials say. The resulting list, which includes more than a dozen different items, represents an escalation of the U.S. role in the Ukrainian war. For instance, the U.S. will provide 18 155mm Howitzer cannons and 40,000 rounds for the first time. American soldiers will also directly provide training to Ukrainian forces on how to use some of the higher-end equipment such as the AN/TPQ-36 counter-artillery radars and AN/MPQ-64 Sentinel air surveillance radars.

The Ukrainian military beat back a weeks-long, blood-soaked Russian offensive in and around the capital, Kyiv, surprising the better-equipped Russian forces, but now faces an escalating threat on other fronts. The massive U.S. transfer comes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky released an online video Wednesday warning that the war risks becoming an “endless bloodbath, spreading misery, suffering, and destruction” without additional weaponry to beat back a much larger, more technologically advanced enemy.

The weapons and equipment are being sent under a so-called “presidential drawdown authority,” which allows Biden to transfer the hardware from U.S. stocks without Congressional approval in order to speed up delivery in an emergency. The White House has now provided about $2.6 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion on Feb. 24. A total of more than $3.2 billion in U.S. military aid has flowed to Kyiv since Biden took office last year. The administration had initially relied on diplomacy with Moscow to resolve the increasing tensions in Ukraine, but Putin’s invasion prompted the U.S. to draw up more aggressive strategies to respond to Russia.

“This new package of assistance will contain many of the highly effective weapons systems we have already provided and new capabilities tailored to the wider assault we expect Russia to launch in eastern Ukraine,” President Joe Biden said in a statement, following a phone call with Zelensky. “The steady supply of weapons the United States and its Allies and partners have provided to Ukraine has been critical in sustaining its fight against the Russian invasion. It has helped ensure that Putin failed in his initial war aims to conquer and control Ukraine. We cannot rest now.”

The Pentagon has launched around-the-clock supply missions, delivering eight to 10 planeloads of anti-aircraft and anti-armor missiles, remote-controlled drones, rounds of ammunition and laser-guided rockets each day. On Wednesday, the Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks and top U.S. defense officials met with the chief executives of the eight largest U.S. defense contractors to discuss industry’s capacity to meet Ukraine’s needs if the war with Russia drags on for several years. “We have been giving an awful lot of stuff to the Ukrainians, and so it would be the prudent thing to do before it becomes a crisis issue for our own readiness to have a discussion with them about accelerated production and advanced production,” said a senior defense official, who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly on the matter.

The Pentagon is determined to rapidly deliver American hardware at a time when Russia is relocating troops and heavy weapons into southern and eastern areas of Ukraine for a concerted push on the regions nearest Russian borders. After Russia’s forces were unable to topple the government in Kyiv, Moscow has shifted its war aims in recent days to less ambitious objectives. “There has been a sense of urgency,” the official said. “We have been pushing things to (the Ukrainians) at unprecedented speeds. From the time it gets into the region, it can be in the Ukrainian hands in as little as 48 hours, sometimes faster.”

The Biden Administration has repeatedly insisted U.S. troops will not fight in Ukraine, but the president has redoubled defenses in surrounding countries by moving roughly 14,000 troops eastward in Europe, principally in Poland. Ukraine is not a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member, but it borders four nations that are: Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania. The U.S. and other NATO allies have pledged to protect their eastern and central European members under the alliance’s defining Article 5 mutual defense commitments. In the meantime, those forward deployed troops may be available for the training of Ukrainian forces on new weapons systems outside of Ukraine, according to Pentagon spokesman John Kirby.

“We’re still working through what those options are going to look like, what that training is going to look like: How many US troops are going to be involved in it? Where’s it going to be? How long? It’s going to depend. We’re still working our way through that,” he said. “But we believe that we can put together appropriate training for some of these systems very, very quickly. These are not highly complex systems.”

Since the beginning of the conflict, the Biden Administration has worked to avoid escalating tensions with Russia, which maintains a nuclear arsenal in size and scope comparable only to the U.S. stockpile. Kirby acknowledged this aid package could be seen as escalatory, but that the administration worked to mitigate the concerns. “Every decision we’re making is we balance the needs of Ukraine to defend itself with our responsibilities, our absolute responsibilities, to think about escalation management,” Kirby said. “And if we weren’t, you should challenge us on that. But these decisions are all done prudently.”

As the Russian military has suffered unexpected setbacks in its war on Ukraine, the invading forces have increasingly hit civilian sites with airstrikes. Hospitals, schools and apartment buildings have been destroyed by a daily bombardment around the country. The Pentagon says that the Russians have launched more than 1,550 missiles, many of which have appeared to miss their intended targets. Ukrainian fighters have accused Russian forces of using chemical weapons, but those claims remain unconfirmed.

The Russians, meanwhile, have been accused of numerous war crimes including attacks on medical facilities, rape, executions, looting, and forced deportation of civilians to Russia. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe released a 100-page report on Wednesday, which said independent experts have found evidence that the Russian military has committed human rights abuses and broken international humanitarian law.

In recent days, U.S. and European officials have warned that Moscow was preparing a new military offensive in Ukraine’s eastern region. During its last invasion of Ukraine in 2014, the Russian military maintained a continued presence in two separatist regions of eastern Ukraine, known as the People’s Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk. Since then, Donetsk and Luhansk have been home to puppet governments installed, armed, funded and operated by the Russian security services. It looks to expand into surrounding territory in the weeks and months ahead.

The Russian military forces are expected to be replenished and restocked after their retreat from northern Ukraine. Knowing this, Ukraine requested specific weapons to prepare for the renewed assault. “These kinds of capabilities are based on what they believe they’re facing,” Kirby said. “They will be facing Russian forces that are familiar with the territory, and that part of Ukraine, that they’ve been fighting over for eight years.”

U.S. President Joe Biden on Saturday authorized the additional security assistance, the White House said, paving the way for the ""immediate"" shipment of fresh military equipment to Ukraine, a senior administration official said.

Biden's decision brings the total U.S. security aid provided to Ukraine to $1.2 billion since January 2021, and to $3.2 billion since 2014, when Russia annexed the Crimea region of Ukraine, according to senior administration officials.

In a memorandum to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Biden directed that up to $200 million allocated through the Foreign Assistance Act be designated for Ukraine's defense.

The funds can be used for weapons and other articles from the Defense Department's stock, as well as military education and training to help Ukraine against the Russian invasion, now in its third week.

""It will provide immediate military assistance to Ukraine, including anti-armor, anti-aircraft systems, and small arms in support of Ukraine’s front-line defenders,"" one of the officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.

The Pentagon declined to comment, referring queries to the White House and State Department.

Ukraine has been asking for more Javelin anti-tank weapons and Stinger missiles to shoot down aircraft.

Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, on Saturday underscored Ukraine's need for additional military supplies in an interview with the nonprofit Renew Democracy Initiative.

The United States has drawn from U.S. weapons stocks to supply Ukraine repeatedly, beginning in the fall of 2021 and then again in December and February.

The last batch of weapons provided by the United States in February included anti-armor, small arms, body armor and various munitions, according to the Pentagon, as well as anti-aircraft systems.

On Thursday night the U.S. Congress approved $13.6 billion in emergency aid for Ukraine as part of a $1.5 trillion measure to fund the U.S. government through September.",https://www.voanews.com/a/us-rushing-weapons-to-ukraine/6482354.html

The White House on Saturday announced that President Joe Biden authorized $200 million worth of defense aid for Ukraine, including arms, equipment, military education, and training.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement that the spending package would include ""further defensive assistance to help Ukraine meet the armored, airborne, and other threats it is facing.""

He continued: ""This drawdown will bring the total security assistance provided by the United States to Ukraine to more than $1.2 billion since the beginning of the Administration.""

Officials told The New York Times that the arms package includes Javelin antitank missiles and Stinger antiaircraft missiles, and will be shipped into western Ukraine from existing US military stockpiles elsewhere in Europe.

Pentagon officials told The Times that Russia hasn't yet attacked such shipments because its forces are too preoccupied elsewhere in Ukraine, but that could soon change.

On Saturday, Russia's deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, warned the US that ""pumping Ukraine with weapons from a number of countries orchestrated by them is not just a dangerous move, but these are actions that turn the corresponding convoys into legitimate targets.""

The US is among several other nations that have provided antitank and antiaircraft weapons to Ukraine. The US provided a similar arms and equipment package to Ukraine in February, which included anti-armor, small arms, body armor, various munitions, and antiaircraft systems.

Earlier this week, the US Senate also approved a $1.5 trillion government funding bill that included $13.6 billion in emergency humanitarian and military aid for Ukraine, as Insider's Joseph Zeballos-Roig reported.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urged the US and NATO to take stronger measures to assist Ukraine, such as providing fighter jets and establishing a no-fly zone. The US has rejected both pleas, noting that flying fighter jets into contested airspace would raise ""serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance,"" and that a no-fly zone would effectively commit the US to shooting down any Russian aircraft entering Ukrainian airspace.",https://www.businessinsider.com/white-house-approves-200-million-in-weapons-for-ukraine-2022-3
9,04b52df1-0830-4ecd-9e10-1224ac9fa5f4,['Eric Schmitt'],2022-03-12 00:00:00,"WASHINGTON — The White House has approved an additional $200 million in arms and equipment for Ukraine, administration officials said on Saturday, responding to urgent requests from President Volodymyr Zelensky for more aid to stave off the Russian invasion.

The latest arms package, which officials say includes Javelin antitank missiles and Stinger antiaircraft missiles, follows a $350 million arms package that the Biden administration approved last month. Altogether, the administration has authorized $1.2 billion in weapons for Ukraine in the past year, officials said.

The weapons come from existing U.S. military stockpiles in Europe and are flown to neighboring countries such as Poland and Romania, where they are shipped overland into western Ukraine. In less than a week at the beginning of the Russian assault, the United States and NATO pushed more than 17,000 antitank weapons, including Javelins, into the hands of Ukrainian commanders.

Russia has so far not attacked these shipments because its forces have been too busy fighting in other parts of Ukraine, Pentagon officials said. But on Saturday, according to the Interfax news agency, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei A. Ryabkov, warned that Moscow would start firing on such shipments, stirring fears of an escalation to the conflict.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/12/us/politics/biden-ukraine-weapons.html
