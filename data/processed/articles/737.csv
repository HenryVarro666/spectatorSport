A mother covered her one-month-old baby with her body while their home was being shelled in Kyiv, according to a Facebook post from National Children's Specialized Hospital Ohmatdit on Friday.

The child was unharmed, but the mother sustained multiple injuries, the post said.

The child's mother and father were at home feeding their baby in the early morning hours when their building was shelled. They heard the sounds of shelling throughout the night getting closer and closer, the hospital said.

""When I went down to the yard, I saw that a shell had hit the kindergarten next to our house. There is no more ceiling, windows and doors in all the houses nearby. The debris of glass flew right on us,"" her husband said, according to the hospital.

The father was treated for scraping wounds to his leg and the mother underwent surgery for her injuries.

Meanwhile dozens of Ukrainian troops have reportedly died in a strike on a military barracks in Mykolaiv.

Here are the latest developments:

Russia hasn't gained air superiority: Britain's military said Russian forces have still not managed to gain control over Ukraine's airspace. An intelligence assessment provided by the UK's Ministry of Defense said Russia has failed to gain air superiority over Ukraine and is largely depending on stand-off weapons, “launched from the relative safety of Russian airspace to strike targets within Ukraine.”

Mariupol residents forced to go to Russia: Residents of besieged Mariupol are being taken to Russian territory against their will by Russian forces, according to the Mariupol City Council. Captured residents were taken to camps where Russian forces checked their phones and documents, the city council said. They were then redirected to remote Russian cities. The besieged city of Mariupol is under almost constant bombardment, according to a major in Ukraine's army, and residents are rationing food and water as bodies are left in the streets. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said what Russian forces have done to Mariupol is an ""act of terror that will be remembered for centuries.""

Ukrainian troops killed in missile strike: Rescue efforts are ongoing in the southern city of Mykolaiv at the scene of a missile strike on barracks housing soldiers, regional official Vitalli Kim said. Dozens of troops are reported to have been killed in the attack by Russian forces, according to journalists from CNN Swedish affiliate Expressen who were at the scene.

Russia uses hypersonic missile: US officials confirmed Russia launched hypersonic missiles against Ukraine last week, the first known use of such missiles in combat. Russia claimed it deployed powerful hypersonic missiles on Friday to destroy an ammunition warehouse in western Ukraine.

Russian bombardment of civilians continues: Two children and a women were killed in the eastern town of Rubizhne after being pulled from the rubble of a residential building pummeled by Russian artillery fire, the emergency services said. In Kyiv, a mother covered her one-month-old baby with her body while their home was being shelled, according to the National Children's Specialized Hospital Ohmatdit. The child was unharmed, but the mother sustained multiple injuries, the hospital said. US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said Russia continues to make ""incremental gains"" in Ukraine's south and has used ""brutal, savage techniques'' in the way it has targeted civilians.

More than 6,600 people evacuated via evacuation corridors: At least 6,623 people were rescued via evacuation corridors from besieged Ukrainian cities Saturday, according to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, a senior official in President Volodymyr Zelensky's office. Tymoshenko said 4,128 people, including 1,172 children, were evacuated from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia. Zelensky said eight evacuation corridors were operating Saturday but due to Russian shelling, authorities were unable to evacuate people from Borodyanka in the Kyiv region. Authorities were also unable to deliver humanitarian aid to the cities in the southern Kherson region.

Zelensky singles out Nestle: Zelensky addressed the Swiss people via video link, calling for Switzerland to take further action against Russia. He singled out Swiss company Nestle, which unlike many other major brands, has not left the Russian market. ""Your company that refuses to leave Russia. Even now — when there are threats from Russia to other European countries. Not only to us. When there is even nuclear blackmail from Russia,"" he said.",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-20-22/h_debf3c28b628baa6b67e82de4b3f3979

WASHINGTON – Two House Democrats on Friday urged the Biden administration to do everything in its power to protect the rights and safety of particularly vulnerable communities in Ukraine, highlighting its Jewish and LGBTQI+ populations.

Rep. Ted Deutch and Rep. Mondaire Jones, who represent two of America's largest Jewish districts in Florida and New York respectively, wrote to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken highlighting the ""horrific waves of violence and persecution"" Ukraine's Jews faced under Russian and Soviet rule and Nazi-German occupation in the 20th century.

""In recent months, Russia’s aggressive rhetoric raised fears among members of Ukraine’s Jewish community who still have memories of the antisemitic violence of the last century,"" the lawmakers continued, highlighting Russian President Vladimir Putin's use of the term ""denazification"" to justify its invasion of Ukraine and his instrumentalization of ""antisemitism to influence domestic and foreign public opinion in its conflict with Ukraine.""

Deutch and Jones further warned about the widespread discrimination and persecution the LGBTQI+ community faces in Russia, warning that these risks carry over to the LGBTQI+ community at the hands of Russian forces. They warned that the Biden administration cannot repeat the Trump administration's mistakes in resettling people subject to large-scale ""anti-gay purges"" by Russian forces in Chechnya in 2017. ""Russia’s military presence in Ukraine endangers the lives of LGBTQI+ Ukrainians and reverses the progress that country has made toward equality,"" they wrote.

They implored Blinken to ""ensure close and continued dialogue with organizations that serve Ukrainian members of marginalized groups; fund and support shelters to serve vulnerable that face particular risk at the hands of Russian forces; ensure U.S. embassies in Eastern Europe are equipped to provide immediate assistance to those fleeing the Russian war in Ukraine; and provide assistance for transgender Ukrainian individuals whose visible gender does not match their documents as they cross checkpoints and international boundaries.""

It was the second time in less than a week that city officials reported a public building where residents had taken shelter coming under attack. A bomb hit a Mariupol theatre with more than 1,300 believed to be inside on Wednesday, local officials said.

There was no immediate word on casualties from the reported strike on the art school, which The Associated Press could not independently verify. Ukrainian officials have not given an update on the search of the theatre since Friday, when they said at least 130 had been rescued.

Mariupol, a strategic port on the Azov Sea, has been under bombardment for at least three weeks and has seen some of the worst horrors of the war in Ukraine.

At least 2,300 people have died, some of whom had to be buried in mass graves, and food, water and electricity have run low.

“To do this to a peaceful city, what the occupiers did, is a terror that will be remembered for centuries to come,” Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address to the nation.

""The more Russia uses terror against Ukraine, the worse the consequences for it.”

In recent days, Russian forces have battled their way into the city, cutting it off from the Azov Sea and devastating a massive steel plant.

The fall of Mariupol would be an important but costly victory for the Russians, whose advance is largely stalled outside other major cities more than three weeks into the biggest land invasion in Europe since World War II.

In major cities across Ukraine, hundreds of men, women and children have been killed in Russian bombardments, while millions of civilians have raced to underground shelters or fled the country.

In the capital, Kyiv, at least 20 babies carried by Ukrainian surrogate mothers are stuck in a makeshift bomb shelter, waiting for parents to travel into the war zone to pick them up.

The infants — some just days old — are being cared for by nurses who cannot leave the shelter because of constant shelling by Russian troops who are trying to encircle the city.

In the hard-hit northeastern city of Sumy, authorities evacuated 71 orphaned babies through a humanitarian corridor, regional governor Dmytro Zhyvytskyy said Sunday.

He said the orphans, most of whom need constant medical attention, would be taken to an unspecified foreign country.

Russian shelling killed at least five civilians, including a 9-year-old boy, in Kharkiv, an eastern city that is Ukraine's second-largest.

The British Defense Ministry said Russia's failure to gain control of the skies over Ukraine “has significantly blunted their operational progress,"" forcing them to rely on stand-off weapons launched from the relative safety of Russian airspace.",https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/world/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-day-25-vladimir-putin-us-military-biological-research-mariupol-russian-bombs-sergey-lavrov-volodymyr-20th-march-2022-765073

“The entire line of defense is held: Kreminna, Rubizhne, Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirska community, Zolote – this is the territory controlled by Ukraine. The only thing the enemy managed to do was to advance a little bit in the direction of Popasna and Rubizhne. But these are temporary victories. Now they regroup and we will knock them out from these spots,” Serhiy Haidai, Head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration, said during the all-Ukrainian telethon, Ukrinform reports.

All the allegations that Luhansk region is completely under the control of the enemy are a complete lie, he stressed once again.

""Our situation is quite difficult precisely because they failed to capture the towns as they had planned or, perhaps, as they have already reported to Putin. That is why they are now bombing and shelling Rubizhne, Severodonetsk, Kreminna, Popasna, Zolote, using weapons of all calibers, completely razing [towns] to the ground, and they do not care what comes under attack: houses, hospitals, kindergartens or schools.

Haidai wrote on the administration’s Telegram channel that every single populated locality in Luhansk region had suffered from the Russian invaders.

“Our towns are now multi-storey ruins, every district is like a horror movie. Entire neighborhoods and streets are uninhabitable. Families were left homeless. Luhansk region was left without people. Some people became internally displaced for the second time,” wrote the Head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration.

Haidai also thanked the top military leadership of the Russian Federation for not strengthening the fighting capacity of the enemy army for years but stealing money and spending it on villas and palaces instead.

On February 24, Russian president Putin announced the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine. Russian troops shell and destroy key infrastructure, massively fire on residential areas of Ukrainian cities, towns, and villages using artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, and ballistic missiles.

Martial law was imposed in Ukraine and general mobilization was announced.
