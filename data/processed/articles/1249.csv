Even though they had existed since 1799, when the air-raid siren was invented by the Scottish natural philosopher and physicist John Robison, these sirens were not used during World War I. However, during World War II, air raids were already being announced, and people were urged to escape to shelters or London Underground stations. Thus, as the aviation industry further developed, so did warning mechanisms, and a system of anti-aircraft sirens was developed in Britain between 1938 and 1939.

Air-raid sirens first sounded the warning in London in September 1939. They were electric and emitted two signals: a waxing and waning warning signal and a steady tone which meant that people could come out of their hiding place. They were later installed almost everywhere in response to Cold War tensions, both in the Eastern and Western Blocs (just for the record, sirens have only been used to warn of tornadoes in the US since the 1970s).

Air raid sirens were also sounded in the NATO bombings in Bosnia in 1995 and in what is now Serbia, Montenegro, and Kosovo in 1999, which, together with the Russian army’s bombing of the Chechen city of Grozny in the 1990s, were, fortunately, the last large-scale military air raids in Europe.

An occasional test of the public warning system in Slovakia may seem unpleasant for many; nevertheless, in a certain sense, it is a reminder of a terrible history when military air raids were a living memory and potentially a real threat. It is impossible to quantify precisely how many people have been saved by the early warning of air raid sirens, but to this day, their sound remains a symbol of moments that no one wishes to return.",http://www.electronic-sirens.com/a-brief-history-of-military-air-raids-and-warning-sirens/

Olena Stokoz, deputy director general of the humanitarian charity, outlined the current situation in Kyiv while hiding in her house.

Speaking at a press conference over Zoom held by the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC), Ms Stokoz said: “Very heavy shelling is taking place every second… three kilometres from me. A couple of minutes ago we had a missile hitting civil houses, which is why I’m a bit scared. The situation is very dangerous here and in all parts of Ukraine.

“The most difficult areas, the hottest spots, in Ukraine are in the east, the north, the south and of course in Kyiv. We have missile attacks on civilians everywhere and many people have to stay in underprepared shelters almost 24 hours a day as we have air raid sirens every 15 minutes.

“People have to stay there without electricity, food, water, medicine, war clothes and other facilities. Other groups of people are trying to leave their homes and migrate either to safer places inside Ukraine or outside Ukraine.”

She spoke about the situation in the city as the DEC announced a new joint fundraising appeal to help people fleeing the conflict after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched an invasion a week ago.

The fundraising appeal brings together 15 UK aid charities to help raise funds, which will be distributed to charities responding on the ground in Ukraine, Moldova, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Poland, giving people food, water and shelter.

A target has not been outlined by the charity, as chief executive of DEC Saleh Saeed said it was “absolutely grateful for every single pound” donated, adding: “The more money we raise, the more people that we can reach.”

Every pound donated by the UK public will be matched by the Government through its Aid Match scheme, up to the value of £20 million.

According to the latest figures from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNCHR) more than one million people have left Ukraine and sought refuge in neighbouring European Countries.

“Many of us would never have envisaged launching a humanitarian appeal in the heart of Europe in 2022,” Mr Saeed said.

“Tragically, that’s exactly where we find ourselves today. The last time the DEC launched an appeal in Europe was over 20 years ago for Kosovo. That time we thought, ‘never again’. Sadly, we were wrong.

“Most of the people fleeing are women and children, forced to abandon their homes and loved ones, to find sanctuary in neighbouring countries. There are reports of long queues on the border of up to 60 hours in freezing conditions.

“The unfolding crisis is horrific and heartbreaking. But there’s something that we can all do to bring hope. Please donate and help us raise funds and support hundreds of thousands of people who are already fleeing.”

He added that the best way for people to help is to donate to the DEC and other similar fundraising efforts as there is “plenty of aid in the region” but funds are needed to buy it.

Andrew Morley, president and chief executive of humanitarian organisation World Vision International, visited the border crossings in Romania and Moldova earlier this week.

He said: “Thousands of refugees are streaming in and they’re taking up to three days to get across the border. In Ukraine, all the children I saw crossing the border were in tears. When I looked into their eyes I saw fear too. They were lost, they were scared and when I close my eyes now, their tears are still there.

“To make matters much worse, the sound of conflict can still be heard across the border. This is a constant reminder of the horrors they’re fleeing.”

Television appeals presented by actors Adrian Lester and Kit Harington will air, and radio appeals, voiced by David Tennant, will be broadcast on Thursday.

Reuters witnesses in the centre of the city of 3.4 million people could not immediately confirm the cause of the blasts, but they were more frequent than in recent days and some were louder. There were no immediate reports of casualties.

While no major assault has been launched on Kyiv yet, the capital has been shelled and Russian forces unleashed fierce firepower to try to break resistance in the nearby town of Borodyanka.

Drone footage from the town to the northwest of Kyiv on Thursday showed flattened houses and a badly damaged apartment block, with some homes charred and still on fire. Burned out military vehicles littered a main road.

In Kyiv's Borshchahivka neighbourhood, some 18 km west of the centre, the twisted metal remnants of a missile, which Ukrainian air defences apparently downed overnight, lay in the middle of a street a few metres from a bus station.

Tens of thousands of residents have fled the capital to the relative safety of the west of Ukraine and neighbouring countries. Many remain, and on Friday some people's message for the Russian military was one of defiance.

Liliya, a woman wearing a black coat and pointing at the missile debris, said Moscow was guilty of ""genocide"" against Ukraine.

""These bloodthirsty creatures came to kill us,"" she said.

Nearby, Igor Leonidovich, a bespectacled man of 62, described himself as an ethnic Russian and said he moved to Ukraine as a boy over 50 years ago.

""They all (Russian invaders) should go to hell,"" he said. ""I cannot believe what I am seeing with my own eyes. The situation is deteriorating for everyone, but especially for occupying forces.""

Russia says its actions in Ukraine are a ""special operation"" not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it calls dangerous nationalists.

Ukraine and its Western allies dismiss that description and call it an unjustified invasion. Hundreds of civilians have been killed in the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two and more than a million people have fled abroad.

In downtown Kyiv, the streets were a far cry from their pre-war vibrancy. But people went about their daily business and soldiers at a checkpoint of concrete blocks and metal spikes laughed as they shared breakfast.

As air raid sirens went off, some residents remained in queues outside pharmacies and food stores, while others took a stroll in a park.

While shopping in Zhytomyr, a city 130 kilometres west of Kyiv, air raid sirens ring out for the third time in one morning. The security guards hurry people toward a shelter, instructing them to leave behind their shopping carts.

Outside, some head to a defunct factory that has a reinforced basement. Others crowd nearby. A security guard comes outside, pleading: “Please go to the shelter, something may hit us. People, these are your lives.”

The last words convince the stragglers, pushing them to join the stream of people heading across the parking lot.

“I was at the shop when sirens rang, and I came here,” says Galina, an elderly lady. “I have a shelter at home, but it’s just the basement, it’s primitive.”

“Sometimes, I go to the church,” she adds, pointing toward a yellow-domed building that has opened its basement to those seeking shelter. Its bells also join in with the air raid siren, telling locals to hide from airstrikes. At least several missiles have hit the town since the war began.

Some fifteen minutes later, the city authorities report that the warning is over. The messages are distributed via Telegram channels, local media, and the radio. The latter plays a key role, beaming uplifting music, news of heroism at the frontlines, and dispatches from besieged cities.

As one set of people goes out, others are bringing bedding inside the bomb shelter to set up early for the night.

The shoppers head back and double their pace, weaving in and out of the aisles. Although Zhytomyr is not under siege and supply lines are still open, the shortages are starting to bear their mark.

The supermarket is already out of fresh meat. Milk shelves are empty, there is no more drinking water, while some other goods are also disappearing.

Soon there will be a humanitarian crisis, says one local. All over Ukraine, food and medicines are starting to run dry. In Kyiv, reports suggest it is increasingly difficult to get stock of even the basic items.

What began with what Russia claimed were “precision strikes” hitting military infrastructure, is increasingly looking like the scenes witnessed in Chechnya, Georgia, Syria, and other Kremlin wars.

A humanitarian convoy, which was reportedly given a green light by Russia in Volnovakha, Donetsk region, was shelled with rocket artillery, the mayor of Mariupol said on the radio on Tuesday. It was not possible to independently verify the information.

Around one million people have already fled Ukraine, according to the United Nations, which also estimates that some 12 million people in the country will need aid.

Driving through Zhytomyr, with the air raid sirens silent, a sudden hit shakes the air. Two dogs walked by their owners start running – a man and a woman hold them back. A few people quickly head off the streets to the nearest shelter.

At the bus station, which still offers a few routes out, a man with luggage in his hands sprints toward a passenger minivan. The driver loads up the bags and departs at speed.

In another shop, when the air raid warning starts wailing again, a boy assures his father: “I know where to hide.” They come up to buy chocolates; another man reaches out and gives them some money. “For sweets,” he says.",https://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english/19/1633597/head-to-the-shelter-these-are-your-lives-shopping-under-air-raid-sirens-in-ukraine
