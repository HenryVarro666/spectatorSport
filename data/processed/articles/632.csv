7:02 p.m.: The U.N. Security Council is due to vote on Friday on a Russian-drafted call for aid access and civilian protection in Ukraine, but diplomats say the measure is set to fail because it does not push for an end to the fighting or withdrawal of Russian troops. Russia put forward the text after France and Mexico withdrew their own push for a UNSC resolution on Ukraine's humanitarian situation because they said it would have been vetoed by Moscow, Reuters reported. They instead plan to put it to a vote in the 193-member General Assembly, where no country wields a veto.

And Ukraine’s foreign minister tweeted that a drama theater in the besieged southern port town of Mariupol, which was sheltering civilians, was destroyed.

2:15 p.m.: In Photos: Russia's Invasion of Ukraine, March 16, 2022

2:10 p.m.: Russia's defense ministry denied a report published by the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv on Wednesday that its forces had shot and killed 10 people waiting in line for bread in the Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, and said there were no Russian troops in the area, according to Reuters. The embassy did not say what evidence it had for the attack in a statement posted on its official Twitter site and its Facebook page. Ukraine's general prosecutor's office said it had opened an investigation into the alleged incident.

2:01 p.m. : Some of the three million Ukrainian refugees who have managed to escape the war are now moving beyond Poland and Eastern Europe to the farthest stretches of the continent. That includes Spain which is already home to a community of 100,000 Ukrainians. VOA’s Alfonso Beato in the Catalonia region has this story, narrated by Jon Spier.

1:52 p.m. : Pope Francis and the Russian Orthodox Church Patriarch Kirill spoke on the phone Wednesday about Ukraine and the need for a “just peace,” the Russian church said. This is the first known communication between the two leaders since the Kremlin’s invasion, The Associated Press reported.

The call was all the more remarkable because Francis and Kirill have only met once – at the Havana airport in 2016 – in what was then the first encounter between a pope and Russian patriarch in over 1,000 years.

Wednesday’s call came just hours after Francis evoked the specter of a “final catastrophe” of an atomic war that would extinguish humanity during his weekly general audience. While Francis didn’t reference Ukraine explicitly in that part of his speech, he did elsewhere call for prayers for Ukraine and for God to protect its children and forgive those who make war.

Francis’ long-term goal to improve relations with Kirill and avoid antagonizing the Russian Orthodox Church had explained his initially tepid response to the February 24 Russian invasion. He has since stepped up his denunciations, demanding “an end to the war.""

1:30 p.m. : The White House on Wednesday released a fact sheet detailing U.S. security assistance to Ukraine, including what will be done with the additional $800 million worth of assistance announced today.

1:20 p.m.: U.S. President Joe Biden spoke at the White House Wednesday, unveiling $800 million in new aid to Ukraine. This brings the total U.S. security assistance committed to Ukraine to $1 billion in just the past week, and a total of $2 billion since the start of the Biden Administration, according to an official statement. ""America is leading this effort, together with our allies and partners, providing an enormous level of security and humanitarian assistance that we're adding to today and we're going to continue to do more in the days and weeks ahead,"" Biden said. VOA White House Bureau Chief Patsy Widakuswara monitored his speech.



1:00 p.m.: U.S. President Joe Biden delivered remarks on the assistance the United States is providing to Ukraine. Watch his speech here.

12:37 p.m. : NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg briefed the media following an extraordinary meeting of alliance defense ministers in Brussels Wednesday, to discuss Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. He said NATO defense ministers “agreed that we must continue to provide significant support to Ukraine, including with military supplies, financial help and humanitarian aid.” He added that Russia’s president “must stop this war immediately” and “withdraw his forces now and engage in diplomacy in good faith.” VOA’s National Security correspondent Jeff Seldin tweeted the highlights.

12:10 p.m. : A few weeks ago, Nargiz Gurbanova was working as a criminal defense lawyer, but now she spends her days sheltering in a hospital basement as the Russian military bombards her city, Kharkiv, in eastern Ukraine. In an interview with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, she says she is now gathering evidence of war crimes.

11:51 a.m. : Ukraine’s president welcomed a ruling by the International Court of Justice Wednesday. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the ruling compels Russia to halt its military offensive in Ukraine.

11:49 a.m.: The International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordered Russia on Wednesday to stop the military actions it started in Ukraine on Feb. 24. ""The Russian Federation shall immediately suspend the military operations that it commenced on Feb 24, 2022 in the territory of Ukraine,"" the judges said. The judges added Russia must also ensure that other forces under its control or supported by Moscow should not continue the military operation. The ICJ also asked both Ukraine and Russia to “refrain from any action which might aggravate or extend the dispute before the Court or make it more difficult to resolve.”

11:39 a.m. : Taiwanese citizens and their government are sending donations to war-torn Ukraine as a show of extra sympathy, analysts say. They argue that many on the Asian Pacific island fear they could become the next place to be targeted by a major military power.

11:15 a.m.: Both Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress gave Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a standing ovation following an address he delivered via video link Wednesday.

VOA’s Yulia Yarmolenko interviewed Republican Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska after the speech, who said, “ We need to be doing more. The United States Congress was called on today and the United States government were called on today to act like a superpower and we should be doing more.”

“They need more weaponry.” Sasses said. “I think we've seen that the Ukrainians have great fighters, they have great courage and they have pilots. So they're willing to engage the battle directly.”

Asked about Zelenskyy’s request for a no-fly zone, Sasse said “NATO with 30 countries and complicated Article Five obligations has not made the decision to directly go to war with Russia at this time. And so that's why a no fly zone, I don't think is the central discussion.”

Sasse advocated giving Ukrainians “a lot more air power, we should be supplying the weaponry. And we know that the Ukrainians will supply the pilots and the fighters.” He said, “As long as they're willing to fight, we're willing to supply them. If something shoots, we should be giving it to the Ukrainians.”

10:51 a.m. Mykhailo Podolyak, an advisor to Ukraine’s president who is actively involved in negotiations with his Russian counterparts to end the conflict, on Wednesday said Ukraine’s model of security guarantees would entail “a rigid agreement with a number of guarantor states undertaking clear legal obligations to Ukraine.” Later Wednesday, he also tweeted a link to an interview with the PBS News Hour, in which he said he makes Ukraine’s position at the negotiations clear.

10:18 a.m.: International Criminal Court chief prosecutor Karim Khan visited Ukraine, Reuters reported Wednesday.

10:10 a.m.: U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke today with General Nikolay Patrushev, Secretary of the Russian Security Council, to reiterate the United States’ firm and clear opposition to Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine, according to a statement released by NSC Spokesperson Emily Horne. Sullivan told General Patrushev that if Russia is serious about diplomacy, then Moscow should stop attacking Ukrainian cities and towns. He also warned General Patrushev about the consequences and implications of any possible Russian decision to use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, the statement added.

10:07 a.m.: While embedded with Ukrainian troops, Current Time journalists Borys Sachalko and Ivan Lyubysh-Kirdey came under fire during a Russian artillery assault in the combat zone northwest of Kyiv. Current Time is a Russian-language TV and digital network led by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty in partnership with VOA.

9:30 a.m.: In a virtual address to the U.S. Congress Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy asked for more support to fight off the Russian invasion and proposed a new alliance of countries that would stand together against such aggression in the future, VOA News reported.



""Right now, the destiny of our country is being decided - whether our people will be free,"" Zelenskyy said, speaking to the lawmakers in Ukrainian. He said Ukrainians and Americans have much in common, especially a desire to live in freedom.



Zelenskyy also drew parallels between Japan's 1941 attack on the U.S. naval base in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, saying that Ukraine is experiencing the same kind of assault every day. He again asked for a no-fly zone over Ukraine, but added that if that was not possible, the U.S. supply more weapons to fight off the Russian attacks.

""I can say to each of you today, 'I have a need,'"" he said. Zelenskyy said he and Ukraine are grateful for everything the U.S. has done, and asked that the U.S. do more, including more sanctions against Russia. ""All American companies must leave the Russian market, because it is flooded with our blood,"" Zelenskyy said.

He also called for a new association of countries that would oppose aggression like the Russian invasion through economic sanctions and military support.

Zelenskyy’s speech follows similar addresses to Britain’s House of Commons, Canada’s Parliament and the European Parliament in recent weeks as he pushes for more military and humanitarian support from the international community.

9:03 a.m.: The American broadcasting agency FOX News says journalist Benjamin Hall is safe and out of Ukraine after the attack that killed 2 of his colleagues Monday, according to National Public Radio correspondent David Folkenflick.

8:54 a.m.: The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv sent this report on Twitter Wednesday.

8:44 a.m.: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has arrived in Saudi Arabia, according to state news agency SPA. Johnson is on a visit to the Gulf as part of efforts to secure more oil supplies and increase pressure on President Vladimir Putin over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reported.

8:34 a.m.: Ukraine has rejected Russian proposals that it adopt a neutral status, Agence France-Presse reported Wednesday. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that a ""compromise"" outcome would center on Ukraine becoming a neutral state comparable to Sweden and Austria. But Zelensky's office gave the idea short shrift. ""Ukraine is now in a direct state of war with Russia. Consequently, the model can only be 'Ukrainian' and only on legally verified security guarantees,"" Kyiv's negotiator Mikhailo Podolyak said.

8:22 a.m.: At the Gare de l’Est train station in Paris, French Red Cross workers greet newly arrived Ukrainian refugees as they step off trains and direct them to a makeshift welcome center that offers food and other assistance. “Most of them are exhausted,” says Elodie Esteve, of the French Red Cross. “We’re here to welcome them, to tell them it’s OK, that they’re safe, and to orient them depending on what they plan to do after.” VOA’s Lisa Bryant went to the station and has this report.

8:01 a.m.: Another mayor was reported to have been abducted by Russian forces in Ukraine on Wedensday. Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dymtro Kuleba said on Twitter that the mayor and deputy of the Ukrainian city of Skadovsk were kidnapped.

At least two other mayors have been seized recently by invading Russian military forces this week, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. The mayor of Dniprorudne was abducted March 13, and the mayor of Melitopol was marched out of city hall by Russian soldiers March 11.

7:52 a.m.: Human rights advocates are pushing U.S. administration officials to expedite the process of reuniting refugees with relatives in the U.S. During a White House briefing Tuesday, press secretary Jen Psaki said the administration is discussing the available options. VOA’s Immigration Correspondent Aline Barros has the story.

7:15 a.m.: VOA’s Eastern Europe Chief Myroslava Gongadze visited a warehouse in Poland managed by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). It serves as a humanitarian relief hub for many international organizations, according to Stephan Allen, the USAID Ukraine Crisis Disaster Assistance Response Team leader.

7:08 a.m.: Ukraine's Foreign Minister on Wednesday tweeted a message calling for ""deputinization"" -- in other words, for the world to cut all ties to Russia’s president Vladimir Putin, his administration and his policies, describing them as “toxic.”

6:47 a.m.: The Kremlin said on Wednesday that a demilitarized Ukraine with its own army along the lines of Austria or Sweden was being looked at as a possible compromise, Reuters reports.



""This is a variant that is currently being discussed and which could really be seen a compromise,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying by RIA news agency. The reference to demilitarization appeared to relate to the idea of neutral status for Ukraine.

Ukraine was promised by NATO as far back as 2008 that it would one day become a member of the alliance. Russia has said it cannot allow that to happen and cited it as part of the logic for what it calls its special military operation in Ukraine.

6:30 a.m.: Peter Maurer, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, has arrived in Kyiv on a five-day visit to Ukraine to urge for greater humanitarian access and protection of civilians, the organization said Wednesday.

“After enormous suffering by the civilian population and after our intensive virtual conversations with the Russian and Ukraine governments, I find it utterly important that we have person-to-person contacts, that we are able to go in-depth into the understanding of neutral, independent and impartial humanitarian work, and that our licence to operate in the country is fully understood by the authorities,” Maurer said in a statement.

“People in Ukraine are crying out for help. Needs are massive, conditions volatile. We are sparing no effort to answer their call,” Maurer later said in a Twitter post.

5:20 a.m.: NATO defense ministers gathered Wednesday to discuss what Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said would be both the “immediate consequences of Russia’s invasion” and long-term efforts to strengthen NATO’s collective defense.

“NATO has a responsibility to ensure that this crisis does not escalate beyond Ukraine, and that's also the reason why we have increased the presence in the eastern part of the alliance,” Stoltenberg told reporters. He has said potential actions could include placing “substantially more forces” in the eastern part of the alliance, along with increases in naval and air deployments, missile defense systems and holding larger and more frequent military exercises.

U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin highlighted support for Ukraine’s ability to defend itself as well as U.S. commitment to aid any NATO ally that comes under attack.

“I think our presence here sends a signal to the world that we remain united in our support of Ukraine, and we condemn Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion into Ukraine,” Austin said.

Russia has objected to NATO’s presence near its borders and sought a guarantee that Ukraine will never join the alliance. NATO insists countries are free to make their own decisions about security ties.

While Ukraine is not part of NATO, seven NATO countries share borders with Russia, Ukraine or Russian ally Belarus, and that proximity has raised concerns of a wider conflict.

Stoltenberg said there are 100,000 U.S. troops in Europe and another 40,000 troops under direct NATO command, as well as hundreds of thousands more on heightened alert across NATO nations.

4:30 a.m.: The Netherlands and other NATO countries will continue to deliver weapons to Ukraine even as these deliveries could become the target of Russian attacks, Dutch defense minister Kajsa Ollongren said on Wednesday.

“Ukraine has the right to defend itself, we will continue to support it,” Ollongren said at her arrival for a meeting with NATO defense ministers in Brussels, Reuters reported.

4:00 a.m.: VOA’s Yan Boechat documents life in Irpin and Kyiv as Russia’s military assault continues.

3:30 a.m.: Russia said on Tuesday it has written guarantees it can carry out its work as a party to the Iran nuclear deal, suggesting Moscow could allow a revival of the tattered 2015 pact to go forward.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov's comments appeared to signal Moscow may have backed off its previous view that Western sanctions imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine were an impediment to salvaging the nuclear deal, Reuters reports.

3:00 a.m.: The British Ministry of Defence said Wednesday that Russian troops are struggling to overcome challenges posed by Ukraine’s terrain. Russia’s advance has been confined to Ukraine’s roads and highways, the daily battleground intelligence report added.

The destruction of bridges by Ukranian forces has “played a key role in stalling Russia’s advance,” the report said.

“The tactics of the Ukrainian Armed Forces have adeptly exploited Russia’s lack of manoeuvre, frustrating the Russian advance and inflicting heavy losses on the invading forces.”

2:30 a.m.: Millions of Ukrainians have now fled their country, mostly to Poland, but also to Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and Moldova. In Hungary, there are reports of some Ukrainians deciding to turn back. Jon Spier narrates this report from Gabor Ancsin on Hungary’s border with Ukraine.

1:30 a.m.: As civilians in Ukraine bear the brunt of Russian artillery attacks, the White House announced that President Joe Biden will head to Brussels next week to coordinate deterrence and defense efforts with NATO allies. VOA’s Senior Diplomatic Correspondent Cindy Saine reports.

1:00 a.m.: In his latest Facebook address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy offered a more optimistic assessment of peace talks with Russia. He said the negotiations are starting to “sound more realistic, but time is still needed.”

The talks are scheduled to continue today. Ukrainian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak also said there is “room for compromise” while cautioning that “fundamental contradictions” continue to emerge during the talks.

Russia has repeatedly insisted that Ukraine concede the provinces of Donetsk, Luhansk and Crimea. It has also insisted that Ukraine renounce any intention of joining NATO, something Zelenskyy has appeared willing to do.

12:40 a.m.: A funeral ceremony was held in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv on Tuesday for four Ukrainian soldiers who lost their lives following the Russian invasion.

12:00 a.m.: U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed his condolences Tuesday to the journalists killed in Ukraine on Monday.

“I am grateful to all those risking their lives to show the world what is happening in Ukraine. The United States condemns Russia's ongoing violence, which is putting the safety of journalists and other media workers in Ukraine at risk.”

Journalists Pierre Zakrzewski and Oleksandra Kuvshynova were killed in an attack that also seriously injured Fox News correspondent Benjamin Hall.

U.S. broadcaster Fox News on Tuesday announced that cameraman Zakrzewski had died in Ukraine. Kuvshynova, a 24-year-old Ukrainian journalist, also was killed in the same attack.

Control of an investment company linked to sanctioned oligarch Roman Abramovich shifted to one of his close business associates the day Russia invaded Ukraine, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Ownership of the company, Norma Investments, was transferred on February 24 to David Davidovich, who has frequently invested in companies with Abramovich, The Journal said Tuesday. Forbes once described Davidovich as ""Abramovich's much lower-profile right-hand man.""

Multiple sources have linked Abramovich to Norma. A 2020 filing by London-listed AFC Energy, seen by Insider, names Abramovich as one of its shareholders ""through Norma Investments."" Pitchbook lists the billionaire as the only executive on Norma's investing team.

The Journal said Tuesday that corporate disclosures dating back several years identified Abramovich as being in control of Norma.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appealed directly to Russian troops in an address on Tuesday.

""On behalf of the Ukrainian people, I give you a chance, a chance to survive,"" he said in an address to Russian troops, according to a translation provided on the video. ""If you surrender to our forces, we will treat you the way people are supposed to be treated — as people.""

""In a way you were not treated in your army. And in a way your army does not treat ours,"" he added.

Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24. In the weeks since, Russian forces have shelled towns across the eastern European country.

Russia's reliance on 'humanitarian corridors' in Ukraine comes from its playbook in Syria, experts say

A crater caused by Russian bombing outside the maternity hospital in Mariupol, Ukraine. Associated Press

Russia is touting its ""humanitarian corridors"" in Ukraine as evidence it does not wish to wage war on Ukraine's civilian population. But experts familiar with its use of such corridors in Syria — and those observing their implementation today in Ukraine — say that Moscow is only using them as a deceitful accessory with the aim of gaining ground in its war against Ukraine.

Ukraine's deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Tuesday that at least 9 humanitarian corridors were opened in conjunction with Russia, with 150,000 civilians escaping areas like Mariupol, Kyiv and Sumy.

But the news comes in the backdrop of the Ukrainian government and Ukrainian NGO leaders repeatedly accusing Russian forces of shelling humanitarian corridors, laying landmines along them and generally disrupting the safe passage of aid workers and medical supplies.

Oleksandra Matviychuk, chair of the Center for Civil Liberties, a Ukrainian humanitarian NGO founded in 2007, is still based in the country. She told Insider that much of her group's day-to-day work involves coordinating which corridors are open — and having volunteers monitor them to see if they can actually evacuate people safely.

Putin thought Russia's military could capture Kyiv in 2 days, but it still hasn't in 20

Russian President Vladimir Putin summons meeting of Russia's Security Council at Kremlin in Moscow, Russia on February 21, 2022. Kremlin Press Office/Handout/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images

When Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an invasion on February 24, he expected a swift and decisive victory, seeming to believe his own propaganda about the strength of his armed forces and people's willingness to fight for a country, Ukraine, that he has defined as an integral part of his own.

Within minutes of his televised war declaration, explosions were reported across Ukraine — including in the capital city, Kyiv, home to nearly 3 million people.

CIA Director Bill Burns told lawmakers last week that Putin's strategy for the war was centered on ""seizing Kyiv within the first two days of the campaign."" US intelligence likewise assessed that the city could fall soon after the invasion.

It has now been roughly three weeks. Instead of quickly conquering Ukraine, the Russian military made strategic mistakes — failing to take out the country's air defenses; deploying tens of thousands of troops without adequate supply lines — and were met by a steadfast Ukrainian resistance that was underestimated by Washington and Moscow alike.

Workers being held hostage by Russian forces at the site of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in northern Ukraine have been blaring the Ukrainian national anthem every morning in defiance of their captors, The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday.

More than 200 staffers at the plant have been held there at gunpoint to complete around-the-clock routine tasks since Russian forces seized control of the site on the first day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine nearly three weeks ago.

The poorly-fed technicians and support staff — some of whom need medicine — are battling immense exhaustion after spending roughly 500 hours since February 23 on the job at the site of the world's worst nuclear-power disaster, according to the Journal.

But workers have started to defy their captors.

An editor at a Russian state TV channel who staged a protest during a live broadcast said she went without sleep for two days while police detained her.

Her fine amounts to $273 and is for a prerecorded video explaining her reasoning for the demonstration, not the on-air interruption itself, according to The New York Times, which cited Sergey Badamshin, the chairman of a Moscow bar association.

Her demonstration, if considered ""false information,"" could cost her up to 15 years in prison per a new Russian wartime censorship law that prevents media from calling the war ""a war"" — which goes against the Kremlin's dubious portrayal of its invasion of Ukraine, according to The Times.

Zelenskyy says Ukraine 'must admit' it won't join NATO and its people must 'rely on themselves and our partners who help us'

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addresses nation in Kyiv, Ukraine on February 25, 2022. Ukrainian Presidential Press Office via AP

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country ""must admit"" that it won't join NATO.

""It is clear that Ukraine is not a member of NATO, we understand that, we are adequate people,"" Zelenskyy said in a meeting with leaders of the Joint Expeditionary Force.

""For years we have heard about the supposedly open door, but we have also heard [lately] that we should not enter, and this is true and we must admit it,"" he said of Ukraine's attempts to join NATO, which started as early as 2008.

Zelenskyy said, however, that security guarantees from NATO allies would be necessary to keep Ukraine safe amid Russia's invasion of the eastern European country.

'Fear': Ukrainians from Zaporizhzhia, where Russia attacked a nuclear plant, faced a harrowing journey to Poland

LUBLIN, Poland — It took Katerina Kompaniets and the seven family members traveling with her over a week to get from Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine to safety across the border in Poland. Normally, that journey takes roughly 15 to 16 hours by car.

At one point, a train they were traveling on from Zaporizhzhi to Lviv, in western Ukraine, was stopped due to an air raid alarm. The power was shut off. They were packed into a train car with roughly 250 people, all of them worrying it could be targeted by a Russian airstrike. When asked what was going through her head during that tense moment, Kompaniets offered a one-word response: ""Fear."" She and her family spoke to Insider from Lublin's main train station on Friday, which has become one of many transit hubs for Ukrainians fleeing the war, where they were hoping to move on to Germany.

Russia's unprovoked war in Ukraine has made travel in the country a harrowing, potentially life-threatening ordeal. More than 2.5 million Ukrainians have left their country — by foot, train, bus, and car — since the war began in late February. A lot of Ukrainians fleeing into Poland have traveled for 24 hours or more, and have to wait for hours at the border before crossing, after already experiencing a hellish situation in their home cities and towns.

Energoatom, Ukraine's state nuclear energy company, said in a Telegram statement that 11 representatives of Rosatom, Russia's state atomic energy corporation, were at the nuclear plant when the explosions were reported.

""It is obvious that the detonation of ammunition on the site of the station is carried out with their direct participation,"" Energoatom wrote in the statement. ""So it turns out that Rosatom is also involved in this terrorism.""

Energoatom added: ""All established international rules and requirements for nuclear and radiation safety are violated by this company.""

Russia may be cut off from the world's lender of last resort as bonds head toward default

As Russia sits on the brink of default, the world's top economies have vowed to prevent it from tapping emergency funding that was used in a prior debt crisis.

On Friday, G7 nations pledged to cut off Moscow's access to lenders like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as Russia ramps up its assault on Ukraine.

""Russia cannot grossly violate international law and expect to benefit from being part of the international economic order,"" according to a statement from the US, Canada, Britain, Germany, France, Italy, and Japan, who also pledged to curtail its international trade with the West.

Sources of emergency funding were key during a previous Russian currency and debt crisis. The government received a $22.5 billion bailout from the IMF and other lenders in 1998 as it defaulted on sovereign debt.

Now, the effort to block IMF and World Bank funding comes as Russia suffers another debt crisis after sanctions froze Moscow's foreign currency and gold reserves.

Russia must make a $117 million debt payment Wednesday on two dollar-denominated bonds. But the finance ministry has said its sovereign bond payments depend on Western sanctions, and if it does pay — it'll do so in rubles.

He went on to claim that pregnant women pictured bloodied and injured after Russia bombed a maternity hospital in Mariupol, Ukraine, on March 10 were ""crisis actors,"" playing the part of victims in an elaborate plot to frame Russia.

Exiled Russian oligarch says blocking all Putin's bankers and sanctioning all oligarchs is the 'only thing' that will stop Russia's invasion of Ukraine

Matej Divizna/Getty Images

An exiled Russian oligarch who was once the country's richest person says the West needs to block all of President Vladimir Putin's bankers and that sanctions need to be extended to every oligarch to deter Russia from continuing to invade Ukraine.

""That's the only thing that will stop the war,"" Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the former CEO of the Russian oil giant Yukos and an outspoken critic of the Kremlin, told CNN.

Western countries and trade blocs have placed heavy financial sanctions on Russia after Putin sent troops to attack Ukraine. The measures include banning transactions with Russia's central bank, cutting off some Russian banks' access to the SWIFT international payments system, blocking the trade of luxury goods, and freezing assets of Putin, other Kremlin leaders, and individual oligarchs.

The sanctions are intended to hobble Russia's economy and cut off funding to its military and have so far sent the ruble to a record low and contributed to soaring inflation. But some critics say the sanctions haven't gone far enough because they haven't persuaded Putin to call off the invasion.

""The blow to the financial system has been enormous,"" Khodorkovsky told CNN. ""But at the moment, only 70% of the cash flows have been blocked.""

""I've never advocated sanctions against Russia as a whole, but the financial flows need to stop,"" Khodorkovsky said.

A no-fly zone wouldn't have prevented Russian missiles attack on Ukrainian military training base near Polish border, Pentagon press secretary says

Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby. Alex Brandon/AP

Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said on Sunday imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine would not have prevented Russian forces from striking a Ukrainian military training base.

Russian soldiers fired more than 30 rockets at the International Peacekeeping and Security Center (IPSC), also called the Yavoriv Military Range, Lviv regional governor Maksym Kozytsky said. At least 35 people were killed according to the regional governor, per the Spectator Index.

A ""no-fly zone has a nice air policing kind of sound to it, but I participated in one as a young officer on an aircraft carrier way back in the early 90s,"" he said on ABC's ""This Week."" ""It is combat. You have to be willing to shoot and to be shot at. President Biden has made it clear that US troops are not going to be fighting in Ukraine.""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called on Western leaders to impose a no-fly zone. But NATO said implementing a no-fly zone would escalate the Ukraine-Russia conflict into ""a full-fledged war in Europe, involving many more countries and causing much more human suffering.""

The attack in Lviv marks the third strike in western Ukraine, Kirby said.

""This is the third now facility or airfield that the Russians have struck in Western Ukraine in just the last couple of days, so clearly, at least from an airstrike perspective, they're broadening their target sets,"" he said.

Two superyachts belonging to the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich were seen headed east after the UK hit the billionaire with sanctions on Thursday.

The sanctions frozen Abramovich's assets, meaning his yachts and private jets are at risk of seizure.

Abramovich's 460-foot vessel, Solaris, was located just off the east coast of Italy on Friday, according to ship-tracking site Marine Traffic. It had left a shipyard in Barcelona, Spain, on Tuesday, where it had been docked since late 2021 for repairs.

Meanwhile, Abramovich's 533-foot yacht, Eclipse, has been cruising eastwards from St. Martin in the Caribbean since February 21, Marine Traffic data shows. The boat was located near the west coast of Africa on Friday, Marine Traffic said.

It is not clear where they are headed. The two superyachts cost about $1.3 billion combined.

Analysis: Russia's struggling military is leaving Putin with only terrifying options in Ukraine

Two weeks after Russia's authoritarian president ordered an invasion, Ukraine continues to hold its largest cities.

But there are growing signs that Europe's biggest land war since 1945 is entering a much more deadly phase as battle nears major cities.

Russian forces appear to be regrouping amid an attempt to get a stranglehold on the country's capitol of Kyiv. Experts increasingly believe Putin's military, once regarded as among the world's most powerful, in fact lacks the troop strength and combat effectiveness to seize and control Kyiv, one of Europe's largest cities, let alone the entire country against the strong resistance Ukraine is mounting.

That leaves Russia's strongman with fraught options: Retreat, suffer heavy losses in urban fighting, or resort to total destruction.

The strategic city of Dnipro was hit by airstrikes on Friday for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine, Ukrainian officials said.

The city suffered three airstrikes from about 6:10 a.m. local time, which hit a kindergarten, an apartment building near the kindergarten, and a shoe factory, the State Emergency Service of Ukraine reported.

At least one person has died, the service said.

Footage showed firefighters working to extinguish a massive fire at one of the buildings.

The Dnieper River is a key river that runs from Russia through Belarus and Ukraine to the Black Sea.

The cities of Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk were also hit on Friday.

Russian forces also launched a long-range attack on two military airfields in the two cities on Friday and crippled them, a Russian defense ministry spokesman said, Reuters reported.

Putin says Russia will help 'volunteers' wanting to help fight Ukraine

President Vladimir Putin said in a Friday meeting with his security council that Russia would welcome ""volunteers"" who want to help fight Ukraine and help them enter the country.

""If you see people who want — on a voluntary basis, especially not for money — to come and help people living in the Donbas — well, you need to cooperate with them and help them move to the war zone,"" Putin said, according to the state-run Sputnik news agency.

Sergei Shoigu, Russia's defense minister, said 16,000 people had volunteered to help Russia fight. Many of them were from the Middle East, he said. Insider has not been able to independently verify that claim.

Putin also approved a plan to send western-made weapons that were seized in Ukraine to the country's separatist Donetsk and Luhansk regions, Sputnik reported.

Russia recognized the pro-Russian, Ukrainian territories of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states on February 21, giving it a pretext to invade Ukraine. Russia has since claimed that it was in Ukraine to defend those territories.

Both US and UK officials said that Russian forces are getting closer to Kyiv.

""Russia is likely seeking to reset and re-posture its forces for renewed offensive activity in the coming days. This will probably include operations against the capital Kyiv,"" the UK Ministry of Defence said in a Friday morning update.

The ministry said, however, that it ""remains highly unlikely"" that Russia had achieved its objectives in Ukraine, and that its forces on the ground ""continue to make limited progress.""

Similarly, a US defense official told reporters on Thursday that Russian forces had moved three miles closer to Kyiv in the 24 hours prior, and that they could be as close as nine miles from the city center.

Russia said it could seize the assets of foreign companies that leave the country as sweeping sanctions and a corporate exodus cripple its economy.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said the Kremlin is trying to find ""legal solutions"" to take over the foreign assets of international companies that are pulling out of its market, the Financial Times reported.

At a meeting on Thursday, Putin told government officials the Kremlin would seek to ""introduce external management and then transfer these enterprises to those who actually want to work,"" according to the Guardian.

""With regards to those who are planning to close their production facilities, we must act decisively . . . By no means must we allow any harm to local Russian suppliers,"" said Putin, according to the FT.

A Ukrainian beauty influencer has been attacked online after Russia falsely claimed she was a crisis actor in Wednesday's bombing of a maternity hospital in Mariupol.

Marianna Podgurskaya had been named in a series of tweets by the Russian Embassy in the UK on Thursday after a picture of her fleeing with blood on her face made headlines worldwide.

The embassy claimed that the blogger was wearing ""some very realistic make-up"" and denied that she had been in the hospital at the time of the strike. It also claimed — without providing evidence — that the hospital had been ""long non-operational"" and was being used by a ""neo-Nazi"" Ukrainian military force.

Twitter has since removed the embassy's posts for violating the platform's Abusive Behavior policy.

Russia continued its bombardment of the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol on Thursday following a Wednesday airstrike that killed three people at a maternity hospital.

Civilians trapped inside the city searched for food and fuel, according to The Associated Press. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy slammed Russia for refusing to allow civilian evacuations out of the city, calling the move ""outright terror.""

More than 1,300 people have died thus far during Russia's 10-day siege on the city, according to Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk.

Many of the city's 430,000 residents lack heat, phone service, and electricity, The AP reported, as nighttime temperatures drop below freezing.

The outlet reported that mass graves are full of bodies throughout the city while burned-out cars and broken glass line the streets. A black market for vegetables is reportedly operating throughout the city as grocery stores were cleared out days ago.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned on Thursday that Russia may deploy chemical weapons in Ukraine.

""I'll make you one other prediction, by the way, which is that the stuff that you're hearing about chemical weapons, is straight out of their playbook,"" Johnson told Sky News' Beth Rigby.

""They start saying that there are chemical weapons that have been stored by their opponents or by the Americans,"" he added. ""And so when they themselves deploy chemical weapons, as I fear they may, they have as a sort of a maskirovka, a fake story ready to go.""

The number includes 1.8 million Ukrainians who are currently in Poland, with 300,000 having moved onto Western Europe.

It comes as Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday said Ukraine must recognise it will never join Nato.

The Ukrainian president’s comments sparked speculation that he could be laying the groundwork for a peace deal with Moscow, which wants Kyiv barred from joining the alliance.

""Ukraine is not a member of Nato. We understand that. We have heard for years that the doors were open, but we also heard that we could not join. It's a truth and it must be recognised,"" Zelensky said during a video conference with military officials.

He said Nato was the ""strongest alliance in the world"" - but ""some of the members of this alliance are hypnotised by Russian aggression"".

Russia has long demanded that its neighbour never be allowed to join the alliance, and the Kremlin said last week the war would end ""in a moment"" if Kyiv agreed, and recognised Russian control of Crimea and separatist-held areas.

8,ea5f5364-3a23-4084-ab11-c3fb0363fef1,['Karol Kamiński'],2022-03-17 10:14:46+00:00,"Philadelphia based A YEAR WITHOUT WORDS recently made their debut with driving, emotional single “Baby Kittens and Stressful Soda”, currently available on all popular streaming platforms (Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube, Bandcamp), and they just premiered their new track “Oxygen Mask”, available for streaming above.

The band features Chris Smith (Lead Vocals, Guitar), Mark Alkis (Bass), Brandon Weiss (Drums & Synths), & Nick Abrams (Guitar). We sat down with the band to give us some more details about their work, comment on both debut singles and their local alt music scene around Philly, DC and New York.

Most of the band members played in DIY local bands for most of their lives, in and around the same area.

“We all also have extensive production, engineering and performing backgrounds.” – says Chris. “So when writing material at the beginning of 2020, I decided I wanted to build a band and perform in Philadelphia, supporting local acts looking to go full time, or supporting touring acts as dependable local friends. Armed with a dozen or so songs, I began looking around for musicians who would fit a specific criterion: capable musicians, willing to play to their strengths and “carry the load” so to speak in terms of all the individual aspects of a local, unsigned, DIY band. That led to meeting Mark.”

Sonically, Chris admits that they are all gear heads, which can be a contradiction sometimes.

“For example, we all love the cleanest heaviest kick drum and snare, love the models for bass and guitars these days, but we’d 100% jump at the chance to record say to tape with vintage gear, I mean who wouldn’t? So as far as our “sound” it’s probably always going to serve as a type of soundtrack for the lyrics I write. It literally took a pandemic for me to start approaching the laundry list of traumas in my life, emerging from a 20 plus year of “music-only” composing, and diving headfirst into writing and singing. All of my words deal with relationships, sometimes from person to lover, from sibling to sibling, from child to parent. In every band I’ve ever played in, I’ve been the principle music composer, and this is the first time in my life where the alignment in sound and intention is, like a total eclipse.”

Track by track commentary:

Baby Kittens and Stressful Soda

When the band formed, it was a vehicle for my content performed live. The initial meets of the members invoked a “maybe someday we’ll write together, who knows.” Well it turns out that not only is everyone a multi-instrumentalist, but everyone has ideas as well. In addition to being a fantastic engineer and our resident gear head (legit he built our amps) Mark is also a phenomenal music composer, walking tight lines between jangles and rock, emo and hardcore. The entirety of the music of Baby kittens arrived in my inbox one morning, and I want to say in about 120 minutes the words and melodies were written and tracked. Lyrically, the song is about the dissolution of a relationship between biological family members, and the narrators attempt to heal.

Oxygen Mask

Only the second song I’ve written in my life, this track is entirely about my relationship with my father. I have always felt something lacking about the music I’ve made, and Oxygen Mask exemplifies our sound in so many ways. The huge guitars, the big drums, the escalating intensity of the singing, the three part harmonies, and a tempo change breakdown, with screaming and a guitar solo. The tune I’ve been singing my whole life.

Growing up near Philadelphia, NYC and DC, A YEAR WITHOUT WORDS are familiar playing in bars, clubs, venues all up and down the east coast of the US

“Once one of us played a lymphoma charity on the top deck of the Moshulu, a boat harbored in Penn’s Landing.” – continues Chris.

“We’ve watched the Roots leave for London and become world famous and meet people from different countries who would know our venues from dvds or pre-YouTube videos filmed at the electric factory or the Trocadero (Rest In Peace). Every year Philadelphia hosts a huge charity concert on the steps of the art museum, with the entire parkway shutdown, something like 40 thousand people. Our live jazz scene is enormous, our busking second only to the NYC subway jams, and Northeast Philadelphia boasts some of the most powerful and conscious young voices in a generation. Our city’s soul sings a song, and it is beautiful, powerful, painful, resonant.”

“Acknowledging this pain and healing are very tough and very different processes, and coupled with the pandemic and the violence around the world, it feels sometimes like our ability to cope is at capacity. This project, while begun as a way to “yell in peoples faces, but in a socially acceptable way” continues to evolve as we do, possibly helping us cope in stronger ways, but also hopefully allowing us to connect further with people we don’t know, with different obstacles and backgrounds, and learn more about how we fit into the larger picture of society. We’d love to say that we just want our music to help folks the way its helped us, a goal we feel expressly achievable.”

“Covid 19 has impacted every industry, and some of those which overlap with live local music or some of the more accessibly DIY-ey aspects of up-and-coming bands had to turn to technology for “live in studio sessions”, sometimes more endearing due to the lo quality nature of the webcam or microphone.”

“Some busked on Facebook, others on RPAN, and anyone with an HBO Max subscription could see our suburb of DELCO, where shouting mothers and scrapple on egg sandwiches rule supreme.

I believe there will arise new stewards, both taking over for older or lost gathering places and assisting those such places in evolving the “Scene” to something that is a little more inclusive while being a little less dangerous. Hopefully a little more consent focused and a lot more grateful. Grateful for all the energy and effort it takes for four or five musicians to deal with their shit enough to work a job to pay the bills to have health insurance to not be in the worst pain or die so they can be able to meet up and write music and plug in somewhere downtown after requesting the day off from four different jobs to bring all your most expensive musical instruments in all of your 2000 pound earth polluting machines to cram into the corner of the room behind the bar and scream your lungs out about your relationship to your parents to the drunken ears of maybe our partners and lucky few friends who were able to get off from their shitty jobs or cared about us that much that they prioritized being there.”

“That’s why a year without words exist. Because doing all that is hard. And those efforts should be seen and heard.”

Lastly, we asked the band about some new music recommendations and their top tips for bands worth a check this year.

Kicking off with their friend’s music: Tangled Up, Petrol, King Eli, Time, Sleep In, Desoto Jones, Here/Now, June Divided, the band is currently blasting Meet me at the Altar, Illuminati Hotties, Hot Mulligan, and “any number of jangle guitar, one person shouting 6 feet away from the mic bands.”

“Supremely love a Japanese band called Sakanaction, and eagerly await their new releases.” – continues Chris. “Also loves Hulst and Dvorak and Copland, and the theme songs for Super Sentai’s. Chojin Sentai Jetman is a fkn banger.”",https://idioteq.com/post-hardcore-tinged-rockers-a-year-without-words-streaming-debut-singles/
