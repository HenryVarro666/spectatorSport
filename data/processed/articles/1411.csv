All this happened yesterday.

Russians' attack on ZNPP

At night, the Russians fired on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, resulting in a fire in the building of the training center. For a long time, rescuers couldn't enter the ZNPP territory to put out the fire. There have been several conflicting allegations of enemy shelling of the unit.

At around 6 am, rescuers managed to enter the ZNPP territory and put out the fire. However, ZNPP, unfortunately, was captured by Russian troops.

After the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate announced this, a video appeared where the mayor of Enerhodar, lowering his eyes, said that the fire was extinguished at the station, there were no civilian casualties, and urged city residents not to provoke the Russian military. Energoatom has already stated that the appeal was ""recorded under the barrel of a machine gun."" It can be seen that the official reads the text from the paper and looks unnatural.

The attack on the Zaporizhzhia NPP was another reason for Zelenskyy to appeal to the world community to close the skies over Ukraine. Zelenskyy also spoke with US President Biden at night, during the shelling of ZNPP.
