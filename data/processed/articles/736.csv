An adviser to the mayor of Mariupol has said officials in the besieged Ukrainian city are struggling to find out exactly how many people survived after an art school was bombed by Russian forces on Sunday morning.

“So far, there is no exact operational data on how many people were hiding in the shelter or the number of casualties,” Petro Andrushenko said in a social media post. “I expect we will have it later today. But the situation is difficult and there is nowhere to get the data from.”

Earlier, the city council said the building was acting as a shelter for an estimated 400 people.

The information black hole reflects a similar lack of clarity about how many people survived an attack four days ago on a theater in Mariupol that was also being used as a shelter, possibly for up to 1,300 people.

The number of people reported to have survived that bombing — put at 130 — has been unchanged for several days.

It is indicative of the almost total collapse of basic services and communications in a city that is increasingly bearing the brunt of Russia’s fierce assault on the country.

“The city continues to be shelled both from the sky and the sea,” Andrushenko wrote on his Telegram channel Sunday. “It seems the occupiers are so eager to wipe out Mariupol that they are ready to cover themselves with fire.”

Four of the seven established humanitarian corridors out of Mariupol were operational on Sunday, according to Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk, and almost 7,300 people were evacuated.

Among them, 3,900 people were evacuated by buses and private transport from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia.

Ukraine government and city officials rejected a call by the Russian Ministry of Defense for Mariupol authorities to surrender the city to Russian forces by 5 a.m. local time Monday, a move reported by the Russian state media outlet, RIA Novosti.

“There can be no discussion of any surrender or of laying down arms,” said Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Irina Vereshchuk in an interview late Sunday.

“I have already informed the Russian side about it. I wrote: ‘Instead of wasting your time to write an 8-page letter — open the corridor,'” Vereshchuk said, adding Ukraine has informed the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross and is “awaiting a response from the international community. This is a conscious manipulation and true hostage taking.”

Russia was offering to open humanitarian corridors to the city by 10 a.m. Monday and “wants to receive a written response from Kiev to these proposals before 5:00,” RIA Novosti reported, citing the head of Russia’s National Center for Defense Management, Colonel-General Mikhail Mizintsev.

“From 10 am to 12 o’clock – for all armed units of Ukraine and foreign mercenaries is a temporary suspension of fighting along the route agreed with Ukraine. From 12 o’clock, there will be a simultaneous passage of humanitarian convoys with food, medicine and basic necessities,” Mizintsev said, according to the report.

Andrushenko said people trying to flee the city in their cars were being shot at by Russian forces.

“Evacuation is difficult — difficult but moving. The Russians are doing everything to complicate things. Last night, cars trying to drive towards the village of Melekine [6 miles west of the city center] were fired upon.”

Other residents looking to flee were having their cars seized from them at a checkpoint just outside Mariupol, he said.

Meanwhile, Mariupol City Council said in a statement on Saturday night that residents of the city were being taken to Russian territories against their will by Russian forces.

“Over the past week, several thousand Mariupol residents have been taken to Russian territory. The occupiers illegally took people from the Livoberezhny district and from the shelter in the sports club building, where more than a thousand people (mostly women and children) were hiding from the constant bombing,” the statement read.

According to Colonel-General Mizintsev almost 60,000 residents of Mariupol “found themselves in Russia in complete safety,” RIA Novosti reported.

The city council said captured Mariupol residents were taken to camps where Russian forces checked their phones and documents, then redirected some of the residents to remote cities in Russia — adding that the “fate of the others is unknown.”

The statement quoted Mariupol mayor Vadym Boichenko saying, “What the occupiers are doing today is familiar to the older generation, who saw the horrific events of World War II, when the Nazis forcibly captured people.”

Oleg Nikolenko, Ukraine’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson, called Russia’s action’s in Mariupol on Sunday a “chapter from WWII.”

“First they came to destroy the cities, bombing hospitals, theaters, schools, and shelters, killing civilians and children. Then they forcibly relocated the scared, exhausted people to the invader’s land. A chapter from WWII? No — the actions of the Russian army, today in Mariupol,” Nikolenko tweeted.

Three weeks of fighting have left much of Mariupol in ruins, with shopping centers, apartment blocks and infrastructure all severely damaged. Local officials estimate 80% of properties are damaged.

Two children were killed in the town of Rubizhne after being pulled from the rubble of a residential building pummeled by Russian artillery fire, the emergency services said.

A woman also died in the same building collapse; her daughter survived and was in a stable condition.

Some context: Rubizhne is part of a cluster of small towns and villages that remain in Ukrainian hands but lie close to two breakaway pro-Russian statelets inside eastern Ukraine.

The Ukrainian army’s most recent assessment of the war makes clear they are seen as a current focus of Russia’s campaign in the east — to link the two strongholds around Luhansk and Donetsk with territorial gains made to the northwest in the region around Kharkiv.

Saturday’s daily update from the army’s central command — released in the early afternoon — reported a series of Russian offensives with “the main efforts focused on attempts to capture Severodonetsk, Rubizhne and Popasna.”

Further deaths and destruction: On Friday, four people were killed and ten others injured as Russian artillery opened up across a series of communities in the region, local Ukrainian authorities said.

Regional head Serhii Haidai said a total of 54 buildings had been hit, including 19 apartment blocks and two health care centers.

Some 23 towns and villages were without gas supplies and 26 were without electricity by the day’s end.

Many of those wounded in recent days were among 700 people evacuated through a humanitarian corridor on Saturday, Haidai reported.",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-20-22/h_a84fdfb3986857201c6b82aa85041251

On Saturday, March 19, the Russian military dropped bombs on art school No. 12 in the Livoberezhny district of the city, where about 400 citizens were in the shelter, the City Council has reported.

""Yesterday, Russian invaders dropped bombs on art school No. 12 in the Livoberezhny district of Mariupol, where about 400 Mariupol residents were hiding – women, children and the elderly,"" the city council said on the Telegram channel.

The city council said that the building was destroyed, and civilians are still under the rubble.

5,7d0a6fa6-f75b-4d8b-973c-69f903f16253,['Carla Babb'],,"Russia has given Ukraine until the early hours of Monday to surrender the besieged city of Mariupol, as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he is ready for peace negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

However, a short time later, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Irina Vereshchuk rejected the ultimatum. “There can be no talk of any surrender, laying down of arms. We have already informed the Russian side about this,” she told the news outlet Ukrainian Pravda.

According to a Russian state news agency RIA, Russia’s defense ministry wanted a response from Ukraine’s military by 5 a.m. Moscow time/4 a.m. in Kyiv (0200 GMT). Moscow referred to refusing to surrender as siding with “bandits.”

The ultimatum came hours after Zelenskyy told CNN’s Fareed Zakaria in an interview broadcast Sunday that failure to reach a negotiated agreement with Russia “would mean that this is a third World War.”

Zelenskyy has called for comprehensive peace talks with Moscow that restore the territorial integrity and provide justice for Ukraine. Russia's lead negotiator has said in recent days the sides have moved closer to agreement on the issue of Ukraine dropping its bid to join NATO and adopting neutral status.

Zelenskyy told CNN that Russian forces entered Ukraine “to exterminate us, to kill us,” but he vowed that Ukraine would not concede its sovereignty or its integrity.

“Russians have killed our children. You cannot reverse the situation anymore. You cannot demand from Ukraine to recognize some territories as independent republics. These compromises are simply wrong,” said Zelenskyy.

Mariupol

A Mariupol art school where about 400 people had found shelter was bombed by Russian forces early Sunday.

Mariupol’s city council said that the building was destroyed in the attack. Information about survivors was not immediately available.

U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told CBS’s “Face the Nation” that he thinks Russian forces are resorting to these brutal civilian attacks because its military “campaign is stalled.”

“This is really disgusting,” Austin said.

Just a few days earlier a Russian airstrike targeted a theater where hundreds of people had been sheltering. The word “CHILDREN” had been written in Russian in big letters visible from the sky on the ground just outside the theater, to alert Russian forces of who was inside.

More than 100 have been rescued from the theater, and it is still unclear how many casualties and fatalities the attack caused.

The city continues to resist Russian military forces, who are having to engage in attrition tactics and urban fighting that requires going from building to building.

""Mariupol has not yet fallen. It is out of food, fuel, water, everything except for heart. They are still fighting very hard,” retired Gen. David Petraeus told CNN Sunday.

Thousands of residents of Mariupol have been forcibly taken from their homes to Russian territory, according to a Mariupol city council statement on its Telegram channel.

""The occupiers illegally took people from the Livoberezhny district and from the shelter in the sports club building, where more than a thousand people (mostly women and children) were hiding from the constant bombing,"" the statement said.

""What the occupiers are doing today is familiar to the older generation, who saw the horrific events of World War II, when the Nazis forcibly captured people,"" Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko said.

Russia still stalled

Austin said that Russian forces across the country have been ineffective as Ukrainian forces continue to attrit Russian troops with weapons provided by the U.S. and NATO allies.

“It’s had the effect of him (Putin) moving his forces into a woodchipper,” Austin told CBS.

U.S. officials have estimated that Ukrainians have killed more than 3,000 Russian troops since the invasion began.

At least five of those have been senior Russian officers, according to the Ukrainian government.

Petraeus said Sunday at least four of the five Russian generals’ deaths “are absolutely confirmed,” adding that Ukrainian snipers “have just been picking them off left and right.”

Russian troops have failed to seize control of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, a major objective of the Kremlin, even as the invasion enters its fourth week.

Ukraine’s National Police said in a statement Saturday on Telegram that Russia was attacking the northwestern suburbs of Kyiv, while the regional Kyiv government reported the city of Slavutych, north of Kyiv was “completely isolated.”

Mykolaiv

Meanwhile, officials in Ukraine have yet to release the death toll following a Russian missile attack Friday on a military base where soldiers were sleeping in barracks, now destroyed, in the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv.

One soldier told AFP that 50 bodies have been found, while another said there could be as many as 100 dead under the rubble.

Mykolaiv is located 130 kilometers from the strategic military port of Odesa.

Russia said Saturday that its hypersonic missiles had destroyed an underground depot for missiles and ammunition Friday in Ukraine’s western Ivano-Frankivsk region. Russian news agencies said it was the first time it used the advanced weapons system in Ukraine since it invaded February 24.

U.S Defense Secretary Austin said Sunday he could not confirm or dispute whether Russia had used those types of weapons in Ukraine but added he would not see it as a gamechanger if they had.

A Ukrainian air force representative verified the attack in the Ivano-Frankivsk region, but said Ukraine had no information on the type of missiles used.

Meanwhile, neighboring Slovakia’s defense minister said Sunday that Patriot air defense systems started arriving in Slovakia from NATO partner countries.

The systems will be operated by German and Dutch troops to help reinforce the defense of NATO's eastern flank, in a move prompted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The United Nations human rights office (OHCHR) reports that at least 902 civilians have been killed and upward of 1,459 have been wounded as of Saturday, while warning the actual count likely is higher. Most of the deaths were from explosions caused by shelling from heavy artillery and multiple missiles and airstrikes, OHCHR said. The Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office said 112 of those killed were children.

Millions of people have fled their homes since the Russian invasion. “The war in Ukraine is so devastating that 10 million have fled — either displaced inside the country, or as refugees abroad,” U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grande tweeted Sunday.
