UPDATE 1005 GMT:

Israel Finance Minister Avigdor Liberman has declined to condemn Russia’s mass killing of Ukrainian civilians.

Liberman told Israeli radio, “There are difficult images, and we all condemn all war crimes….[But] this is about mutual accusations.”

He promoted Russia’s effort to cover up the killings: a call for a UN Security Council meeting to accuse “Ukrainian radicals” of a “blatant provocation”.

Russia is blaming Ukraine and Ukraine is blaming Russia. We condemn, but really what we need to understand is that there is a bloody war and we must, on the one hand, maintain Israel’s moral position and on the other hand preserve the interests of the State of Israel.

He claimed good Israeli relations with both countries, emphasizing the Russian Army’s presence in Syria and citing a greater concern with the Iran nuclear talks.

In contrast, Defense Minister Benny Gantz extended the condemnation by Foreign Minister Yair Lapid of the killings, albeit without naming Russia: “I condemn carnage of this kind. It is certainly a war crime.”

It is impossible to remain indifferent in the face of the horrific images from the city of Bucha near Kiev, from after the Russian army left. Intentionally harming a civilian population is a war crime and I strongly condemn it. — יאיר לפיד – Yair Lapid🟠 (@yairlapid) April 3, 2022

UPDATE 0835 GMT:

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has spoken of possible “genocide” in Russia’s mass killing of Ukrainian civilians.

We will do everything to ensure that those who have perpetrated these war crimes do not go unpunished, and therefore appear before the courts… to deal with these alleged cases of [crimes against] humanity, war crimes and — why not say it too? — genocide.

Sanchez told an economic forum in Madrid, “Putin’s unjustified aggression has brought war back to the gates of the European Union.”

Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said on Monday:

I am deeply shocked at the fact that on the outskirts of Kyiv terrible atrocities have been perpetrated against civilians. The killing of innocent civilians violates international humanitarian law. It is absolutely intolerable and Japan condemns it in the strongest terms….Russia must be held strictly accountable for those acts.

UPDATE 0735 GMT:

Russia’s weekend strikes on Mykolaiv in southern Ukraine are continuing this morning.

Russian forces fired rockets early Monday, killing at least one person and injuring more than a dozen, according to the head of the regional military administration.

A Russian attack on the regional administration building in Mykolaiv killed at least 35 people last Tuesday.

UPDATE 0723 GMT:

Ukrainian journalist Oleh Baturin has spoken of his injuries — with threats of torture, mutilation, and death — during eight days in detention by Russian forces.

Baturin, a reporter with the newspaper Novyi Den (New Day), was seized on March 12 in Russian-occupied Kherson in southern Ukraine. He was given little water, food, or medicine, and had four ribs broken during interrogations and beatings.

Baturin told the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe:

They tortured me, threatened to mutilate me, threatened to kill me, asked a lot of stupid questions – who are the organisers of pro-Ukrainian rallies in the Kherson region, who runs Telegram channels, who have weapons, or do we have activists and independent journalists from Belarus? The Russian invaders have only one goal – to break down the citizens of Ukraine, to intimidate them and to completely destroy independent journalism, to crush civil activists and journalists physically and psychologically.

UPDATE 0715 GMT:

French President Emmanuel Macron has called for toughened sanctions on Russia, targeting oil and coal exports, over the mass killing of Ukrainian civilians by Russian forces.

Macron said in an interview on nationa radio:

There are very clear clues pointing to war crimes. It is more or less established that the Russian army is responsible. What happened in Bucha demands a new round of sanctions and very clear measures.

UPDATE 0635 GMT:

Ukraine’s military declares that Russia has launched a “hidden mobilization” of about 60,000 soldiers to rebuild units which have suffered losses during the invasion.

The UK Defence Ministry supported the claim: “Russian forces are continuing to consolidate and reorganise as they refocus their offensive into the Donbas region in the east of Ukraine. Russian troops, including mercenaries from the Russian state-linked Wagner private military company, are being moved into the area.”

The Ukraine military’s report said forces thwarted seven attacks in the territories of Donetsk and Luhansk in the Donbas over the past 24 hours.

Serhiy Haidai, head of the Luhansk regional military administration, said:

I can confirm that there is a significant accumulation of troops and military equipment that is getting prepared for the major breakthrough. There was an attempt of a breakthrough in Rubizhne this night, our defenders repelled an attack. We are holding out, but we do see there’s a major accumulation of troops.

ORIGINAL ENTRY: Reclaiming territory after the Russian withdrawal in northern Ukraine, officials are compiling evidence of the hundreds of civilians killed by the occupying forces in Bucha, northwest of Kyiv, and other towns.

International and national leaders condemned the apparent war crimes on Sunday, raising questions about the response to Moscow — military, political, economic, and legal — in the next phase of Vladimir Putin’s invasion.

As the Ukrainian military moved into Bucha last Thursday after Russia’s five-week occupation, it found bodies strewn across the streets. Journalists from AFP saw the bodies of at least 22 people in civilian clothes, one with his hands tied behind his back. Associated Press reporters saw at least 21 victims in various locations. One group of nine, scattered on a site used by the Russian troops as a base, had been killed at close range. At least two had their hands tied behind their backs, one was shot in the head, and another’s legs were bound.

Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk said another 280 people were buried in mass graves. The head of the local rescue, Serhiy Kaplychniy, showed journalists one grave behind a church with 57 corpses. All the dead, some with hands and feet poking through the clay, were in civilian clothes.

The Witness Testimony

Victims and witnesses testified about executions. Halyna Tovkach, 55, spoke of the killing of her husband and of three family members — two young boys and their mother — with whom they were leaving Bucha on March 5. Their two-car convoy was halted by Russian troops, who machine-gunned the group: Halyna was shot in the shoulder but fled.

Taras Schevchenko, 43, said Russian soldiers refused to allow men to leave through a humanitarian corridor and then shot at them as they fled across an open field. Some of the bodies on the streets had been “squashed by tanks … like animal skin rugs”.

Shevchenko’s mother, Yevdokia, 77, said she saw an elderly man killed, as he stood next to his wife, after he challenged a Russian soldier. “They shot him dead, and ordered the woman to leave,” she said.

Hanna Herega described the killing of a fellow Bucha resident:

He went to get some wood when all of a sudden they started shooting. They hit him a bit above the heel, crushing the bone, and he fell down. The shooter shouted: “Don’t scream or I will shoot!” and they turned away. Then they shot off his left leg completely, with the boot. Then they shot him all over this side [on the chest.] And another shot went slightly below the temple. It was a controlled shot to the head.

Larisa Savenko, 72, said, “A Russian APC was parked in my garden for three days. Five gunmen entered my house, they looked at my documents and took our phones away. [They] told us we are lucky to have them, because other Russian troops would have already shot [us].”

Ukrainian officials say they have recovered the bodies of 410 civilians in towns near Kyiv that were recaptured in recent days.

“#RussianArmy didn’t allow to bury the dead. Only after we said they’re RU soldiers too, they somewhat agreed”. This group in #Bucha found 340 bodies. 20 more addresses to go. No one knows how many buried in the backyards.#BuchaMassacre #StandWithUkraine #BanRussianOil pic.twitter.com/tUNpB4QcIY — olexander scherba🇺🇦 (@olex_scherba) April 4, 2022

Zelenskiy to Russian Mothers: “How Did Your Sons Become Butchers?”

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy spoke of the mass killings in his late-night video address to the nation.

Hundreds of people were killed. Tortured, executed civilians. Corpses on the streets…. Concentrated evil has come to our land. Murderers. Torturers. Rapists. Looters. Who call themselves the army. And who deserve only death after what they did.

He continued with a direct appeal:

I want every mother of every Russian soldier to see the bodies of the killed people in Bucha, in Irpin, in Hostomel. What did they do? Why were they killed? What did the man who was riding his bicycle down the street do? Why were ordinary civilians in an ordinary peaceful city tortured to death? Why were women strangled after their earrings were ripped out of their ears? How could women be raped and killed in front of children? How could their corpses be desecrated even after death? Why did they crush the bodies of people with tanks? What did the Ukrainian city of Bucha do to your Russia? How did all this become possible? Russian mothers! Even if you raised looters, how did they also become butchers?…They killed deliberately and with pleasure.”

He told Russians, “This is how the Russian state will now be perceived. This is your image. Your culture and human appearance perished together with the Ukrainian men and women to whom you came.”

International Condemnation

As the reports circulated of the scale of the killings, UN Secretary General António Guterres called for an independent investigation.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she was “appalled by reports of unspeakable horrors in areas from which Russia is withdrawing”. She also sought an urgent independent investigation so “perpetrators of war crimes will be held accountable”. European Council head Charles Michel said he was shocked by “haunting images of atrocities committed by [the] Russian army” and pledged “further EU sanctions and support are on their way”.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, spoke of the “terrible and horrifying” images of “streets littered with bodies” and “bodies buried in makeshift conditions”. In a significant shift from Germany, with its dependence on Russian energy supplies, Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht, said the European Union should consider a ban on gas imports from Russia.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke on CNN of “a punch in the gut” from seeing the mass killings: “We can’t become numb to this. We can’t normalize this. This is the reality of what is going on every single day as long as Russia’s brutality against Ukraine continues.”

Russian Disinformation

Repeating its tactic after other mass killings of civilians, from its intervention in the Syrian confict to its attacks on Mariupol in southern Ukraine, Russia’s Defense Ministry said the videos and photos from Bucha were “another staged performance by the Kyiv regime”.

Hoping to divert attention and escape responsibility, Moscow said it wants an emergency UN Security Council meeting on Monday, pushing the disinformation of the “provocation of Ukrainian radicals in Bucha”.

Russia’s Ambassador to the US, Anatoly Antonov, tried another disinformation approach:

I would like to emphasize with full responsibility that not a single civilian suffered from violence when the town was controlled by the Russian Armed Forces. On the contrary, our troops delivered 452 tonnes of humanitarian aid for civilians. Meanwhile, the fact that the Ukrainian Armed Forces shelled the town of Bucha right after Russian troops had left was deliberately ignored in the US. This is what could have caused civilian casualties.

Ukraine MP Yelyzaveta Yasko responded:

It’s such a terrible cynicism. The question is how did these societies end up, and that political leadership of Russia end up that they can so easily justify the crimes and the murders and saying that it was just staged?",https://eaworldview.com/2022/04/ukraine-war-bucha-100s-civilians-killed-by-russia-forces/

How could it be otherwise, the news about the massacres in Bucha and other towns in northern Ukraine have marked the news. However, new developments continue to occur on the battlefield, as well as in the international arena. As the Russian withdrawal continues to take place, we continue to see shipments of materiel to Ukraine's northeastern and eastern borders. In addition, the troops of the self-proclaimed republics of Lugansk and Donetsk, supported by the Russian Army, continue with their small but constant advances, while the Ukrainians reinforce their defenses awaiting intense fighting.

It is necessary to make a reference to what happened in Bucha and other towns in the north of Ukraine. Beyond the barbarism, deep investigations will be necessary to clearly determine what happened and to know with certainty if they were war crimes, crimes against humanity or something else. The images, which range from executed to burned and from adult men to women and small children, are heartbreaking. Unfortunately, this is the reality in practically any conflict and therefore the experts must be the ones who clarify what happened so that, in their case, the guilty parties can be prosecuted.

While what happened is becoming clearer, the battle of stories, between a Russia that either denies what happened or tries to sow reasonable doubt, and the press from much of the world, starting with the European and American press, is being atrocious and also it has an impact when it comes to dividing societies, even within some countries.

Regarding its impact on the course of the war, in military terms it is non-existent, although the consequences in the form of sanctions, greater international isolation of Russia, loss of image and even greater military aid to Ukraine could be important. In fact, new sanctions are already being negotiated.

That said, and moving on to the purely military, the transfer of Russian forces from Belarus to the Russian borders with Ukraine continues. The latest, throughout the day, 28 helicopters, including Ka-52 attack helicopters and Mi-8 transport helicopters in the direction of Bryansk Oblast. These have been accompanied by several trains with various vehicles and material, also in the same direction, as well as Il-76 transport planes that have landed in Gomel, probably to load personnel.

It is not clear to what extent Russian forces have managed to withdraw completely from some areas of northern Ukraine, specifically around Chernigov. It is known, from the numerous photographic testimonies and the videos that have appeared, that Russian losses have been substantial in recent weeks there. However, there is no clear news about the recovery of the entire territory by the Ukrainian troops, so it must be considered that there are still Russian troops in it, unlike in the kyiv and Sumy oblasts, where today the regional governor reported on the complete Russian withdrawal.

Another interesting point is Mariúpol. If two weeks ago it seemed that the city was going to fall imminently, there would still be some pocket of resistance, although in the last hours they have reached some images of mass surrenders and the Russian side has managed to plant the flag of the Russian Federation in the center of the city. The fact that the city has endured so many days would be indicative of the difficulty on the Russian side to allocate the appropriate number of troops to its conquest, for which both are undoubtedly paying an exorbitant price in lives. In fact, the need to recruit new volunteers in Chechnya - yesterday we published a video with the new replacement - makes us think that the first levy has suffered considerable casualties.

While the slow movement of media -to which must be added the arrival of troops and fresh vehicles necessary to make units with a very high attrition rate operational again - continues, the most important fighting is taking place in the east, both in Donetsk and Lugansk. Battles always preceded by an important artillery preparation that is sowing both regions of towns completely erased from the face of the earth. Not in vain, as we have mentioned before, these regions are full of trenches. Moreover, the Ukrainians would have continued to build new trenches in recent weeks that they use elastically. By this we mean that, far from resisting in them to the last man, on many occasions they withdraw to positions further to the rear, recovering them later, thus minimizing their losses and increasing those of the enemy, who must make enormous efforts to gain every inch of ground.

🇷🇺🔥🇺🇦 #Russia vs #Ukraine (day 40) – The militiamen of the #RPD supported by Russian troops have taken Novobakhmutovka. The trench warfare will continue in the coming days, as the Ukrainians have not stopped digging, as seen in the last image. pic.twitter.com/y6RNxCLUEy – Ejércitos Magazine (@REjercitos) April 4, 2022

If, as it seems, the means that Russia is going to have to continue with its «Special Military Operation» are those that remain from the accumulation prior to the war, plus the few BTGs that have been able to meet in recent days, in addition to the militias of the RPD and the RPL, we can witness a real carnage in the coming weeks. In addition, there are worrying reports about the combat readiness of some units, although since most come from Ukrainian reports, they must be taken with great caution. In any case, the most worrying thing from the Russian point of view - leaving aside the intelligence that the West transfers to Ukraine - has to do with logistics. The number of abandoned vehicles in kyiv or Chernigov and the fact that many of them lack wheels it is indicative of serious logistical problems and lack of spare parts, with the consequent ""cannibalization"" of components. We have also seen combat vehicles in good condition, left to their fate without having suffered any attack by the Ukrainian side, which indicates that either they suffered mechanical breakdowns, or the lack of fuel. Be that as it may, Russia must take care of this aspect, since a campaign like the one expected in the east, although it may not need as many vehicles and fuel, will be very demanding of ammunition.

By fronts, in the last few hours the most notable developments are the following.

North: Russian troops may remain in Chernigov Oblast. For the rest, the Russian withdrawal is complete and it does not seem that they are leaving troops in Belarus to launch an attack in the future without prior notice. Given that any new accumulation of forces would give Ukraine time to act accordingly, reinforcing its defenses, it should be considered that at least in the coming weeks there will be no movement in the area.

Northeast: Bombing continues in Kharkov. There are no apparent changes on the ground beyond the Sumy Oblast withdrawal that we have already discussed.

East: DNR militias, supported by the Russian Armed Forces, have seized Novobakhmutovka and reached the road from Kostyantynivka to Avdiivka after three days of fighting. For their part, the Lugansk militiamen have reached Novotoshkivs'ke, the southern part of the Severodonestk-Lysychansk defensive system and one of the last defenses before reaching Hirske, a city of more than 10.000 inhabitants whose gates pass through the road leading to Lysychansk and for which its conquest seems vital. Further north, from Izyum, the Russian salient will have to break the Barvinkovo-Sloviansk-Limán line to continue advancing towards Sloviansk.

International context, diplomacy and sanctions

The international context of the conflict is irremediably marked by what happened in Bucha. However, Ukraine's Attorney General, Iryna Venediktova, has already warned that the worst situation with civilian casualties is in Borodyanka and that at the moment the military is working on Irpin, Bucha and Vorzel. The President Zelensky has been expressed in the following terms:

""These are war crimes and will be recognized by the world as genocide. We know of thousands of people killed and tortured, with their limbs cut off. Women raped, children murdered. I think this is genocide.""

For their part, Russian representatives such as the Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, maintain that the images we are seeing of places like Bucha are a false attack that Ukraine and the West later spread through their channels and social networks. In addition, he insists that the Russian troops withdrew completely from that town on March 30 – confirmed by the mayor of Bucha on the 31st – thus complying with the plans and agreements reached.

Apparently, both parties would be interested in taking this matter to the United Nations Security Council. However, Russia had requested that this matter be addressed today at the headquarters of this body, a request that has been denied.

UK🇬🇧 Presidency violated UNSC rules of procedure by rejecting 🇷🇺request for an emergency meeting of the Council to discuss the events in #Bucha. In light of this, Ambassador #Nebenzia will hold a press conference today at 03.30 pm.

One of the responses of the European Union has been precisely to create a Joint Investigation Team collect evidence and investigate war crimes and crimes against humanity. As they also announced a few days ago, the European Commission insists that the EU is willing to support the Ukrainian Prosecutor's Office by sending investigation teams on the ground, since Eurojust and Europol are ready to act.

In addition, it would not be an isolated investigation given that the European agency Eurojust is in contact with the International Criminal Court with the aim of having the latter institution form part of the Joint Investigation Team. In this way, they estimate that with an integrated approach involving the International Criminal Court, the European Union together with its Member States and agencies, and the Ukrainian authorities, a process of collecting, analyzing and processing evidence of as fully and efficiently as possible.

I spoke with President @ZelenskyyUa about the atrocious murder of civilians in Bucha and elsewhere in Ukraine.



The EU is ready to send Joint Investigation Teams to document war crimes in coordination with the Ukrainian Prosecutor General.@Europol and @Eurojust will support. - Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen) April 4, 2022

He too United States's president Joe Biden has reaffirmed his conviction that the Russian President is a war criminal and has announced that he will ask to be tried as such. To do this, he stresses the need to collect all the details in order to hold a trial for war crimes. Furthermore, he warns that the US administration will continue to adopt sanctions against Russia.

Based on the foregoing, the US Ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas Greenfield, has confirmed that they will ask the General Assembly to suspend Russia from the Human Rights Council.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, has communicated for her part that she feels “horrified by the images of civilians lying dead in the streets and makeshift graves in the town of Bucha”. Thus, it calls for ""independent and effective"" investigations to be guaranteed into what happened there in order to ""guarantee truth, justice and accountability, as well as to file appeals and obtain reparations for the victims and their families."" It also insists that for this all the corpses must be exhumed and identified in order to inform the families of the victims.

On the other hand, it should also be noted that attempts are still being made to evacuate as many civilians as in previous days, although it is true that International Red Cross has failed to complete its work in Mariupol. There, there would still be 130.000 residents who have not been able to leave the city. According to various sources, the members of the Organization would be held 20 kilometers from the city.

However, the Minister of Social Policy of Ukraine, Maryna Lazebna, has confirmed the evacuation of 413 children belonging to vulnerable categories to Switzerland, Germany, Poland and Turkey. In particular, they were in orphanages in Boyarka and Kamyanka, in the Dnipropetrovsk region.

The United Nations Office for Human Rights reports that from February 24 to April 3 they have recorded a total of 3.527 civilian casualties. 1.430 people would have died, while 2.097 would have been injured.

In this sense, issues related to the evacuation of civilians and the deaths of civilians in towns such as Bucha have been addressed by the Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration, Olha Stefanishyna, and the Greek Foreign Minister, Nikos Dendias in Odessa. What's more, in the statement it is underlined that Greece has been one of the countries that turned to the International Criminal Court to start investigating war crimes. He also insisted that he will continue to provide aid, essentially humanitarian, and that his Consulate General in Odessa has been the first European representation to resume work since last April 1.

Taking up other of the EU's first responses to the events of the last few hours, the President of the European Parliament has called for action along three lines:

Provide more humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine Adopt more sanctions and cover the loopholes that exist “Go to zero gas from the Kremlin.”

# Ukraine is fighting for our values, in impossible conditions.



The images from #Bucha & #Irpin show the level of threat.



My appeal is to act:

• more humanitarian aid & military equipment

• more sanctions & close loopholes

• move to zero-gas from the Kremlin pic.twitter.com/x5mZtHF8K7 - Roberta Metsola (@EP_President) April 4, 2022

The European Union is certainly already working on the adoption of more sanctions and once again one of the issues to be discussed will be energy. An issue not exempt from controversy and disparate opinions, as we have been reporting in previous reports.

In relation to this matter, it should be noted that the Minister for the Economy, Robert Habeck, has announced that Germany has assumed the control of the German subsidiary of Gazprom to ""protect public safety and order."" In this way, after Gazprom's decision to end its participation in said subsidiary last Friday and until September 30, Germany will hold control of the company and can take measures to guarantee security of supply while looking for private buyers. In his statement, Habeck emphasized that guaranteeing security of supply in his country also ""means that we do not allow energy infrastructure in Germany to be subject to arbitrary decisions by the Kremlin.""

On the one hand, and not only related to the energy issue, Merkel's legacy has been called into question in recent hours mainly due to what Zelensky said in his last night's speech; also one of the strongest:

“I invite Mrs. Merkel and Mr. Sarkozy to visit Bucha and see what the policy of concessions to Russia has led to in 14 years. Let them see with their own eyes the tortured Ukrainian men and women. I want to be understood well. We do not blame the West. We blame no one but the specific Russian military who did this against our people.""

Furthermore, the Ukrainian President has not been the only one to openly accuse the former Chancellor, but so has the Prime Minister of PolandMateusz Morawiecki:

“Madam Chancellor, you have been silent since the beginning of the war. The policy of Germany during the last ten or fifteen years has meant that Russia now has a strength based on the monopoly of the sale of raw materials.

He also took advantage of his speech to make it clear that the German Government is currently the main obstacle to the adoption of very severe sanctions. A different position would be that of France or Italy.

In reaction to the murders in Bucha, Emmanuel Macron has called for a ban on Russian coal and oil under a new sanctions package. The Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio has confirmed that his country will not veto sanctions related to Russian gas imports.
