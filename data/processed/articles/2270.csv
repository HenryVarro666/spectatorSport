U.S. representatives and senators from Massachusetts had been watching the escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine all week. Some came out in full support of President Biden's plans to impose sanctions on Russia.

But as the conflict took a turn late Wednesday night and reports came of Russian military forces and Russian-backed separatists firing missiles into major cities in Ukraine, state leaders escalated their condemnation of Russia's aggression while continuing to express support for Ukraine.

Below we've compiled their public remarks about the rapidly unfolding conflict.

Sen. Ed Markey

In a series of tweets Wednesday, Markey expressed sympathy with the Ukrainian people and used the conflict to highlight ""the importance of eliminating U.S. and European reliance on Russian dirty energy,"" like oil and natural gas.

Following Thursday's attacks, Markey focused his message on uniting with Ukraine and against Russia.

Markey also weighed in on the conflict's looming humanitarian cost Thursday morning in Lynn.

""There will be refugees,"" Markey said. ""There are going to be people who are seriously harmed or killed because of this event and we have to be there to say that the United States will be your friend.""

Sen. Elizabeth Warren

Warren tweeted Tuesday in support of Biden's plans to impose sanctions against Russia, before releasing a fresh statement on the conflict late Thursday morning following the developments overnight.

Rep. Jake Auchincloss

Auchincloss predicts sanctions imposed against Russia by the United States and Western nations will be crippling to the Russian economy.

On WBUR's Radio Boston, Auchincloss said the U.S. response must go further than the sanctions imposed by President Biden Thursday.

""The sanctions are just one element we need to crush the Russian oil and gas sector,"" he said. ""Clean energy is not just an environmental issue, it's not just good economics. It is maybe the single-most important strategic asset that the West can have in the coming generation.""

The U.S. needs to wage an information campaign in the Russian homeland to show the Russian people what is really happening and to undermine Putin, Auchincloss said.

In a tweet Thursday afternoon, Auchincloss also noted a personal connection to the terror provoked by Russia's invasion.

Rep. Katherine Clark

Earlier this week, Clark joined others in calling for sanctions against Russia in response to its ""unprovoked dangerous actions against #Ukraine,"" as she wrote in a Feb. 22 tweet. In it, she went on to say, ""America and its allies abroad must use every diplomatic tool we have to stop further aggression by Putin that threatens Ukraine's sovereignty and its people.""

She tweeted Thursday the U.S. must hold Russian leaders accountable.

Rep. Bill Keating

Rep. Stephen Lynch

Lynch — who chairs the House national security subcommittee — joined WBUR's Morning Edition on Friday to discuss the situation.

He highlighted in a tweet on Thursday that Russia's attacks were a ""naked use of military force against a civilian population.""

He called on the U.S. and its allies to respond with ""condemnation in the strongest possible terms.""

Rep. Jim McGovern

McGovern posted a series of tweets, including one in which he retweeted Biden's message that ""Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring.""

McGovern focused his last tweet on the humanitarian crisis he said will ensue.

Rep. Seth Moulton

Rep. Richard Neal

In tweet Wednesday, Neal insisted on a ""diplomatic solution"" in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he described as ""a brazen aggressor, acting in dangerous ways."" In light of Thursday's attacks, Neal said, ""We cannot and will not tolerate his authoritarian regime.""

Rep. Ayanna Pressley

Pressley responded to Thursday's attacks in part by retweeting a statement by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: ""Russia's invasion of Ukraine is indefensible. The U.S. is right to impose targeted sanctions on Putin & his oligarchs. We also must work with our allies to prepare for a refugee crisis on a massive scale. Finally, any military action must take place with Congressional approval.""

Pressley also posted her own remarks Thursday morning.

Rep. Lori Trahan

Trahan emphasized in a tweet that Russia's actions were a ""violation of international law"" that would be felt for ""decades to come."" In a second tweet, she extended sympathy with the Ukrainian people while also calling on world leaders to make de-escalation a ""top priority.""",https://www.wbur.org/news/2022/02/24/massachusetts-congress-ukraine-russia-reaction

Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said Putin's decision to invade ""will be his defining mistake.""

Despite the U.S. and its allies' best efforts ""Vladimir Putin has chosen war,"" said Rep. Adam Schiff.

WASHINGTON – As Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, Democratic lawmakers condemned Vladimir Putin, backed President Joe Biden and endorsed new economic sanctions on Putin's regime, while Republicans offered a more divided response that included attacks on the American president.

""This is a reckless war of choice, and the choice was made by Putin and Putin only,"" said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., shortly after Biden announced harsh new economic sanctions on the Russian regime.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., tweeted that ""an attack on Ukraine is an attack on democracy,"" and she applauded Biden ""for his forceful leadership"" in imposing ""severe sanctions to counter Russian aggression.""

The latest on Ukraine:NATO leader calls Russian attack 'brutal act of war': live updates

Republicans criticized Putin as well, though many of them – particularly former President Donald Trump – also had harsh words for Biden's handling of the Russia-Ukraine crisis.

""Putin is playing Biden like a drum. It is not a pretty thing to watch!"" Trump said Wednesday, just hours before Russia launched a full-scale invasion of the sovereign nation of Ukraine.

In a telephone interview Wednesday night with Fox News – with a split screen showing war in Ukraine – Trump blamed ""the weakness and the incompetence and the stupidity"" of the Biden administration. He also echoed his false claims of voter fraud in the 2020 elections, claiming falsely that a ""rigged election"" led to Russia's aggression.

Trump has also described Putin as ""smart"" and ""savvy"" in the run-up to the invasion of Ukraine.

Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., a member of the House Republican leadership, devoted the first sentence of her statement on the invasion to a political attack on Biden: ""After just one year of a weak, feckless, and unfit President of the United States and Commander-in-Chief, the world is less safe. Rather than peace through strength, we are witnessing Joe Biden’s foreign policy of war through weakness.""

Later in her statement, Stefanik described Putin as ""a gutless, bloodthirsty, authoritarian dictator,"" as well as ""a war criminal and deranged thug."" She added that ""we must stand with democracies under assault.""

Other Republicans focused more on Putin but second-guessed Biden as well.

The enigma of Vladimir Putin:What do we really know about Russia's leader?

Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who has clashed repeatedly over the years with Trump over Russia policy, began his statement by denouncing Putin as a ""thug"" who is exhibiting ""full brutality"" on a peaceful neighbor. ""Russia’s aggressive ambitions threaten the core interests of the United States, NATO, and the West,"" he said.

McConnell also said that Biden ""should have exercised his extensive authorities to impose certain tough sanctions early enough to actually deter invasion and weaken Russia.""

Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who is reportedly considering a presidential bid in 2024, called on Biden to ""finally"" impose hard economic sanctions on the Russian autocrat.

Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who wants to be speaker of the House if Republicans prevail in this year's congressional elections, called Putin's invasion ""reckless and evil."" McCarthy did not mention Biden in his statement, and said ""Putin must be held accountable for his actions.”

The Ukraine crisis has revived GOP and conservative divisions over what to do about Putin and Russia.

While no one is calling for American military intervention, long-time hawks like Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have accused Putin of seeking to revive the Cold War and said the U.S. needs to confront him with economic sanctions.

Overnight, Graham said ""Putin and his cronies should be pursued by international law enforcement agencies for the purpose of seizing their lavish apartments, fine art, yachts, and other material goods purchased through stealing the Russian people blind.""

Other Republicans said the U.S. has no business interjecting itself into the Russia-Ukraine imbroglio and risks widening the conflict. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., tweeted: ""Hear this loud and clear, Americans don’t want to be dragged into more never ending foreign wars on another continent no matter how many neocons and neoliberals demand it.""

Some Democrats said it is absurd for Republicans to be as critical of Biden as of Putin.

They said Trump coddled Putin during his presidency, enabling the Russian leader to build strength and confidence. Opponents also noted that Trump once threatened to withhold military aid from Ukraine if it did not investigate Biden, his opponent in the 2020 election. Trump was impeached over that incident.

Gov. Phil Murphy, D-N.J., told reporters that ""anybody who is laudatory"" toward Putin should be ashamed. ""And that includes former President Donald Trump and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who should literally be ashamed of themselves,"" he said.

Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who tweeted that ""Putin’s decision to invade is an evil, panicked move of weakness and will be his defining mistake,” added that the Russian autocrat ""has plans for us too.""

Putin ""will use this crisis to try to divide Americans from each other and to separate America from our allies,"" Murphy said. ""In this, we must remain vigilant and united. This is not a moment for politics to trump security.""

Ben Rhodes, a foreign policy adviser during the Barack Obama presidency, said some Republicans are doing exactly that, and the party needs new leadership on foreign policy. He tweeted that ""you can't praise Trump out of one side of your mouth and talk tough about Putin out of the other.""

By and large, Democrats stood more united behind Biden in opposing Russian aggression.

Former President Obama said all Americans ""should support President Biden’s efforts, in coordination with our closest allies, to impose hard-hitting sanctions on Russia –sanctions that impose a real price on Russia’s autocratic elites.""

Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., citing the large number of Ukrainian-Americans in her home state of Michigan, said ""America will stand strong with all of our allies to do everything we can to protect their freedom and independence and save lives.”

Some Democrats did offer warnings to Biden. Members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus applauded the president's initial efforts and added that ""we urge the Biden administration to be guided by two goals: to avoid dangerous escalation that is all too easy in the chaos of war, and to ensure we are minimizing harm to civilians.""

Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who chairs the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, noted that the Biden administration had already hit Russia with new sanctions before the full-scale assault on its neighbor.

""It is clear that despite our unified efforts with our allies and Ukraine, Vladimir Putin has chosen war,"" Schiff said.

Calling on the U.S. to stand with Ukraine, Schiff said ""this begins by moving swiftly beyond the significant sanctions already announced by the Biden administration to fully cutting off Russia’s leading financial institutions from the global economy and ending Europe’s dependence on Russian oil for good.""

In the hours following the invasion — the largest in Europe since World War II — which occurred before dawn in Europe, Missouri's representatives in Congress condemned the Russian operation, releasing statements calling for a strong U.S. response.

U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, who sits on the Committee on Armed Services, said Thursday morning that Russia's ""brutal assault ... must be met with strong American resolve,"" and called for sanctions against Russia and aid to Ukraine.

""President Biden must act now to hit Vladimir Putin where it hurts, beginning with Russia's energy sector,"" Hawley said. ""The Biden administration should sanction Russian energy production to a halt, and help arm the Ukrainians to defend themselves.

""At the same time, the White House should reopen American energy production in full. This is the time to show Russia and the world that America will not reward aggression and it will not be dependent on its enemies.""

Biden met Thursday morning with world leaders and his national security team. In a midday speech, he detailed new sanctions on Russian banks and oligarchs, saying ""Putin chose this war"" and ""now he and his country will bear the consequences.

Ukraine invasion:Why is Russia invading Ukraine? Could it be the start of WWIII? Here's what we know

U.S. Rep. Vicky Hartzler, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee and is running for U.S. Senate, said the invasion ""warrants a fury of sanctions"" and called on Biden to ""swiftly decimate Putin's further capabilities"" through sanctions.

""To the Ukrainian people: I stand with you and pray for your health, safety and freedom as you defend your homeland from this baseless Russian invasion,"" Hartzler said.

U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt characterized the invasion as ""an assault against democracy and a destabilizing threat to all of Europe"" in a Thursday statement. He said it was ""important that our newest NATO allies understand our steadfast defensive military commitment to them at this critical moment.""

""We must work with our allied nations to hold Russia accountable,"" Blunt said. ""A failure to act forcefully will only embolden Russia and other authoritarian nations that seek to undermine peace and democracy around the world.""

Blunt, who visited the Missouri State Capitol on Wednesday, told reporters prior to the invasion that Biden had taken the proper steps in response.

""I do think the president's decision to call this what it is and the president's decision to move forward with these sanctions was important,"" Blunt said.

U.S. Senate race:Roy Blunt, Missouri's senior senator, weighs in on race to replace him, state of politics

U.S. Rep. Billy Long of southwest Missouri, also running for Senate, called Putin's action ""a war crime"" and said it ""must be met with consequences — but it may be too little, too late."" He blamed Biden's ""failure to lead"" in part ""created the conditions to make this possible.""

""We could not be in a worse position as this could have been largely prevented,"" Long said in a statement. ""Due to the feckless Biden-Harris Administration, we have gone from energy independent to energy dependent in record time.""

In social media posts Thursday morning, Long used the occasion to make jabs at Biden's immigration policy and popular conservative talking points about LGBTQ+ culture issues.

""Ukraine's border was invaded last night, pray for the Ukrainian people,"" Long wrote. ""Our southern border was invaded 1/20/21 a date that will live in infamy. Pray for our country.""

""The only question now is if Mr. Putin and his troops will use the right pronouns or not,"" Long wrote in another tweet referencing impending Russian propaganda and disinformation.

Gov. Mike Parson posted a statement on social media Thursday.

""Missourians stand with the people of Ukraine and pray for every innocent life put in harm's way due to this unprovoked and senseless act of Russian aggression,"" Parson wrote. ""The free world shouldn't cower to dictators or stand idly by as democracy is threatend.

""We pray that a unified response from the United States and our allies can quickly resolve this conflict.""

Both the Missouri House and Senate chambers took moments of silence Thursday morning for the people of Ukraine.

“Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is intolerable and must be met with immediate strength and decisive action from the United States and our allies. This is a blatant attack on Ukraine’s sovereignty. Putin’s intentions have been clear from the beginning: he is a vicious opportunist who will continue to exploit his self-made crisis and put his people through incredible pain and suffering if it means accomplishing his goal of returning Russia to the prestige it commanded before the collapse of the Soviet Union.

“Our adversaries are watching. The world is looking to the United States to see how we respond. This attack by Putin is not only about Ukraine – this is about the rest of Europe, the Indo-Pacific and the entire democratic world order. I urge President Biden to hold true to his word and show the world that Putin’s malign behavior will be met with a swift response from the United States.”",https://wittman.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=4041

Some Republicans in the Senate and House of Representatives blamed Biden for failing to deter Russian President Vladimir Putin from sending forces into Ukraine and called on the U.S. president to take a stronger position on the largest conflict in Europe since World War Two.

""There's no doubt that weakness leads to war,"" Representative Brian Mast, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a Thursday morning tweet. ""Putin once said the collapse of the Soviet empire was the 'greatest geopolitical catastrophe' of the past century for Russia. For America, President Biden may be the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of this century.""

The invasion of Ukraine followed months of Russian military buildup along the country's borders, leading to frantic diplomacy and sanctions from the United States and NATO that failed to prevent the incursion. Biden plans an address to the nation at 12:30 p.m. EST (1730 GMT).

The criticisms represented a further fraying of the dictum that partisan politics should stop at the water's edge, a view which Republicans voiced at the outset of the Cold War in the late 1940s.

""There used to be a grace period to see how the commander in chief handled things. ... It seems Biden was not given much room to maneuver,"" said a former chief of staff to a Republican member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

A more moderate message came from Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who called Biden's withdrawal from Afghanistan a signal of American weakness for Putin. But he also called for political unity going forward. ""We're all together at this point, and we need to be together about what should be done,"" said McConnell, who urged Biden to impose full and crippling economic sanctions on Russia and stand ready to supply Ukraine with the weapons necessary to inflict maximum damage on Russian forces.

'WHERE'S BIDEN?'

Other Republicans kept up the political attack on Biden.

""Almost 12 hours since Vladimir Putin declared war on Ukraine and the only response we've gotten from Biden is a Zoom call. Where's Biden? He's the leader of the free world. It's time to start acting like it,"" Representative Carlos Gimenez wrote on Twitter.

Biden spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as the invasion began late on Wednesday, convened his National Security Council on Thursday, and met with his counterparts from the Group of Seven allies to map out more severe responses. read more

""The president must change course or our deterrent posture will continue to collapse, chaos will continue to spread and eventually no one will trust America's promises or fear America's power,"" said Representative Mike Gallagher, a member of the House Armed Services Committee.

Former President Donald Trump -- who even out of office remains the most powerful voice in the Republican Party -- had threatened during his four years in office to leave NATO, calling the military alliance ""obsolete."" He withdrew the United States from international agreements -- including the Paris Climate Accord, which it has since rejoined -- and pulled out of a pact in which Iran had curbed its uranium enrichment program, a possible pathway to nuclear arms, which is now being renegotiated.

Trump, who has expressed admiration for Putin, described the Russian leader's actions leading up to invasion as ""genius,"" ""smart"" and ""pretty savvy.""

The response among congressional Republicans -- blaming Biden, calling for stronger sanctions and warning against any use of U.S. troops in Ukraine -- largely mirrored the sentiments of Republican voters, as lawmakers approach the Nov. 8 midterm elections that will determine the balance of power in Congress ahead of the 2024 presidential election.

Only 34% of Americans -- including just 12% of Republicans -- approved of the way Biden was handling the crisis in the run-up to the invasion, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted Tuesday and Wednesday.

Twenty-five percent of Republicans polled said Biden was primarily to blame for the conflict, with 46% saying Putin was primarily to blame. Nearly one in five was unsure who to blame. read more

Senator Mitt Romney, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a moderate voice in his party, offered broader criticism that also blamed U.S. responses to Russia by former Presidents Barack Obama and Trump while evoking the Reagan era's tough posture against the former Soviet Union.

""Putin's impunity predictably follows our tepid response to his previous horrors in Georgia and Crimea, our naive efforts at a one-sided 'reset,' and the shortsightedness of 'America First.' The '80s called' and we didn't answer,"" Romney said in a statement.

Interim U.S. Permanent Representative

February 25, 2022

Chairman, thank you for coordinating this vital session of the Permanent Council as the situation in Ukraine rapidly evolves.

To start, it is no accident that I am wearing blue and yellow today. These are the colors of the Ukrainian flag, and our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Ukraine as they face off against Russia’s illegal, unprovoked, and completely unjustified attack.

As President Biden said: “President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering. Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring.”

We – as a democratic Hemisphere – must stand united against Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, and we must continue to condemn it in the strongest possible terms. Russia’s action are a violation of international law and of the global norms that we – as an international community – have all pledged to respect.

Let us be clear – as we witness a large-scale land war in Europe for the first time since WWII – Russia is the sole aggressor in this crisis. After months of a relentless military buildup on Ukraine’s borders and hybrid warfare to destabilize Ukraine from within, Russia followed exactly the script we expected.

Putin’s illegal recognition of the so-called Luhansk People’s Republic and the Donetsk People’s Republic represented a farcical pretext for naked aggression, the likes of which have not been seen in Europe for some 70 years.

Let us not mince words: Vladimir Putin is a revanchist dictator bent on conquest. His goal is nothing less than the recreation the Soviet Russian empire.

We have a message for Mr. Putin: this is not 1822 or 1922. The Age of Imperialism is long gone. Ukraine is a free, sovereign, and independent state, and the Ukrainian nation will continue to exist regardless of Putin’s efforts to crush it.

The consequences of Russia’s aggression will be felt for years to come. Ukrainians will fight for their country, just as you and I would fight for our own, regardless of the odds. Ukraine will not give up its sovereignty without a fight, nor should it.

Regardless of who eventually comes out on top, there will be death and destruction on a massive scale. Russia, and Russia alone, must be held responsible for this tragedy.

Ukraine’s neighbors will face a humanitarian emergency as refugees pour across their borders. International peace and security are in jeopardy, and the global economy weakened. The implications of Russia’s decision to launch a war of conquest against its peaceful neighbor will reverberate globally, affecting us all, including those in our Hemisphere, for years to come.

We urge all countries in the Hemisphere to join us in strongly and publicly condemning Russia’s aggression and affirming our support for Ukraine. We ask that you call on Russia through every possible channel to cease its hostilities.

We must remain united in our message to Russia: the territory of a sovereign state cannot be seized by force of arms. Borders cannot be redrawn at gunpoint. Russia’s military aggression is illegal and unacceptable to the civilized world.

We call on all democratic countries to press Russia to halt its military operations in Ukraine immediately, return its troops and equipment to Russia, and cease all further aggression against Ukraine, including its ongoing cyber attacks.

We look forward to working with other OAS member states to uphold the values of the international system and support a return to the status que ante

Thank you.

(KRON) – A Bay Area Representative suggested in a CNN interview that the country should kick “every Russian student out” of universities in retaliation against Russian President Vladamir Putin.

Rep. Eric Swalwell was interviewed on Thursday. In the interview, Swalwell said that “closing their embassy in the United States” and “kicking every Russian student out” of the country should be on the table.

Here is Swalwell’s full response from the interview:

“Everything we do has to be aligned with our allies and the fact that we were able to get the Germans to stop this pipeline, that’s huge. That’s U.S. leadership on the international stage, and so, we want to move with our allies in NATO but also in countries, like Japan, who can, you know, take quite swift and severe actions against Russia. But yes, on the table should be sanctioning Putin personally. Completely taking them out of the European and international banking system which is known as SWIFT. Frankly, I think closing their embassy in the United States, kicking every Russian student out of the United States, those should all be on the table, and Putin needs to know that every day that he is in Ukraine, there are more severe options that could come.”

Following this interview, people took to Twitter by responding to and retweeting Fox News’ post which read, “Eric Swalwell floats kicking Russians out of US universities in retaliation to Putin invading Ukraine.”

Senator Bernie Sanders’ foreign policy advisor, Matt Duss, retweeted the post saying:

“This is empty hawkish posturing that would punish students while doing nothing to help Ukrainians.”

Biden has acknowledged a growing likelihood that war in Eastern Europe would affect Americans, though he has ruled out sending troops to Ukraine. Gas prices in the U.S. could rise in the short term. And Russian President Vladimir Putin has a range of tools he could use against the U.S., including cyberattacks hitting critical infrastructure and industries.

“Defending freedom will have costs for us as well, here at home,” Biden said Tuesday. “We need to be honest about that.”

Just 26 percent say the U.S. should have a major role in the conflict, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Fifty-two percent say a minor role; 20 percent say none at all.

The findings are a reminder for Biden and fellow Democrats that while the crisis may consume Washington in the coming months, pocketbook issues are likely to be a bigger priority for voters heading into the midterm elections. A December AP-NORC poll showed that Americans are particularly focused on economic issues, including rising inflation.

The Biden administration has argued that supporting Ukraine is a defense of fundamental American values and has made a concerted effort to declassify intelligence findings underscoring the dangers it sees for Ukraine and the wider European region. But the survey shows widespread public skepticism of the U.S. intelligence community.

Democrats are more likely than Republicans to think the U.S. should have a major role in the conflict, 32 percent to 22 percent. Overall, the poll shows 43 percent of Americans now approve of Biden’s handling of the U.S. relationship with Russia, a downtick from 49 percent in June of last year.

Despite the clear reluctance about major involvement in the conflict, Americans are hardly looking at Russia through rose-colored glasses. The poll finds 53 percent say they’re very or extremely concerned that Russia’s influence around the world poses a threat to the U.S., an uptick from 45 percent in August 2021.

Jennifer Rau, a 51-year-old mother of three adopted teenagers who lives on Chicago’s South Side, said she listens to local public radio for her world news. But in recent days, when the news turns to Russia and Ukraine, she has started to turn it off.

“I’m so frustrated. It’s enough. We’re bombarded,” Rau said. “There are other stories in Chicago that need to be covered.”

Rau is a political independent who voted for Biden. But she believes the U.S. gets involved in foreign wars to make money. She is more concerned about rising crime in Chicago, the prevalence of guns, and systemic racism that affects her three children, who are Hispanic.

“I just feel like there’s a war going on in the United States, every day, in Chicago,” she said. “And it is really scary. And I feel like no one helps us.”

Edward Eller, a 67-year-old retiree from Shady Valley, Tennessee, said the White House needs to focus on lowering oil prices.

“They want to send millions of dollars of ours to stop a war that we have nothing to do with,” he said. “I’m sorry they’re involved in a mess, but it’s not our problem.”

The poll was conducted Friday to Monday during a period of rapidly escalating tensions, culminating with Putin recognizing the independence of two separatist regions in eastern Ukraine, widely seen in the West as a step toward a wider war. Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian forces have been locked since 2014 in fighting that’s killed 14,000 people.

Asked on Tuesday why people in the U.S. should have to sacrifice for the conflict, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said, “This is about standing up for American values.”

“We have repeatedly throughout history been leaders in the world in rallying support for any effort to seize territory from another country,” she said.

Russia has massed at least 150,000 troops on three sides of Ukraine and continues to establish bridges, camps, and logistics necessary for a protracted invasion. U.S. officials believe Putin could attack Ukraine at any time. A full-on war in Ukraine could result in thousands of deaths and huge numbers of refugees fleeing for the U.S. or elsewhere in Europe.

The U.S. has imposed sanctions on Russian banks and oligarchs with more measures possible this week.

The White House has warned in increasingly strong words about a Russian invasion while trying to persuade Putin against launching one. It has declassified Russian troop positions and detailed allegations of “false-flag” plots that could set a pretext for a military attack on Ukraine.

However, the poll shows there remains skepticism among Americans of the U.S. intelligence community. Only 23 percent said they had a “great deal of confidence” in intelligence agencies. Another 52 percent say they have some confidence and 24 percent have hardly any.

U.S. Rep. Mike Quigley, an Illinois Democrat who serves on the House Intelligence Committee, says the intelligence he’s received on Ukraine “has been very, very good. Sadly, it’s been accurate.” But he often hears from constituents who are uninterested in Ukraine and more focused on health care and the coronavirus pandemic.

Over time, Quigley said, he has developed comments about why Ukraine matters to the U.S.: its role as a strategic ally and a “sovereign democratic nation at Putin’s doorstep,” and how a new war could hit already disrupted technology supply chains that use exports from Russia and Ukraine.

Among Russia’s biggest threats to Americans is its capability to wage cyberwarfare. Previous Russia-linked cyberattacks have cut off services at hospitals and breached the servers of American government agencies. A ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline linked to a Russia-based hacking group temporarily shut down gas stations across the East Coast. And Russia was accused of interfering in both the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections.

“I think it’s an incredibly difficult time to message because of everything else that’s topping the list of what Americans care about. It’s hard to bump COVID, inflation, safety issues away,” Quigley said. “But you’ve got to try.”

The AP-NORC poll of 1,289 adults was conducted Feb. 18-21 using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.

As the threat of Russia launching a war against Ukraine grew in recent weeks, congressional lawmakers struggled to reach a consensus on what kind of sanctions package they could piece together.

After days of talks, for example, the Senate left for a recess last week with only the approval of a symbolic resolution rebuking Russia for its escalating aggression against Ukraine.

Now, lawmakers have returned from several overseas trips to meet with U.S. allies sounding a new bipartisan note against a rising threat led by Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Among them is House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who joined dozens of Democratic and Republican lawmakers who traveled to last week's Munich Security Conference.

""The focus was Ukraine,"" Pelosi told reporters on Wednesday. ""All united in our support for the transatlantic alliance, NATO, all of us united in being there, to remove all doubt in Putin — or anyone else's mind — that we were acting as one.""

The annual event often draws bipartisan congressional attendance. But the trip was planned well before a new Russian threat had taken hold, putting Ukraine at the center of discussions, Pelosi said, who also took aim at Putin.

""It's stunning to see in this day and age a tyrant roll into a country. This is the same tyrant who attacked our democracy in 2016,"" Pelosi said.

Now, a bipartisan coalition of members say they are joining forces to address the crisis when Congress returns next week, with plans to issue an emergency supplemental bill to aid NATO allies and Ukraine.

""The emergency supplemental needs to help our allies, needs to provide more assistance to the Ukraine. We need to create a mechanism for Putin and his cronies to pay a heavy price to deter further aggression,"" South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters earlier this week.

Graham, along with Rhode Island Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, led a separate bipartisan congressional delegation to the Munich Security Conference. Upon their return this week, the group of more than 20 senators and House members issued a joint statement pledging to put together the emergency aid package in the face of Putin's further escalation of hostilities against Ukraine.

""No matter what happens in the coming days, we must assure that the dictator Putin and his corrupt oligarchs pay a devastating price for their decisions,"" the group said, which also includes Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, Ohio GOP Rep. Mike Turner and Michigan Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin, among others.

Graham also told reporters he's ""been on the phone with Democratic senators for the last two days"" discussing that emergency supplemental bill, which he said he hopes will also include the creation of a task force covering several federal agencies that will go after Russian oligarchs.

""It's now time for that crowd to lose their yachts, lose their luxury apartments and to pay a price for being part of a thuggish group — a nation-state that really is a mafia-state,"" Graham said.

There is divide in the GOP on how the Biden administration should move forward

Some GOP members say the Russian sanctions issued by the Biden administration so far remain weak and raise concerns about the U.S. response to a Russian war's impact on gas prices.

Many GOP members, while slamming Putin, also take aim at President Biden, saying the president should have issued sanctions tied to the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline project between Russia and Germany long ago.

""Sadly, President Biden consistently chose appeasement and his tough talk on Russia was never followed by strong action,"" House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy said in a statement with several top GOP members in the lower chamber. ""Lethal aid was slow-walked, anti-air and anti-ship capabilities were never directly provided, pre-invasion sanctions proportionate to the aggression Putin had already committed were never imposed, and sanctions on Nord Stream 2 were waived.""

On Wednesday, the Biden administration moved to issue sanctions targeting the Russian-owned company that is building the pipeline, drawing support from earlier Republican critics.

Among them were Texas Rep. Michael McCaul, the ranking Republican on the House Affairs Committee, and Alabama Rep. Mike Rogers, the top GOP member on the House Armed Services Committee. Both had signed onto the earlier McCarthy statement criticizing the Biden administration's moves with Russia, and issued a new statement lauding the change.

""We strongly objected to President Biden's decision last May to waive congressionally mandated sanctions on the Russian malign influence Nord Stream 2 project. Today's announcement, while long overdue, reflects years of bipartisan efforts and is a step in the right direction,"" McCaul and Rogers said.

This, as other Republicans — led by former President Donald Trump — are taking a more extreme stance of praising Putin and Russia. Trump called Putin's moves in Ukraine ""savvy"" and said the Russian president was making a ""smart"" move by referencing a rebel-controlled region in Ukraine as ""independent.""",https://www.npr.org/2022/02/23/1082602594/ukraine-crisis-draws-new-resolve-from-bipartisan-lawmakers-with-some-gop-critics
