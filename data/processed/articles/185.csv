Hundreds of structures, including transport facilities, hospitals, kindergartens and homes, have also been destroyed, according to Reuters.

“Children, women and defence forces are losing their lives every hour,” the emergency service said in a statement, Reuters reported.

Earlier this week, Ukrainian officials reported a civilian death toll of more than 350 people, including at least 14 children.

Ukraine’s defense ministry said on Sunday that roughly 4,300 Russian servicemen had been lost in the invasion.

Throughout Ukraine, civilians have taken up arms in defense of their country amid Russia’s ongoing attack.

However, as Moscow’s military has targeted hospitals and civilian centers, the violence is widely expected to intensify in the coming days.

“Reports of Russia’s human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law are mounting by the hour,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the United Nations Human Rights Council on Monday.

“Russian strikes are hitting schools, hospitals, residential buildings, are destroying critical infrastructure, which provides millions of people across Ukraine with drinking water, gas to keep them from freezing to death,” he added.

A Russian military convoy stretching some 40 miles was detected in the outskirts of Kyiv earlier this week as fighting continued in other Ukrainian cities like Kharkiv.

Addressing his German counterpart, Bennett says, “We also have a responsibility to make sure that Iran does not have nuclear weapons, and that there will be no possibility of acquiring nuclear weapons — not on our watch, and never,” in line with Israel’s longstanding view of nuclear Iran as one of its greatest security threats.

“We are following with concern the talks in Vienna, and the possibility that an agreement will be signed that will allow Iran to install centrifuges on a large scale within a few years is not acceptable to us.”

Regarding the war in Ukraine, Bennett expresses support for civilians, but does not address military aid, requests for which Israel has previously denied.

“Israel stands by the Ukrainian people,” Bennett says, noting that Israel on Monday and Tuesday sent 100 tons of humanitarian aid to Ukraine. “We are dedicated to continue [supporting the Ukrainian people] and to do more.”

However, Bennett declined to respond to questions regarding whether Israel would change its decision not to send military aid to Ukraine.

Israel is walking a tightrope in its policy toward Ukraine, professing support for Ukraine while endeavoring to maintain good relations with Russia, which has a military presence in Israel’s northern neighbor Syria.

Focusing on the German-Israeli relationship, Bennett says he and Scholz are forging new partnerships, in addition to thanking Scholz for insisting on their visit to Yad Vashem earlier in the day.

“I’m happy to report that today the chancellor and I agreed upon the creation of new strategic cooperation between Germany and the State of Israel,” says Bennett. “It’s the format of a dialogue that will happen twice a year, on security and state issues.”

Despite Scholz’s short visit, Bennett says that the chancellor “insisted that the visit to Yad Vashem would [happen in full]. And I could see that your mind was there as well as your heart.”

The latest: Russian troops have seized the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in the southeast after hours of shelling that resulted in Ukrainian deaths and sparked a since-extinguished fire nearby, Ukrainian officials said. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russian forces of ""nuclear terror.""

Local officials and the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog reported that the plant was secured, but Zelensky urged European leaders to ""wake up"" and stop Russia's military ""before this becomes a nuclear disaster.""

President Biden said after speaking with Zelensky over the phone that Russia should ""cease its military activities"" at the plant. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who also spoke with Zelensky, is seeking an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting in the coming hours over the shelling.

Meanwhile, the U.K. Ministry of Defense said in a Friday intelligence update that the southeastern city of ""Mariupol remains under Ukrainian control but has likely been encircled"" by Russian forces. ""The city's civilian infrastructure has been subjected to intense Russian strikes,"" the MoD added.

Local officials say the population is running out of electricity, heating and water, and the humanitarian situation is dire.

State of play: Russian forces in the south are seeking to cut off Ukraine's access to the sea, advancing toward the major port city of Mykolaiv after taking control of Kherson. A senior U.S. defense official said Russian troops in the south have not experienced the same logistical and supply issues that have held up the offensive near Kyiv.

The official told reporters Thursday that 90% of the Russian forces that had massed on the border were inside Ukraine, and that Russia has launched 480 missiles since the start of the invasion. Most of Ukraine's air and missile defense systems remain intact.

The head of Ukraine's military intelligence agency told Military Times that Ukrainian fighter jets have been striking the 40-mile Russian convoy outside of Kyiv, which U.S. and U.K. officials say remains ""stalled"" due to fuel and food shortages.

Zoom out: In a second round of peace talks near the Ukraine-Belarus border on Thursday, the Ukrainian and Russian delegations agreed to organize humanitarian corridors to allow civilians to flee, but made no progress toward ending the war, according to a Ukrainian official.

Russian President Vladimir Putin told French President Emmanuel Macron during a 90-minute phone call Thursday that his goals — demilitarization and ""denazification"" of Ukraine — would be achieved no matter what, a Kremlin official said.

In a televised statement to his Security Council, Putin accused the Ukrainian military of using civilians and foreigners as human shields, in an apparent attempt to shift blame for the fast-growing civilian death toll from his invasion.

Putin said the family members of Russian troops killed in Ukraine would receive up to 7 million rubles ($65,000). He claimed, despite evidence to the contrary, that the invasion was going to plan and that Russia's forces ""completely understand what they are fighting for.""

The White House sent Congress a request on Thursday for $10 billion in additional humanitarian, security and economist assistance for Ukraine.

The big picture: The Russian plan to sprint to Kyiv and force a swift capitulation has faltered under stout Ukrainian resistance. But Russian forces are taking towns and cities, particularly in the south, intensifying their bombardments and continuing to funnel forces toward the capital.

Kharkiv, a Russian-speaking city of 1.4 million, has been under siege for days. Zelensky accused Russia of war crimes after Kharkiv's central square was destroyed in a missile strike.

The humanitarian situation in Kharkiv, Mariupol, Chernihiv and suburbs north of Kyiv under consistent Russian assault is growing increasingly dire.

What they're saying: In a Thursday video address, Zelensky called Ukraine ""a nation that broke the enemy's plans in a week — plans that have been built for years, treacherously, deliberately, with hatred of our country, of our people, of any people who have heart and freedom.""

By the numbers: Ukraine's State Emergency Service said Wednesday that more than 2,000 civilians have been killed since Russia invaded on Feb. 24. Attacks on civilian areas have increased in the past 48 hours, but the casualty number is impossible to verify.

In its first acknowledgment of significant casualties, Russia's defense ministry announced Wednesday that 498 Russian troops had been killed and 1,597 injured. Ukraine has claimed its forces have killed more than 5,300 Russian troops. Neither figures have been independently verified.

A senior U.S. defense official declined to comment on the accuracy of the Russian figures, but said: ""My advice to anyone would be to be extremely skeptical over any information the Russian Ministry of Defense puts out there.""

At least 1 million Ukrainians have fled to neighboring countries, the U.N. said Wednesday.

The EU is planning to allow Ukrainian refugees to live and work in the bloc for up to three years.

In Russia, citizens are watching their savings deplete as the ruble crashes and losing access to everything from new iPhones to Disney films to flights to Europe. The Russian stock market remains closed but investors are desperate to get their money out.

Russian authorities have vowed to arrest anyone who protests, but there have still been significant gatherings in Moscow and St. Petersburg.

What else is happening: 141 countries voted in favor of a UN General Assembly resolution on Wednesday ""deploring"" Russia's aggression, while five voted against and 34 abstained.

Ukrainian authorities claimed they had foiled an assassination plot against Zelensky by a unit of elite Chechen special forces, in part thanks to tips from members of Russia's Federal Security Service who do not support the war. That claim could not be verified.

Zelensky is pushing for an accelerated acceptance into the European Union, which he said would be a signal that Europe accepted Ukraine as an equal member. It would also be an economic boon after the war.

He's also pleading with NATO for a no-fly zone, but that would force NATO to possibly shoot down Russian troops and risk a far wider conflict between nuclear powers.

Russian officials have made vague threats of a wider war.

Former President Dmitry Medvedev tweeted a warning that ""in human history, economic wars quite often turned into real ones,"" while Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned that a third world war would turn into a nuclear war.

Putin has put Russia’s nuclear deterrence force on alert, citing the sanctions and ""aggressive language"" from the West.

U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin canceled a ballistic missile test scheduled for this week ""to demonstrate we are a responsible nuclear power"" in response to Putin's actions.

The U.S. and European allies were scrambling to get weapons through Poland to the front while they still can. Moscow has said it will hold countries that supply weapons used on Russian troops responsible.

What to watch: With Russia closing in on Ukraine’s largest cities and employing aggressive tactics, such as the bombing of civilian areas, the danger to civilians is growing.

The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has opened an investigation into allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide committed in Ukraine since 2013.

With peace talks showing little likelihood of success, analysts and officials are considering what off-ramps might still be available.

The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting on Friday in response to Russia’s attack and capture of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, which caused worldwide alarm about the potential for a nuclear accident if the conflict in Ukraine is not contained.

The United States and its allies denounced Russia for the attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine, calling it a threat to civilians and a reckless escalation. They condemned the seizure of the plant and called for Russia to withdraw its troops from Zaporizhzhia and from the former Chernobyl nuclear plant in northern Ukraine.

“By the grace of God, the world narrowly averted a nuclear catastrophe last night,” said Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. “Mr. Putin must stop this madness, and he must stop it now. Cooler heads must prevail.”

Early on Friday, as fighting reached the vicinity of the Zaporizhzhia plant, a fire started at a training building. The fire was extinguished, and the plant appeared to be safe on Friday. Ukrainian officials and the International Atomic Energy Agency said the fire had been contained without damage to the reactors or other equipment, and that radiation levels had not increased.

“This is the first time that a state has attacked a fueled and functioning nuclear power plant,” said Britain’s U.N. ambassador, Barbara Woodward, who had called for the Security Council meeting. “It must not happen again.”

Russia’s ambassador, Vasily Nebenzya, told the council that the allegations that Russia had attacked the nuclear site were “lies” and part of an anti-Russian campaign. He said the emergency meeting had been called to “kindle artificial hysteria about what is taking place in Ukraine.”

Mr. Nebenzya offered a different account of the incident, saying that Russian troops patrolling the area of the nuclear facility had come under fire from Ukrainian forces inside the training building and had returned fire. He accused Ukrainians of setting the blaze.

“Our servicemen are not interfering with the work of the operators of the power plants and only working to ensure stability,” Mr. Nebenzya said, adding that Russia had experienced the 1986 Chernobyl disaster and did not want to see another nuclear accident.

The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, briefed the council from an airplane en route to Iran. Mr. Grossi said he had proposed to the Ukrainian and Russian authorities that he travel to Ukraine as soon as possible and visit both nuclear sites, Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhia, to establish a framework to protect them.

Mr. Grossi said his mission would not be political and would be restricted to ensuring “the safety and security of nuclear establishments of Ukraine, which, as facts have shown, are in constant danger of accidents.” He added that the Zaporizhzhia facility was operating normally, but said he had informed the I.A.E.A. board of governors that “there is no normalcy to the situation when there are military forces in charge of the site.”

Beyond the statements of diplomats, the Security Council cannot take significant action against Russia because the country has veto power over legally binding resolutions. Russia vetoed a resolution last week that condemned its invasion of Ukraine and called for the immediate withdrawal of its troops.

The U.N. General Assembly, a 193-member body, passed a resolution on Wednesday that condemned the invasion and called for humanitarian access and a diplomatic solution. That resolution, which was politically symbolic but not legally binding, passed with 141 countries voting in favor, demonstrating Russia’s isolation on the world stage, diplomats said.

Kramer', 'Aurelien Breeden', 'Christopher F. Schuetze', 'Michael Schwirtz']",2022-03-02 00:00:00,"BEIJING — On Wednesday night, the organizers of the Paralympic Winter Games were resolute that they had no option except to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete. On Thursday afternoon, they were equally resolute when they came to the opposite conclusion.

In a stunning reversal, the International Paralympic Committee bowed to heavy internal pressure and barred athletes from Russia and Belarus on the eve of the opening ceremony, extending the global sporting isolation of both countries in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine.

Citing threats by several federations to boycott the Paralympic Games, mounting discontent in the athletes’ village and fears that a “deteriorating” situation there could lead to violence, the International Paralympic Committee said the situation had changed so dramatically overnight that the viability of the Games would be in jeopardy if organizers did not expel the Russian and Belarusian delegations.

“The environment in the village is deteriorating,” said Andrew Parsons, the president of the I.P.C. He said rising anger and threats by multiple national committees, some under pressure from their governments, to withdraw from the Games had made the situation “untenable.”

Russia’s sports minister, Oleg Matytsin, told journalists in Moscow that the country was preparing an immediate appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland that would seek to overturn the exclusion of Russian athletes before the Games open.

“Today’s decision of the International Paralympic Committee to bar our team is a blatant violation of athletes’ rights and a manipulation of the Olympic Charter and human lives’ values in pursue of political goals,” Matytsin said, according to the state-run news agency TASS.

The announcement came less than a day after the committee had said it would allow athletes from both countries to compete as neutrals in Beijing, a response to the invasion that was widely criticized as inadequate. By Thursday morning, Paralympic officials met again and decided they had little choice but to throw out the two teams.

Parsons said that there had been no reports of confrontations or violence between athletes, but that tensions were rising. He said there was a “huge” concern for the safety of participants, including 71 Russians athletes.

“The village is not the place for fights,” Parsons said.

The move made the Paralympics the latest international sporting organization to bar Russian and Belarusian athletes and teams in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which was staged with Belarusian support. Sports like soccer, tennis, auto racing and figure skating already have barred Russian and Belarusian athletes since the International Olympic Committee took the extraordinary step this week of suggesting global federations and event organizers put in place a global ban on athletes from the two countries as a result of their actions in Ukraine.

The Russian and Belarusian Paralympic delegations — whose athletes initially had been cleared to compete if they agreed to do so without their national names, flags or anthems — could appeal the decision in court. But the Games are set to hold their opening ceremony on Friday, and their first events on Saturday.

Russia’s Paralympic committee criticized the reversal as “completely unfounded,” and said it unfairly portrayed the Russian committee and its Paralympic athletes “as the perpetrators of the current political conflicts.”

“In this regard, the R.P.C. considers the I.P.C.’s decision illegal and reserves the right to defend the rights and interests of Russian para athletes” in court, it said in a statement.

Athletes from both Ukraine and Russia practiced on Thursday, sometimes side by side, but Parsons said the I.P.C. now would work with the Russian and Belarusian delegations to get their teams home from China.

On Wednesday, Parsons had said the I.P.C. could not remove the athletes from Russia and Belarus because there was no specific mechanism to do so in the organization’s constitution; at the time, he said it was the I.P.C.’s “duty” to allow the Russians to participate.

On Thursday, he acknowledged that the legal situation had not changed, but that the situation on the ground had. The executive board, he argued, was equally bound to protect the viability of the Paralympic Games in the face of growing discontent. By Thursday, for example, teams in wheelchair curling and sled hockey had informed Paralympic officials that they would refuse to play against Russian opponents.

“The I.P.C. is a membership-based organization,” he said, “and we are receptive to the views of our member organizations.”

By then, Parsons said, a large number of members had reached out and urged the I.P.C. to reconsider its decision. Ukraine’s athletes released a statement voicing their disapproval, saying the claims of “political neutrality” from sports administrators were “a convenient lie used to deflect calls to stand up for human rights and peace.”

On Thursday, their team’s leader left no doubt about the country’s position. “Russia and Belarus must leave the Paralympic Games as soon as possible,” said Valerii Sushkevich, a member of Ukraine’s parliament and the president of the nation’s Paralympic committee.

Parsons, who had declared on Wednesday that the Russian and Belarussian athletes had a right to compete because they were not responsible for the invasion, expressed regret on Thursday that their dreams of competing at the Games would not be fulfilled.

“To the para athletes from the impacted countries, we are very sorry that you are affected by the decisions that your government took last week in breaching the Olympic truce,” he said. “You are victims of your government’s actions.”

The Games, though, will go ahead. The opening ceremony will take place in Beijing on Friday night, and competition begins Saturday in Alpine skiing, sled hockey, cross-country skiing and wheelchair curling.

Said Parsons: “We can at least preserve the experience for the around 600 athletes that are still competing here.”",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/03/02/world/ukraine-russia-war

Russian military forces escalated attacks on civilian areas of Ukraine's largest cities Wednesday as the nation's leaders pledged to repel the invaders and the citizenry joined the military effort to defend their battered country.

""We are a people who in a week have destroyed the plans of the enemy,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a video address early Thursday local time. “They will have no peace here. They will have no food. They will have here not one quiet moment.”

Meanwhile, the United Nations General Assembly voted 141-5, with 35 abstentions, to demand Russia halt the war. The vote came after the 193-member assembly convened its first emergency session in a quarter century.

Also Wednesday, the prosecutor for the International Criminal Court opened an investigation into whether Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin, have committed war crimes.

Zelenskyy, in a televised address to the nation one week into the hostilities, rallied his people and praised them for their resolve.

“During this time, we have truly become one,"" Zelenskyy said. ""We forgave each other. We started loving each other. We help each other. We are worried for each other.""

Russian forces appear to have gained their first major prize by taking control of Kherson, a port city of almost 300,000 in southern Ukraine. Zelenskyy's office said the fighting in Kherson continued, but Mayor Igor Kolykhaev said there were no Ukrainian forces left.

Outside Kyiv, an enormous Russian military convoy -- estimated at 40 miles -- continues to encounter strong Ukrainian resistance and supply problems, stalling its progress toward the capital city.

In the besieged northeastern city of Kharkiv, Mayor Igor Terekhov said the unrelenting assault has caused ""massive destruction."" A rocket strike hit the regional police headquarters, killing four people and wounding several others, Ukraine Emergency Services said.

Food, medicine and other supplies were being distributed at central locations and by trucks rolling through the city of 1.5 million residents, the mayor said. Efforts were underway to provide heat to lost utilities in the bombing as temperatures dip toward freezing.

""Kharkiv is holding on and will hold on,"" Terekhov said on Ukrainian TV. ""Today the main goal of our enemy is to sow panic and devastation, but Kharkiv will always stand.""

In Melitopol, a city of 150,000 people in the southeast, thousands of people took to the streets to stop the Russian occupation of the city, the government said.

In one week, more than 2% of Ukraine’s population has been forced out of the country, according to a tally from the United Nations released to The Associated Press. The number topped 1 million on Wednesday.

►The U.N. human rights office reported 136 civilian deaths, but the true toll was likely much higher. Ukrainian emergency services, meanwhile, say more than 2,000 Ukrainian civilians have died. Observers say Russian troops have killed hundreds of civilians, including more than a dozen children.

►The Associated Press, citing a senior Western intelligence official, estimated that 5,000 Russian soldiers had been captured or killed in the biggest ground war in Europe since World War II. Zelenskyy estimated the Russian death toll at 6,000.

International Criminal Court looks into war crimes by Putin, Russia

Urged by a coalition of 38 countries led by the U.K., the International Criminal Court’s prosecutor opened an investigation Wednesday into possible war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide in Ukraine dating back to 2013, but also covering the current conflict sparked by Russia’s invasion.

ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan was able to proceed directly to an investigation without the need of judicial approval after receiving a state party referral from the largest coalition of countries in ICC history.

""Russia’s use of indiscriminate force against innocent civilians, in its illegal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, amounts to war crimes, for which the (President Vladimir) Putin regime must be held accountable,'' the U.K. Foreign Office said in a statement.

The release also quoted Foreign Secretary Liz Truss as saying: ""An investigation by the International Criminal Court into Russia’s barbaric acts is urgently needed and it is right that those responsible are held to account. The UK will work closely with allies to ensure justice is done.”

Southern port city of Kherson appears to fall to Russian forces

Amid conflicting reports about whether the southern port city of Kherson has been taken over by the Russians, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s office said fighting is still ongoing, adding that it could not comment further while the battle was being waged.

However, Russian officials said they're in ""complete control,'' and Kherson Mayor Igor Kolykhaev made it sound like the battle is over, saying Russian soldiers came into the city administration building. Kolykhaev said he asked them not to shoot civilians and to allow them to gather up the bodies from the streets.

“I simply asked them not to shoot at people,” Kolykhaev said in a statement. “We don’t have any Ukrainian forces in the city, only civilians and people here who want to LIVE.”

UN General Assembly demands Russia end hostilities, exit Ukraine

The United Nations General Assembly voted 141 to 5 to demand Russia halt the war. China was among 35 countries that abstained. Belarus and North Korea were among Russia's supporters, along with Syria and Eritrea. Longtime allies China, Cuba and Venezuela abstained.

U.N. Secretary General António Guterres said after the vote that the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine must be respected in line with the U.N .Charter. He said the ""brutal effects"" of the conflict on Ukrainians were plain to see – and that the situation would get much worse.

He also said the U.N. appeal for humanitarian aid was met with record generosity that will fund delivery of vital medical and health supplies, food, drinking water, shelter and protection.

""The message of the General Assembly is loud and clear. End hostilities in Ukraine now,"" Guterres said. ""Silence the guns now. Open the door to dialogue and diplomacy now.""

Last week Moscow vetoed a similar resolution before the U.N. Security Council.

Justice Department to target oligarchs who support Putin

The U.S. is trying to pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin from a number of angles, and one of them is his financial support.

The Justice Department on Wednesday announced a special task force to go after the assets of billionaire oligarchs who support Putin and benefit from his regime.

President Joe Biden zeroed in on Russian financial and political elites in his State of the Union address Tuesday, saying: ""Tonight I say to the Russian oligarchs and corrupt leaders who have bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime: 'No more.'

""We are joining with our European allies to find and seize your yachts, your luxury apartments, your private jets. We are coming for your ill-begotten gains.""

Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement the primary goal of the task force will be to enforce the sweeping sanctions and restrictions the U.S. and its allies and partners have imposed on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine says station where residents have sought refuge was hit by missile

The office of Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told The Associated Press that a missile hit Wednesday in central Kyiv between the Southern Railway station and the Ibis hotel, an area near Ukraine’s Defense Ministry. It was not known how much damage the strike caused and whether there were casualties.

The Southern Railway station is a major part of the main passenger rail complex that thousands have used to flee the war over the past week. Two stations are connected by an overhead corridor that crosses over about a dozen tracks.

“Russian terrorists launched an air strike on the South Railway Station in Kyiv, where thousands of Ukrainian women and children are being evacuated,” the national railway company said.

The U.S. is slapping additional sanctions against Russia and Belarus over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

The White House said Wednesday the U.S. will impose stringent export controls on Belarus, which has hosted Russian troops and equipment and has been a Russian staging ground for the attack. The export controls aim to prevent the diversion of items, technologies and software through Russia to Belarus and limit the two countries’ ability to obtain materials they need for the invasion.

The State Department is imposing sanctions that target Russia’s defense sector. Twenty-two Russian defense-related entities will be targeted, including firms that make combat aircraft, infantry fighting vehicles, electronic warfare systems, missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles for Russia’s military.

The U.S. also is restricting exports on oil and gas extraction equipment to Russia, which could degrade Moscow’s status as a leading energy supplier, and is targeting entities that have been involved with or supported Russian and Belarusian security services, military and defense sectors.

That will keep the military, aerospace, maritime and high-technology sectors in those countries from obtaining U.S. goods and technology that can be used to support Russian technical maintenance and innovation, the White House said.

Huge Russian convoy outside Kyiv not making any progress

The massive Russian military convoy remains stalled outside Kyiv, encountering stiff resistance from Ukrainians and continuing shortages of fuel and food, a senior Defense Department official said Wednesday.

The convoy, whose estimated length is 40 miles, is a mix of combat and supply vehicles, said the official who described intelligence estimates on condition of anonymity. There are indications that Ukrainian forces have targeted the convoy with attacks.

The official estimated that 82% of Russia’s combat forces have entered Ukraine, nearly one week into its invasion. That’s up slightly from 80% on Tuesday.

The Russians continue to seek control of Ukraine’s largest cities, including Kyiv and Kharkiv, and have been met with “ferocious” resistance, the official said.

The Russian convoy has made no appreciable progress in the last 24 hours, leaving it about 15 miles from Kyiv’s city center. They continue to face fuel and shortages and appear to be behind schedule, the official said.

Russia has yet to gain control of Ukrainian air space. Meanwhile, U.S. shipments of arms and other supplies has continued to arrive in Ukraine, the official said, declining to say how it was transported.

Russia’s failure thus far to coordinate its air, ground and sea attack has come a surprise, the official said. Ukrainian resistance, supply problems and a risk-averse approach appear to be hindering the Russians.

Russian owner of Chelsea soccer club says he'll sell, donate proceeds to victims

Roman Abramovich, the Russian owner who turned Chelsea into one of the British Premier League's top clubs with his massive infusion of money, said he will sell the soccer team and donate the net proceeds to victims of the war in Ukraine.

Abramovich had been looking for a way to relinquish control of the club while retaining ownership, but a week into Russia’s invasion, pressure was growing on the British government to include him among the wealthy Russians to be targeted in sanctions.

Abramovich said in a statement that it pained him to part with Chelsea, but was making the decision ""in the best interest of the Club, the fans, the employees, as well as the Club’s sponsors and partners.''

He also said gains from the sale would be used to set up a charitable foundation. ""The foundation will be for the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine. This includes providing critical funds towards the urgent and immediate needs of victims, as well as supporting the long-term work of recovery.''

Some Russian oligarchs speak out against war

Russia’s war on Ukraine has rattled many wealthy Russians at home and around the world who suddenly face sanctions that could jeopardize their jetset lifestyles. President Joe Biden, in Tuesday's State of the Union, warned that ""we are coming for your ill-begotten gains.”

Alexei Mordashov, a steel magnate and Russia's richest man, has been blacklisted by the European Union. Mordashov said he doesn't see how his sanctions will help settle the ""dreadful conflict"" in Ukraine, according to his statement to TASS, a Russian news agency.

“I have absolutely nothing to do with the emergence of the current geopolitical tension,” Mordashov said Monday. “I do not understand why the EU has imposed sanctions on me.”

Metals mogul Oleg Deripaska, Alfa Bank founder Mikhail Fridman and banker Oleg Tinkov urged an end to the war.

London’s Evening Standard newspaper published a front-page, anti-war statement from its Russia-born owner, Evgeny Lebedev, this week. “As a Russian citizen I plead with you to stop Russians killing their Ukrainian brothers and sisters,"" Lebedev said. ""As a British citizen I ask you to save Europe from war.”

Grassroots resistance fuels Ukrainian war effort

U.S. officials say Russian forces have grown increasingly frustrated by Ukrainian resistance, but they have warned that Moscow's military superiority will likely limit Ukraine's ability to fight back over time. Ukrainians are nonetheless still finding ways big and small to resist Russian President Vladimir Putin any way they can.

“Freedom is above all for us,” said Oleksandr Rybitskyi, 27. On Monday, he detained three Russian agents masquerading as Ukrainians in his city, which he didn't want to identify for fear of drawing attention to it. “I help maintain order.""

In the western city of Lviv, dozens of volunteers lined up at the library to help shred old shirts, sheets and other cloth into long strips, to be braided into camouflage coverage for troops on the frontlines.

“We don’t want to spend all day running back and forth to a bunker, waiting for the worst,” said Iryna Bidna, 24.

Zelenskyy to Ukrainians: 'The whole world admires you'

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the actor turned wartime president, has earned international praise for his viral speeches from the streets of war-battered Kyiv while boosting morale among Ukrainians on the ground.

“Take care of your brothers in arms. I admire you,"" Zelenskyy said in a speech Wednesday. ""The whole world admires you, from Hollywood stars to politicians. Today, you Ukrainians are a symbol of invincibility. A symbol that people in any country can become the best people on Earth at any moment.""

He chided the Russians targeting major cities such as Borodyanka, Kharkiv and Kyiv, saying the attacks were meant to “erase our country. Erase us all.” Zelenskyy said more than 6,000 Russian troops had died in the first six days of fighting, according to the Ukrainian military's count.

“To get what? To get Ukraine? It is impossible,” Zelenskyy said.

Zelenskyy reiterated Ukraine’s desire to join the European Union, a move EU officials have praised. Ukraine formally signed an accelerated application to join the bloc days after Russia's invasion of the country began.

Twitter suspends Russian state media in Europe

Twitter will ban the accounts of Kremlin-backed media outlets RT and Sputnik in Europe after sanctions from European Union officials targeted Russian state media for spreading disinformation. Twitter joins other social media giants such as TikTok, YouTube and Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, in restricting access to Russian state media. Apple, Google and Microsoft pulled RT apps from their platforms in Europe.

RT and Sputnik have been accused of spreading false information about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Broadcasters in Europe including France, Germany and the United Kingdom have banned RT from the airwaves. The Kremlin has threatened to retaliate on Western media outlets operating in Russia should Russian-state media continue to be blocked.

Russian foreign minister: World War III would be ‘nuclear and destructive’

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Wednesday that another world war would be “nuclear and destructive” for all parties, and he condemned Western sanctions on the Kremlin’s unprovoked war in Ukraine. Lavrov, in an interview with Al-Jazeera News, claimed Russia would face “real danger” should Ukraine acquire nuclear weapons; Ukraine has not attempted to acquire nuclear weapons and Russia has provided no evidence to support its claims to the contrary.

Putin over the weekend ordered the Kremlin’s nuclear arsenal to be on heightened alert, a provocative step that officials in the Biden administration and NATO allies called reckless. Military aid to Ukraine and more rounds of sanctions, however, did not waver after the escalation.

Lavrov said that while Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government had been prepared for the series of stringent economic sanctions levied at Russia since the invasion of Ukraine, they had been caught off-guard by sanctions on athletes and personnel.

Ukraine raises $270M in a hurry to help fund war

The Ukrainian government raised $270 million in war bonds after it began issuing the assets to fund its defense of the country from Russian invasion. Ukraine’s central bank enacted capital controls amid the Russian invasion, making it difficult for foreign investors to participate in the program. That hasn’t stopped many international and local investors from buying the bonds, according to Ukraine’s finance ministry.

“The proceeds from the bonds will be used to meet the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and to ensure the uninterrupted provision of the state's financial needs under the war,” Ukraine’s Ministry of Finance tweeted.

The Ukrainian government continues to lobby for stricter sanctions on Russian financial institutions and businesses. Western sanctions on Russia have so far caused the ruble to plummet in value, while everyday Russians and economic elites rush to shield their wealth from financial crisis.

Harris: US troops won’t fight Russians in Ukraine

Vice President Kamala Harris reiterated that U.S. troops will not fight Russians in Ukraine as the Kremlin continues its advance. Appearing on NBC News Wednesday morning, Harris also said it would be “irresponsible” to engage in nuclear escalation after Russian President Vladimir Putin said he had put the country’s nuclear arsenal on alert.

“Our position is we are not going to contribute to an escalation in that direction and we have no intention of changing our posture,” Harris told NBC News anchor Savannah Guthrie.

Harris made the rounds Wednesday across several network morning shows.

“We are not going to put U.S, troops in Ukraine to fight Russians on the ground or in the air, but we are firm in our preparedness to defend our allies,” she said, echoing President Joe Biden’s vow to defend “every inch of NATO territory.”

Ukraine is not a member of NATO, but the U.S. has sent troops to reinforce NATO’s eastern flank.

Russian delegation ready to resume talks, Kremlin spokesman says

Russian negotiators are ready to resume talks with Ukrainian officials but cannot ""predict whether Ukrainian negotiators will show up or not,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday.

""Let's hope this happens,"" Peskov said. ""Ours will be there and ready.""

Peskov said Putin's culture adviser Vladimir Medinsky remains the main negotiator for Russia. Talks held Monday near the Belarus-Ukraine border produced no breakthrough, though the two sides agreed to meet again. It was not clear when talks would continue.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has previously accused the Kremlin of trying to force him into concessions by intensifying the invasion.

""Fair negotiations can occur when one side does not hit the other side with rocket artillery at the very moment of negotiations,” he said.

From Olympics to war: Ukraine athlete joins war effort

World champion biathlete Dmytro Pidruchnyi, who last month was competing at the Winter Olympics for Ukraine, has joined his nation's military. He posted a photo on Instagram of himself in uniform, and the post drew more than 7,300 ""likes"" and many comments of support.

""I’m grateful to everyone who texts me and worries about my family and to those who support and help Ukraine,"" Pidruchnyi wrote. ""I’m currently in my hometown Ternopil serving in the National Guard of Ukraine. This photo was taken during air alarm.""

In another post, Pidruchnyi asks for donations for the Ukraine army and for moral support.

""Don’t tell me that sport is not related to the politics,"" he said. ""IT IS RELATED!! when the soldiers and civilians of my Motherland are dying while you are reading this.""

Biden: Putin is more 'isolated from the world' than ever

President Joe Biden hailed the united response of the U.S. and Western allies against Russian President Vladimir Putin during his State of the Union address Tuesday night as Russia continues its war in Ukraine.

Biden called the attack “premeditated and totally unprovoked,” adding that Putin thought he could divide the world. “But Putin was wrong. We are ready. We are united,” Biden said. “Putin is now isolated from the world more than he has ever been.""

Biden said the U.S. and western allies are enforcing ""powerful economic sanctions,"" including cutting off Russia's largest banks from international financial systems, preventing Russia's central bank from shoring up the Russian ruble and ""making Putin's $260 billion war fund worthless.""

He announced the U.S. is closing off airspace to all Russian flights, joining a growing number of countries around the world that have made similar moves in recent days. Biden also said he is working with 30 countries to release 60 million barrels of oil from reserves around the world to ease the impact of the war in Ukraine on energy markets.

Is Putin committing war crimes? What the experts say.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has described Russian President Vladimir Putin’s overnight attack on in civilian areas of Kharkiv as a ""war crime.""

Meanwhile, on Monday, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court in The Hague said he plans to open an investigation ""as rapidly as possible"" into possible war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine.

""Is Vladimir Putin committing a war crime? Yes. It’s very clear,"" said David Schwendiman, a former senior Justice Department lawyer and international war crimes prosecutor.

But war crime experts say the post-World War II effort to create an international framework to thwart brutal dictators such as Adolf Hitler is too toothless, caught up in power politics and focused on war crimes already committed to make a difference when it comes to Russia’s invasion.

United States to ban Russian planes from American airspace

President Joe Biden said in his State of the Union address Tuesday night that the U.S. is closing its airspace to Russian planes in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The U.S. joins a growing list of countries that have announced plans to close their airspace to Russian aircraft in response to the invasion. The European Union took that step Sunday after several European countries, including France, Italy and Denmark, announced the move.

Canada also joined the international move to cut off Russian aircraft.

Cities under siege: A look at Kyiv and Kharkiv by the numbers

The war has thrown a global spotlight on Ukraine's two largest cities, Kyiv and Kharkiv.

Kyiv's (KEE-ev) population of 2.7 million people would make it the third largest in the U.S. slightly ahead of Chicago. The city covers 330 square miles – bigger than Chicago or New York, about the size of San Diego.

Kyiv is in north-central Ukraine, not far from the borders with Russia and Belarus. Ukrainian and Russian are commonly spoken in the city, among the oldest in Eastern Europe.

Kharkiv (kar-KEEV), 300 miles east of Kyiv and near the Russian border, has a population of about 1.4 million spread over about 135 square miles – about the size of Philadelphia, which has a population of about 1.5 million.

The country of Ukraine has a population of about 45 million people, a few million more than California, and is about 233,000 square miles – a bit smaller than Texas.

More than 2,000 Ukrainian civilians have so far been killed during Russia’s ongoing invasion, Ukraine’s State Emergency Service said Wednesday. CNN has not been able to independently verify this figure.

“More than 2,000 Ukrainians died, not counting our defenders,” the service said in a statement before removing it.

CNN has reached out to Ukraine’s State Emergency Service for more information.

“Children, women and our defense forces are losing their lives every hour,” the statement said before it was removed.

According to the service, some transport infrastructures, houses, hospitals and kindergartens have been “destroyed” by Russian forces over the last seven days.

Meanwhile, the United Nations’ reported civilian death toll is far lower than the “more than 2,000” figure, although the UN has cautioned that the real toll is likely to be “much higher.”

The United Nations High Commission for Human Rights said Tuesday that more than 500 civilian casualties had been reported in Ukraine by the UN – including at least 136 civilians killed and 400 civilians injured.

“Most of these casualties were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and air strikes,” the UN office said in a statement on Tuesday.

“These are only the casualties we were able to cross-check, and the real toll is likely to be much higher,” the statement added.
