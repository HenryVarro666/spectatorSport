Ukrainian officials said major fighting was underway in Ukraine's east, with the regional military governor of eastern Luhansk region urging civilians to evacuate some towns.

On Wednesday, Vadym Denysenko, adviser to Ukraine's Ministry of Interior, said, ""If we talk about the key directions where combat will be ongoing -- it's the Sloviansk [Donetsk region] and Barvinkove [Kharkiv region] directions, in the Luhansk region it's in the Popasna and Rubizhne areas and, of course, in Mariupol.""

Some background: Southeastern Mariupol has been under heavy bombardment for many weeks, with Ukrainian officials calling the situation in the encircled city a humanitarian catastrophe. According to officials, around 100,000 civilians require evacuation from Mariupol.

Further north, Serhii Haidai, the military governor of the Luhansk region issued a statement Wednesday calling for the evacuation of several towns in the region.

I urge the evacuation of Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Kreminna, Rubizhne, Popasna, Hirske,"" he said on Telegram. ""The Russians are destroying the railway connections of Donetsk region.""

Haidai said five evacuation corridors would be open Wednesday for getting civilians out of the region.

""We will take everyone out if the Russians allow us to get to the gathering places,"" he said. ""As you can see, they do not always observe the 'ceasefire regime.'""

Haidai added: ""I appeal to every resident of Luhansk region -- evacuate while it is safe. We cannot always get even to the southern part of Rubizhne.""

He added in a separate statement that the town of Popasna was under shelling by Grad rockets.

""There is no 'ceasefire mode' in Popasna,"" he said. ""The Russians are shelling with Grads, mortars, artillery. A significant number of private houses are on fire. Evacuation from Popasna is under threat today.""

UKRAINE: serious fighting in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, were explosions in Dnipropetrovksk region, Mariupol is still under blockade. The genocide of Ukrainians continues

WORLD: Pope Francis condemned the massacre in Bucha and raised the Ukrainian flag, which was sent to him from the city, where hundreds of civilians were shot.

The killings in Bucha near Kyiv have resonated globally, with the international community imposing more sanctions on Russia.

This was stated by the head of the British government Boris Johnson: «When we look at what is happening in Bucha, what Putin has done in Ukraine, and what I think is very close to genocide, it is not surprising that people react in this way».

He also added that the international community, including the United Kingdom, would move synchronously to «impose new sanctions and restrictions on the regime of Vladimir Putin.»

Usual fascism. There was such a film by Mikhail Romm. By the way, I do not agree that what is shown in the film is fascism.

Russia without Nazism is not Russia

Classic fascism is Mussolini's regime. Pretty herbivorous, by the way, when compared with the Nazism of Nazi Germany. Or with socialism in the version of Lenin-Stalin. It's like comparing a hamster to man-eating tigers: all three are mammals, but that's where the similarities end.

Romm's film is about Nazism and its bloody legacy. But in Soviet reality, analogies of red and brown were carefully avoided, so Nazism was covered up with a “fascism” sign so that it would never occur to anyone that the USSR was a real fascist power. Like, we're not like that! We are different!

Today there is a very precise term describing the current mainstream Russian ideology: Russian fascism is rashism.

Nazism – Russian Nazism is an integral part of rashism. And the anti-Ukrainianism of the Russians, like the anti-Semitism of the Germans in its time, is the main axis of the rashist ideology. Her driving force, her blood. The current military psychosis in Russia, despite the disguise as anti-fascism, is pure Nazism with a history of expressive, outright anti-Ukrainianism.

In principle, Nazism in Russia is not a new phenomenon, but a familiar one. Internationalism, in which there are older brothers, but there are “ho * li”, “f * dy”, “black * rki”, “rodents”, “natsmen” – this is some kind of strange internationalism. But this has never been recognized at the state level. In the USSR, for example, there was never anti-Semitism, but there was a quota for the admission of Jews to institutions, to the party, to leadership positions.

Yes, even today, personally, I receive the largest number of national insults from Russian “non-fascists” . It is somehow strange for the declared goals of denazification of an entire nation, isn't it?

The new “Mein Kampf”

Now the Russian authorities have completely uncovered themselves. Let me quote Dmitry Medvedev, the second face of Russia, who sleeps forever:

“Deep Ukrainianism, which is fueled by anti-Russian poison and an all-consuming lie about its identity, is one big fake. This phenomenon has never happened in history. And now it does not exist. To change the bloody and full of false myths consciousness of part of today's Ukrainians is the the name of tranquility for future generations of Ukrainians themselves.”

The Ukrainian issue (or the solution of the Ukrainian issue) is a term used by the state media of the Russian Federation in describing the goals of Russian President Putin's policy towards the Ukrainian state. Federation in relation to the Ukrainian state after the victory of the Revolution of Dignity. The euphemism “final solution” meant the inclusion of Ukraine into the Russian Federation, or at least “Finlandization”, “demilitarization and denazification”.

The decision to invade Ukraine was based on a misrepresentation of Ukraine as a neo-Nazi proxy state influenced by much of the West and, according to historians, the memory of World War II.

This is me quoting the Wikipedia article, which It's called The Final Solution to the Jewish Question. It turns out that we have more in common with the Jews than one might suspect.

We must understand that in the minds of the deep Russian people, Ukrainians and Ukraine are dehumanized and reduced to the level of Untermensch. This has been done consistently and purposefully for twenty years. TV channels, books, films, the press, and the Internet were used to dehumanize.

Therefore, the support of today's terror in Ukraine among the population is not an accident, it is a purposefully formed psychosis, the result of many years of work of propagandists.

Yesterday's article on the official Russian resource is an anti-Ukrainian memorandum that practically opens the chapter of the new Russian “Mein Kampf”. With which I congratulate the Russians. Churchill never said that the fascists of the future would call themselves anti-fascists, but the phrase is prophetic, you will agree, whoever it belongs to.

How to destroy the Kremlin Reichstag

Romm's film is a stunning documentary evidence that reveals to the world the face of Hitler's Nazism. Today's shots from Bucha, Gostomel, Irpen are shots from a new film, terrible in its frankness. A film about Russian Nazism, about Russian occupation, about the atrocities committed by rashism on Ukrainian soil in 2022.

The first chapter. Too bad it's not the last one. We still do not know everything about the denazification procedure carried out by the Russian Nazis. There is still much to learn, much to be horrified.

Hitler's Nazism ended not with the ruins of the Reichstag, but at the moment when ordinary Germans were forced to look at the results of the crimes of their fellow citizens without turning away. Russian Nazism will end when ordinary Russians are forced to look at what Russian troops have done in Ukraine.

On people shot in the back of the head with their hands tied behind their backs. On raped ten-year-old girls. On Ukrainians burned by whole families. On women who were abused and crushed by a tank. On mass graves in the devastated Kiev suburbs. On corpses along the roadsides. On civilian vehicles shot from cannons.

In the meantime, rashism is alive, healthy and feeling great. And feeds on Ukrainian blood. And there is no other way to stop him than to win. Our victory.",https://newsreadonline.com/near-kiev-the-world-saw-only-the-first-chapter-of-russian-nazism/
