Kyiv, Ukraine - After a particularly horrific spate of attacks on civilians the day before, Thursday started with Ukrainian emergency services scrambling to assess the true toll of a devastating airstrike on the Mariupol Drama Theater.

Massive Russian attack on the Drama Theatre where hundreds of innocent civilians were hiding. The building is now fully ruined. Russians could not have not known this was a civilian shelter,"" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba had tweeted on Wednesday. According to multiple reports, hundreds of civilians had been sheltering inside the theater when it was hit. Images also showed the word ""CHILDREN"" spelled out in big white Russian letters on the ground in front of the building, presumably to ward off any attacks. It didn't stop the devastating airstrike, the consequences of which aren't yet fully known. Rubble is still blocking the entrance and authorities don't know how many people have been killed. Russia, meanwhile, flatly denied having carried out any ""operations"" in the area and blamed the Ukrainian Azov battalion – whose far-right reputation it has used to partly justify the ""denazification"" campaign – of bombing the theater. Daily Horoscope Today's horoscope: Free horoscope for Saturday, April 16, 2022 Separately, a group of 10 people was allegedly executed in the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv while they were lined up waiting for bread, according to a report by public broadcaster Suspilne. Despite some encouraging signals sent out by negotiators on Wednesday, a peace agreement is nowhere in sight. Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, has spent the past 24 hours ratcheting up the rhetoric, raging against the West, Ukraine, and Russians who oppose the war. Overall, though, the military offensive seems to have stalled on all fronts, while Russia's brutal shelling campaign continues. Here's the latest news as the war in Ukraine reaches its 22nd day.

The Russian military is increasingly attacking civilian facilities in Ukraine, according to the US Department of Defense. ""We have seen an increase of strikes on civilian infrastructure and civilian targets,"" a senior US defense official said on Thursday. At the same time, he stated morale among Russian soldiers was allegedly dwindling in places. ""We don't have insight into every unit and every location. But we certainly have picked up anecdotal indications that that that morale is not high in some units,"" the official said. It is worth noting that the Russian military is considering bringing supplies to Ukraine. The defense official also said it's not yet clear that this is happening, but the very fact it's an issue is an area of concern for Russia. ""So three weeks in, they're still able to maintain their force in the field, but not without difficulty. Three weeks in, we are seeing them begin to think about resupply from elsewhere, including manning support,"" the official said, adding, ""Two weeks and we saw them put out a call for foreign fighters, which we noted was also an interesting development."" Around the southwestern Ukrainian port city of Odessa, ongoing Russian naval activity is being observed, but the senior official noted there were no ""imminent signs"" of an attack from sea.

""We're not sure what they're planning to do, what they're preparing to do,"" the official said.

An attack in eastern Ukraine has left 21 dead and 25 injured, with 10 in critical condition, according to district prosecutors in the region of Kharkiv. The injuries came as a result of Russian shelling reported in the city of Merefa, where Ukrainian forces already accused Russian invaders of firing on a school and a community culture center during the night.

The claims could not be independently verified.

Slowly but surely, reports of civilians being rescued from beneath the Mariupol theaters ruins are emerging. The Associated Press cited Ludmyla Denisova, Ukraine's Commissioner for Human Rights, who said there were hopes that Wednesday's attack had not damaged the parts of the building where over 1,000 people were reportedly sheltering.

As of now, no deaths have been announced, but many are injured.

US President Joe Biden is to hold a phone call with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Friday to discuss ""Russia’s war against Ukraine and other issues of mutual concern."" ""This is part of our ongoing efforts to maintain open lines of communication between the United States and the PRC,"" the White House said in a statement, referring to the People’s Republic of China. The Chinese leadership has failed to explicitly condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and Western leaders have approached Xi to ascertain whether there is scope for Chinese mediation in the conflict.

China and Russia have deepened their relation in recent years.

Ivan Fedorov, the mayor of the Ukrainian city of Melitopol who was allegedly abducted last week, has been freed, the government in Kiev says. The 33-year-old was released on Wednesday in exchange for nine captured Russian conscripts, a spokesperson for Ukraine's presidential office said, according to local media. Fedorov was said to have been kidnapped last Friday. Melitopol has a population of almost 150,000 and has been occupied by Russian troops since nearly the start of the war three weeks ago.

Attacks on the northern city of Chernihiv have killed more than 50 people in one day, local authorities say. ""In the last 24 hours alone, 53 bodies of our citizens murdered by the Russian aggressor have arrived at the city's morgues,"" the head of the military administration, Vyacheslav Chaus, wrote on Telegram. Chernihiv, located near the borders with Russia and Belarus, has been the target of a Russian onslaught since the beginning of the war. Authorities say the humanitarian situation is calamitous and that there has been heavy damage to electricity, water and gas supplies. Further negotiations are planned for Thursday on a possible escape corridor through which civilians are to leave the city, Chaus said, adding that no Russian forces were currently in the city. ""I don't want to send the children of the city to certain death. The corridor will only take place if we reach an agreement,"" Chaus said.

The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, has documented the deaths of at least 780 civilians in Ukraine since Russian troops invaded three weeks ago, with 58 children and young people among the victims. He has made a point of stressing that the actual numbers are surely much higher.

At least one person was killed and three injured when debris from an intercepted missile hit a high-rise building in eastern Kiev overnight, local authorities said on Thursday. Video released by the emergency services on social media showed smoke and flames coming out of the destroyed flat. Other apartments had windows blown out and debris was scattered across the ground.

The rescue crews were able to bring the remaining residents to safety, the service said.

More than 1,000 people were sheltering in the Mariupol theater believed to have been the target of a Russian bombing, according to mayor Vadim Boichenko. Boichenko posted the information on his Telegram channel early Thursday, calling the incident ""another tragedy."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky meanwhile said in a video message that people had sought protection from shelling in the building and it was now destroyed, but said there was no information on fatalities yet. Member of Ukrainian parliament Sergiy Taruta posted on Facebook that people were emerging ""alive"" from the wreckage.

Private cars are being allowed out of Mariupol again, according to Boichenko. Some 6,500 cars left Mariupol in the last two days, but there was no ceasefire so civilians had to travel out of the city while it was under fire, he said.

Russia's war against the east European nation was its fourth week, leaving hundreds dead and thousands injured, and prompting one of the worst refugee crisis in Europe since the Second World War.

According to an AFP report, artillery fire hit a school and a cultural centre in the town of Merefa outside the city of Kharkiv. Of the wounded, 10 people are in serious condition.

Russian forces have continued to batter Ukrainian cities even as talks between the two sides continue.

Live updates on Russia-Ukraine war

In a Facebook post, regional prosecutors shared a photo that showed a building of several storeys that was destroyed in the middle with windows blown out and emergency workers combing through the wreckage.

Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city and some 30km (18 miles) north of Merefa, has been the scene of intense Russian air strikes in recent weeks and has been severely damaged.

Earlier in the day, authorities in the besieged port city of Mariupol said Russia bombed a theatre where ""hundreds"" of civilians were taking shelter. While Moscow has denied striking the theatre, reports said women and children had taken refuge there.

According to a photo shared by the authorities, the middle part of the building looked destroyed, while any report on the toll was yet to surface.

Meanwhile, the Kremlin has dismissed reports of “major progress” in ongoing talks with Ukraine to end the war, while blaming Kyiv for slowing the negotiations.

The fresh round of talks between representatives of the two warring nations that began on Monday, after multiple failed attempts, is set to continue on Thursday.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ukraine-war-russian-shelling-leaves-21-dead-in-east-ukrainian-town-101647526640479.html
2,04858bb8-a9d2-4738-be8a-fbbec5b3dbfb,[],,"The United States says that Ukraine will be given long-range missile defense and Switchblade armed drones, enabling Kyiv’s forces to better defend against Russian aircraft and armor from a distance.

The new arms and equipment that US President Biden announced for Ukraine include:

S-300 long-range missile defense

Ukraine has had the ability to shoot down Russian aircraft and cruise missiles at relatively close quarters. Washington is arranging for it to acquire systems that can strike attacking aircraft from much farther away.

According to a military source, the systems are the Soviet/Russian-made S-300, which like the US-made Patriot system, is a fully automated, ground-based radar-and-missile launcher unit that can detect, track and fire at multiple incoming aerial threats at long distances.

Ukrainians already know how to operate the S-300, and the United States and a number of NATO countries possess the systems or components of them to supply Ukraine.

‘Kamikaze drones’

Washington will send Ukraine 100 Switchblade drones, essentially camera-equipped, remote-controlled flying bombs that can be directed by an operator to find and then, when ready, plunge onto a target, exploding on contact.

Dubbed “kamikaze drones,” Switchblades can extend the range of attack on Russian vehicles and units to beyond the sight of the user. That gives them an advantage over the guided heat-seeking missiles that Ukrainians have used against Russian tanks.

Anti-aircraft Stingers

The United States is also giving 800 more Stingers, which are shoulder-mounted infrared anti-aircraft missiles. The US provided Stingers to Afghan fighters in the 1990s to shoot down Russian helicopters; Ukrainians have used them effectively against Russian helicopters and slower, lower-flying fixed-wing attack aircraft.

‘Saint Javelin’

Western allies have already provided the Ukrainian army with some 17,000 lightweight, shoulder-launched, self-guided missiles which have become the weapon of choice in the ground war. These are being used with great effect to destroy armored vehicles at close quarters.

Among those, the US-made Javelin, with dual charges designed to defeat Russian tanks’ anti-missile defenses, has become legendary in its effectiveness. A popular Ukrainian song extols it and there is now even a viral depiction of “Saint Javelin,” an Eastern iconography-style image of a woman cradling the weapon. Biden said Washington will send 2,000 more javelin missiles to Ukraine.

Guns, ammunition, body armor

The new US arms provisions also include 7,000 other anti-armor weapons, thousands of machine guns, rifles, and grenade launchers, 20 million rounds of small arms ammunition fitting both Russian and NATO standards, and 25,000 sets of body armor and helmets.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-march-17-2022/

March 17 (UPI) -- A rocket attack on the western Ukrainian town of Merefa left at least 21 people dead and 25 others injured Thursday, the town's mayor announced. Mayor Veniamin Sitov said the early-morning attack destroyed a school and community center. Merefa is a town of about 21,000 people located 13 miles southwest of the larger city of Kharkiv.

As Ukraine's second-largest city and located in the northeast near the Russian border, Kharkiv has been the focus of Moscow's attempts at capture. Ukrainian forces have so far held Russian troops at bay, but rockets, missiles and other artillery have pounded the city, reducing much of it to rubble.

Kharkiv's emergency services agency said at least 500 civilians in the city of 1.5 million have been killed. Much of the population are ethnic Russians and speak Russian, The New York Times reported.

""Kharkiv is not yet completely destroyed, but we hear constant shelling, constant bombing,"" resident Natalka Zubar told the Times. ""It's a place of constant airborne terror.""

New satellite images showed significant damage from Russian bombs across Ukraine on Thursday.

The satellite images from Maxar Technologies show major destruction from bombs in Volnovakha, about 35 miles north of Mariupol, and a number of homes on fire in eastern Chernihiv.

The images also show an airfield at the Kharkiv Aircraft Manufacturing Co. that's littered with impact craters.

It's not yet known how many people have been killed or injured from a Russian attack on a theater in the surrounded town of Mariupol on Wednesday. The theater was being used as a bomb shelter and officials believed more than 1,000 people were inside.

Sergiy Taruta, the former head of the Donetsk region, announced Thursday that about 130 survivors of the bombing were brought to safety.

""After an awful night of not knowing, we finally have good news from Mariupol on the morning of the 22nd day of the war,"" he wrote on Facebook, according to CNN. ""The bomb shelter was able to hold. The rubble is beginning to be cleared. People are coming out alive.""

Taruta said rescue efforts at the theater were slowed by a lack of civil services and the constant threat of Russian attacks.

""People are doing everything themselves. My friends went to help, but due to constant shelling, it was not safe. People are clearing away the rubble themselves. There is no rescue operation, because all the services that are supposed to rescue people, to treat them, to bury them, these services no longer exist,"" he said in an appearance on Ukrainian television.

Despite continued Russian bombardment, a British intelligence report released on Thursday said that Moscow's advances have ""largely stalled on all fronts.""

""Russian forces have made minimal progress on land, sea and air in recent days and they continue to suffer heavy losses,"" the report states.

""Ukrainian resistance remain staunch and well-coordinated. The vast majority of Ukrainian territory, including all major cities, remains in Ukrainian hands.""

In a virtual address to the German Parliament on Thursday, Zelensky evoked images of the Berlin Wall in calling for further aid from Germany and expedited membership to the European Union.

Zelensky directly appealed to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz by echoing a famous call from U.S. President Ronald Reagan over Russia's efforts to create a political wall with Ukrainian invasion.

""Mr. Scholz, tear down this wall,"" Zelensky said, according to The New York Times.

The remarks came one day after Zelensky made an address to a joint session of U.S. Congress, during which he urged a no-fly zone over Ukraine and more aid to halt Russian aggression.

A Russian airstrike before dawn Thursday killed 21 people and destroyed a school and community center in Merefa, near the northeast city of Kharkiv, officials said.

Foreign ministers of the Group of Seven leading economies said in a joint statement that Russian President Vladimir Putin is conducting an ""unprovoked and shameful war.""

The fighting has led more than 3 million people to flee Ukraine, the U.N. estimates. The death toll remains unknown, though Ukraine has said thousands of civilians have died.

Here are some key things to know about the conflict:

What is happening on the ground?

The World Health Organization has verified 43 attacks on hospitals and health facilities, with 12 people killed and 34 injured, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told the United Nations Security Council in a virtual briefing Thursday.

In the besieged southern city of Mariupol, rescuers continued searching for survivors of a Russian airstrike on a theater where hundreds of people were sheltering, local officials said. With communications disrupted across the city and movement difficult because of shelling and other fighting, there were conflicting reports on whether anyone had emerged from the rubble. Video and photos provided by the Ukrainian military showed that the building had been reduced to a roofless shell, with some exterior walls collapsed. Petro Andrushchenko, an official with the mayor’s office, said the building had a relatively modern basement bomb shelter designed to withstand airstrikes.

Snow flurries fell around the skeletons of burned, windowless and shrapnel-scarred apartment buildings as smoke rose above Mariupol's skyline.

""We are trying to survive somehow,"" said one Mariupol resident, who gave only her first name, Elena. ""My child is hungry. I don’t know what to give him to eat.""

During a video address to German lawmakers, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned Russia for the dire situation in Mariupol, saying: ""Everything is a target for them.""

Zelenskyy's address was delayed because of a technical problem caused by an attack close to where Zelenskyy was speaking, Bundestag deputy speaker Katrin Goering-Eckardt said.

The governor of the northern city of Chernihiv said it has experienced ""colossal losses and destruction"" from Russian artillery and air strikes. Viacheslav Chaus told Ukrainian TV on Thursday that the bodies of 53 people had arrived at city morgues over the past 24 hours. A hostel was shelled, killing a mother, father and three of their children, including 3-year-old twins, officials said.

In eastern Ukraine, a municipal pool complex where pregnant women and women with children were taking shelter was also hit Wednesday, according to Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of the Donetsk regional administration. There was no word on casualties.

A fire broke out in an apartment building in the capital, Kyiv, Thursday after it was hit by the remnants of a downed Russian rocket, killing one person and injuring at least three others, according to emergency services. Fighting continued in Kyiv's suburbs, depriving thousands of heat and clean water.

Britain’s Defense Ministry said Russia’s invasion ""has largely stalled on all fronts"" amid stiff Ukrainian resistance. It said Russian forces have made ""minimal progress"" on land, sea or air in recent days, and are suffering heavy losses.

Ukrainian forces are using inexpensive Turkish-made drones to carry out lethal attacks on the Russian invaders.

The attacks in Mariupol knocked out the windows of apartment buildings and sent smoke rising above the skyline. Cars, some with the ""Z"" symbol of the Russian invasion force in their windows, drove past stacks of ammunition boxes and artillery shells in a neighborhood controlled by Russian-backed separatists.

In Kharkiv, doctors are struggling to treat COVID-19 patients as the bombs fall outside. Several times a day, air raid sirens wail at a local hospital, sending virus patients — some connected to ventilators and struggling to breathe — into bomb shelters.

""Bombing takes place from morning into night,"" hospital director Dr. Pavel Nartov said. ""It could hit at any time.""

How is the world responding to the war?

U.S. President Joe Biden and China’s Xi Jinping are scheduled to speak by phone on Friday. Biden also plans to travel to Europe next week for talks with European leaders about the Russian invasion, and will attend an extraordinary NATO summit in Brussels. NATO has been bolstering its eastern flank with troops and equipment to deter Russia from invading any of its members.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said American officials were evaluating and documenting potential war crimes committed by Russia in Ukraine. Blinken said the intentional targeting of civilians is a war crime, for which there will be ""massive consequences.""

U.S. President Joe Biden called Russian leader Vladimir Putin a war criminal in comments the Kremlin said were “unforgivable” as it insisted the war in Ukraine was “going to plan” amid talk of compromise at peace talks.

Moscow has yet to capture any of Ukraine’s biggest cities despite the largest assault on a European state since World War Two. More than 3 million Ukrainians have fled and thousands have died as the war enters its fourth week.

Ukraine’s foreign ministry said Russian forces dropped a powerful bomb on a theater in the besieged southern port city of Mariupol, leaving many civilians trapped and an unknown number of casualties. Reuters could not independently verify the information.

The United Nations’ top court for disputes between states ordered Russia on Wednesday to immediately halt its military operations in Ukraine, saying it was “profoundly concerned” by Moscow’s use of force.

At least one person was killed when the remains of a downed missile struck a residential building in Kyiv. Three people were wounded and a portion of the building’s residents were evacuated.

Russian airstrikes targeted the city of Merefa, located near Kharkiv early Thursday morning. The missiles destroyed a school and community center.

‘NEUTRAL STATUS’

Ukraine’s armed forces are conducting small-scale counter attacks on several fronts and Russian troops have not been able to gain ground because of a lack of resources, Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said on Wednesday.

There were signs of compromise and progress at ongoing talks between Russia and Ukraine.

The Kremlin said negotiators were discussing a status for Ukraine similar to that of Austria or Sweden, both members of the European Union that are outside the NATO military alliance.

“Neutral status is now being seriously discussed along, of course, with security guarantees,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said. “There are absolutely specific formulations which in my view are close to agreement.”

Vladimir Medinsky, Russia’s chief negotiator, told state TV: “Ukraine is offering an Austrian or Swedish version of a neutral demilitarized state, but at the same time a state with its own army and navy.”

Austria and Sweden, the biggest of six EU members outside NATO, both have small militaries that cooperate with the alliance.

President Volodymyr Zelensky has said Ukraine could accept international security guarantees that stopped short of its longstanding aim to join NATO. That prospect has been one of Russia’s primary concerns.

“My priorities during the negotiations are absolutely clear: the end of the war, guarantees of security, sovereignty, restoration of territorial integrity, real guarantees for our country, real protection for our country,” Zelensky said in a video address released early on Thursday.

In a speech on Wednesday to the U.S. Congress by video link, Zelensky repeated a request for a no-fly zone over Ukraine, something the West won’t introduce.

“In the darkest time for our country, for the whole of Europe, I call on you to do more,” he said.

The United States announced an additional $800 million in security assistance to Ukraine to fight Russia, with the new package including drones, anti-armor and anti-aircraft systems.

“More will be coming as we source additional stocks of equipment that … we are ready to transfer,” Biden said, later condemning Putin.

“He is a war criminal,” he told reporters.

NATO defense ministers meeting in Brussels also pledged more arms supplies to help Ukraine.

Security Council is due to vote on Friday on a Russian-drafted call for aid access and civilian protection, but diplomats say the measure is set to fail because it does not push for an end to the fighting or withdrawal of troops.",https://nypost.com/2022/03/17/ukraine-russia-war-shells-hit-theatre-sheltering-civilians-biden-calls-putin-a-war-criminal/
