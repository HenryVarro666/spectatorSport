KYIV

Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, killing dozens and forcing hundreds to flee for their lives in the pro-Western neighbor.

Russian air strikes hit military facilities across the country and ground forces moved in from the north, south and east, triggering condemnation from Western leaders and warnings of massive sanctions.

Also there were reports that the Ukraine fighting raged in Chernobyl near nuclear facility.

Weeks of intense diplomacy failed to deter Putin, who massed over 150,000 troops on Ukraine’s borders in what the West said was the biggest military build-up in Europe since the Second World War.

""I have decided to proceed with a special military operation,"" Putin said in a television announcement in the early hours of Thursday.

Shortly afterwards, the first bombardments were heard in Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, and several other cities, according to AFP correspondents.

At least 68 people were killed, including both soldiers and civilians, according to an AFP tally from various Ukrainian official sources.

In the deadliest single strike reported by the authorities, 18 people were killed at a military base near Ukraine’s Black Sea port city of Odessa.

Ukraine’s border guards said Russian forces had reached the region around the capital, Kyiv.

An AFP reporter in the northern part of the city saw several low-flying helicopters overhead amid reports that an airfield was under attack.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said a ""full-scale invasion"" was underway.

President Volodymyr Zelensky declared martial law and said Russia was attacking his country’s ""military infrastructure"" but urged citizens not to panic and vowed victory.

He accused Russia of acting like ""Nazi Germany"", saying it had attacked in a ""cowardly and suicidal way"".

Ukrainian forces said they had killed ""around 50 Russian occupiers"" while repulsing an attack on a town on the frontline with Moscow-backed rebels, a toll that could not be immediately confirmed by AFP.



Kyiv’s main international airport was hit in the first bombing of the city since World War II and air raid sirens sounded over the capital at the break of dawn.

""I woke up because of the sounds of bombing. I packed a bag and tried to escape,"" Maria Kashkoska told AFP, as she sheltered inside the Kyiv metro station.

In the eastern Ukrainian town of Chuguiv, a son wept over the body of his father among the wreckage of a missile strike in a residential district.

""I told him to leave,"" the man sobbed repeatedly, next to the twisted ruins of a car.

Kuleba said the worst-case scenario was playing out.

""This is a war of aggression. Ukraine will defend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now,"" he said.

Within a few hours of Putin’s speech, Russia’s defence ministry said it had neutralised Ukrainian military airbases and its air defence systems.

Ukraine said Russian tanks and heavy equipment crossed the border in several northern regions, in the east as well as from the Kremlin-annexed peninsula of Crimea in the south.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the operation would last as long as necessary, saying there were ""goals that need to be achieved"".

""Ideally, Ukraine needs to be liberated and cleansed of Nazis,"" he told reporters, repeating unfounded claims made by the Kremlin.



The fighting roiled global financial markets, with stocks plunging and oil prices soaring past $100.

European wheat prices also hit a record high on expectations of lower supplies as Ukraine and Russia are two of the world’s biggest producers.

In his televised address, Putin justified the assault by claiming the government was overseeing a ""genocide"" in the east of the country.

The Kremlin earlier said the leaders of two separatist territories in eastern Ukraine had asked Moscow for military help against Kyiv after Putin recognised their independence on Monday.

A conflict between the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Lugansk republics and government forces has dragged on since 2014, killing more than 14,000 people.

US President Joe Biden spoke with Zelensky after the Russian assault began to vow US ""support"" and ""assistance"".

He condemned the ""unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces,"" and vowed Russia would be held accountable.

Biden was due to join a virtual meeting of G7 leaders -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States -- on Thursday, likely to result in more sanctions against Russia.

In Brussels, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Russia faced ""unprecedented isolation"" and would be hit with the ""harshest sanctions"" the European Union has ever imposed.

NATO said it would also hold a virtual summit and activate ""defence plans"" for allied countries.

But NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said: ""We don’t have any plans to send NATO troops into Ukraine"".

The Russian invasion also rattled eastern NATO members once dominated by Moscow during the Cold War.

Poland called for urgent NATO consultations and said it was preparing for a large influx of refugees, while Lithuania imposed a national state of emergency.



Ukraine has around 200,000 military personnel, and could boost that with up to 250,000 reservists.

Moscow’s total forces are much larger -- around a million active-duty personnel -- and have been modernised and re-armed in recent years.

But Ukraine has received advanced anti-tank weapons and some drones from NATO members. More have been promised as the allies try to deter a Russian attack or at least make it costly.

Russia has long demanded that Ukraine be forbidden from ever joining the NATO alliance and that US troops pull out from Eastern Europe.

Putin this week set out a number of stringent conditions if the West wanted to de-escalate the crisis, saying Ukraine should drop its NATO ambition and become neutral.

""Putin’s aim is to end the existence of Ukraine as it was yesterday,"" said Tatyana Stanovaya, founder of the political consultancy R.Politik Center and a non-resident scholar at the Carnegie Moscow Center.

""It is possible that the east of Ukraine will come under Russian control,"" she said, adding: ""I cannot see anything that would stop Russia now"".",https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/ukraine-under-attack-along-russia-belarus-borders-border-guards-171755

“At about 5:00 a.m., the state border of Ukraine in the area with the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus was attacked by Russian troops supported by Belarus,” the border service said, according to CNN.

The attacks occurred in the regions of Luhansk, Sumy, Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Zhytomyr, according to the border service cited by CNN. Theses areas are located on the eastern and northern borders of Ukraine.

Additionally, the border service said “the attack takes place from the Autonomous Republic of Crimea side,” according to CNN.

Artillery, heavy equipment and small arms were aimed at border units, border patrols and checkpoints, CNN reported.

A U.S. defense official told CNN that the Pentagon is following reports of troops entering Ukraine from Belarus. The source, however, told the network that it was unclear if the troops were strictly Russian or also Belarusian.

The Hill reached out to the Pentagon for more information.

Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a military operation in Ukraine early Thursday morning Moscow time amid heightened tensions between the two countries. Russia in recent weeks had amassed up to 190,000 troops at the Ukrainian border, stoking fear in the U.S. and allied nations that Moscow was planning an invasion of Ukraine.

Putin on Thursday claimed that the operation was meant to protect eastern Ukraine from what he called a “regime.”

Reports of troops entering Ukraine from Belarus comes days after the two countries extended their military drills, which were set to end on Sunday. Belarusian Defense Minister Viktor Khrenin said military leaders from his country and Russia decided to “continue checking” joint force readiness because of an “increase in military action” near the Belarusian border.

He also said the decision to continue the exercises was made in response to the “aggravation of the situation” in eastern Ukraine.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday said the continuation of exercises made him more concerned about a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine.

President Biden late Wednesday evening called Russia’s attack on Ukraine an “unprovoked and unjustified attack.”",https://thehill.com/policy/international/595621-ukrainian-state-border-services-says-troops-attacked-from-belarus

“Attacks on border units, border detachments and checkpoints are carried out with the use of artillery, heavy equipment and small arms,” the border guards’ statement said.

“The work of enemy sabotage and reconnaissance groups is also recorded.”

The statement was issued as a Ukrainian interior ministry official reported the fall of the previously government-held town of Shchastya, on the eastern frontline with a rebel-held enclave.

The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, announced in the early hours of Thursday morning a “special military operation” in the Ukrainian region of Donbas. The objective, according to the leader, is to demilitarize the country, although the attack against the former Soviet republic is looking more and more like a major invasion. This is the story of the attacks via maps:

The Russian troops were this morning crossing the border in various points of Ukraine, according to confirmation from the country’s Interior Ministry. The attack began minutes after Putin made his announcement of action in Donbas.

The offensive, which began in Odessa and Crimea, saw major explosions in the regions of Sloviansk, Kramatorsk, Járkov and even Kyiv. There were also deflagrations in the separatist regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, whose independence was recognized by the Russian government on Monday.

According to the Ukrainian state emergency service, the Russian attacks have reached 10 regions in the east and south of the country. The Russian Defense Ministry has stated it is using “high-precision weapons” to cripple military infrastructure. The Ukrainian government decreed a state of emergency on Wednesday and closed the airports of Jarkov, Zaporiya and Dnipro.

The war in Ukraine has now lasted eight years. In March 2014, following a referendum that the international community deemed illegal, Russia annexed the Crimea peninsula and offered military and economic support for separatists in the Donbas region. A month later, the latter proclaimed independence from Ukraine, triggering a conflict that has dragged out for eight years and claimed over 14,000 lives.

The fighting has divided the Donbas region into two separate areas, one on each side of the frontline. The eastern zone, which borders Russia, is controlled by separatists who are backed by the Kremlin; the western zone remains under the control of Ukraine’s armed forces. Separatists are claiming the entire territories of Donetsk and Luhansk, although they only have control over a third of the land – around 6,500 square kilometers (2,500 square miles), according to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).

In November, Russia began to amass troops and weapons along its border with Ukraine. The defense consulting firm Rochan Consulting, which has been monitoring the deployment, on January 27 calculated that over 100,000 Russian soldiers were already positioned near the border. The latest moves by Russia and the beginning of what Rochan is calling “a new phase,” in which units are no longer just congregating at meeting points but operating in more dispersed areas, will make it complicated to monitor movement on the ground. According to “Western sources” cited by the BBC news organization, two-thirds of Russian forces are now less than 50 kilometers (31 miles) from the border with Ukrainian territory. Besides the soldiers deployed near Ukraine, Moscow also has 30,000 soldiers, heavy equipment as well as airplanes and combat helicopters in Belarus.

The US Ambassador to OSCE, Michael R. Carpenter, on Friday figured that between the Russian troops near the Ukrainian border as well as those in Crimea and Belarus, Moscow might have between 169,000 and 190,000 soldiers in and around Ukraine. To this must be added the approximately 2,000 troops that, according to the Polish think tank Warsaw Institute, Moscow has in Transnistria, an unrecognized breakaway state with a Russian-speaking population that declared independence from Moldova in 1990.

Analysts feel that the most likely scenarios for an alleged Russian invasion of Ukraine are the following:

1. South option . Russian troops would try to secure Ukrainian territory located along the Black Sea. This strip would extend from the Donbas region to Transnistria, in Moldova, and include the Crimea peninsula, illegally annexed by Russia in 2014. This possibility would ensure water supply to Crimea after Kyiv cut it off eight years ago, and it would also leave Ukraine landlocked.

2. East option . Russian soldiers could penetrate separatist areas of the Donbas region, without advancing any further into Ukraine, or else try to gain control over all the Ukrainian territory east of the Dnieper, a river that splits the country in half. This military advance would involve taking Kyiv, possibly with help from Russian troops stationed in Belarus, whose border is 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the capital.

3. Total option . A full-scale invasion of Ukraine is the least likely scenario because of the difficulty of controlling a territory of over 600,000 square kilometers (233,062 square miles) and a population of 44 million according to the World Bank. Popular opposition could end up being a more determining factor than a purely military resistance by the Ukrainian armed forces, who are vastly outnumbered by the Russian army. Besides the huge differences in terms of weapons, Ukraine only has 209,000 troops on active duty compared with 900,000 in the Russian army, according to the Stockholm International Peace Reserch Institute (SIPRI).",https://english.elpais.com/international/2022-02-24/the-russian-attack-in-maps-troops-cross-the-ukrainian-border.html

Newswire AFP reported that Ukraine was under attack from Russia and Belarus border.

Russian and Belarus had earlier taken part in large scale military exercise although Russia had said it had pulled out some troops from Belarus but satellite photos a few days ago suggested military units were still deployed in the area.

As loud explosions were heard across Ukraine, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said it was ""a glaring violation"" and a ""dark day"" for Europe.

The Ukrainian government-held town of Shchastya said it had fallen to Russian-backed eastern insurgents.

""Germany condemns in the strongest possible terms this unscrupulous act by President Putin. Our solidarity goes out to Ukraine and its people,"" the German chancellor said.

Amid the explosions, air raid sirens rang out in Ukraine's capital Kyiv as the Russian defence ministry said it will not target Ukrainian cities with missiles.
