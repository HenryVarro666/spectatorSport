0,a038d4af-ee2a-4397-8814-a54a3dca68dc,[],,"The United States says that Ukraine will be given long-range missile defense and Switchblade armed drones, enabling Kyiv’s forces to better defend against Russian aircraft and armor from a distance.

The new arms and equipment that US President Biden announced for Ukraine include:

S-300 long-range missile defense

Ukraine has had the ability to shoot down Russian aircraft and cruise missiles at relatively close quarters. Washington is arranging for it to acquire systems that can strike attacking aircraft from much farther away.

According to a military source, the systems are the Soviet/Russian-made S-300, which like the US-made Patriot system, is a fully automated, ground-based radar-and-missile launcher unit that can detect, track and fire at multiple incoming aerial threats at long distances.

Ukrainians already know how to operate the S-300, and the United States and a number of NATO countries possess the systems or components of them to supply Ukraine.

‘Kamikaze drones’

Washington will send Ukraine 100 Switchblade drones, essentially camera-equipped, remote-controlled flying bombs that can be directed by an operator to find and then, when ready, plunge onto a target, exploding on contact.

Dubbed “kamikaze drones,” Switchblades can extend the range of attack on Russian vehicles and units to beyond the sight of the user. That gives them an advantage over the guided heat-seeking missiles that Ukrainians have used against Russian tanks.

Anti-aircraft Stingers

The United States is also giving 800 more Stingers, which are shoulder-mounted infrared anti-aircraft missiles. The US provided Stingers to Afghan fighters in the 1990s to shoot down Russian helicopters; Ukrainians have used them effectively against Russian helicopters and slower, lower-flying fixed-wing attack aircraft.

‘Saint Javelin’

Western allies have already provided the Ukrainian army with some 17,000 lightweight, shoulder-launched, self-guided missiles which have become the weapon of choice in the ground war. These are being used with great effect to destroy armored vehicles at close quarters.

Among those, the US-made Javelin, with dual charges designed to defeat Russian tanks’ anti-missile defenses, has become legendary in its effectiveness. A popular Ukrainian song extols it and there is now even a viral depiction of “Saint Javelin,” an Eastern iconography-style image of a woman cradling the weapon. Biden said Washington will send 2,000 more javelin missiles to Ukraine.

Guns, ammunition, body armor

The new US arms provisions also include 7,000 other anti-armor weapons, thousands of machine guns, rifles, and grenade launchers, 20 million rounds of small arms ammunition fitting both Russian and NATO standards, and 25,000 sets of body armor and helmets.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-march-17-2022/

The growing number of Ukrainians seeking refuge in Germany will become a “big, big challenge”, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said.

Speaking after talks with the leaders of Germany’s 16 states to discuss the coronavirus pandemic, Scholz said that despite the challenge it should be relatively easy to help Ukrainians settle in given that they don’t need visas to enter Germany and they have automatic access to healthcare and education as well as language and integration courses.

The International Committee of the Red Cross has called on the warring parties to allow safe passage out of besieged Mariupol and allow aid in, the organisation’s head Peter Maurer said.

The ICRC was also still seeking access to prisoners of war from both sides in the conflict, adding captured troops should be treated with dignity and not exposed to “public curiosity”.

Russia is pretending to negotiate with Ukraine, while pursuing the invasion of its neighbour in line with a brutal strategy it has used elsewhere, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has said.

“Unfortunately we’re still facing the same Russian logic – making maximalist demands, wanting Ukraine to surrender and intensifying siege warfare,” Le Drian told newspaper Le Parisien.

“Just as in and Aleppo (in Syria), there are three typical elements – indiscriminate bombardment, so-called humanitarian “corridors” designed to allow them to accuse the other side of failing to respect them, and talks with no objective other than pretending that they are negotiating.”

Russia is rethinking its approach: Analyst

Speaking to Al Jazeera, Frank Ledwidge, senior lecturer in military capabilities and strategy at the University of Portsmouth, said Russia’s attack “has, in military terms, culminated”.

“Essentially, that they’ve gone as far as they can with the logistics and weaponry they brought into the country – that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s stalled,” he added.

“What we’re seeing now is what’s called an operational pause as they start to get, in colloquial terms, their act together, which they have not had largely due to very poor planning assumptions in the early part of the campaign.

“So they’d be working frantically to try to get weapons and get their planning sorted out and to understand where does it go next. And of course, Ukrainians have a say in that, which is why we are starting to see counterattacks by Ukrainian armed forces that seem to be having some effect.”

In an interview with NPR news on Wednesday, Blinken said the fact that China “has not stood strongly against” Russia’s aggression in Ukraine flies in the face of China’s commitments as a permanent member of the UN Security Council responsible for maintaining peace and security.

“It’s totally inconsistent with what China says and repeats over and over again about the sanctity of the United Nations charter and the basic principles, including the sovereignty of nations,” Blinken said.

He said that such groups or fire spotters are detained almost daily in Kyiv and are present even in the western Ukrainian regions where hostilities have been limited to rare cruise missile strikes on strategic sites such as military bases or airports.

Bombed Mariupol theatre sheltering at least 500 civilians: HRW

Human Rights Watch says the Mariupol theatre hit during an alleged Russian attack was sheltering at least 500 civilians.

“Until we know more, we cannot rule out the possibility of a Ukrainian military target in the area of the theatre, but we do know that the theatre had been housing at least 500 civilians,” said Belkis Wille, senior crisis and conflict researcher at Human Rights Watch.

“This raises serious concerns about what the intended target was in a city where civilians have already been under siege for days and telecommunications, power, water and heating have been almost completely cut off.”

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

Ukrainian historian: 'People just don't believe Kyiv will fall'

A historian with the Canadian Institute for Ukrainian studies at the University of Alberta has explained the determination of so many people in Kyiv to remain, despite the ongoing conflict.

Olha Klymenko is currently in Kyiv, having returned to be with her father, who neither wants to leave the city nor is in good enough health to do so. ""He refuses to leave. And this is the case with a lot of people, a lot of my friends,"" she told DW.

She said there were a number of reasons for this, perhaps they had children fighting with Ukrainian forces, or perhaps they simply refused to abandon their homes.

""There are people who just say: We're going to stay. This is our land. This is our home. We're not leaving. And people just do not believe that Kyiv is going to fall. They believe that Kyiv is going to stand. So I'm staying.""

Klymenko spoke from a darkened room on Thursday evening, as authorities had asked residents to keep their lights off to make targeting more difficult for Russian forces.

Ukrainian MP: Attack on sheltering women and children 'intentional'

Ukrainian lawmaker Dmytro Gurin told DW that before a theater being used as a shelter in the besieged city of Mariupol was hit by a bomb, clear efforts had been made to communicate to the Russian army that women and children were sheltering there.

""Of course it was deliberate. The theater building stands alone and the closest buildings are like 100 meters away.""

Gurin said the word ""children"" was written in very big letters outside the theater [in front and behind] so it could be seen from the air.

""At 2 p.m. one of the survivors from Mariupol, the refugees, told on the Ukrainian television that there is a bomb shelter where women and children are in the basement trying to stay safe from the constant bombardment.""

""And in 20 minutes, a plane went there and dropped a super powerful bomb. So it's intentional and it's it cannot be a mistake. Exactly. And the pilot, he knew what he did.""

Gurin said that Russia was trying to starve Mariupol into submission, comparing it to ""Auschwitz or Treblinka…it’s mass murder.""

Regional prosecutors said artillery fire hit a school and a cultural center in Merefa.

Along with their statement, prosecutors shared an image showing a building of several stories that was destroyed in the middle with windows blown out and emergency workers combing through the wreckage.

Erdogan invites Putin for talks with Zelenskyy

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is said to have offered to Vladimir Putin to host him and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy for talks, according to his office. The offer was reportedly communicated to Putin during a phone call between the two leaders.

A Turkish government statement said Erdogan told Putin that agreement on certain issues could require a meeting between the leaders. Erdogan also told Putin that a lasting ceasefire could lead the way to a long-term solution, according to the statement.

Both Kiev and Moscow have expressed openness to having Turkey mediate the talks and offer security guarantees for a potential peace accord.

Canada to sanction Belarusian officials

Canada's government said it would impose sanctions on 22 senior officials of Belarus's Department of Defense, over their support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

""Just as Canada is imposing severe sanctions on the Russian regime, Belarusian leadership must also be held accountable for enabling and supporting Vladimir Putin's unprovoked attacks,"" Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said in a statement. ""We will not hesitate to take further action.""

It comes as diplomats at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva voiced outrage at Belarus for ""enabling"" Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

A wide range of countries decried Minsk's role in supporting Moscow's war, with US Ambassador Michele Taylor saying Belarus was now party to ""a dangerous crisis which could irrevocably harm global security and that of every sovereign state.""

Ukrainian MP says dozens rescued from Mariupol theater

Ukrainian member of parliament Olga Stefanishyna said around 130 people were rescued from a theater in the port city of Mariupol after it was bombed on Wednesday.

""Good news that we need so urgently. The air raid shelter under the theatre of Mariupol has stood up to it. Around 130 people have already been saved,"" Stefanishyna said in a Facebook post.

HRW urges Ukraine to stop posting footage of Russian prisoners

Rights group Human Rights Watch called on Ukraine to stop publishing videos of captured Russian soldiers as it violated the Geneva conventions.

""The obligation to protect POWs (prisoners of war) from being objects of public curiosity, as well as protecting them from intimidation or humiliation, is part of the broader requirement to ensure their humane treatment and protect their families from harm,"" said HRW's senior legal advisor Aisling Reidy. ""The Ukrainian authorities should stop posting these videos online.""

HRW noted that it documented numerous violations and apparent war crimes by Russian forces, but stressed that Ukraine still had to uphold ""clear obligations"" of human rights.

""The violations by Russian forces are pervasive and widespread, causing intense civilian harm,"" Reidy said. ""At the same time, Ukraine has clear obligations that it must uphold, including lawful treatment of POWs.""

In a separate statement, HRW reported that Russian forces fired cluster munition rockets into the densely populated city of Mykolaiv in southern Ukraine, killing and injuring several civilians in multiple attacks.

The rights group noted that cluster munitions are subject to an international treaty ban, citing its long-lasting danger to civilians.

Stoltenberg: NATO has 'responsibility' to prevent escalation

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance is determined to stop the war in Ukraine from escalating further.

""NATO has a responsibility to prevent this conflict from escalating further. That would be even more dangerous and cause more suffering, deaths and destruction,"" Stoltenberg told a joint news conference in Berlin with Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

Stoltenberg and Scholz reiterated their support for Ukraine and sharply criticized Russian President Putin for the war.

""This is President Putin's war. He must stop the war, withdraw his forces and engage in diplomacy in good faith,"" Stoltenberg said.

UK says will deploy Sabre missile system in Poland

British Defense Minister Ben Wallace said the UK will deploy its Sky Sabre missile system in Poland as NATO moves to bolster the security of its eastern flank.

""We are going to deploy the Sky Sabre medium-range, anti-air missile system to Poland with about 100 personnel to make sure that we stand alongside Poland, protecting her airspace from any further aggression by Russia,"" Wallace told a news conference, according to the Reuters news agency.

Wallace made the announcement during a trip to Warsaw.

Russia rejects ICJ order to halt invasion

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed an order by the United Nation's highest court, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), to suspend military action in Ukraine.

""We cannot take this decision into account,"" Peskov said, adding that both parties — Moscow and Kyiv — had to agree for the ruling to be implemented.

ICJ judges in The Hague announced their ruling a day earlier in a case raised by Ukraine to challenge the Russian invasion.

Rulings by the ICJ are binding, but the court has no executive means to implement them.

Search for Mariupol theater survivors underway

The bomb shelter underneath the drama theater in the besieged city of Mariupol is said to have withstood a Russian airstrike, city officials said, adding that there may be survivors.

""The bomb shelter held. Now the rubble is being cleared. There are survivors. We don't know about the number of victims yet,"" mayoral adviser Petro Andrushchenko told Reuters.

Ukrainian lawmaker Serhiy Taruta wrote that some survivors had already emerged. ""After a terrible night of uncertainty, on the morning of the 22nd day of the war finally good news from Mariupol! The bomb shelter has held,"" Taruta wrote.

""People are coming out alive!"" adding that the removal of the rubble had begun.

Ukraine war a wall through Europe, Zelenskyy tells Bundestag

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke directly to Germany's lawmakers in a video call on Thursday. The address follows a series of appeals Zelenskyy had been making to world powers, seeking to drum up support after Russia invaded his country.

Zelenykyy warned German MP's that Russia was trying to build a new wall against freedom.

""It's not a Berlin Wall, it is a wall in central Europe between freedom and bondage and this Wall is growing bigger with every bomb"" dropped on Ukraine,"" he said.

""Dear Mr. Scholz, tear down this wall,"" Zelenykyy added, evoking US President Ronald Reagan's Cold War appeal to then Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev in Berlin in 1987.

The Ukrainian president previously addressed the Canadian parliament and the US Congress, calling for tougher economic sanctions on the Kremlin and enablers of the invasion.

Mariupol council will 'never forgive' theater attack

Ukraine claimed on Wednesday that Russia had destroyed a theater in the besieged port city of Mariupol. Russia disputed the claim, as it had with explosions last week at a maternity hospital, claiming that a Ukrainian nationalist regiment, the Azov Batallion, was behind the attack.

A post on Telegram from the Mariupol local council appeared to suggest that as many as 1,000 people were sheltering inside.

""Today, the invaders destroyed the Drama Theater. A place, where more than a thousand people found refuge. We will never forgive this,"" the Mariupol local council said in a Telegram post.

The number of casualties from the incident is still not known.

Ukraine's Foreign Minister said that ""the Russians could not have not known this was a civilian shelter. Satellite images of the building showed the words ""children"" written in Russian on either side of it, presumably in the hope that this could be seen by either pilots or artillery units.

Europeans are defying Putin by helping refugees, says migration expert

An expert on forced migration has told DW that Russian President Vladimir Putin's plan to ""destabilize"" Europe with an influx of refugees from war-torn Ukraine has failed.

Gerald Knaus, chairman of the European Stability Initiative, said: ""I am sure that Vladimir Putin had the intention these people would destabilize Europe. A large number of refugees would scare the Europeans. And it's not happened. If the Europeans mobilize, they can defy his blackmail.""

To give an idea of the magnitude of the migration following the conflict, Knaus used the influx of refugees in Europe in 2015 as an example, where ""the big refugee movement in the Aegean, saw 1 million people"" coming ""from Turkey to Greece in 1 year. Now, 1 million people come from Ukraine to the EU in 1 week.""

Russian ballerina quits Bolshoi Theater over invasion

Russian prima ballerina Olga Smirnova has quit Moscow's Bolshoi Theater to join the Dutch National Ballet. She made the decision over ""incredibly sad circumstances"" in reference to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine prosecutor general seeks punishment for 'war criminal' Putin

Ukraine's prosecutor general has welcomed the International Court of Justice's ruling for Russia to ""immediately suspend"" military operations in Ukraine.

Iryna Veneditktova told DW it as an ""important first step"" for Ukraine though ""we understand that such decisions cannot stop the war, can't punish the people who are guilty in the deaths of Ukrainian citizens.""

The prosecutor wants to eventually see proceedings brought against Russian ""soldiers, their top management, and the main war criminal of the 21st century — President Putin"" over the ""brutal and aggressive war.""

Japan: Sanctions on Russia needed

Japanese sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine are necessary, even if they squeeze energy supplies.

That is the view of Taro Kono, a former defense chief and ex-foreign minister. Kono says Japan may one day need to call on allies to help it counter China.

""We need to tell the people in Japan that in order to protect ourselves we need to help the others too,"" Kono told the Reuters news agency. ""If there is any aggression anywhere on this planet, we need to stop them.""

Japan sees neighboring China as its primary national security threat, followed by North Korea and Russia.

Summary of Wednesday's events in Ukraine-Russia crisis

Republican senators on Thursday introduced a bill to ban US imports of Russian uranium to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine.

The bill comes as the Biden administration has been weighing sanctions on Russian nuclear power company Rosatom, a major supplier of fuel and technology to power plants around the world.

The administration’s ban on US imports of Russian energy, such as oil and liquefied natural gas, does not yet include uranium.

“While banning imports of Russian oil, gas and coal is an important step, it cannot be the last,” said Senator John Barrasso, who introduced the bill.

Barrasso represents Wyoming, a state that could benefit from a revitalisation in US uranium mining.

“Banning Russian uranium imports will further defund Russia’s war machine, help revive American uranium production, and increase our national security,” he added.

The US has over 90 nuclear reactors, more than any other country, and is heavily reliant on imported uranium. Russian uranium made up 16% of US purchases in 2020, according to the Energy Information Administration, with Canada and Kazakhstan each providing 22%.

Russia also supplies a fuel called highly enriched, low assay uranium (HALEU) which is enriched up to 20% and could be used in advanced nuclear plants expected to be developed later this decade or in the 2030s.

The US would likely need to move fast on building bigger domestic capacity to supply HALEU if a ban is enacted.

Kathryn Huff, who was nominated by President Joe Biden to be an assistant secretary for nuclear energy and is now a senior official in the US Energy Department, told Barrasso in her nomination hearing on Thursday: “I think it is critically important that we wean ourselves off of unstable, untrustworthy sources of our critical fuels, including uranium.”

The Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry’s main trade group, supports development of a US uranium industry. An NEI spokesperson said the group was reviewing the bill and assessing “the potential impacts of fuel disruption on the US nuclear fleet”.

Many environmental groups and tribes have opposed expanding the industry on lands in the US west.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/mar/17/russia-ukraine-war-latest-kremlin-anger-after-biden-calls-putin-a-war-criminal-us-to-send-more-military-aid-live?page=with%3Ablock-623390cc8f0832c62ade079c

Morning,

In case you missed it, a video has gone viral over the past few days of men rating women at a beach.

In the video, three young men at a popular Perth beach hold whiteboards to rate women out of ten as they walk past.

My colleagues Isabella Ross takes you through what happened and why the video makes her, and many others, feel both angry and defeated. READ: A video has gone viral of men rating women out of ten at a Perth beach. It’s 2022.

But first, here are the five biggest stories women are talking about today, Friday March 18.

1. Former AFL player Andrew Lovett jailed over family violence.

Former AFL player Andrew Lovett has been jailed after admitting to punching, kicking, spitting and pouring beer on his ex-partner during nearly two years of sustained emotional and physical abuse.

Lovett, who played 88 games for Essendon from 2005 to 2009, on Thursday faced Dandenong Magistrates Court where he was sentenced to eight months in prison.

He had earlier pleaded guilty to 24 charges relating to family violence from February 2020 to December last year.

""No woman should fear or suffer physical harm because of a partner,"" magistrate Jason Ong told the 39-year-old.

""This was terrifying, ongoing, aggressive, physical violence. It was controlling and manipulative. You could and should have walked away.

""It was serious and sustained family violence. It was escalating over time (and) cannot be tolerated.""

Lovett has already served 100 days in pre-sentence detention, in what was his first time in custody.

He will be placed on a 12-month community corrections order following his release from prison.

2. Labor to examine culture after bullying claims.

Deputy Labour leader Richard Marles says the party will look into their culture after bullying claims following senator Kimberley Kitching's death.

Kitching died from a suspected heart attack aged 52 last week, with reports suggesting she was stressed and ostracised by colleagues before her death.

Kimberley Kitching labelled three senior Labor senators “mean girls” before her death, with claims she was subject to a campaign of bullying. @tminear https://t.co/oD6SFHGhew — Herald Sun (@theheraldsun) March 16, 2022

Marles told reporters on Thursday he did not accept ""assertions that have been in the media"" about the way Kitching was treated.

""Senator Kitching died a week ago today; somebody I knew for 30 years,"" he said.

""The whole Labor movement is a state of grief and shock. Right now, I am focused on providing support to Andrew, her husband, and her family, whose grief is unspeakable.""

However, Marles said the party's internal culture would be examined amid the claims, saying ""Questions of culture are something which is assessed in an ongoing way within Labor"".

3. Hundreds of Ukrainians to arrive in Australia seeking help.

Hundreds of Ukrainians are set to arrive in Australia in need of a place to stay, but there are fears support systems set up by the local community could be overwhelmed.

The Ukrainian peak body in Australia has so far received more than 250 requests for accommodation from people fleeing the conflict, with the majority of those expected to arrive within days.

""The community is taking on all the responsibility and the brunt of the load in terms of finding these people accommodation and getting them settled,"" Kateryna Argyrou from the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations told AAP.

There were emotional scenes as Ukrainians arrived in Sydney and Melbourne, fleeing their war-torn country and reuniting with loved ones. https://t.co/jPtUBBZIH9 — SBS News (@SBSNews) March 12, 2022

Immigration Minister Alex Hawke's office told AAP more than 4000 Australian visas have been issued to Ukrainians since the Russian invasion on February 24, and of those visa holders about 500 people have travelled to Australia.

Argyrou warned the flow of people out of Ukraine has only just begun - and soon cracks would emerge in the community's volunteer-run systems.

While accommodation is the main need according to Argyrou, requests have also come in for food, clothes, mobile phones, and help with childcare and schooling.

4. BBC apologises to Princess Diana aide over interview deceit.

The BBC says it has apologised and paid a ""substantial"" sum to Princess Diana's private secretary over subterfuge used to get an explosive television interview with the late royal.

The 1995 interview, in which Diana discussed the breakdown of her relationship with Prince Charles - famously saying ""there were three of us in this marriage"" in reference to Charles' relationship with Camilla Parker-Bowles - was watched by 23 million people in the UK and sent shock waves through the monarchy.

A report last year by a retired senior judge concluded BBC journalist Martin Bashir used ""deceitful behaviour"" to get the interview, including showing Diana's brother fake bank statements that falsely suggested members of Diana's inner circle were being paid to spy on her.

The UK publicly-funded broadcaster said it acknowledged that ""serious harm"" was caused to Diana's private secretary Patrick Jephson by the circumstances in which the interview was obtained.

""The BBC apologises unreservedly to Commander Jephson for the harm caused to him and has paid his legal costs,"" it said in a statement.

""The BBC has also paid Commander Jephson a substantial sum in damages, which he intends to donate in full to British charities nominated by him.""

5. Afghan schools to reopen to girls, says Taliban.

The Taliban will allow girls around Afghanistan to return to class when high schools open next week, an education official says, after months of uncertainty over whether the group would allow full access to education for girls and women.

""All schools are going to open to all boys and girls,"" Aziz Ahmad Rayan, a spokesman for the Ministry of Education, told Reuters.

""But there are some conditions for girls,"" he said, adding that female students would be taught separately from males and only by female teachers.

In some rural areas where there was a shortage of female teachers, he said that older male teachers would be allowed to teach girls.

Allowing girls and women into schools and colleges has been one of the key demands the international community has made of the hardline Islamist movement since it toppled the foreign-backed government last August.

But Heather Barr, associate women's rights director at Human Rights Watch, urged the international community against complacency after the announcement, saying reopening schools would not necessarily mean that the broader rights of women and girls in society would be protected.

And that's it, you're all up to speed. We'll be back to bring you more of the biggest news stories throughout the day.

In a televised address at the Annual Friends of Ireland Luncheon in Washington, Mr Biden said Putin is paying a “big price for his aggression”.

Until Wednesday, the Biden administration had avoided calling Putin a war criminal to preserve the chance of negotiating an end to the war with Moscow.

But in an off-the-cuff remark on Wednesday night, the US president responded to a reporter's question by saying: ""I think he is a war criminal.""

Mr Biden will hold a call on Friday with Chinese leader Xi Jinping as Washington piles pressure on China to not support Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a step that would dramatically widen the gulf between Beijing and Western governments.
