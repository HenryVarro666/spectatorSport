Russia could end its ISS involvement in two years Roscosmos cosmonauts (from bottom left) Anton Shkaplerov and Pyotr Dubrov work outside the Nauka multipurpose laboratory module on the International Space Station during a spacewalk in January 2022. (Image credit: NASA) Russia could end its cooperation on the International Space Station in as little as two years, using the sanctions imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine as an excuse, according to space experts. Most commentators characterize the threats by the director general of Russia‚Äôs Roscosmos space agency to end its involvement with the orbital outpost as mere political bluster. But the threat to sever such relations could come to fruition, as some experts Live Science spoke to noted that Russia has only committed to the ISS project until 2024, rather than ‚Äúafter 2030‚Äù as had been proposed by NASA and other partners. And Russia‚Äôs withdrawal from the project could mean it will be mainly up to NASA to keep the ISS physically in orbit for almost another 10 years ‚Äì something that Russia has been responsible for up until now. Even further, the threats signal just how badly Russia's actions in Ukraine have damaged ties in the scientific community between the country and the rest of the world, meaning that any science-related cooperation with Russia may be difficult, experts said.

Satellite tech uncovered evidence of a Russian massacre of Ukrainian civilians A WorldView-3 satellite image of grounds of the Church of St. Andrew and Pyervozvannoho All Saints, on March 31. It appears to show a mass grave in its top center. (Image credit: Maxar Technologies) Satellite images have revealed what appears to be a mass grave and the bodies of civilians scattered in the streets of the Ukrainian town of Bucha. The images implicate Russian troops in a massacre. Many of the images were taken during the Russian occupation of Bucha by Maxar Technologies' WorldView-3 satellite. They show that the bodies ‚Äî some of which were discovered by eyewitnesses with their hands bound and with gunshot wounds to the head ‚Äî could have been in the streets for as long as three weeks. Another, taken on March 31, shows what is likely a mass grave on the grounds of a church, which includes a trench that is roughly 45 feet (14 meters) long, according to Maxar, a satellite company that produces ""90% of the foundational geospatial intelligence used by the U.S. Government for national security and keeping troops safe on the ground,"" as well as the imagery for companies such as Google Earth and Google Maps. A previous Maxar satellite image, taken on March 10, shows what looks like the initial excavations of the grave. Read the full story on Live Science .

Russians strike tank of nitric acid in Rubizhne üõë WARNING ‚ùóIn Rubizhne, #Luhansk region, Russian troops hit a tank with nitric acid!Nitric acid is very dangerous if inhaled, swallowed or if it is in contact with skin.The consequences of this incident are similar to usage of chemical or biological weapons!1/2 pic.twitter.com/o5kPccPg6uApril 5, 2022 See more A large tank of nitric acid was struck during a Russian air strike on the city of Rubizhne in eastern Ukraine, causing the ruptured tank to let loose a plume of yellow-brown smoke, The New York Times reported Tuesday (March 5). The colorless liquid turns brown upon exposure to water or oxygen, producing yellow or red fumes with an acrid odor, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Exposure to nitric acid can irritate the eyes, skin and mucous membranes and can also cause a condition known as ""wet lung,"" or pulmonary edema, where excess fluid accumulates in the organ. Exposure to the chemical can also irritate and inflame the lung tissue; cause bronchitis; and drive dental erosion. The ""highly corrosive"" acid is typically used in the manufacture of fertilizers, dyes and polymers, according to the CDC. After the Russian strike burst the nitric acid tank in Rubizhne, the governor, Serhiy Haidai, advised residents to stay indoors, close their doors and windows and wear masks to avoid inhaling the fumes, according to the Times. ""This is a rather toxic substance,"" Haidai said in a video posted on his Facebook page. ""We don't know where this toxic cloud will go.""

U.S. to give $250,000 to global chemical weapons watchdog The United States will allocate $250,000 to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), an intergovernmental organization, The Associated Press reported Tuesday (March 5). In a statement, Marc Shaw, deputy assistant secretary at the State Department‚Äôs Bureau of Arms Control, Verification and Compliance, said that he hopes that the money will enable the OPCW to ""quickly assist Ukraine as it seeks protection against chemical threats from the Russian government.""

Russia threatens to pull out of space station partnership (Image credit: NASA) Russia threatened to pull out of the International Space Station (ISS) program until sanctions from the West are lifted, according to news reports. This isn't the first time the Russian space agency, Roscosmos, has aired such threats. Head of Roscosmos Dmitry Rogozin said that Moscow would restore cooperation with ISS partners only after sanctions were lifted. (Other ISS partners include the United States, Japan, Canada and the European Union.) ""The purpose of the sanctions is to kill the Russian economy, plunge our people into despair and hunger and bring our country to its knees,"" Rogozin wrote on Twitter on Saturday (April 2), as translated from Russian using Google Translate. This and other similar tweets from Rogozin do not mean Russia will necessarily walk out on the ISS. The Russian space chief is known for his hyperbolic statements, according to Live Science sister site Space.com. Despite these past threats, the ISS has been operating normally, with NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei returning to Earth in a Russian Soyuz spacecraft on March 30.

Russian forces reportedly leaving the Chernobyl nuclear power plant (Image credit: Karen Kasmauski/Getty Images) The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, has been informed that the Russian forces occupying the Chernobyl nuclear power plant have ""in writing, transferred control"" of the defunct facility to Ukrainian personnel, The Associated Press reported . Three convoys of Russian forces have left the site and the rest seem to be preparing to leave, the IAEA reported Thursday (March 31). These reports came from Energoatom, Ukraine's nuclear power operator. In a Telegram post , Energoatom said that the Russian troops were leaving the Chernobyl power plant and surrounding exclusion zone and heading towards Belarus, according to a translation by Axios . Russian forces were also preparing to leave the nearby city of Slavutych, where many of the Ukrainian workers that monitor and maintain the plant live, the post said. In a later Telegram post , Energoatom said that the Russian troops signed a document officially confirming the plant's handover back to Ukrainian control. There have been reports of Russian soldiers being exposed to high doses of radiation while at the plant and in surrounding exclusion zone, but the IAEA has not yet been able to confirm those reports, according to the AP. The agency continues to investigate.

Biden announces ""largest release of oil reserves in history"" President Joe Biden has announced a plan to increase the U.S. oil supply, with the aim of driving down gas prices that have skyrocketed since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, according to a White House statement released March 31. Biden has called on Congress to institute fees for oil companies that have leased public lands and drilled wells for oil production but aren't actively utilizing those leased acres. In addition, ""the President will announce the largest release of oil reserves in history, putting one million additional barrels on the market per day on average ‚Äî every day ‚Äî for the next six months,"" the White House statement reads. The release will likely lower the price of oil in the short term, but it may not completely make up for the loss of Russian resources should the situation worsen, experts told The New York Times . Biden's two-part plan aims to increase oil supply, in the short term, and reduce the country's dependence on oil, in the long term, the White House statement notes. To achieve the latter goal, Biden's administration is pursuing various initiatives to increase the country's use of and investment in alternative energy sources.

Radioactive material stolen from Chernobyl monitoring lab (Image credit: Pavel Gospodinov via Getty Images) Sometime during Russia's invasion of Chernobyl in Ukraine, looters stole radioactive material from a radiation monitoring laboratory near the defunct nuclear power plant. There seems to be a low risk that this material would be used in so-called dirty bombs, an expert told Live Science. Read the full story on Live Science .

Ukrainian internet provider suffers major cyberattack Ukrtelecom, the biggest internet provider in Ukraine in terms of geographical coverage, was the target of a major cyberattack, the State Special Communications Service of Ukraine reported on Monday (March 28), according to The New York Times . During the attack, which the agency says was perpetrated by Russian forces, Ukrtelecom limited its service to private users and business clients in order to maintain coverage for the military, technical security and intelligence service of Ukraine. The company was able to restore connectivity to all users after several hours.

UN nuclear watchdog chief in Ukraine to discuss safety of facilities Rafael Mariano Grossi, the chief of the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, is currently in Ukraine to speak with senior government officials about maintaining the integrity of the country's nuclear facilities, CNN reported on Tuesday (March 29). The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has stated that it will offer ""urgent technical assistance to ensure the safety and security of the country's nuclear facilities and help avert the risk of an accident that could endanger people and the environment."" ""The IAEA's presence, where needed to ensure safety and security, is of paramount importance. We are ready to provide the necessary support now,"" Grossi said in an IAEA statement, according to CNN. Ukraine's nuclear sites include the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and 15 additional nuclear power reactors at four other plants.

Sanctions have caused Russians to panic-buy medicine Russian citizens are panic-buying medicines such as sleeping pills, contraceptives, cancer drugs, heart drugs, hormones and antidepressants following a further increase of Western sanctions and boycotts, Reuters has reported . Information from the Russian data analytics company DSM Group has shown that, in the two weeks between Feb. 28 and March 13, Russians bought one month's worth of pharmaceutical items. The 270.5 million items amount to a value of around $104 billion. Sergei Shulyak, general director of DSM Group, told Reuters that the surge was due to fear. ""The first fear was that everything could get more expensive and the second fear was that medicines they need won't be available in some time. Those fears moved people. They stood in lines at pharmacies and bought everything,"" he said. Shuylak explained that he expects the surge to stabilize over time, as many Russian manufacturers are still capable of producing generic drugs and foreign producers are still able to supply them, albeit at higher prices. He did raise concerns, however, that worsening relations with the West could leave Russian drug manufacturers unable to source some of the ingredients needed to make drug products.

Roman Abramovich and Ukrainian negotiators reportedly suffered from poisoning symptoms after peace talks Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, shown here at a Chelsea ‚Äúfootball‚Äù match in 2017, experienced symptoms of poisoning after meeting with Russia in Kyiv. (Image credit: BEN STANSALL/AFP via Getty Images) The Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich and Ukrainian negotiators experienced symptoms of poisoning after a meeting to discuss peace with Russia in Kyiv earler this month, according to the Wall Street Journal . Abramovich and two members of the Ukrainian team reportedly suffered from red eyes, painful tears and peeling skin around their faces and hands after attending the meeting on the night of March 3-4, according to the investigative journalism group Bellingcat . The symptoms, which lasted until the morning, have been blamed on a likely biological or chemical weapons attack, with Bellingcat citing that the three affected men only consumed water and chocolate in the hours leading up to the onset of the symptoms. A fourth member of the team who also consumed the same chocolate and water did not suffer from symptoms. Bellingcat reports that , according to two chemical weapons experts and a doctor, the symptoms most closely matched those associated with porphyrin, organophosphates, or bicyclic substances, although a lack of specialized lab equipment near the victims made it impossible to know for sure. The experts believe that the dosage was low, indicating that the poisoner may have intended to scare the victims rather than kill them. It is unclear who was responsible for the alleged attack, but the Ukrainian negotiating team suspect it may have been committed by Russian hard-liners who hoped to disrupt peace talks between the two warring nations. Poisonings have an infamous place in modern Russian history and have occurred multiple times since the beginning of Vladimir Putin‚Äôs rule. These include the 2004 dioxin poisoning of Viktor Yushchenko (who ran against a Kremlin-favored candidate for Ukraine's presidency and was left disfigured); the 2004 poisoning of Russian investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya; the 2006 polonium -210 poisoning of former FSB officer Alexander Litvinenko and the 2018 Novichok poisoning of former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal.

US and EU strike landmark energy supply deal On Friday (March 25), U.S. President Joe Biden and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the establishment of a joint task force to help reduce European dependence on Russian fossil fuels, according to a White House statement . The Task Force for Energy Security will be chaired by a representative from the White House and a representative of the President of the European Commission. Through this partnership, the U.S. will work with international partners to increase exports of liquified natural gas (LNG) to Europe; the plan does not specify how much of this LNG will be supplied by the U.S., specifically, according to Reuters . In the short-term, for the U.S. to increase its LNG exports to Europe, the nation would likely need to compensate by exporting less LNG to other places, analysts told Reuters. In addition to diversifying Europe's LNG supply, the task force will work to ""reduce overall gas demand by accelerating market deployment of clean energy measures,"" the White House statement reads. Speaking in Brussels after the deal was agreed on Friday, Biden said that launching the task force was not ""only the right thing to do from a moral standpoint"" but ""it's going to put us on a stronger strategic footing,"" The Guardian reported .

Russian forces destroy Chernobyl 'radioactive' lab Russian forces have destroyed a laboratory located in Chernobyl 's exclusion zone where radioactive samples were being stored, according to news outlets. The laboratory, which cost about 6 million euros to build, opened in 2015 and was aimed at improving the management of radioactive waste at the plant, among other objectives. The State Agency of Ukraine on Exclusion Zone Management reported on social media that the Russian military has now destroyed the facility and that radioactive material is in the ""hands of the enemy"" rather than the hands of a ""civilized world,"" The Hill reported . At the start of the invasion, Russian forces seized control of the power plant, holding hostage more than 60 workers who continued to try to maintain safety at the plant until volunteers could replace them, The Hill said. In addition, the automated radiation monitoring system in the exclusion zone has stopped working, according to National Nuclear Energy Generating Company of Ukraine (also called Energoatom), as reported by The Hill. Russian forces took control of Chernobyl early in the invasion on Feb. 24. After the defunct nuclear plant was seized, more than 60 workers continued to work for about 600 hours to maintain the facility until volunteers were able to replace them. Chernobyl is the site of the 1986 nuclear reactor meltdown, considered the world's worst nuclear disaster. The defunct plant and the contaminated zone surrounding the disaster, continue to be a a safety risk as Russian forces shell and bomb the area.

Ukraine using AI to identify deceased Russian soldiers Mykhailo Fedorov, the deputy prime minister and head of the Digital Transformation Ministry in Ukraine, has confirmed that Ukraine is using facial recognition technology to identify deceased Russian soldiers, Forbes reported . Specifically, they're using software provided by Clearview AI, the New York-based facial recognition provider, which has offered the service without charge, Fedorov's department told Forbes. Ukraine's aim in identifying Russian soldiers is to inform their loved ones of the deaths, and in doing so, ""dispel the myth of a 'special operation' in which there are 'no conscripts' and 'no one dies,'"" Fedorov wrote in a Telegram post, according to Forbes. In other words, the effort is intended to counter Russian propaganda and help reveal exactly how many Russian soldiers are dying in the ongoing war. Albert Fox Cahn, founder of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, told Forbes that using facial recognition technology of this kind in a war could be a ""human rights catastrophe in the making."" The technology is fallible, so it's possible that the deceased could sometimes be misidentified and the wrong loved ones informed of the death, he noted. He also expressed concern that the technology may eventually be used to screen refugees at checkpoints, where misidentification could have fatal consequences.

International agency 'gravely concerned' about safety of Ukraine nuclear reactors An international organization that promotes the peaceful use of nuclear energy is ""gravely concerned"" about Ukraine's nuclear reactors, which are at high risk of a severe accident due to the Russian invasion of the country, the related intense fighting and Russia's seizure of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. ""Over the past few weeks, the International Atomic Energy Agency has been actively working to ensure the safety and security of all nuclear installations in Ukraine during these dramatic and unique circumstances where major nuclear facilities are operating in an armed conflict zone,"" Rafael Mariano Grossi, IAEA director-general, said in a video statement Wednesday (March 23). ""I remain gravely concerned about the safety and security of nuclear facilities in Ukraine."" Several of Ukraine's 15 working nuclear reactors are currently under Russian control; Chernobyl has been occupied by the Russians since the start of the invasion on Feb. 24, according to The Guardian. ""The IAEA is ready and is able to deploy immediately and provide indispensable assistance for ensuring nuclear safety and security in Ukraine,"" Grossi said in the statement. In addition to the bombs and missiles that could endanger these facilities, fires have broken out in Chernobyl, officials have said. Firefighters are currently trying to extinguish wildfires near the Chernobyl Nuclear power Plant, the IAEA said in a statement Wednesday (March 23). ""The fire brigade from the town of Chornobyl [Chernobyl] has extinguished four fires, but there are still ongoing fires. The local fire station does not currently have access to the electricity grid,"" the regulator said, as reported by the IAEA. The nuclear power plant continues to rely on offsite power, the IAEA said. ""The distressing situation continues and the need to prevent a nuclear accident becomes more pressing with each day that passes,"" Grossi said, emphasizing the importance of allowing in IAEA experts to ensure nuclear reactor safety. ""This assistance is essential to help avert the real risk of a severe nuclear accident that could threaten public health and the environment in Ukraine and beyond,"" Grossi said.

Kremlin statement regarding Russia's nuclear weapons; EU considers joint measures to tackle energy crisis ‚ÄîKremlin spokesperson Dmitri S. Peskov said that Russia would consider using nuclear weapons if the country comes under ""existential threat,"" CNN reported . Peskov said this in an interview with CNN‚Äôs Christiane Amanpour, after he repeatedly characterized Russia's invasion as a defensive move to protect Russia from Ukraine, which he said was ""formed by the Western countries, anti-Russia,"" according to The New York Times . ‚Äî On Wednesday (March 23), the European Commission presented European Union (EU) leaders with options to handle soaring energy prices and impending fuel shortages largely driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, The New York Times reported . Some options include establishing price caps and subsidies, to lower energy prices for both consumers and businesses. Additional proposals suggest that, in advance of next winter, member states should jointly buy and store fuel so that resources can be rapidly stockpiled and then shared across the bloc.

Russia may soon resort to more severe tactics, Biden says U.S. President Joe Biden delivers remarks at the Business Roundtables CEO Quarterly Meeting in Washington, DC, on March 21, 2022. (Image credit: NICHOLAS KAMM / Contributor via Getty Images) Having recently launched its hypersonic missiles against Ukraine, Russia may soon resort to using more severe tactics, including biological and chemical weapons, President Joe Biden said in an address at the Business Roundtable‚Äôs CEO Quarterly Meeting on March 21. ""Now, Putin‚Äôs back is against the wall,"" Biden said. ""And the more his back is against the wall, the greater the severity of the tactics he may employ."" Russia has asserted ‚Äî without evidence ‚Äî that the U.S. and Ukraine have biological and chemical weapons, Biden noted. ""That‚Äôs a clear sign he [Putin] is considering using both of those. He‚Äôs already used chemical weapons in the past, and we should be careful ‚Ä¶ of what‚Äôs about to come."" In addition, Russia may soon execute cyberattacks against critical U.S. infrastructure, Biden said. ""The magnitude of Russia‚Äôs cyber capacity is fairly consequential, and it‚Äôs coming,"" he said. ""The federal government is doing its part to get ready.""

Chernobyl trees could release radiation if fired upon The trees around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant still hold loads of radiation absorbed during the 1986 nuclear meltdown, considered one of the world's worst nuclear disasters. Since Feb. 25, Russian forces have occupied the power plant and the surrounding exclusion zone , taking plant employees hostage. This seizure and related fighting put the forest at an increased risk of catching fire, according to William Keeton, a forest ecosystem scientist at the University of Vermont. Such a fire would release potentially dangerous radiation into the atmosphere. When the nuclear reactor ""melted down"" on April 26, 1986, it launched radionuclides across an area of about 58,000 square miles, according to Smithsonian Magazine . Some of that radiation washed down to the ground in rain, only to be taken up by growing trees. Those trees now store all of those radionuclides. ""These forests absorbed tremendous amounts of radiation during the 1986 disaster, and the trees and soils still contain significant radiation ‚Äî in the form of large amounts of radioactive elements called radionuclides,"" Keeton said in a statement . If a forest fire happens ‚Äî from a bomb, explosion or fire ‚Äî this radiation could be released into the atmosphere. The forest there is mostly coniferous, which includes relatively fire-prone types of trees, Keeton said. Because of that risk, the U.S. Forest Service and Ukrainian experts have worked together to manage the fire risk. With Russian occupation, that capacity has dwindled. In addition, the forests are near the warzone, meaning risks from gunfire, explosions and even power line damage, Keeton explained. Forest fires in the exclusion zone are not unheard of. In April of 2020, about 50 acres (20 hectares) of forest caught fire near the abandoned village of Vladimirovka in Ukraine's exclusion zone, Live Science previously reported. Water drops from aircraft and a 124-person strong firefighting force were needed to put out that blaze.

Zoo near Kyiv requests safe passage to evacuate animals, procure food The Park XII Months zoo, located about 15.5 miles (25 kilometers) north of Kyiv in Ukraine, has requested that a humanitarian corridor be established to allow some of its animals to be evacuated, The Independent reported . For large animals that are difficult to transport, such as the rhinos and giraffes, the zoo staff hope that such corridors could serve as transport routes for food and fuel to heat the animals' enclosures. ""We need green corridors to bring in diesel, heat, and feed them. We can‚Äôt take out rhinos and giraffes, big animals, we don‚Äôt even have medicine to put them to sleep. We need to negotiate green corridors,"" Mykhailo Pinchuk, the zoo's owner, said in a recent Facebook video, according to The Independent. Since the start of the war, various humanitarian corridors have been established to allow tens of thousands of people to evacuate Ukraine, The Washington Post reported . However, these corridors have often been made impassable by ongoing Russian attacks, Ukrainian officials have said.

Countries must both prioritize clean energy and curb dependance on Russian oil, UN Secretary-General says Ant√≥nio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, speaks during the Global Climate Action High-level event: Racing For A Better World on November 11, 2021 in Glasgow, Scotland. (Image credit: Jeff J Mitchell / Staff via Getty Images) In response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, countries must not only decrease their reliance on Russian oil and gas but also heavily invest in renewable energy sources, Ant√≥nio Guterres, the Secretary-General of the United Nations (UN), said in an address on Monday (March 21), The Guardian reported . It would be folly to invest in new fossil fuel infrastructure to make up for the loss of Russian resources, as doing so ""might create long-term fossil fuel dependence and close the window to 1.5C,"" the goal set forth at the Cop26 UN climate summit last year, he said. ""Countries could become so consumed by the immediate fossil fuel supply gap that they neglect or knee-cap policies to cut fossil fuel use."" Average global temperatures have already increased more than 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) since the pre-industrial era, The Washington Post reported . Estimates suggest that the world could pass the 2.7 F (1.5 C) cutoff by the 2030s, if critical action is not taken now. ""If we continue with more of the same, we can kiss 1.5 goodbye. Even 2 degrees may be out of reach,"" Guterres said Monday, according to the Post.

Leak at Ukraine ammonia plant sends residents into shelter An ammonia leak at a chemical factory near the northern Ukrainian town of Novoselytsya has led officials to urge residents to take shelter, all amidst the intense fighting with Russian armed forces in the area, according to news reports. The ammonia leak came from the Sumykhimprom fertilizer plant, the Sumy regional governor Dmytro Zhyvytsky said, as reported by Al Jazeera . Shelling from Russian forces caused the leak, he added, and wounded an employee at the plant. The Russian army has said otherwise, calling the ammonia leak a ""chemical false flag."" Russian army spokesperson Igor Konashenkov said, ‚ÄúThe Russian army has not planned or delivered any strikes against Ukrainian facilities that manufacture or keep in store poisonous chemicals,"" Al Jazeera quoted him. Ammonia is a highly toxic gas made of nitrogen and hydrogen that produces a noxious odor. To produce the compound, plants utilize a chemical reaction of both elements at high temperature and pressure, according to the American Chemical Society . About 85% of the world's ammonia production is used directly or indirectly in agriculture, according to the ACS. The most common household use of the chemical is in glass cleaners. According to the ACS, exposure to the gas can cause severe skin burns and eye damage; it is toxic if inhaled and under pressure the gas can explode when heated.

Russia denies cosmonauts' suit colors showed Ukraine support The bright-yellow and blue flight suits donned by a trio of Russian cosmonauts as they boarded the International Space Station on Friday (March 18) appeared to be a sign of their support for Ukraine, whose flag is the same colors, some outsiders had said. Now, Russia has scoffed at that interpretation. The three cosmonauts, Oleg Artemyev, Denis Matveev and Sergey Korsakov, joined seven crewmates already onboard the ISS. On Saturday (March 19), the Russian space agency released a statement quoting Artemyev: ""There is no need to look for any hidden signs or symbols in our uniform. A colour is simply a colour. It is not in any way connected to Ukraine. Otherwise, we would have to recognise its rights to the yellow sun in the blue sky,"" Artemyev said, as reported by The Guardian . ""These days, even though we are in space, we are together with our president and our people!"" Even so, on Friday, Artemyev had explained the color choice with a different rationale, saying the team chose the bright yellow because there was so much of that material in storage, explaining ""that‚Äôs why we had to wear yellow,"" The Guardian reported.

Russia claims it used deadly hypersonic weapons Mikoyan MiG-31K fighter jets with Kinzhal hypersonic missiles fly over Moscow's Red Square during the Victory Day military parade in Moscow, Russia, on May 09, 2018. (Image credit: Sefa Karacan/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images) Russian president Vladimir Putin claimed the country has deployed its newest Kinzhal hypersonic missiles for the first time in Ukraine on Friday (March 18) in an effort to destroy a weapons storage facility, This is the first time that Russia has claimed to use such high-precision weapons in combat, according to the South China Morning Post. ""The Kinzhal aviation missile system with hypersonic aeroballistic missiles destroyed a large underground warehouse containing missiles and aviation ammunition in the village of Deliatyn in the Ivano-Frankivsk region,"" the Russian defence ministry said Saturday (March 19), as reported by Al Jazeera . The Kinzhal weapon, which was unveiled and tested in March 2018, reportedly travels at 10 times the speed of sound. At the time, Putin, speaking on Russian television, indicated that this new hypersonic missile and cruise missile had ""unlimited range"" and could avoid adversaries' detection technologies.

Russian cosmonauts wear Ukraine colors on space station Donning bright yellow and blue flight suits, cosmonauts Oleg Artemyev, Denis Matveev and Sergey Korsakov float aboard the International Space Station after arriving on March 18, 2022. (Image credit: Roscosmos TV) Three Russian cosmonauts who arrived at the International Space Station on Friday (March 18) wore yellow and blue flight suits ‚Äî the same colors as the Ukraine flag ‚Äî when they entered the orbiting lab, according to The Associated Press . The three cosmonauts, Oleg Artemyev, Denis Matveev and Sergey Korsakov, joined seven crewmates already onboard the ISS. Whether their ""fashion choice"" was a sign of their support for Ukraine during the Russian invasion is unknown. When the trio were able to speak with family on Earth, Artemyev was asked about the color choice. He responded: ‚ÄúIt became our turn to pick a color. But in fact, we had accumulated a lot of yellow material so we needed to use it. So that‚Äôs why we had to wear yellow,‚Äù he said, as reported by the AP. Regardless, former NASA astronauts who were watching the docking with the ISS noticed. In a tweet on Friday, former NASA astronaut Scott Kelly said, ""Three Russian cosmonauts who just docked with the ISS arrive in Ukrainian yellow!"" Kelly was onboard the space station with cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko from March 2015 to March 2016.

International Energy Agency warns of impending energy crisis The International Energy Agency, an autonomous intergovernmental organization, warned that Russia's invasion of Ukraine is likely to create a global energy crisis, the likes of which we've never seen before, The New York Times reported . The agency, which was established after the 1973 oil crisis to help stabilize the global energy market, issued several recommendations to help nations reduce their dependence on oil. ""Reducing demand is a way of addressing the situation without just pumping more oil,"" said Fatih Birol, the agency‚Äôs executive director, according to the Times. The agency's recommendations include reducing speed limits; reducing fares on public transportation; promoting the use of trains over airplanes, when possible; encouraging carpooling; instituting car-free days in cities; and cutting down on commuting by having people work from home three days a week. The agency also put forth several recommendations to be implemented in the long-term, such as establishing the necessary infrastructure to prioritize electric vehicles.

Race to deliver food to Ukraine; ExoMars mission cuts ties with Russia The ExoMars rover, called Rosalind Franklin, is designed to collect samples beneath the Martian surface. (Image credit: ESA) ‚ÄîThe World Food Programme (WFP) is urgently trying to deliver emergency food supplies to hardhit Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv, Kharkiv and Dnipro, The Guardian reported . These cities, the WFP said, are at risk of ""medieval tactics of besiegement."" ‚ÄúWe are concentrating right now on stocking up the cities that are in danger of being encircled. That‚Äôs the rush against time for us,‚Äù said Jakob Kern, emergency coordinator for WFP, as reported by The Guardian. The agency will try to get food into the porty city of Mariupol, where bombings have destroyed a hospital complex and more, as well as the encircled city of Sumy; aid workers plan to take advantage of any ceasefires for humanitarian aid, The Guardian said. ‚ÄîThe European Space Agency unanimously voted to suspend a joint Mars mission with Russia. The Council of the ESA said on Thursday (March 17) that due to the the tragedy that is unfolding in the Ukraine since the Russian invasion, the agency could no longer carry out ""ongoing cooperation with Roscosmos on the ExoMars rover mission with a launch in 2022,"" referring to the Russian Space Agency and its role in the second part of the ExoMars program that involves sending a rover and a Russian surface platform to the Red Planet.

ESA suspends Russian partnership on Mars mission The European Space Agency (ESA) will suspend its partnership with Russian space agency Roscosmos on a number of projects, including the ExoMars rover mission, which is scheduled to launch later this year, the ESA said in a statement. ESA officials will implement a fast-track study to ""define the available options for a way forward to implement the ExoMars rover mission,"" the agency said.



The ExoMars mission will hunt for evidence of potential past life on Mars. The mission was previously pushed back in 2020, due to pandemic-related issues.

US astronaut will ride Russian capsule home to Earth NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei is carried to a medical tent shortly after he, NASA astronaut Joe Acaba, and Russian cosmonaut Alexander Misurkin landed in their Soyuz MS-06 spacecraft near the town of Zhezkazgan, Kazakhstan on Feb. 28, 2018 (Image credit: NASA) U.S. astronaut Mark Vande Hei will return to Earth from the International Space Station (ISS) aboard a Russian space capsule alongside two Russian cosmonauts, despite earlier fears that he might get left behind amid tensions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, BBC reported . ""I can tell you for sure Mark is coming home... We are in communication with our Russian colleagues. There's no fuzz on that,"" Joel Montalbano, NASA's International ISS program manager said. Vande Hei, 55, has been in space for 355 days, setting a new U.S. record for most time spent in space. He and the two cosmonauts are expected to land in Kazakhstan on March 30. Earlier this month, ‚Äã‚ÄãDmitry Rogozin, chief of the Russian Space Agency Roscosmos, announced on state TV that Russia would halt rocket sales to the U.S. in response to sanctions against Russia.

Biden‚Äôs national security adviser warns Russia against use of chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine (Image credit: Chip Somodevilla / Staff via Getty Images) Jake Sullivan, National Security Advisor to President Joe Biden, spoke with General Nikolay Patrushev, Secretary of the Russian Security Council, on Wednesday (March 16), according to a White House statement . During the call, Sullivan ""warned General Patrushev about the consequences and implications of any possible Russian decision to use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine,"" the statement reads. U.S. officials have not said exactly why they think Russia might deploy chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, The New York Times reported . But that said, Russia recently accused the U.S. of operating a biowarfare lab out of Ukraine, and ""Russia has a track record of accusing the West of the very crimes that Russia itself is perpetrating,"" U.S. Department of State spokesperson Ned Price said in a recent statement . ""These tactics are an obvious ploy by Russia to try to justify further premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified attacks on Ukraine.""

Power lost at Chernobyl (again) The Chernobyl plant has been captured for nearly 3 weeks. (Image credit: Shutterstock) The defunct Chernobyl nuclear power plant has lost power again, less than 24 hours after the plant's electricity was restored on March 13. Ukrenergo, Ukraine's electrical grid operator, has demanded safe entry to the site for a repair crew to inspect and fix the high-voltage power lines that supply the plant's electricity. Approximately 20,000 spent nuclear fuel units sit in the plant's cooling tanks, and without reliable power, the likelihood of the evaporation and discharge of nuclear material at the site may increase, Ukrainian officials have warned. But nuclear experts, including the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), have downplayed these concerns, saying that cutting off power to the Chernobyl power plant will not have a drastic impact on the facility's safety.

Pregnant woman from Mariupol hospital attack dies A pregnant woman who was pulled out of the rubble of the bombed Ukrainian maternity hospital in Mariupol on March 9 has reportedly died; her baby also died, The Associated Press reported. AP photos of the woman on a stretcher stroking her bloodied belly and her face in shock was one of the ""most brutal moments"" in the now 19-day invasion of Ukraine, the AP reported. When the woman was rushed to a nearby hospital, she reportedly realized her baby was dying and yelled out to the medics ""Kill me now!"" the AP said. The surgeon who treated her told the AP that her pelvis had been crushed and hip was detached from the attack. The baby was delivered via C-section, though it showed no signs of life.

Pharma company Bayer suspends ads, business in Russia Bayer, one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, is halting business in Russia. ""As a response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Bayer stopped all spending in Russia and Belarus that is not related to supplying essential products in health and agriculture,"" Bayer said in a statement today (March 14). The ban includes halting both advertising and promotional activities in Russia as well as any capital investment projects. However, Bayer did not suspend delivery of their products to Russia, as some people had reportedly wanted: ""Our position is that this senseless war has already taken many lives. As a Life Science company, we have an ethical obligation ‚Äî in every country we operate in. Withholding essential health and agriculture products from the civilian populations ‚Äî like cancer or cardiovascular treatments, health products for pregnant women and children as well as seeds to grow food ‚Äî would only multiply the war's ongoing toll on human life,"" Bayer said.

Energy prices soar in EU after Russian sanctions Energy prices skyrocket in the European Union, on the heels of sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, according to news reports. Nikolai Kobrinets, a Russian foreign ministry officer, said that the EU would pay at least three times more for their oil, gas and electricity, Reuters reported . ""I believe the European Union would not benefit from this ‚Äî we have more durable supplies and stronger nerves,"" Kobrinets told Interfax, a Russian news agency, as reported by Reuters. In fact, Russia is currently urging India to invest even more into the country's oil and gas sector. ""Russia's economy faces its deepest crisis since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union , as the West imposes severe sanctions over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine,"" Reuters reported . Russia is one of the world's largest oil producers. This month, the International Energy Agency (IEA) put together a 10-point plan to help reduce the European Union‚Äôs reliance on Russia‚Äôs natural gas.

U.N. discusses baseless claims of U.S. bioweapons program in Ukraine, Russia adds 'bird army' to list of conspiracy theories A woman feeds pigeons in Ternopil, Ukraine. Russia claims the U.S. is training migratory birds to attack Russian targets with Ukrainian bioweapons. (Image credit: Getty) The U.N. Security Council convened on Friday (March 11) to discuss Russia's unsupported claims that the United States has been running a biological weapons program out of Ukraine. The U.S. again denied the claims, instead accusing Russia of using the council meeting for ""lying and spreading disinformation,"" the Associated Press reported . U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield suggested that Russia had fabricated these claims to ""justify its own violent attacks against the Ukrainian people,"" and that Russia was likely to ""use chemical or biological agents for assassinations, as part of a staged or false-flag incident, or to support tactical military operations."" U.N. disarmament chief Izumi Nakamitsu agreed that there was no evidence of ""any biological weapons programs"" in Ukraine. With its claims still being boosted by Chinese media as well as right-wing pundits in the U.S, Russia continued to push the story on Friday, adding the bizarre detail that the U.S. had trained an army of migratory birds to carry Ukrainian bioweapons across the border to drop on Russian targets, Vice reported .

WHO advises Ukraine labs to destroy high-threat pathogens A picture taken on May 8, 2021 shows a sign of the World Health Organization (WHO) at the entrance of their headquarters in Geneva (Image credit: FABRICE COFFRINI / Contributor via Getty Images) The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that Ukrainian public health labs that handle infectious agents destroy any ""high-threat pathogens"" to prevent potential spills during the ongoing Russian invasion, the agency told Reuters on Thursday (March 10). The WHO previously worked with Ukrainian public health labs to establish security protocols aimed at preventing the ""accidental or deliberate"" release of such pathogens, the agency told Reuters in an email. ""As part of this work, the WHO has strongly recommended to the Ministry of Health in Ukraine and other responsible bodies to destroy high-threat pathogens to prevent any potential spills,"" the email read. The agency also advised all affected parties ""to reach out for technical assistance as needed,"" regarding the safe and secure disposal of any pathogens. Read the full story on Live Science .

China boosts unsupported Russian claim of Ukraine bioweapons labs China has joined Russia in spreading unsupported claims that the United States has been funding biological weapons‚Äô labs in Ukraine. The U.S. denies the claims, and the UN says it has not received any information to back them up. Even so, both China and Russia insist that the rumors are true, and that the U.S. may be gearing up to use them on Ukrainian citizens, the Associated Press reports . ""This Russian military operation has uncovered the secret of the U.S. labs in Ukraine, and this is not something that can be dealt with in a perfunctory manner,"" Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign ministry, said Thursday (March 10). ""It is not something they can muddle through by saying that China's statement and Russia's finding are disinformation, and are absurd and ridiculous."" The claims have since been picked up by far-right groups and media in the U.S., but U.S. state department officials say the allegations are a disinformation operation. ""The Russian accusations are absurd. They're laughable. And you know, in the words of my Irish Catholic grandfather, a bunch of malarkey. There's nothing to it. It's classic Russian propaganda,"" John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said in a news briefing on Wednesday (March 9). ""Unlike Russia, which does have chemical weapons and has used them, and does do biological weapons research and has for years, Ukraine has neither,"" Burns, the director of the CIA and a former U.S. ambassador to Moscow, said in a senate hearing on Thursday. ""And when you couple that with their demonstrated willingness to create false flag operations and try to create the impression that somehow Ukrainians are responsible for this, that should give us all pretty serious reason for concern about their propaganda."" The U.N. Security Council is set to discuss Moscow‚Äôs claim at a meeting today (March 11).

Death toll rises from Mariupol hospital bombing The destroyed hospital complex contained a maternity ward, children's ward and internal medicine department, according to Ukrainian officials. (Image credit: Volodymyr Zelenskyy via Twitter) At least three people, including a 6-year-old child, were killed in a Russian airstrike on a hospital complex in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol yesterday, city officials said on Thursday (March 10). At least 17 other civilians were wounded in the attack, which destroyed the hospital's maternity and children's wards, deputy mayor Sergiy Orlov told reporters. Russian forces continue to bomb the city for the eighth day in a row, the New York Times reported. The city is home to some 430,000 people. Read the full story on Live Science.

Chernobyl safe after power loss The damaged Chernobyl nuclear reactor, site of one of the worst nuclear accidents in history, in April, 1986 (Image credit: Karen Kasmauski/Getty Images) The UN's atomic watchdog has said that the cutting off of power to the Chernobyl power plant will not have a drastic impact on the facility's safety. The Chernobyl nuclear facility was taken on the first day of the invasion (Feb. 24). After heavy fighting, Russian forces captured the defunct plant and took its roughly 210 staff hostage. An announcement made yesterday (March 9) by Ukraine's state energy company said that the plant has been disconnected from the electrical grid, leaving its roughly 20,000 spent nuclear fuel units held in cooling tanks without active cooling, Live Science previously reported . This led to concerns that the defunct Chernobyl reactor's spent fuel would overheat and leak from containment. But the IAEA said in a tweet that while the development ""violates (a) key safety pillar,"" in this case it saw ""no critical impact on safety."" The UN agency said that ""the heat load of spent fuel storage pool and volume of cooling water at #Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant"" were ""sufficient for effective heat removal without need for electrical supply."" The seven pillars of nuclear safety are seven important regulatory conditions set out by the IAEA for nuclear facilities. Among them are the requirements to maintain the physical integrity of nuclear facilities; ensure that staff are not under coercion or duress; and guarantee a constant supply of electricity to facilities. Ukraine's state energy company has announced that ""there is no possibility to restore the lines"" at Chernobyl and that the site's security systems had also lost power. Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, a key Russian ally, has instructed Belarusian specialists to restore the Chernobyl plant's power supply, according to the state-owned Belarusian news agency BelTA.

A screenshot from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant's livestream during a fire following fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces (Image credit: Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine was overtaken by Russian forces last week, and now, the plant's communication lines have been cut, the United Nations' (UN) atomic watchdog has announced. That means that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is no longer receiving data transmissions from the Zaporizhzhia plant or the defunct Chernobyl power plant, whose communication lines had already been severed. Without a way to monitor how nuclear material is being handled at these sites, the IAEA cannot check that key safety regulations are being upheld or that material isn't being moved from its current location. ""The remote transmission of data from IAEA safeguards equipment located at nuclear sites around the world is an important component of our safeguards implementation, in Ukraine and globally,"" IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi said in a statement . ""Such systems... enable us to monitor nuclear material and activities at these sites when our inspectors are not present."" Read the full story on Live Science .

'Genocide,' 'Apocalyptic' and 'Atrocity' used to describe situation in Mariupol Images being released from Ukraine continue to look bleak. Much of Mariupol‚Äôs population of 400,000 is without power, heat and water, as well as no phone signal, for over a week, a situation that the country‚Äôs foreign minister Dmitryo Kuleba said is akin to Russia ""holding 400,000 people hostage,"" The Guardian reported . The city is being bombarded by continuous shelling, resulting in the deaths of at least 1,170 Mariupol‚Äôs residents (47 of these individual were buried March 9 in a mass grave), the city‚Äôs deputy mayor Sergei Orlov said, as reported by The Guardian. Orlov called the acts ""medieval"" and ""pure genocide."" He reportedly added, ""The attack isn‚Äôt simply treacherous. It‚Äôs a war crime. They are attacking us with aviation, shells, multiple rocket launchers.‚Äù Meanwhile, the Red Cross has described conditions in Mariupol ""apocalyptic."" And ""catastrophic"" is the term the deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk used to describe what is happening in the port city, according to The Guardian. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy also denounced the brutal attack in Mariupol, saying it is an ""atrocity"" and comparing it to the devastation unleashed by the Nazis, The Guardian said.

Russia claims it used thermobaric weapons: What that means. A TOS-1A rocket system, shown in this stock image. (Image credit: SergeyVButorin/Getty Images) The Russian forces have used thermobaric weapons ‚Äî which pull in oxygen to generate a super-hot explosion ‚Äî in Ukraine, according to the U.K. Ministry of Defence. ""The Russian MoD has confirmed the use of the TOS-1A weapon system in Ukraine. The TOS-1A uses thermobaric rockets, creating incendiary and blast effects,"" the U.K. Ministry of Defence tweeted . The MoD also included a video showing the Russian TOS-1 rocket launchers, which can spit out up to 30 thermobaric warheads atop rockets in quick succession, according to the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation . Along with fuel air explosives, thermobaric warheads are a type of volumetric weapon that consists of a fuel container and two explosive charges, the Arms Control center explained. Once the weapon gets launched, the first explosive charge detonates and broadcasts fuel particles. Then, the second charge ignites those particles and oxygen in the surrounding air. The result? A high-pressure, high-temperature blast that can reverberate and can even generate a partial vacuum when released inside buildings and other enclosed spaces, the Arms Control center said. Though international law allows for the use of thermobaric weapons against military targets, they are banned if they could harm civilians, The Hill reported. U.S. officials have said that Russia is escalating its tactics, killing hundreds of civilians (including kids), The Hill reported . The Russian MoD has confirmed the use of the TOS-1A weapon system in Ukraine. The TOS-1A uses thermobaric rockets, creating incendiary and blast effects.Watch the video below for more information about this weapon and its devastating impact. üá∫üá¶ #StandWithUkraineüá∫üá¶ pic.twitter.com/d8PLQ0PhQDMarch 9, 2022 See more

(Image credit: Volodymyr Zelenskyy via Twitter) A hospital complex that includes a children‚Äôs ward and maternity hospital in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol has been destroyed by Russian forces dropping bombs on the facility, CNN reports . Video of the building after being bombed shared by the city council of Mariupol shows a hospital in tatters, with scraps from walls and beds and equipment strewn or in piles across the floors. ""A maternity hospital in the city center, a children‚Äôs ward and department of internal medicine ... all these were destroyed during the Russian air strike on Mariupol. Just now,"" said Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of the Donetsk regional administration. In terms of casualties, the police said that information ‚Äúis being clarified,‚Äù CNN reported. Even so, preliminary information indicates that at least 17 people were injured in the Russian attack, according to CNN. Among those injured are staff and patients in the maternity ward, The New York Times said . Though Russia and Ukraine had agreed on a cease-fire on Saturday (March 5), hours later fighting had resumed. Videos of the current strike also show sprays of shrapnel bursting through hospital windows. One of the resulting craters, this one in a courtyard between buildings, looked to be about 10 feet (3 meters) deep, according to the Times. Read the full story on Live Science.

(Image credit: dia images / Contributor via Getty Images) Dr. Hans Henri P. Kluge, the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Director for Europe, issued a statement on March 8 addressing health care provisions for civilians within and refugees beyond Ukraine. Kluge notes that he's been working with Amin Awad, Assistant Secretary-General and United Nations Crisis Coordinator for Ukraine, to establish a system to safely convey humanitarian health supplies into Ukraine. ""So far, 2 shipments totalling 76 tonnes (36 + 40 tonnes) of trauma and emergency health supplies, as well as freezers, refrigerators, ice packs and cool boxes are in transit in Ukraine,"" the statement reads. ""We have further shipments of 500 oxygen concentrators and more supplies are on their way."" WHO teams have also been deployed to Hungary, Poland, the Republic of Moldova and Romania to assess the needs of incoming refugees and to help build up the capacity of local health care systems. As the Russian invasion continues in Ukraine, so too does the COVID-19 pandemic. ""Remarkably, Ukraine has maintained its COVID-19 surveillance and response system,"" the WHO statement reads. The country reported 731 COVID-19 deaths to the WHO last week, ""and sadly this number will increase as oxygen shortages continue."" In addition to addressing the health status of Ukrainians, the WHO condemned Russian attacks on health care facilities and workers in the country. ""It should not need saying that health workers, hospitals and other medical facilities must never be a target at any time, including during crises and conflicts. To date, we have 16 confirmed reports of attacks on health in Ukraine, and more are being verified. WHO strongly condemns these attacks on health-care services."" Read the full WHO statement .

Ukraine's top climate scientist calls this a ""fossil fuel war"" An oil refinery in Russia (Image credit: Anton Petrus via Getty Images) As Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, Svitlana Krakovska, a senior scientist at the Ukrainian Hydrometeorological Institute, and a delegation of other Ukrainian scientists continued to attend UN-run virtual meetings to finalize the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report . Krakovska, who headed the Ukrainian delegation, told the IPCC chair that the group would ""continue to work if we have an internet connection and no missiles over our heads,"" Bloomberg Green reported on Feb. 28. Soon, however, members of the delegation had to abandon the enterprise to seek safety in air raid shelters, or to flee Ukraine altogether, The Guardian reported on Wednesday (March 9). Krakovska sheltered in her home in Kyiv with her family as missiles struck nearby buildings. At this time, ""I started to think about the parallels between climate change and this war and it‚Äôs clear that the roots of both these threats to humanity are found in fossil fuels,"" Krakovska told The Guardian. ""Burning oil, gas and coal is causing warming and impacts we need to adapt to. And Russia sells these resources and uses the money to buy weapons,"" she said. ""Other countries are dependent upon these fossil fuels, they don‚Äôt make themselves free of them. This is a fossil fuel war. It‚Äôs clear we cannot continue to live this way, it will destroy our civilization."" This statement follows an executive order from President Joe Biden banning the importation of Russian oil, gas and coal into the U.S., as well as an announcement from the European Union that its member states will be drastically reducing their dependence on Russian fossil fuels.

Chernobyl nuclear plant just went dark (Image credit: Karen Kasmauski/Getty Images) The site of the worst nuclear disaster in history, Chernobyl‚Äôs nuclear power plant has gone dark, as Russian forces occupy the defunct plant in Ukraine. The plant along with the facilities in the Chernobyl exclusion zone have no electricity, Ukraine‚Äôs state energy company announced . With now power, the planet‚Äôs estimated 20,000 spent nuclear fuel units, which are stored in cooling tanks, will no longer receive cooling. The fear is that the spent nuclear fuel could discharge a dangerous dose of radioactivity to the plant‚Äôs personnel, Ukrainian officials warned. Even so, nuclear energy experts caution that because the fuel rods are 22 years old, they are not as hot as they were initially and so this discharge is unlikely. Facility staff are responsible for decommissioning the site and ensuring the safe disposal of the radioactive material inside the plant‚Äôs defunct reactors. However, since Russian forces seized Chernobyl, that work has been on hold. ""I'm deeply concerned about the difficult and stressful situation facing staff at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and the potential risks this entails for nuclear safety,"" IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi said in the statement. ""I call on the forces in effective control of the site to urgently facilitate the safe rotation of personnel there."" Read the full story on Live Science.

Pentagon turns down Poland offer of Soviet-era fighter jets MiG-29 aircraft are twin-engine fighter jets designed in the Soviet Union. (Image credit: guvendemir/Getty Images) NATO member Poland said Tuesday (March 8) that the country was ready to deliver Mikoyan MiG-29 fighter jets designed in the Soviet Union to Ramstein Air Base for use by the U.S. The Defense Department, however, turned down the offer. The move is thought to be a way for Poland to avoid any retaliation for directly helping Ukraine fight against Russian invaders. However, the Pentagon responded that the delivering the Soviet-era warplanes from the Air Base in southwestern Germany into risky airspace is just not a ""tenable"" proposal. According to The Guardian , Poland is thought to have around 28 of these fighter aircraft. ""The prospect of fighter jets 'at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America' departing from a U.S./NATO base in Germany to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance,"" John F. Kirby, Pentagon press secretary, said in a statement today . ""It is simply not clear to us that there is a substantive rationale for it. We will continue to consult with Poland and our other NATO allies about this issue and the difficult logistical challenges it presents, but we do not believe Poland's proposal is a tenable one."" The proposal from Poland comes after news that although Russian forces are seeing great losses ‚Äî and not the easy win the Kremlin had anticipated ‚Äî the country under Vladimir Putin will push on, The New York Times reported . According to the Times, top intelligence officials said that Putin was ""surprised and unsettled by the problems that have hampered his military in Ukraine."" Even so, the Ukraine forces can't hold onto Kyiv forever. ""With supplies being cut off, it will become somewhat desperate in, I would say, 10 days to two weeks,"" Lt. Gen. Scott D.

Biden to sign order regulating cryptocurrency A novelty Bitcoin token arranged at a CoinUnited cryptocurrency exchange in Hong Kong, China, on Friday, March 4, 2022.

And now, in order to prevent Russia from skirting these restrictions with cryptocurrency , U.S. President Joe Biden is expected to sign an executive order this week to regulate the digital currency. According to Reuters, Biden could sign the order on Wednesday (March 9) for ""a wide-ranging oversight of the cryptocurrency market."" The executive order is also a response to moves by China and others to create their own cryptocurrencies, Reuters reported .

Victims in Bucha. (Ukrainian Ministry of Digital Development Mikhail Fedorov/Wikimedia Commons)

By Joe Lauria / Consortium News

Within hours of news Sunday that there had been a massacre at Bucha, a town 63 kms north of the Ukrainian capital, the verdict was in: Russian troops had senselessly slaughtered hundreds of innocent civilians as they withdrew from the town, leaving their bodies littering the streets.

Unlike their judicial systems, when it comes to war, Western nations dispense with the need for investigations and evidence and pronounce guilt based on political motives: Russia is guilty. Case closed.

Except the case hasn‚Äôt even been opened yet and the sentence is already being proposed. French President Emmanuel Macron, for instance, has called for Russian coal and oil to be banned from Europe. ‚ÄúThere are very clear indications of war crimes,‚Äù he said on France Inter radio Monday. ‚ÄúWhat happened in Bucha demands a new round of sanctions and very clear measures, so we will co-ordinate with our European partners, especially with Germany.‚Äù

Other voices are now perilously calling for the U.S. to go to war with Russia over the incident.

‚ÄúThis is genocide,‚Äù Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told Face the Nation on CBS. ‚ÄúMothers of Russians should see this. See what bastards you‚Äôve raised. Murderers, looters, butchers,‚Äù he added on Telegram.

Russia has categorically denied it had anything to do with the massacre.

Where to Start

If there were to be a serious probe, one of the first places an investigator would begin is to map out a timeline of events.

Last Wednesday, all Russian forces left Bucha, according to the Russian Defense Ministry.

This was confirmed on Thursday by a smiling Anatolii Fedoruk, the mayor of Bucha, in a video on the Bucha City Council official Facebook page. The translated post accompanying the video says:

‚ÄúMarch 31 ‚Äì the day of the liberation of Bucha. This was announced by Bucha Mayor Anatolii Fedoruk. This day will go down in the glorious history of Bucha and the entire Bucha community as a day of liberation by the Armed Forces of Ukraine from the Russian occupiers.‚Äù

All of the Russian troops are gone and yet there is no mention of a massacre. The beaming Fedoruk says it is a ‚Äúglorious day‚Äù in the history of Bucha, which would hardly be the case if hundreds of dead civilians littered the streets around Fedoruk.

‚ÄúRussian Defence Ministry denied accusations by the Kiev regime of the alleged killing of civilians in Bucha, Kiev Region. Evidence of crimes in Bucha appeared only on the fourth day after the Security Service of Ukraine and representatives of Ukrainian media arrived in the town. All Russian units completely withdrew from Bucha on March 30, and ‚Äònot a single local resident was injured‚Äô during the time when Bucha was under the control of Russian troops,‚Äù the Russian MOD said in a post on Telegram.

What Happened Next?

What happened then on Friday and Saturday? As pointed out in a piece by Jason Michael McCann on Standpoint Zero, The New York Times was in Bucha on Saturday and did not report a massacre. Instead, the Times said the withdrawal was completed on Saturday, two days after the mayor said it was, and that the Russians left ‚Äúbehind them dead soldiers and burned vehicles, according to witnesses, Ukrainian officials, satellite images and military analysts.‚Äù

The Times said reporters found the bodies of six civilians. ‚ÄúIt was unclear under what circumstances they had died, but the discarded packaging of a Russian military ration was lying beside one man who had been shot in the head,‚Äù the paper said. It then quoted a Zelensky adviser, who said:

‚Äú‚ÄôThe bodies of people with tied hands, who were shot dead by soldiers lie in the streets,‚Äô the adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said on Twitter. ‚ÄòThese people were not in the military. They had no weapons. They posed no threat.‚Äô He included an image of a scene, photographed by Agence France-Presse, showing three bodies on the side of a road, one with hands apparently tied behind the back. The New York Times was unable to independently verify Mr. Podolyak‚Äôs claim the people had been executed.‚Äô‚Äù

Bucha, Kyiv region. The bodies of people with tied hands, who were shot dead by üá∑üá∫ soldiers lie in the streets. These people were not in the military. They had no weapons. They posed no threat. How many more such cases are happening right now in the occupied territories? (1/2) pic.twitter.com/AJloZ81JIt ‚Äî –ú–∏—Ö–∞–π–ª–æ –ü–æ–¥–æ–ª—è–∫ (@Podolyak_M) April 2, 2022

It is possible that on Saturday the full extent of the horror had yet to emerge, and that even the mayor was unaware of it two days before, though photos now show many of the bodies out in the open on the streets of the town, something that presumably would be difficult to miss.

In Bucha, the Times was close to the neo-Nazi Azov Battalion, whose soldiers appear in the newspaper‚Äôs photographs. In his piece, McCann suggests that Azov may responsible for the killings:

‚ÄúSomething very interesting then happens on [Saturday] 2 April, hours before a massacre is brought to the attention of the national and international media. The US and EU-funded Gorshenin Institute online [Ukrainian language] site Left Bank announced that: ‚ÄòSpecial forces have begun a clearing operation in the city of Bucha in the Kyiv region, which has been liberated by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The city is being cleared from saboteurs and accomplices of Russian forces.‚Äô The Russian military has by now completely left the city, so this sounds for all the world like reprisals. The state authorities would be going through the city searching for ‚Äòsaboteurs‚Äô and ‚Äòaccomplices of Russian forces.‚Äô Only the day before [Friday], Ekaterina Ukraintsiva, representing the town council authority, appeared on an information video on the Bucha Live Telegram page wearing military fatigues and seated in front of a Ukrainian flag to announce ‚Äòthe cleansing of the city.‚Äô She informed residents that the arrival of the Azov battalion did not mean that liberation was complete (but it was, the Russians had fully withdrawn), and that a ‚Äòcomplete sweep‚Äô had to be performed.‚Äù

Ukraintsiva was speaking a day after the mayor had said the town was liberated.

By Sunday morning, the world learned of the massacre of hundreds of people. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said: ‚ÄúWe strongly condemn apparent atrocities by Kremlin forces in Bucha and across Ukraine. We are pursuing accountability using every tool available, documenting and sharing information to hold accountable those responsible.‚Äù President Joe Biden on Monday called for a ‚Äúwar crimes‚Äù trial. ‚ÄúThis guy is brutal, and what‚Äôs happening in Bucha is outrageous, and everyone‚Äôs seen it. I think it‚Äôs a war crime.‚Äù

The Bucha incident is a critical moment in the war. An impartial investigation is warranted, which probably only the U.N. could conduct. The Azov Battalion may have perpetrated revenge killings against Russian collaborators, or the Russians carried out this massacre. (Once again the Pentagon is dampening the war hysteria, saying it can‚Äôt confirm or deny Russia was responsible.)

A rush to judgment is dangerous, with irresponsible talk of the U.S. directly fighting Russia. But it is a rush to judgment that we are getting.

[Update: Satellite images, published after this article appeared by The New York Times, purportedly showing bodies strewn on a street in mid-March, should be considered by an impartial investigation. It cannot be considered at this point as conclusive evidence.]
