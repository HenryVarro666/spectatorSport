Here's a look at the most significant developments from today and how the situation unfolded:

Putin announces 'special operation'

In an unscheduled television address on Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that he ""decided to conduct a special military operation.""

Putin claimed the ""operation"" was to ""protect people who have been subjected to bullying and genocide... for the last eight years,"" or since 2014, when Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea. Moscow-backed separatists have fought the government's forces in eastern Ukraine ever since.

The Russian government claimed hours earlier that separatist leaders had requested military help to fend off what they called Ukrainian ""aggression.""

Putin said, ""We will strive for the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine.""

At an emergency UN Security Council meeting, Russia's envoy Vassily Nebenzia said the ""operation"" was targeting ""the junta"" in power in Kyiv.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenkskyy was elected in a 2019 vote, although some eligible voters could not take part owing either to Russia's annexation of Crimea or the fighting in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.

Ukraine: Worst-case scenario plays out

Air raid sirens sounded over the Ukrainian capital at the break of dawn.

The Ukrainian leadership said at least 40 soldiers had been killed so far by Russian airstrikes.

Zelenskyy declared martial law and said Russia was attacking his country's ""military infrastructure.""

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said, ""Putin has just launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Peaceful Ukrainian cities are under strikes.""

""This is a war of aggression. Ukraine will defend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now,"" he added.

Ukraine's border guard reported that Russian tanks entered Ukraine in the Luhansk region and Crimea.

Russia's Defense Ministry said it had neutralized Ukrainian military airbases and air defense systems.

West reacts: Sanctions, condemnation and NATO reinforcement

World convened on Thursday as part of multiple bodies, including the European Union, NATO and the G7.

NATO announced it would deploy additional forces to eastern Europe ""to take additional steps to further strengthen deterrence and defense across the alliance.""

The European Union was quick to vow the ""strongest, the harshest package"" of sanctions ever considered, the bloc's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said.

Europen Union leaders agreed to a sweeping second set of sanctions against Russia at an emergency meeting in Brussels on Thursday.

""These sanctions cover the financial sector, the energy and transport sectors, dual-use goods as well as export controls and export financing, visa policy, additional listings of Russian Individuals and new listing criteria,"" the European Union said in a statement.

""With this package, we will target the strategic sectors of the Russian economy by blocking their access to technologies and markets that are key to Russia,"" European Commission President U von der Leyen said before presenting the sanctions.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz expressed solidarity with Ukrainians, saying ""Putin's war"" on their country was completely without justification. The US and the UK strongly condemned the Russian invasion.

The US, the EU, Japan and the UK had already unveiled a range of economic and financial sanctions against Russia earlier this week, while Germany suspended the Russian Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.

The moves came in the wake of Putin ordering troops into the separatist-held regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine after he recognized the independence of the two regions.

Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden announced ""devastating"" Western sanctions against Russia after a virtual closed-door meeting with the other G7 powers.

The G7 states are the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States.

Biden tweeted that the G7 leaders ""agreed to move forward on devastating packages of sanctions and other economic measures to hold Russia to account. We stand with the brave people of Ukraine.""

In a joint statement, the seven countries said they were ""ready to act"" to minimize disruptions to world energy markets resulting from Russia's attack on Ukraine.

Failed diplomacy

For weeks, Western intelligence has shown that a Russian attack on Ukraine was imminent, with over 150,000 Russian troops massed along the Ukrainian borders.

NATO allies have also warned that Russia was seeking a pretext to invade Ukraine further.

Still, diplomatic efforts were continuing to prevent an invasion. But when Putin announced the recognition of two separatist regions in eastern Ukraine as ""independent republics,"" diplomacy came to a halt.

""While we were trying to find a political solution, they were planning for this invasion,"" NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday. ""Russia has shut the door"" on a political solution, he added.

Up until late Wednesday, Ukraine's Zelenskyy said he attempted to reach out to Putin. In an emotional address, Zelenskyy said, ""Today I initiated a phone call with the president of the Russian Federation. The result was silence.""

Russia on Wednesday had withdrawn its diplomatic mission from Kyiv. Ukraine on Thursday officially severed diplomatic ties with Russia.

A brief history of Ukrainian-Russian relations

Ukraine, the largest country on the European continent, had a short-lived independent state following World War I. It was absorbed by the Soviet Union, which forced the terror of famine on the country in the 1930s under Josef Stalin.

In 1991, Ukraine officially declared its independence. Russia recognized Ukraine's borders in a number of international agreements.

With the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukraine politically began looking westwards and started talking with both the European Union and NATO.

In 2004, the first of two significant revolutions on Maidan Square took place, known as the ""Orange Revolution."" That year, voters elected the pro-Western candidate Viktor Yushchenko over the Russian-backed Viktor Yanukovych, who later won the 2010 elections.

In 2013, Yanukovych stopped the signing of an association agreement with the EU he had said he supported earlier. Protests ensued and the second Maidan revolution, Ukraine's ""Revolution for Dignity"" as it has become known, culminated in his security forces firing on demonstrators gathered on Maidan. Yanukovych fled to Russia by helicopter the next day, taking with him briefcases of cash and documents.

A year later, Russia annexed Crimea. Bloody battles and heavy losses in the eastern part of the country have been ongoing since then.

In eastern Ukraine, Russian-backed separatists are fighting for what they have called ""people's republics "" in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, and more than 13,000 people have been killed so far, according to the UN. An additional 1.4 million Ukrainians have been internally displaced by the conflict.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, announced the country’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on Thursday and added that Ukrainian cities are under strikes. “Putin has just launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Peaceful Ukrainian cities are under strikes. This is a war of aggression. Ukraine will defend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now,” Kuleba tweeted. This tweet comes less than an hour after Putin announced a special “military operation” to protect Donbas in eastern Ukraine.

Defending Russia’s decision to take military action in the Donbas region, the Russian envoy to the UN Vasily Alekseevich Nebenzya, told UN Security Council “the root of today’s crisis around Ukraine is the actions of Ukraine itself.” “The root of today’s crisis around Ukraine is the actions of Ukraine itself, who for many years were sabotaging its obligations under the (Minsk agreement),” said Nebenzya.

Nebenzya said that the Russian operation is aimed to protect residents in eastern Ukraine. Condemning Russia’s “unprovoked and unjustified attack on Ukraine”, US President Joe Biden said that the premeditated war will bring a catastrophic loss of life. “The prayers of the entire world are with the people of Ukraine tonight as they suffer an unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces. President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering,” Biden said in a White House statement.

Asserting that the US and its allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way, Biden said that Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring. The world will hold Russia accountable, he added.

Putin said the special military action was ""aimed at demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine"". He also warned other countries that any attempt to interfere with the Russian action would lead to ""consequences they have never seen.""

As Vladimir Putin spoke, big explosions were heard in Kyiv, Kharkiv and other areas of Ukraine.

Soon after, Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted, ""Putin has just launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Peaceful Ukrainian cities are under strike. This is a war of aggression. Ukraine will defend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now.""

Meanwhile, Ukraine's interior ministry confirmed that Kyiv is under attack from cruise and ballistic missiles.

As Russia prepared to invade Ukraine, the United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting to discuss the escalating tensions.

Speaking at the UN meeting, the Russian ambassador said, "" A special operation declared by President Putin is to protect the people of Ukraine who have been suffering for years.

Russian President, in a surprise statement shortly before 6 am Moscow time (0300 GMT, said, “I have made the decision of a military operation.”

Despite Putin’s claim that it's a military action, soon explosions were heard across Ukraine’s capital Kyiv and other parts of the country. Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba also warned that a ""full-scale invasion"" was underway.

Putin also called Ukrainian service members to ""lay down their arms and go home"", adding that the special military action was meant for ""demilitarisation and denazification"" of Ukraine.

Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba accused the Russian leader of launching a full-scale invasion. Kuleba tweeted, ""Putin has just launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Peaceful Ukrainian cities are under strikes. This is a war of aggression. Ukraine will defend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now.""

Kuleba, in a tweet, to Ukrainians around the globe said, “Putin attacked, but no one is running away. Army, diplomats, everyone is working. Ukraine fights. Ukraine will defend itself. Ukraine will win.”

United States

US President Joe Biden, who has ruled out putting U.S. troops on the ground in Ukraine, said that ""world will hold Russia accountable"" for the attack against Ukraine. Biden also warned that the Russian President’s actions will cause ""catastrophic loss of life.""

Biden, in a statement, shortly after Putin announces military operations in Ukraine, said he would address the US public to outline the ""consequences"" for Russia and called the attack ""unprovoked and unjustified.”

Britain

UK’s Prime Minster Boris Johnson said ""I am appalled by the horrific events in Ukraine and I have spoken to President Zelenskyy to discuss next steps. President Putin has chosen a path of bloodshed and destruction by launching this unprovoked attack on Ukraine.""

Barbara Woodward, British ambassador to the UN, said “This is a grave day for Ukraine and for the principles of the United Nations. We and our partners have been clear that there will be consequences for Russia's actions.”

NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization)

Jens Stoltenberg, Secretary-General, NATO, while condemning Russia's reckless and unprovoked attack, said NATO allies would meet to tackle the consequences.

Finland

Sauli Niinistö, President, Finland, said that he strongly condemns the military measures Russia has started in Ukraine. Niinistö said “Russia's acts target Ukraine, but at the same time they are an attack on the entire European security order. We feel deep compassion towards Ukraine and are seeking ways to increase our support to Ukraine.""

Sanctions imposed

Even before Putin's announcement, dozens of nations had imposed sanctions on Russia, further reducing Russian influence and banks out of global markets. The threat of war has already fractured Ukraine's economy and raised the spectre of massive casualties, energy shortages across Europe and global economic chaos.

Many western countries and Japan, in response to Putin's Monday announcement, imposed sanctions on Russian banks and individuals but held off their toughest measures until an invasion began.

The US increased the pressure on February 23 and imposed penalties on the Russian firm building the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. Germany has also frozen approvals for the pipeline amid concerns that it could allow Moscow to weaponise energy supplies.

European Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen promised to hold the Kremlin accountable. They tweeted, “In these dark hours, our thoughts are with Ukraine and the innocent women, men and children as they face this unprovoked attack and fear for their lives.”

Russian missiles rained down on Ukrainian cities. Ukraine reported columns of troops pouring across its borders into the eastern Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Luhansk regions, and landing by sea at the cities of Odessa and Mariupol in the south.

Explosions could be heard before dawn in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. Gunfire rattled out near the main airport and sirens blared across the city.

A resident of Ukraine's second largest city Kharkiv, the closest big city to the Russian border, said windows in apartment blocks were shaking from constant blasts. The city was gripped by panic as people tried to flee, said the resident, who asked not to be identified.

Ukraine's President Volodymur Zelenskiy said Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin's aim was to destroy his state.

""This is a war of aggression. Ukraine will defend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now.""

At least eight people had been killed and nine were wounded by the Russian shelling, an advisor to the Ukrainian Minister of Internal Affairs said.

Putin declared in a televised address that he had ordered ""a special military operation"" to protect people, including Russian citizens who had been subjected to ""genocide"" in Ukraine, an accusation the West has long described as absurd propaganda.

""And for this we will strive for the demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine,"" Putin said. ""Russia cannot feel safe, develop, and exist with a constant threat emanating from the territory of modern Ukraine...All responsibility for bloodshed will be on the conscience of the ruling regime in Ukraine.""

Ukraine, a democratic country of 44 million people with more than 1,000 years of history, is the biggest country in Europe by area after Russia itself. It voted overwhelmingly for independence from Moscow after the fall of the Soviet Union and says it aims to join NATO and the European Union.

Putin, who denied for months that he was planning an invasion, has called Ukraine an artificial creation carved from Russia by enemies, a characterisation Ukrainians call shocking and false.

US President Joe Biden said his prayers were with the people of Ukraine ""as they suffer an unprovoked and unjustified attack"", while promising tough sanctions in response.

He would be meeting with G7 leaders, he said.

EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell also promised the toughest financial sanctions the bloc had ever imposed.

""These are among the darkest hours of Europe since the Second World War,"" Borrell said.

The full scope of the Russian military operation was not immediately clear but Putin said: ""Our plans do not include the occupation of Ukrainian territories. We are not going to impose anything by force.""

Speaking as the UN Security Council held an emergency meeting in New York, Putin said he had ordered Russian forces to protect the people and appealed to the Ukrainian military to lay down their arms.

Zelenskiy appealed to world leaders to impose all possible sanctions on Russia, including on Putin.

Three hours after Putin gave his order, Russia's defence ministry said it had taken out military infrastructure at Ukrainian air bases and degraded its air defences, Russian media reported.

Earlier, Ukrainian media reported that military command centres in Kyiv and the city of Kharkiv in the northeast had been struck by missiles, while Russian troops had landed in the southern port cities of Odessa and Mariupol.

A Reuters witness later heard three loud blasts in Mariupol. Russian-backed separatists in the east later said they had captured two towns, the RIA news agency reported. There was no immediate comment by authorities in Ukraine.

Russia announced it was shutting all shipping in the Azov Sea. Russia controls the strait leading into the sea where Ukraine has ports including Mariupol.

Hours before the invasion began, the separatists issued a plea to Moscow for help to stop alleged Ukrainian aggression - claims the United States dismissed as Russian propaganda.

Global stocks and US bond yields dived, while the dollar and gold rocketed higher after Putin's address. Brent oil surged past $100/barrel for the first time since 2014.

(AP Photo/Emilio Morenatti)

Russia launched a wide-ranging attack on Ukraine on Thursday, hitting cities and bases with airstrikes or shelling, as civilians piled into trains and cars to flee. Ukraine’s government said Russian tanks and troops rolled across the border in a “full-scale war” that could rewrite the geopolitical order and whose fallout already reverberated around the world.

In unleashing Moscow’s most aggressive action since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, President Vladimir Putin deflected global condemnation and cascading new sanctions — and chillingly referred to his country’s nuclear arsenal. He threatened any foreign country attempting to interfere with “consequences you have never seen.”

Sirens rang out in Ukraine’s capital, large explosions were heard there and in other cities, and people massed in train stations and took to roads, as the government said the former Soviet republic was seeing a long-anticipated invasion from the east, north and south. It reported more than 40 soldiers had been killed and dozens wounded so far.

The chief of the NATO alliance said the “brutal act of war” shattered peace in Europe, joining a chorus of world leaders who decried the attack, which could cause massive casualties, topple Ukraine’s democratically elected government and upend the post-Cold War security order. The conflict was already shaking global financial markets: Stocks plunged and oil prices soared amid concerns that heating bills and food prices would skyrocket.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy cut diplomatic ties with Moscow and declared martial law.

“As of today, our countries are on different sides of world history,” Zelenskyy tweeted. “Russia has embarked on a path of evil, but Ukraine is defending itself and won’t give up its freedom.”

His adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said: “A full-scale war in Europe has begun. … Russia is not only attacking Ukraine, but the rules of normal life in the modern world.”

The attack targeted a country the size of Texas that has increasingly tilted toward the democratic West and away from Moscow’s sway. The autocratic Putin made clear earlier this week that he sees no reason for Ukraine to exist, raising fears of possible broader conflict in the vast space that the Soviet Union once ruled. Putin denied plans to occupy Ukraine, but his ultimate goals remain hazy.

Ukrainians who had long braced for the prospect of an assault were urged to stay home and not to panic despite the dire warnings.

With social media amplifying a torrent of military claims and counter-claims, it was difficult to determine exactly what was happening on the ground.

Associated Press reporters saw or confirmed explosions in the capital, in Mariupol on the Azov Sea, and Kharkiv in the east. AP confirmed video showing Russian military vehicles crossing into Ukrainian-held territory in the north from Belarus and from Russian-annexed Crimea in the south.

“We are facing a war and horror. What could be worse?” 64-year-old Liudmila Gireyeva said in Kyiv. She planned to flee the city and try to eventually get to Poland to join her daughter. Putin “will be damned by history, and Ukrainians are damning him.”

Governments from the U.S. to Asia and Europe readied new sanctions after weeks of failed efforts for a diplomatic solution. But global powers have said they will not intervene militarily to defend Ukraine, though NATO mobilized more troops to move toward eastern Europe.

Alliance member Lithuania, which borders Russian ally Belarus and a Russian exclave, declared a state of emergency, and the president of Moldova pushed to do the same.

“We woke up in a different world today,” Germany’s foreign minister said.

After weeks of denying plans to invade, Putin justified his actions in an overnight televised address, asserting that the attack was needed to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine — a false claim the U.S. had predicted he would make as a pretext for an invasion. He accused the U.S. and its allies of ignoring Russia’s demands to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO and for security guarantees.

The attacks came first from the air. Later Ukrainian authorities described ground invasions in multiple regions, and border guards released security camera footage Thursday showing a line of Russian military vehicles crossing into Ukraine’s government-held territory from Russian-annexed Crimea.

The Russian military claimed to have wiped out Ukraine’s entire air defenses in a matter of hours, and European authorities declared the country’s air space an active conflict zone. Russia’s claims could not immediately be verified, nor could Ukrainian ones that they had shot down several Russian aircraft. The Ukrainian air defense system and air force date back to the Soviet era and are dwarfed by Russia’s massive air power and precision weapons.

U.S. President Joe Biden pledged new sanctions to punish Russia for the “unprovoked and unjustified attack.” The president said he planned to speak to Americans on Thursday after a meeting of the Group of Seven leaders. More sanctions against Russia were expected to be announced.

Zelenskyy urged global leaders to provide defense assistance to Ukraine and help protect its airspace, and urged his compatriots to defend the nation. Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba pleaded: “The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now.”

In the capital, Mayor Vitaly Klitschko advised residents to stay home unless they are involved in critical work and urged them to prepare go-bags with necessities and documents if they need to evacuate.

Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister, said on Facebook that the Russian military had launched missile strikes on Ukrainian military command facilities, air bases and military depots in Kyiv, Kharkiv and Dnipro.

The Russian Defense Ministry said it was not targeting cities, but using precision weapons and claimed that “there is no threat to civilian population.”

The consequences of the conflict and resulting sanctions on Russia started reverberating throughout the world.

World stock markets plunged and oil prices surged by nearly $8 per barrel. Market benchmarks tumbled in Europe and Asia and U.S. stocks pointed toward a sharply lower open. Brent crude oil jumped to over $100 per barrel Thursday on unease about possible disruption of Russian supplies. The ruble sank.

Anticipating international condemnation and countermeasures, Putin issued a stark warning to other countries not to meddle.

In a reminder of Russia’s nuclear power, Putin warned that “no one should have any doubts that a direct attack on our country will lead to the destruction and horrible consequences for any potential aggressor.”

Among Putin’s pledges was to “denazify” Ukraine. World War II looms large in Russia, after the Soviet Union suffered more deaths than any country while fighting Adolf Hitler’s forces. Kremlin propaganda sometimes paints Ukrainian nationalists as neo-Nazis seeking revenge — a charge historians call disinformation. Ukraine is now led by a Jewish president who lost relatives in the Holocaust.

Putin’s announcement came just hours after the Ukrainian president rejected Moscow’s claims that his country poses a threat to Russia and made a passionate, last-minute plea for peace.

“The people of Ukraine and the government of Ukraine want peace,” Zelenskyy said in an emotional overnight address, speaking in Russian in a direct appeal to Russian citizens.

Zelenskyy said he asked to arrange a call with Putin late Wednesday, but the Kremlin did not respond.

The attack began even as the U.N. Security Council was meeting to hold off an invasion. Members still unaware of Putin’s announcement of the operation appealed to him to stand down. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres opened the emergency meeting, telling Putin: “Give peace a chance.”

European Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen later promised to hold the Kremlin accountable.
