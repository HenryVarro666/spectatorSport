""We reaffirmed that we have never been more fully aligned across the globe to defend and preserve the freedom and sovereignty of Ukraine and all states,"" the department quoted Blinken as saying in a call with Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi and other G7 leaders.

1,c1e3efec-3173-42c3-bac1-b95cf4251933,['Brad Glosserman'],2022-03-01 00:00:00,"As the Ukraine crisis unfolds, the world is asking if the West misread Vladimir Putin.

The far more pertinent question is how well such countries read themselves. Putin hasn’t just bet that he could invade a neighboring country; he is betting that he can outlast the coalition that seeks to turn him back. Much is riding on that assessment of Western determination or weakness since his view his shared by other governments, too.

The West hoped to deter Putin from invading. It failed. Now the question is whether the countries aligned against him can impose sufficient pain on him and his country to force a retreat. They are testing his “resolve,” a word that will be heard a lot in days and weeks to come. But, and this is the key point, he is testing their resolve as well. Putin believes that his adversaries are soft, unable to muster the commitment and determination to prevail in the struggle that is underway. The key question isn’t how much pain they can impose on Russia, but how much pain they will endure.

Putin has been proved wrong in the first instance by the Ukrainian people, who have defied one of the world’s largest and most powerful militaries. Their determined resistance frustrated Putin’s plans for a quick invasion that would present the world a fait accompli. According to RUSI, the venerable British think tank, Putin relied on Russian security service social surveys of Ukraine that predicted the populace was “fertile grounds for subversion” and “appeared to possess only a moderate level of resolve.”

Instead, Russia faces a country virtually united in defense of the nation. Daily, the internet and the newswires are flush with shows of resistance that are galvanizing world opinion, whether it was the profane response by 13 soldiers defending an island after a Russian warship’s call to surrender; a video of teachers fighting tears and terror as they volunteered to join militias; or Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s now famous retort, “I need ammunition, not a ride.”

The Ukrainian people understand the stakes. Historian Heather Cox Richardson explained, “The Ukrainian people have done far more than hold off Putin’s horrific attack on their country. Their refusal to permit a corrupt oligarch to take over their homeland and replace their democracy with authoritarianism has inspired the people of democracies around the world.” It is this demonstration of the possibilities of genuine democracy on Russia’s doorstep that poses the real threat to Putin, not some imagined invasion of or aggression against Russia.

In the second case — the war of wills between Putin and the West — the balance of resolve is still being weighed. Absent some horrific escalation, the West will not send military forces to confront Putin’s troops. Rather, the battlefield will be economic as Western governments impose ever tougher sanctions to change Russia’s political calculus.

The West has put together a package of measures to punish Putin, designed to impose severe pain on the president, his closest allies and vital institutions of the state. As President Joe Biden vividly put it, “We will limit Russia’s ability to be part of the global economy. We will stunt their ability to finance and grow Russia’s military. We will impair their ability to compete in a high-tech, 21st century economy.”

As I write, a second tranche of sanctions have been imposed. The United States, Japan and the European Union have ratcheted up pressure on Russia, blocking access to its foreign currency reserves in the West, about $640 billion, a move that the former deputy head of the Central Bank of Russia called “a kind of financial atomic bomb.”

This follows sanctions on top officials, including Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, along with a short list of banks. Also in the second round was the decision to bar certain Russian banks from SWIFT, the international financial messaging system, which essentially makes it impossible for them or their customers to do business in dollars.

The sanctions process is unfolding. That is a good policy — if gradual hardening reflects a desire to provide Putin with off ramps. (This is the same logic behind waiting for Putin to act before imposing sanctions in the first place: Punish him before he acts and you’ve lost the deterrent.)

If, however, a slow pace reflects fear of blowback — that sanctions will ultimately hurt those implementing them — then Putin’s calculations about Western resolve could be correct. Cutting Russian energy supplies or disconnecting its banks from SWIFT will increase energy costs. As I detailed a few weeks ago, Europe relies on Russia for 40% of its gas imports. And politicians throughout Europe fear that constituents would echo those in a Morning Consult/Politico poll, in which a combined 58% said Biden would be “very responsible” or “somewhat responsible” if gas prices increased because of war.

That’s likely. One energy analyst told NBC News that “Russia can dig a bigger hole in supply than the West can plug,” adding “That’s just a matter of molecules and math.”

Russia isn’t an economic powerhouse, but it does play a role in parts of the global economy. Attempts in 2018 to sanction an oligarch who owned a Russian aluminum producer upended the global market since his company was a major supplier of the intermediate product alumina, and blocking that trade made life hard for major smelters in the West. The U.S. retreated.

There are also fears of cyberattacks on Western economies.

In Japan, there are worries about inflation triggered by cutoffs of imported products such as wheat and petroleum, of which Russia is a major global supplier. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida admitted that “sanctions will have an impact on people’s livelihoods and various sectors of the Japanese economy.” Businesses fear a loss of rare metals, for which Russia is a major supplier. In all, 347 Japanese companies operate in Russia, a 60% increase from a decade ago, and they are concerned.

Meanwhile, Putin has been steeling his country for the squeeze. He built up Russian foreign currency reserves to $620 billion, some of which is overseas, but much is not. Dollar reserves account for just 16% of the central bank’s holdings, a decline from more than 40% four years ago. Moscow has set up an alternative to SWIFT, the System for Transfer of Financial Messages, which while limited may offer some relief from sanctions. Overall, Russia is better prepared to weather sanctions than it was in 2014.

Perhaps most important, Putin is insulated from popular pressure. He is a dictator and autocrat who does not fear political opposition, unlike governments in the West. His populace is accustomed to hardship.

He is not alone in thumbing his nose at his adversaries. Shen Yi, professor at Fudan University’s School of International Relations and Public Affairs, spoke for many in China when he wrote in the Global Times that the U.S. “today is like a second-generation rich who has dissipated all wealth and resources accumulated by the previous generation. All it can do is fighting a war of words, without the capability to make real actions.” The foundation of “core interests,” such as Taiwan, is a belief that these issues are so much more important to China than any other country that Beijing will pay a higher price to protect them.

It’s easy to see why the West’s adversaries think that way. In the early stages of this crisis, Biden conceded that “this is hard and that Americans are already hurting,” adding that “I will do everything in my power to limit the pain the American people are feeling at the gas pump.” That is consistent with his “foreign policy for the middle class,” but it focuses attention exactly on where lines will — or won’t — be drawn.

Writing in the Washington Post, Sebastian Mallaby, an economics fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, warned that “the West has bet on the idea that it can fight Russia with sanctions. But sanctions are not free. They, too, demand sacrifice.” He concluded that “the West’s softness — its refusal to accept sacrifice — explains why Putin felt emboldened to invade Ukraine in the first place.”

The West needs to rediscover a sense of purpose and marshal the will to act upon it. It did this during the Cold War — a curious irony given the insistence from just about every capital that we are not re-entering that dark era. But in the face of this aggression, the world cannot pretend otherwise.

We must defend our freedoms and be ready for the price and hardships all that will entail. Failure to do so will confirm to Putin and those that think like him that the West is weak and feckless — and that will herald the beginning of a much more dangerous world.

TOKYO, March 1 (Reuters) - Japan and the United States pledged on Tuesday to work together to force Russia to ""pay the high price"" for its invasion of Ukraine, Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said on Tuesday.

Speaking shortly after his online talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Suzuki said both sides agreed to continue to coordinate with each other in acting against Russia, which invaded neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24.

The fact that Russian central bank raised interest rates showed that sanctions were having an impact, he added.

WASHINGTON--The United States joined European allies Saturday in dramatically escalating financial penalties against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, after the West’s initial rounds of sanctions failed to deter Russian President Vladimir Putin in his military offensive.

Two of the key new measures target the heart of Russia's financial system, its Central Bank, and cut an unspecified number of Russia's banks off from the SWIFT financial network. SWIFT is a vital element of global commerce and banking that moves money from bank to bank around the world.

U.S. and European officials made clear they still were working on implementation of the sanctions, and said they would take care not to impact European purchases of Russian natural gas.

U.S. officials said the moves would send Russia's ruble currency crashing in value, and intensify its isolation financially. It's the latest and toughest in days of new sanctions since Russian forces moved into Ukraine late last week.

A look at Saturday's measures and earlier ones. In all, they potentially amount to some of the toughest sanctions imposed on any nation in modern times.

HITTING AT RUSSIA'S CENTRAL BANK

The new restrictions that the United States, European Union and United Kingdom announced for Russia's Central Bank would limit the Kremlin's ability to access the more than $600 billion in reserves there. If the West is able to implement the Central Bank restrictions as it aims to, it will cripple Russia’s ability to keep the ruble from crashing in value amid the tightening Western sanctions.

The likely result, U.S. officials told reporters Saturday: The Russian ruble goes into free fall, triggering spiraling inflation there.

Specifically, by limiting Russia’s ability to sell off its international reserves, the Central Bank measures mean the Kremlin would lose its best tool to prop up Russia’s currency.

Bank runs, as Russians line up at banks to try to get their ruble deposits and convert it into the safer dollar, will likely worsen, said Clay Lowery, executive vice president of the Institute of International Finance. And the run on dollars inside Russia would cause a drain on the central bank's reserves.

Combined with the new SWIFT limits announced by Europe and the United States, the Central Bank measure is ""likely to cause serious damage to the Russian economy and its banking system,” Lowery said.

Going after a country’s central bank is a rare but not unprecedented move by the international community, and a powerful one.

SWIFT PUNISHMENT

Saturday’s move includes cutting key Russian banks out of the SWIFT financial messaging system, which daily shuffles countless billions of dollars among more than 11,000 banks and other financial institutions around the world.

Allies on both sides of the Atlantic also considered the SWIFT option in 2014, when Russia invaded and annexed Ukraine’s Crimea and backed separatist forces in eastern Ukraine. Russia declared then that kicking it out of SWIFT would be equivalent to a declaration of war. The allies — criticized ever after for responding too weakly to Russia’s 2014 aggression — shelved the idea back then. Russia since then has tried to develop its own financial transfer system, with limited success.

The U.S. has succeeded before in persuading the Belgium-based SWIFT system to kick out a country — Iran, over its nuclear program. But kicking Russia out of SWIFT could also hurt other economies, including those of the U.S. and key ally Germany.

The disconnection from SWIFT announced by the West on Saturday is partial, leaving Europe and the United States room to escalate penalties further later.

Western officials held off from including the SWIFT ban in the first rounds of sanctions, partly because of the collateral impact it would have on other economies that buy Russia's oil and natural gas.

Officials said they would work to limit the impact of the restrictions on other economies and European purchases of Russian energy.

CUTTING RUSSIAN BANKS OFF FROM THE U.S. DOLLAR

Earlier sanctions last week, launched within hours of Russia's announcement of its offensive, included sanctions targeting big Russian banks holding nearly 80% of all the country's banking assets, the Treasury Department said.

That includes Russia's two biggest: state-owned SberBank and VTB. Combined, they hold almost $750 billion in assets, the U.S. said, which is more than half of the entire total in Russia.

Thursday's sanctions on the banks wield the unique power the U.S. has through the dollar, the currency of choice in business transactions around the world.

The targeted banks normally do tens of billions of dollars in business in dollars daily. The U.S. is now cutting them off from the U.S. financial system and U.S. dollar. The aim is to make the most ordinary business matters as well as international trade far more difficult for the banks, and Russia.

Other U.S. measures target key state-owned and private businesses in Russia, aiming to make it harder for them to raise money to invest and operate.

The U.S. also went after more of Russia's elites, sanctioning bankers and other powerful associates of Putin in Russia's top financial, political and security circles.

STARVING RUSSIA'S BUSINESSES, MILITARY OF U.S. HIGH-TECH

Export controls announced by the Biden administration earlier in the week featured another especially strong piece of leverage the U.S. holds — America's semiconductors and other advanced high-tech gear.

President Joe Biden said new U.S. export limits will deprive Russia of more than half of its current high-tech supply. It will “strike a blow” to Russia's aims to modernize its military, its vaunted aerospace industry, its space program, shipping and other industry, he declared.

By “reducing their ability to compete economically,” the high-tech limits will be a ""major hit to long-term strategic ambitions,"" Biden said.

U.S. export controls are expected to deprive Russian industries and the military of the high-tech U.S. components that help warplanes and passenger jets fly and make smartphones smart, along with other software and advanced electronic gear that make the modern world run.

The U.S. said the European Union, Japan, Britain and other countries were also cooperating in the move to starve Russia of high-tech components.

The U.S. response could add Russia to the most restrictive group of countries for export control purposes, putting them with Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Syria.

They limit Russia’s ability to obtain integrated circuits and products containing integrated circuits, due to the global dominance of U.S. software, technology and equipment. The impact could extend to aircraft avionics, machine tools, smartphones, game consoles, tablets and televisions.

However, U.S. export restrictions would risk motivating businesses to look for alternatives elsewhere, including China.",https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/14559052
4,c1e3efec-3173-42c3-bac1-b95cf4251933,"['Condé Nast', 'John Cassidy']",2022-03-01 01:03:20.164000+00:00,"When Vladimir Putin was a schoolboy, one of his biographers tells us, he spent a lot of time reading the works of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, all of whom regarded economics as the driving force of history, and political forces as secondary. Evidently, the future Russian leader took these lessons to heart. In ordering an invasion of Ukraine, he apparently assumed that the countries of Western Europe were so dependent on Russian energy imports and so economically beholden to the Kremlin that their governments wouldn’t introduce sanctions that would do serious harm to the Russian economy. In any case, over the past half a decade or so, Russia had built up more than six hundred billion dollars in foreign-exchange reserves to weather any foreign pressure.

If Putin was indeed calculating along these lines, he was gravely mistaken. On Saturday, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, announced that the E.U.—in coöperation with the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada—was taking steps to “cripple Putin’s ability to finance his war machine.” The transatlantic allies moved to bar “selected Russian banks” from the global SWIFT messaging system, which financial institutions use to facilitate cross-border transfers of money. And, in a more surprising step, they also announced that they would impose “restrictive measures” on the Central Bank of Russia, with the explicit aim of preventing it from using its large stock of foreign-exchange reserves to lessen the impact of the sanctions. “This will show that Russia’s supposed sanctions-proofing of its economy is a myth,” a senior official in the Biden Administration said, in a teleconference with reporters. “The six-hundred-billion-plus war chest of Russia’s foreign reserves is only powerful if Putin can use it.” The measures the allies announced were designed to block Moscow’s Central Bank from buying rubles from Western financial institutions, a step that could offset the impact of sanctions and stabilize the Russian currency. “The ruble will fall even further, inflation will spike, and the Central Bank will be left defenseless,” the U.S. official predicted.

In wartime, it is wise to treat statements from all sides skeptically. In this case, we don’t need to rely on the assessments of anonymous U.S. officials. When the international markets opened on Monday morning, the value of Russia’s currency plunged by a third. To stem the decline, the Russian Central Bank more than doubled its key interest rate, from 9.5 per cent to twenty per cent, and ordered Russian exporting companies to sell foreign currencies and buy rubles. These desperate moves helped trim losses, but at the close of trading in Moscow the ruble was still down by almost twenty per cent—a huge decline for any currency. In a briefing with reporters, Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, conceded that “economic reality had significantly changed.”

In Washington, meanwhile, the Biden Administration intensified its economic offensive by imposing a freeze on the Central Bank of Russia’s assets held in U.S. financial institutions. The Treasury Department also prohibited any U.S. person, including American banks and businesses, from engaging in transactions with Russia’s Central Bank, finance ministry, or sovereign wealth fund. “This action effectively immobilizes any assets of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation held in the United States or by U.S. persons, wherever located,” the Treasury said, in a statement announcing the new policy. In London, the U.K government has introduced a policy along the same lines.

It wasn’t immediately clear just how much money the Central Bank of Russia still holds in New York, London, and other Western financial centers—and which it will no longer be able to access. (According to some estimates, about two-thirds of Russian reserves are now blocked off in countries that have introduced sanctions.) Even so, experts on economic sanctions described the targeting as unprecedented and highly effective. “The G-7 sanctions against the Russian Central Bank, not the SWIFT sanctions, are the real hammer, and they’re showing effect,” Jonathan Hackenbroich, a policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said. “Russia’s Central Bank might struggle to fight massive inflation and panic even after it doubled interest rates and introduced capital controls.”

The fall in the value of the ruble will quickly force Russian consumers to pay more for everything, from French wine to iPhones. And the sanctions on the Central Bank could reverberate throughout Russia’s financial system, effectively cutting off large parts of it from the outside world and raising the possibility of bank runs. “Financial systems need one thing to function, they need trust,” Stefan Gerlach, a former deputy governor of Ireland’s central bank, told the Wall Street Journal. “If you suddenly realize that they can’t get help from their government if needed, it becomes incredibly riskier to deal with them. You just pulled the carpet from under the financial system.”

That such unprecedented steps have been taken in just five days is remarkable. This time last week, it seemed like Putin had sound reasons for being skeptical about the prospect of truly damaging sanctions. Russia supplies the European Union with about forty per cent of its natural-gas imports and about a quarter of its crude oil imports; Germany and Italy are among the most dependent on Russian natural resources for fuel and power. On February 18th, Mario Draghi, Italy’s Prime Minister and the former head of the European Central Bank, said that if the European Union were to impose sanctions on Moscow they should be “concentrated on narrow sectors.” As recently as last Thursday, Olaf Scholz, the German Chancellor, expressed opposition to barring Russian banks from the SWIFT system. At that point, the idea of sanctioning the Russian Central Bank had been barely mentioned.

Less than a week later, Russia is an economic pariah. On Monday, the Japanese government announced it will join the sanctions on the Central Bank, saying that “Japan stands with Ukraine.” On Friday, UEFA, the governing body of European soccer, voted to move the 2022 Champions League final from St. Petersburg, where it was scheduled to take place, to Paris. On Sunday, BP, the British energy company, announced that it would divest a twenty-per-cent stake it holds in Rosneft, the state-owned Russian energy giant, even though it will entail a big financial loss. Then, on Monday, another energy company, Shell, announced that it, too, was cutting ties with Russia: the London-based firm said it would exit oil-and-gas joint ventures with Gazprom, the Russian energy conglomerate, and also end its involvement with the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany. When even Europe’s oil barons abandon Russia and its vast energy reserves, it is evident that the geopolitical—and geoeconomic—map has been redrawn.

Details of how the G-7 countries decided to target Russia’s Central Bank have yet to be revealed. Richard Nephew, a sanctions expert at Columbia University who worked in the Obama Administration on economic measures directed at Iran, told me that he and his colleagues had long been monitoring the Russian buildup of foreign-exchange reserves. “The question was, if it comes to sanctioning Russia in a future crisis, is there a way to do it effectively?” Nephew said. “Or does the country have enough liquid assets to ride things out?” In targeting the Central Bank and freezing Russia’s foreign assets, the Western allies found a way to make life difficult for Putin and his regime despite their large war chest. “It’s a pretty tough situation for them,” Nephew said. “There’s not really a way around these restrictions.”

Where do things go from here? In the coming days, Putin could conceivably move to cut off oil-and-gas exports to Western Europe. Even though the loss of revenues would exert further pressure on the Russian economy, such a move could cause greater pain in European countries, in the form of energy shortages and sharply higher prices. Hackenbroich told me that the government in Berlin, in agreeing to impose sanctions on Russia’s Central Bank, will most likely have planned for this possibility. During the past month or so, he noted, German economic officials had lined up alternative sources of natural gas, from countries such as Qatar and Azerbaijan. “It looks like the German government is ready to accept the possibility of a Russian energy cutoff and accept the consequences,” he said. “I don’t think that we are going there immediately, but so much that seemed impossible a week ago has already happened, and who knows where we will be at the end of this week.”",https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/how-vladimir-putin-miscalculated-the-economic-cost-of-invading-ukraine

Jonathan Kaplan, United States Ambassador to Singapore The EU, G-7, Allies, and partners are united in denouncing Russia's premeditated, unprovoked and unjustified attack against Ukraine. The pain and suffering we are witnessing in Europe today—the shattering of peace and stability—affects all of us around the world. As Russia's premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified invasion of Ukraine continues, let us be clear – Russian President Vladimir Putin has chosen a war that will bring catastrophic loss of life and suffering to innocent human beings. The entire world stands with the people of Ukraine as they suffer a brutal attack by Russia's military forces. Putin has been planning this invasion for months, if not longer. He directed the movement of more than 175,000 troops and military equipment into positions along the Ukrainian border – the largest buildup of military forces in Europe since World War II. Putin flagrantly violated international law when he decreed Russia would recognize the purported ""independence"" of two so-called ""republics"" on Ukraine's sovereign territory – ""republics"" Russia has propped up and controlled through political and armed proxies since 2014. These actions were political theater, centered on baseless claims, and falsely staged to create the pretext for Russia's full-scale invasion on February 24. The world is not fooled. At Putin's direction, Russia rejected every good faith effort Ukraine, the United States, the European Union, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and allies and partners made to address Russia's alleged mutual security concerns – which Russia's actions have proven to be no more than a pretext. We urged Russia to engage diplomatically, avoid needless conflict, and avert human suffering. And yet, while the UNSC was meeting to stand up for Ukrainian sovereignty, Putin declared his war.

Now Russia's aerial bombing, troop deployments, and tank assaults have indiscriminately fallen on peaceful cities across Ukraine. The death and destruction that will follow Russia's incursion will result in incalculable costs for the innocent people of Ukraine. There are credible reports of hospitals, orphanages, and kindergartens destroyed by Russian forces. Russia's invasion is a flagrant violation of international law and the international principles that we as an international community have all pledged to respect: national sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the right of states to make their own decisions regarding their foreign and security policy arrangements. Our friends in Singapore share our grave concerns and have also emphasized the importance of upholding international law and the rules-based order, as evidenced by their decision to impose export controls and block certain Russian banks and financial institutions connected to Russia. Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this invasion is bringing. We, the ambassadors and high commissioners of the Group of Seven (G7), the European Union and its Member States, and allies and friends of Ukraine, stand together against Russia's illegal war. Our countries have responded and will continue to respond in a united and decisive way. As our leaders have said, the world will hold the Kremlin accountable.

The United States, the 27 members of the European Union, as well as the UK, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and others are united in imposing massive, severe economic costs on Russia. Leaders from the Group of Seven (G7) met the morning of February 24 and agreed to restrict Russia's ability to do business in U.S. Dollars, Euros, Pounds, and Yen. This will limit Russia's ability to be part of the global economy and stunt Russia's ability to finance and grow its military. The G7 and the European Union also took action to impose strong sanctions and new limitations on what can be exported to Russia. We moved to cut off major Russian banks from the international financial system and sanctioned additional Russian elites and their family members. We also stopped the Russian government – and its state-owned enterprises – from raising money from United States or European investors, and plan to cut off more than half of Russia's high-tech imports. Our allies and partners are implementing similar measures. These unified actions will squeeze Russia's access to finance and technology for strategic sectors of its economy, isolate Russia from financial activities worldwide, and degrade its industrial capacity for years to come.

While Russia may have anticipated the measures, what the country perhaps did not anticipate was for so much action to be taken so swiftly. The US and European allies have limited its ability to transact in foreign currencies such as dollars and euros, frozen the assets of multiple Russian banks, and cut off Russia’s banks from the SWIFT messaging system banks use to transmit information globally. Japan said it would join in freezing the assets of Russian leaders and some banks and freezing Russia’s foreign reserves in yen. Even Switzerland, a historically neutral country in conflict, has agreed to join sanctions efforts.

In turn, Russia has taken action to try to shore up its economy and finances. Its central bank has doubled its interest rate in an attempt to stabilize the ruble after the currency sank against the dollar. The country, which has been facing sanctions since its invasion of Crimea in 2014, has over $600 billion in foreign reserves, meaning money in other countries’ currencies and gold. It built up those reserves specifically to help fend off sanctions. As the New York Times notes, a lot of that money isn’t actually in Russia but is essentially on paper in banks around the world. So now, the country could have a hard time accessing that money. Sanctions are likely to hurt the Russian government; they are also hurting the Russian people, who were already in a tough spot before now.

These developments have major implications not only for Russia’s economy but potentially for the world’s; it’s unlikely their impact will be contained to one country’s borders. I spoke with Elina Ribakova, deputy chief economist at the Institute of International Finance, about the potential effects of these sanctions over the days, weeks, and months to come. Our conversation, lightly edited for length and clarity, is below.

Can you talk about the breadth of the international sanctions on Russia right now? How big of a deal is this?

This is a unique combination of measures that have been taken. Each individual measure is not unprecedented. What is historically unprecedented is the degree of multilateral coordination and the fact that they’re using these nuclear options at the same time.

It definitely will have a dramatic impact on the Russian economy, but at the same time, there’s room for further escalation.

What does this mean for Russia’s economy?

We are looking at a double-digit economic contraction already. We have seen extreme measures applied by the [Russian] government in terms of capital controls and blocking transfers of foreign currency to non-residents. Exporters have to convert 80 percent of their proceeds to the domestic market, and Russia’s central bank has more than doubled interest rates. Russia is also undertaking banking sector support, releasing some capital for the banks.

All these measures are just basic crisis management. But this crisis will grow larger for the Russian economy and common Russian people than whatever we can forecast or expect at the moment.

What’s going on with the ruble?

There’s definitely been movement on the ruble. Markets closed last week, and there have also been changes this week. The rate hike had an effect — the central bank more than doubled interest rates from 9.5 to 20 percent, and capital controls should also help.

Here, it is critical to see what individual and corporate depositors will do, whether they will accelerate dollarization of deposits, meaning they generate a big demand for dollars. If you have a 10 percentage point increase in the dollarization of domestic deposits — and we have seen that in the past, in the 2008 crisis — then you have pressure to have $100 billion on reserve, and they do not have that. In the extreme, if these rate hikes do not work, capital controls do not work, you could see the risk of foreign exchange deposits being frozen [by the Russian government].

So basically Russia is trying to get people to keep their money in rubles instead of putting it in dollars?

Right. For basic domestic Russian economic participants, what they’re trying to do is to prevent them from converting their rubles into dollars and to stop them from withdrawing cash from the banking system. For non-residents, they have effectively put up the Iron Curtain, you’re no longer able to pay as a resident in foreign currencies to a non-resident.

What does it mean for the people on the ground in Russia?

This is the worst economic crisis that many of them have seen. Those who remember the early ’90s, this is comparable to that.

It’s complete devastation for regular people in Russia because they’ve had years of austerity. The government has been trying to protect themselves with the Fortress Russia strategy [to bulk up its economy to protect itself from sanctions]. That requires not spending on infrastructure, social spending, and education, but instead accumulating all of its coffers to try to protect itself against sanctions. The person on the street has already been suffering and doesn’t have much in savings, if anything. But at the moment, they risk not even receiving their pension payments.

We’re not talking about the crisis in 2014 or 2008 or 1998, it’s closer to the early ’90s in the economy — losing savings, having capital controls, not being able to transact in foreign currencies, potential double-digit contraction in the economy, the inability, potentially, to get transfers for your salaries and pensions. Could we get to barter trading? That is also what happened in the ’90s. It was devastating for the Russian people.

Do you think the sanctions are more than the Russian government expected?

It’s very hard to speculate what the Russian authorities thought would happen. Given the current environment, I think it was to be expected that these nuclear measures would be put forward. Global authorities flagged that if there was an escalation in Ukraine, they were preparing factors that included extremely severe measures, and that’s what the authorities, multilaterally, are delivering.

What does all of this mean for the world economy? Will there be knock-on effects?

It will likely have knock-on effects via financial channels, trade channels, and pure contagion.

In trade, we are likely to see an effect on commodity prices, and we are already seeing that. Russia is an important exporter of oil and gas, various metals and mining commodities, and agricultural products. Ukraine is also a very important exporter of some metals and agricultural products. We’ll see the effects there, we’ll see the effects on global inflation, and then the question is how global central banks will react in each individual country’s conditions.

In the financial channel, Russia is not as significant as some other emerging markets in terms of foreign investor participation in the local market. So, I think it might not have massive direct effects. But Russian financial institutions, its central bank, they are important players in certain global markets. They have $640 billion in foreign exchange reserves, so they have positions still, or were hedging via financial instruments. So that’s something to watch for as the situation develops.

And then there’s pure contagion if there is a risk of high inflation and tightening of global financial conditions. There is definitely a high risk posed for global repercussions from this war.

Do corporations taking action make a difference? Like BP saying it will exit its stake in Rosneft, a Russian oil company?

I think it makes a difference in certain sectors of the Russian economy. You have seen foreign companies already being cautious about Russia even before sanctions because the rule of law concerns were already there starting from 2004 onward. Foreign investors were maybe interested in doing portfolio investments or some equity investments, but as far as serious commitments on the foreign direct investments front, at some point, people started being more careful. Then you had the 2008 crisis, and then after sanctions, even more so. The US imposed export controls and sanctions on new field developments in the energy sector. So this will have an impact, but it will not necessarily have an immediate impact on the economy, though it will have a long-lasting medium-term impact.

In the financial industry, foreign banks are not very large, but again, they could basically remove another layer of protection of individuals’ deposits there.

There’s room for escalation on sanctions, right? What does that look like?

Tightening existing sanctions, first and foremost. Going after the central bank’s ability to get foreign exchange, for example, or to transact in foreign exchange, that could be further curtailed. The same goes for banks; not all banks have lost access to US dollars, they haven’t yet lost access to euros. Not all banks have lost access to SWIFT [a messaging system banks used to transmit information such as payment confirmations and currency exchanges worldwide]. Even with the existing framework, there are ways to tighten the measures taken over the weekend.

There’s also energy and commodity prices, there’s a possibility of limiting those as well.

Is there coming back from this?

In the current set of sanctions packages, there is room for de-escalation should the authorities believe that it’s warranted. We now have different options on the table. Assessing those options is not my role as an economist. But there are options to scale up and scale down sanctions. Also, we should not forget that economic sanctions are part of the broader economic statecraft, and that is part of the broader set of foreign policy tools, international relations, defense and military tools. This is just one of the tools being applied within the broader framework, but within that tool, there is room for escalation.

And in the meantime, this is hurting everyone in Russia, right? Or are the wealthy spared?

No matter how much money you have, you cannot transfer it abroad, you cannot get it out of your bank, and there’s nowhere to invest. But still, with any crisis, the common people feel it the most.
