(Yevhen Kotenko/Ukrinform/Future Publishing via Getty Images)

The first lady of Ukraine, Olena Zelenska, published an open letter on her Facebook page reflecting on what has happened to Ukraine in the past two weeks since the Russian invasion.

""Despite assurances from Kremlin-backed propaganda outlets, who call this a 'special operation' — it is, in fact, the mass murder of Ukrainian civilians,"" Zelenska said.

In the long and impassioned letter, she added: ""Perhaps the most terrifying and devastating of this invasion are the child casualties. Eight-year-old Alice who died on the streets of Okhtyrka while her grandfather tried to protect her. Or Polina from Kyiv, who died in the shelling with her parents. 14-year-old Arseniy was hit in the head by wreckage and could not be saved because an ambulance could not get to him on time because of intense fires.""

""The first newborn of the war, saw the concrete ceiling of the basement, their first breath was the acrid air of the underground, and they were greeted by a community trapped and terrorized. At this point, there are several dozen children who have never known peace in their lives,"" she wrote.

The Ukrainian first lady also discussed the challenges of getting essential medical care, as well as the growing tide of refugees.

She said Russian President Vladimir Putin has underestimated Ukrainians' resistance.

""While Kremlin propagandists bragged that Ukrainians would welcome them with flowers as saviors, they have been shunned with Molotov cocktails,"" she wrote.

Zelenska also thanked people from around the world for supporting her country.

And she echoed her husband's demands for a no-fly zone over Ukraine. ""Close the sky, and we will manage the war on the ground ourselves,"" she said.

She concluded: ""I testify and tell the world: the war in Ukraine is not a war ""somewhere out there."" This is a war in Europe, close to the EU borders. Ukraine is stopping the force that may aggressively enter your cities tomorrow under the pretext of saving civilians.""

""If we don't stop Putin, who threatens to start a nuclear war, there will be no safe place in the world for any of us,"" she continued.",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-08-22/h_d4bc8e55ecfe69a97adfc2cbec73658f

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

3,e0dd2ce8-be43-4fe1-a618-8378867dc4f2,[],,"Israel has sent a “stiff message” to Ukraine over the past day that it is not prepared to tolerate a situation in which, while it tries to mediate between Kyiv and Moscow, it gets publicly attacked by Ukrainian officials, Channel 12 reported on Tuesday, quoting unnamed Israeli sources.

The message appears to have resonated, the report said the Israeli sources suggested, as Ukraine’s foreign minister earlier Tuesday apologized for incorrectly claiming El Al was accepting money “soaked in Ukrainian blood” by accepting funds via a Russian payment system.

Also Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted his thanks to Bennett for his continued mediation efforts.

This, after Zelensky last week said that while his relations with Bennett were “not bad at all,” he did not feel that the Israeli prime minister was “wrapped in our flag.”

While Foreign Minister Yair Lapid has condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Bennett has not done so. Israel declined a US request to sponsor a UN Security Council resolution condemning the invasion last month; it did support the subsequent General Assembly resolution to do so.

Israel’s reported message of complaint raised eyebrows among Israeli commentators, who noted that Ukraine is battling an invasion, with its cities bombarded, and civilians targeted. Channel 12’s political analyst Amit Segal noted that, if true, the complaint would mark “the height of chutzpah: a nation is fighting for its life, and we’re protesting its table manners.”

Zelensky asked Israel to try to mediate with Russia in a February 25 phone call, and Bennett expressed readiness to do so in a call with Putin two days later.

Bennett then flew to Moscow on Saturday, breaking the Shabbat in the cause of the potentially life-saving mission, and has held calls with both presidents since his return.

Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin has relayed to the Israeli prime minister Moscow’s proposal for a ceasefire with Ukraine, which would not require a regime change in Kyiv, according to a report by the Axios news site.

Bennett has not presented either leader with an Israeli ceasefire proposal and is, rather, focusing on passing along messages from one leader to the other, helping clarify Putin’s position to Zelensky and the West, according to the report.

Speaking to Israeli reporters on Tuesday, British ambassador to Israel Neil Wigan praised Bennett for his efforts vis-a-vis Russia, noting Israel’s unique position.

“We appreciate the Prime Minister’s efforts to explore what scope there is for ending this conflict with Russia. Israel has probably the best relationship with both countries of any democracy,” he said.

“As for the chance Bennett’s efforts will succeed? It depends on Putin, and whether he really wants to stop the war and find a diplomatic solution,” he added.

“Bennett is the first leader to have sat down with Putin for three hours since the war began, which is a major achievement. It was the beginning of a process. I don’t think anyone was under the impression it would stop the war the next day. The question is whether Putin is open to a diplomatic solution. It is important to try to stop [Russia’s] attacks via diplomacy, and that is exactly what Bennett tried to do, while keeping the Ukrainians in the picture.”",https://www.timesofisrael.com/jerusalem-said-to-warn-kyiv-it-wont-tolerate-continued-criticism-amid-mediation-bid/

The effect of the efforts of the top leaders of Israel, India and France is now clearly visible. Both Ukrainian President Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin have softened their stance. Zelensky has announced that he is giving up his insistence on joining NATO, with the West not getting the expected help and the Russian army getting too close to Kyiv. At the same time, Russia, which is facing extremely tough sanctions from Western countries, also said that it only wants to withdraw Ukrainian forces from the Donbass area.

Israeli officials have said that the ongoing ceasefire talks between Russia and Ukraine have reached a complicated point. This statement by Israeli officials comes at a time when Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has spoken to Zelensky and Putin several times. It is being told that indirect talks are taking place between the Ukrainian President and Putin through Bennett. In fact, Israel has very good relations with both Ukraine and Russia. This is the reason why Israel is in a position to make reconciliation between both Russia and Ukraine.

There has been a lot of softening in the attitude of both the sides in the last 24 hours.

Israeli officials directly involved in the talks with Putin and Zelensky said that the stance of both sides has softened significantly in the last 24 hours. Russia has said that it only wants to withdraw troops from the Donbass area. On the other hand, Zelensky has said that he is no longer pushing Ukraine to join NATO. Zelensky attacked NATO, saying that he does not want to be the president of a country that is kneeling before anyone and begging. Israeli officials said it was a sign that the dispute could soon be resolved diplomatically.

Earlier on Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Bennett visited Moscow and met Putin. Since then, Bennett has spoken on the phone several times with Putin, Bennett, the French President and the German Chancellor. On Tuesday, Bennett spoke to Zelensky about the ongoing ceasefire efforts and conveyed his message by phone to Putin. The Russian presidential office said Putin told Bennett about the third round of talks between Ukraine and Belarus in Belarus.

‘Russian terms are not too tough for Zelensky’

Israeli officials said that Bennett has not given any plans to stop the war, but is only passing on Putin and Zelensky’s words to each other. During the meeting with Putin, Bennett told him about the suggestions received from Ukraine and other countries to know the reaction of the Russian President. It can also be assessed whether Putin is adopting a flexible approach to his latest terms regarding the ceasefire. Bennett has also told US President Joe Biden about this entire incident.



Israeli officials said Putin’s proposal was not easy for Zelensky to accept but not too harsh as he had previously anticipated. He said Putin’s proposal did not include regime change in Ukraine. Not only this, he is also in favor of giving Ukraine its sovereignty. An Israeli official said Zelensky was now at a crossroads where he would have to make a choice. Russia’s offer is difficult to accept, but it will preserve Ukraine’s sovereignty and stop the war. If Zelensky rejects this proposal, the war will take a more severe form and will be a catastrophe for Zelensky and Ukraine itself.

5,e0dd2ce8-be43-4fe1-a618-8378867dc4f2,[],,"IN a trip with extraordinarily high stakes, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett brought Israel to the centre of the world stage on Saturday, by flying to Moscow for talks on the Ukraine crisis with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The Prime Minister’s Office on Saturday night stated that what turned out to be a three-hour meeting at the Kremlin was held “in coordination and with the blessing of the US administration”, which has continually sought a diplomatic resolution to Russia’s invasion, and in coordination too with Germany and France.

As the former foreign minister Tzipi Livni immediately noted on Channel 12 news, American backing “was critical”.

Bennett’s office also said he was working “in ongoing dialogue with Ukraine”.

Officials close to the Prime Minister denied Hebrew media reports that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who knew the trip was imminent, refused to take a call from Bennett on Friday, and Bennett indeed spoke with Zelensky immediately after departing the Kremlin, even before taking off from Moscow en route to Germany to brief Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

It was Zelensky who asked Bennett in a February 25 phone call to try to mediate in the crisis, and Bennett expressed readiness to do so in a call with Putin two days later. (Zelensky had reportedly asked Bennett to try to help when the Prime Minister last met with Putin, in Sochi, in October.)

But Zelensky in recent days has made plain his disappointment with Bennett’s stance on the invasion, telling reporters on Thursday that “I don’t feel that he [Bennett] is wrapped in our flag.” Although Israel is providing humanitarian aid to Ukraine, the Prime Minister has not directly condemned Russia, did not co-sponsor the United Nations Security Council resolution doing so, and reportedly refused a direct request from Zelensky for military aid.

The trip had been taking shape since midweek but, atypically, was not leaked. Bennett flew by private jet, reportedly over Turkey, accompanied by key officials. Ukraine-born Ze’ev Elkin, the minister of housing, performed the role of translator he frequently played at such meetings when Benjamin Netanyahu was prime minister.

Early reports of what was discussed in Moscow were unsurprisingly short on specifics. One official said Bennett spoke with Putin about the situation of Israelis and Jewish communities in Ukraine amid the conflict, and they also discussed the reportedly imminent revival of the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran – a development Bennett openly opposes.

Unsourced and unconfirmed Hebrew media reports suggested that Bennett raised the imperative to ensure safe and smooth passage from Ukraine, and from Russia, for Jews seeking to immigrate to Israel. Putin was said to have told Bennett not to provide Ukraine with anti-aircraft, anti-missile, or any other kind of weaponry.

That Bennett, Israel’s first Orthodox prime minister, flew to Moscow on Shabbat underlined his conviction that his mission has the potential to save lives – and thus to take precedence, in accordance with Jewish religious law, over Sabbath observance. The open question is whether he can indeed somehow contribute to a restraining of Russia’s military activity, and an earlier and less bloody conclusion to the war.

If Bennett’s mission leads nowhere, and worse, if he incurs the further displeasure of the free world’s most popular head of state, the Prime Minister may come to conclude he should have stayed home this Shabbat. Already, his insistence on attempting the almost impossible – trying to maintain not neutral but warm relations with both sides in a war – is threatening to exasperate the US and has the potential to deeply harm Israel’s standing in the free world.

If he somehow brokers life-

saving progress, by contrast, he will have performed a remarkable service.

Putin has repeatedly insisted he intends to demilitarise and “denazify” Ukraine, while also demanding it not join NATO. Ten days into his invasion, he has ratcheted up his rhetoric – warning that any countries tempted to establish a no-fly zone would be considered enemy combatants, comparing the mounting sanctions to a declaration of war, and telling Ukraine’s leaders they “risk the future of Ukrainian statehood” if they continue to resist him.

In short, Vladimir Putin is not sounding like a man inclined to compromise. Will Israel’s Prime Minister – delivering messages from the West while trying to bring his own added value – be able to change that?

In order to halt the ongoing bloodshed, Zelensky with the Israeli Prime Minister discussed ways to stall the Russian aggression and also talked about measures to stop the war.

Informing about the same in a tweet, President Zelensky said that he had discussed the negotiation process with Naftali Bennett, and further thanked him for indulging himself in the mediation efforts.

“Talked to @naftalibennett. Thanked Israel for its mediation efforts in establishing the negotiation process. Ways to end war and violence were discussed (sic)”, Zelensky wrote.

Israel steps in to mediate negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv

Zelensky's statement comes as President Putin’s forces are continuing their aggression to devastate the country brick by brick on the 13th day of the war. Earlier last week, Bennett visited Moscow to hold a 'secret meeting' with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday, March 5.

Stepping into the role of a mediator, Bennett had held a 3-hour long meeting with Putin, during which he raised the issue of the large Jewish community caught up in the war. Later, he dialled Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who he is said to be playing mediator at the behest of.



However, it is pertinent to note that so far, Israel has maintained an ambiguous stance on Moscow's military action in Kyiv. While it has sent a 100-ton shipment of humanitarian aid to Ukraine, it has not dispatched a single piece of military equipment. Israel has expressed concern over the Russian invasion but avoided outrightly bashing Moscow.

Zelensky expresses discontent over West's inaction

President Zelensky on the thirteenth day of the ongoing war decried NATO and the West for turning their backs on Ukraine and hinted over accepting Putin’s demands. Zelenskyy dropped a big hint on the possibility of recognising Crimea as part of Russia and the breakaway Donbass and Luhansk regions to be recognised as independent regions. He said that a compromise could be discussed. ""We can discuss this and find a compromise on how people will live there,"" Zelenskyy said.

However, he later posted a video message where he assured people that he was still present in Kyiv and exuded confidence about Ukraine's victory against Russia.

Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the conflict in Ukraine by telephone with Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett on Tuesday, the Kremlin said.

In a readout of the call, the Kremlin said Putin had told Bennett about Moscow’s assessment of the third round of talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials that took place on Monday.

Earlier on Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke to Bennett the latter’s efforts to act as an intermediary with Moscow after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Kyiv has voiced frustration with Israel’s refusal to provide military aid to Ukraine against Russia but has welcomed its role as a go-between.

“Thanked for Israel’s mediation efforts. Discussed ways to end the war and violence,” Zelensky said in a tweet.

While condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Israel has limited itself to humanitarian relief and kept up contacts with Moscow. Israel coordinates strikes against Iranian deployments in Syria with Russia’s military garrison there, and is mindful of the big power’s sway over nuclear talks with Tehran.
