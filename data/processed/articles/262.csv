Supplying the Ukrainians with such weaponry would be effective in allowing them to shoot down aircraft or missiles in their airspace, and it is something that Ukrainians have specially asked the US and western countries to provide.

“The purpose of this letter is to urge, in the strongest possible sense, immediate action to provide the Ukrainian Armed Forces with a viable mid- and high-altitude air defense capability. They need immediate reconstitution of their capability to defend themselves against air attacks from the Russian Air Force,” the retired military officials write. “We cannot stand idly by and wish them well as Russia prosecutes an unrestricted campaign of destruction on the Ukrainian government, its infrastructure, and its people.”

This move should would stop short of creating a no-fly zone, which the US and NATO have so far resisted supporting due to concerns that this could embroil the alliance in a war with a nuclear-armed power.

Earlier this week 27 foreign policy experts published an open letter calling on the Biden administration and the international community to establish a limited no-fly zone in Ukraine surrounding the humanitarian corridors.

The retired military leaders say that NATO’s decision to reject a no-fly zone was “devastating to the Ukrainian government and people’s morale.” They go on to assert that supplying the mid- and high-altitude air defense capability would prevent the Russians from dominating Ukrainian “airspace while delivering devastation of Ukraine’s cities.”

They note that, “Some nations have air defense systems similar to those which were previously destroyed in the opening days of the Russian campaign. Those nations could transfer existing stocks of Soviet-era and Russian-produced weapon systems to include radars. Other nations can purchase them on the international market and expedite their delivery to Ukraine.”

This proposal may have a better chance of success than implementing a no-fly zone because supplying the Ukrainian military with advanced air defense capabilities,

The Ukrainians already have some S300 missile systems — which are a type of air defense — which means they are trained in operating these. The Croatians and few either other NATO nations have S300s in their inventory.

Turkey could use this an opportunity to offload the S400s they bought from Russia, which was a purchase that created deep tensions within the NATO alliance.

The letter's signatories: They include General Phillip M. Breedlove, former Supreme Allied Commander Europe, and General Sir Richard Shirreff, former Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe.

The former chiefs of defense of three Eastern European countries also signed on to the letter Lieutenant General Raimonds of Latvia; Lieutenant General Vytautas Jonas Žukas of Lithuania, and General Riho Terras of Estonia.

A number of key former leaders of US Special Operations Forces also signed the letter including Lieutenant General John F. Mulholland, former Deputy Commander, Special Operations Command, Vice Admiral Sean Pybus, former Deputy Commander, Special Operations Command; Lieutenant General Francis M. Beaudette, former Commanding General, Army Special Operations Command, and Major General Michael S. Repass, former Commander, Special Operations Command Europe.

CNN military analyst, Lieutenant General, Mark P. Hertling, was also a signatory to the letter.

More background: Their letter comes just a day after the Chair of Ukraine's Parliament requested surface-to-air defense systems, no-fly zones over critical areas and fighter jets for Ukraine in a letter to US lawmakers on Tuesday, according to the letter reviewed by CNN.

The chair, Ruslan Stefanchuk, said that there is a need for “military assistance suitable for countering Russian attacks and military advances,” citing the Iron Dome as one example of the military equipment that Ukraine needs.

When asked about providing this type of additional military assistance to Ukraine State Department Undersecretary for Political Affairs, Victoria Nuland, told lawmakers that some of it could be possible but cited challenges with certain highly advanced equipment.

“I would only say with regard to Iron Dome, you can't just, you know, snap your fingers and you have an Iron Dome. It takes training, it takes the ability to emplace it and all of those kinds of things. But there are other things on your list, on their list, which we think that we can do,” Nuland said. She added that she could get into more detail in a classified setting.

1,fe8c1929-a96d-4b02-9535-db17084ee9cb,"['Jeremy Herb', 'Jeremy Diamond', 'Kevin Liptak', 'Natasha Bertrand', 'Lauren Fox']",2022-03-09 00:00:00,"Washington (CNN) The swift US rejection of a Polish plan to get MiG-29 fighter jets into Ukraine is the clearest example yet of the complications that the US and its NATO allies face trying to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia's brutal assault while ensuring they don't get dragged into a wider war.

The negotiations fell apart almost as quickly as they came together.

Poland's announcement on Tuesday that it was ready to provide MiG fighter jets to Ukraine via a US Air Force base in Germany caught the US off-guard. By Wednesday morning, US and Polish officials were still discussing the prospect of providing fighter jets to Ukraine, an administration official told CNN.

But on Wednesday afternoon, the Pentagon bluntly announced it was opposed to the idea, which Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin conveyed in a call to his Polish counterpart.

""Secretary Austin thanked the minister for Poland's willingness to continue to look for ways to assist Ukraine, but he stressed that we do not support the transfer of additional fighter aircraft to the Ukrainian air force at this time, and therefore have no desire to see them in our custody either,"" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said at a briefing.

The episode underscores how the US and its allies may be reaching the limits of what they can do to help Ukraine -- while staying out of the conflict -- and points to possible cracks in an alliance that has remained strongly unified in the early part of the war as members enacted stiff sanctions and provided security aid.

It also demonstrates that the Biden administration is still working to get on the same page.

The Pentagon's rejection of the plan to provide jets came after Secretary of State Antony Blinken endorsed the idea earlier in the week, and one senior GOP lawmaker said there were divisions inside the administration about what to do on the issue. Officials tell CNN that all of the public discussion about the plan make it less likely to happen, because it only increases Moscow's ability to call any moves escalatory and adds to the jitters of countries like Poland nervous about being in the crosshairs of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

US officials were deeply frustrated that Poland made the offer public, saying that it appeared to be a play for a domestic audience to try to show they are doing everything they can to help Ukraine, well aware the logistics had not yet been worked out.

In Warsaw on Thursday, Vice President Kamala Harris sought to underscore the strength of the Polish-American alliance despite the flap that has played out this week.

""I want to be very clear. The United States and Poland are united in what we have done and are prepared to help Ukraine and the people of Ukraine, full stop,"" Harris said alongside Polish President Andrzej Duda during a joint news conference.

Harris skirted directly addressing the issue during the news conference and instead underscored the military support the United States is already providing Ukraine short of air power, including antitank missiles, saying, ""We're making deliveries every day in terms of what we can do.""

Asked what more Ukraine could expect, Harris said, ""That is an ongoing process and that is not going to stop to the extent there is a need.""

Concerns about escalation

Kirby's comments made clear there are concerns that more direct measures could escalate tensions with Russia even further and risk dragging NATO directly into the war.

One administration official said the US was concerned Russia could interpret jets flying into Ukraine from a NATO base as an attack.

""The intelligence community has assessed that the transfer of MiG-29's to Ukraine may be mistaken as escalatory and could result in significant Russian reaction that might increase the prospects of a military escalation with NATO,"" Kirby said. ""Therefore, we also assess that the transfer of the MiG-29's to Ukraine to be high-risk.""

The US and its allies have taken a number of steps to help Ukraine, including providing weapons and enacting sanctions like the US import ban on Russian oil that President Joe Biden announced this week -- another step that Zelensky pushed for publicly. A senior defense official told reporters that most of the $350 million in security assistance approved for Ukraine last month has been sent.

The US and other NATO members have so far provided Ukraine 17,000 anti-tank missiles and 2,000 Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, according to a senior US official.

However, they have stopped short of implementing a no-fly zone and providing Ukraine with MiG-29 fighters despite numerous requests from Zelensky due to concerns about pulling the alliance into the conflict.

A number of lawmakers in Washington have also called for a no-fly zone, as Republicans and Democrats alike have publicly pushed the Biden administration to do more.

""Open the skies, give them the planes. These issues trump anything else we're concerned about,"" Rep. Mike Quigley, an Illinois Democrat and co-chair of the Congressional Ukraine Congress, told CNN's Kate Bolduan on Wednesday.

""I can't stomach quibbling and drawing lines when Putin has already said the sanctions are war. We're delivering lethal aid,"" he added. ""Do we honestly think Putin is going to draw a distinction between the Javelins and Stingers that are coming across killing Russians very effectively from jets protecting the skies above?""

Air defense instead

On Wednesday, British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said that the UK would supply air defense systems to Ukraine -- while also saying it was not seeking to set-up a no-fly zone.

""The best way to help protect the skies is through anti-air weaponry, which the UK is now going to be supplying to Ukraine,"" Truss said at a news conference at the State Department with Blinken.

Kirby said the Pentagon believed that the best way to support Ukraine was to provide them anti-armor and air-defense systems, such as surface-to-air missiles and ground-based air defense systems. Adding aircraft to the Ukrainian fleet was ""not likely to significantly change the effectiveness of the Ukrainian air force relative to Russian capabilities,"" Kirby said.

""Therefore we believe that the gain from transferring those MiG-29's is low,"" the Pentagon spokesman said.

Earlier on Wednesday, Blinken -- who had said on Sunday that the US was working with Polish officials to transfer the planes to Ukraine and ""backfill"" with US jets -- said that the US was continuing to consult with Poland and other NATO allies on how to provide fighter jets to Ukraine.

""I think what we're seeing is that Poland's proposal shows that there are some complexities that the issue presents when it comes to providing security systems. We have to make sure that we're doing it the right way,"" Blinken said.

There are also a handful of other countries with the jets, including Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria, and officials are not ruling out talks with those nations as they seek a way forward. One official said that Ukraine's initial request was directed at Poland, plus those three countries, but that Poland was the only country initially willing to entertain a possible jet transfer.

Officials describe the issue as two-fold: a logistics problem of getting the jets to Ukraine, and a political problem of avoiding escalation with Russia. US officials described the Polish plan as failing to adequately address both.

Frustrations among Poland and US officials

Polish officials, for their part, have said they feel unfairly blamed for the delay in sending over fighter jets to Ukraine, sources told CNN.

After Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, Polish officials told their American counterparts that they would be willing to give Ukraine their supply of MiG-29 jets. But given the possibility of ramped up aggression from Russia, the Poles told the US they would need replacement jets. The US said none would be available until 2024, given a number of nations, including Taiwan, were ahead of Poland in line for the American-made fighter planes. So Poland felt it had to put the idea on hold.

But public pressure on the Biden administration to send the jets ratcheted up considerably after Zelensky pleaded with US lawmakers to facilitate a transfer during a Zoom call on Saturday morning.

Prior to the call, US officials had downplayed the prospects of helping with a transfer of the MiG planes, which Ukrainian pilots have been trained to fly. Officials said they were focused mainly on other areas of security assistance, including sending anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles. The logistical challenges of getting the aircraft to Ukraine appeared to some officials an unworkable challenge who questioned how effective the planes would be.

But Zelensky's request on the call, which lawmakers described as impassioned, seemed to change the calculus. Immediately after the session ended, both Republicans and Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, came out in support.

A Senate aide, however, argued that the Biden administration was ahead of Congress in considering the idea of transferring the jets. While Zelensky's presentation was compelling and there was broad interest about exploring what was possible, the aide said, there was not a concerted push to get the Biden administration to back the transfer.

But US officials said the public backing left the administration with little choice but to publicly get behind the idea, even if some officials were skeptical. The US then began publicly messaging that the decision was Poland's alone to make. Blinken told CBS on Sunday that the US had given the ""green light"" to Poland to send the jets, despite Poland emphasizing to the US that they would be unable to do so without proper replacements.

The comments deeply frustrated Polish officials, and -- after days of feeling unfairly blamed for the delay -- Poland's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Tuesday night made a surprise announcement that they would be willing to transfer the jets to the US, via Ramstein Air Base in Germany, for the US to then send directly to Ukraine. The US promptly rejected the idea.

Divisions inside the administration

Texas Rep. Mike McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told CNN Wednesday following a classified briefing on Ukraine there appeared to be internal division in the Biden administration between officials at the Pentagon and State over how to handle Poland's proposal.

""(The) secretary of defense had reservations about it about it and triggering... Article 5,"" McCaul said. Asked if it was Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin who were divided, McCaul said, ""Yes.""

""I encouraged the secretary to do it when we were in Poland, and he agreed,"" McCaul said.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday there was a ""serious logistical bottleneck,"" while noting that discussions are ongoing between the defense officials and their Ukrainian counterparts.

An administration official said the bilateral relationship between the two countries remains strong and that the additional US security assistance has continued to flow into Ukraine via Poland, including in the last day.

The senior defense official said Wednesday that the ""majority"" of the Ukrainian air fleet is still ""intact and operable."" The Ukrainians have fixed-wing aircraft available to them, the official said, while noting the airspace above Ukraine remains ""contested.""

""The airspace is contested,"" the official said. ""And as I said yesterday, the Russians have surface-to-air missile umbrellas that virtually cover the whole country.""",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/09/politics/us-poland-jets-russia/index.html

The negotiations fell aside virtually as shortly as they got here collectively.

Poland’s announcement on Tuesday that it was prepared to supply MiG fighter jets to Ukraine by way of a US Air Power base in Germany caught the US off-guard. By Wednesday morning, US and Polish officers had been nonetheless discussing the prospect of offering fighter jets to Ukraine, an administration official instructed CNN.

However on Wednesday afternoon, the Pentagon bluntly introduced it was against the thought, which Protection Secretary Lloyd Austin conveyed in a name to his Polish counterpart.

“Secretary Austin thanked the minister for Poland’s willingness to proceed to search for methods to help Ukraine, however he burdened that we don’t help the switch of extra fighter plane to the Ukrainian air pressure presently, and subsequently haven’t any want to see them in our custody both,” Pentagon press secretary John Kirby mentioned at a briefing.

The episode underscores how the US and its allies could also be reaching the boundaries of what they will do to assist Ukraine — whereas staying out of the battle — and factors to attainable cracks in an alliance that has remained strongly unified within the early a part of the battle as members enacted stiff sanctions and supplied safety support.

It additionally demonstrates that the Biden administration remains to be working to get on the identical web page.

The Pentagon’s rejection of the plan to supply jets got here after Secretary of State Antony Blinken endorsed the thought earlier within the week, and one senior GOP lawmaker mentioned there have been divisions contained in the administration about what to do on the problem.

US officers had been deeply annoyed that Poland made the supply public, saying that it gave the impression to be a play for a home viewers to attempt to present they’re doing the whole lot they will to assist Ukraine, nicely conscious the logistics had not but been labored out.

Issues about escalation

Kirby’s feedback made clear there are issues that extra direct measures might escalate tensions with Russia even additional and threat dragging NATO instantly into the battle.

One administration official mentioned the US was involved Russia might interpret jets flying into Ukraine from a NATO base as an assault.

“The intelligence group has assessed that the switch of MiG-29’s to Ukraine could also be mistaken as escalatory and will end in important Russian response which may improve the prospects of a navy escalation with NATO,” Kirby mentioned. “Subsequently, we additionally assess that the switch of the MiG-29’s to Ukraine to be high-risk.”

The US and its allies have taken a lot of steps to assist Ukraine, together with offering weapons and enacting sanctions just like the US import ban on Russian oil that President Joe Biden introduced this week — one other step that Zelensky pushed for publicly. A senior protection official instructed reporters that a lot of the $350 million in safety help authorised for Ukraine final month has been despatched.

The US and different NATO members have up to now supplied Ukraine 17,000 anti-tank missiles and a pair of,000 Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, in response to a senior US official.

Nonetheless, they’ve stopped in need of implementing a no-fly zone and offering Ukraine with MiG-29 fighters regardless of quite a few requests from Zelensky resulting from issues about pulling the alliance into the battle.

Various lawmakers in Washington have additionally known as for a no-fly zone, as Republicans and Democrats alike have publicly pushed the Biden administration to do extra.

“Open the skies, give them the planes. These points trump anything we’re involved about,” Rep. Mike Quigley, an Illinois Democrat and co-chair of the Congressional Ukraine Congress, instructed CNN’s Kate Bolduan on Wednesday.

“I can not abdomen quibbling and drawing strains when Putin has already mentioned the sanctions are battle. We’re delivering deadly support,” he added. “Will we truthfully assume Putin goes to attract a distinction between the Javelins and Stingers which can be coming throughout killing Russians very successfully from jets defending the skies above?”

Air protection as a substitute

On Wednesday, British Overseas Secretary Liz Truss mentioned that the UK would provide air protection programs to Ukraine — whereas additionally saying it was not searching for to set-up a no-fly zone.

“The easiest way to assist shield the skies is thru anti-air weaponry, which the UK is now going to be supplying to Ukraine,” Truss mentioned at a information convention on the State Division with Blinken.

“I believe what we’re seeing is that Poland’s proposal exhibits that there are some complexities that the problem presents relating to offering safety programs. We now have to guarantee that we’re doing it the suitable manner,” Blinken mentioned.

There are additionally a handful of different international locations with the jets, together with Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria, and officers aren’t ruling out talks with these nations as they search a manner ahead. One official mentioned that Ukraine’s preliminary request was directed at Poland, plus these three international locations, however that Poland was the one nation initially keen to entertain a attainable jet switch.

Officers describe the problem as two-fold: a logistics downside of getting the jets to Ukraine, and a political downside of avoiding escalation with Russia. US officers described the Polish plan as failing to adequately deal with each.

Frustrations amongst Poland and US officers

Polish officers, for his or her half, have mentioned they really feel unfairly blamed for the delay in sending over fighter jets to Ukraine, sources instructed CNN.

After Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, Polish officers instructed their American counterparts that they might be keen to present Ukraine their provide of MiG-29 jets.

The US mentioned none can be obtainable till 2024, given a lot of nations, together with Taiwan, had been forward of Poland in line for the American-made fighter planes.

However public strain on the Biden administration to ship the jets ratcheted up significantly after Zelensky pleaded with US lawmakers to facilitate a switch throughout a Zoom name on Saturday morning.
