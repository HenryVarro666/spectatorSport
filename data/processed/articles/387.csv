We all cried. The children cried. The wives cried. It was awful. The children kept on saying, ‘Mummy, let’s go back home. Let’s return to Daddy.’”

Marina and the girls headed to the city of Lviv, then to a smaller town farther west. Along the way she was in touch with relatives, frantically trying to determine where they should go. Then, friends of the family called and said there’s a housing help desk at the Warsaw East transit station run by Habitat for Humanity Poland.

A new home: ‘We can now sleep in peace’

“This is some miracle, how my friends found this organisation, Habitat,” she says, sitting on a beige sleeper sofa inside a one-bedroom Warsaw apartment where Habitat for Humanity Poland has placed Marina and her two daughters. “When we entered the flat for the first time, it seemed to us that here was a place where we can now sleep in peace, without being woken by sirens in the middle of the night, without having to sit in the hallway for three hours in a row . . . My children had a good night’s sleep for the first time. We felt that we had finally found a home.”",https://www.habitat.org/emea/ukrainian-family-flees-bombing

April 2 (UPI) -- Russian forces broadly retreated from the Kyiv region Saturday, Ukrainian military officials said. The Russian military left behind dead soldiers and burned vehicles in its retreat, according to to witnesses, Ukrainian officials, satellite images and military analysts, signaling a potential major turn in the war which is in its sixth week, The New York Times reported.

""The initial Russian operation was a failure and one of its central goals -- the capture of Kyiv -- proved unobtainable for Russian forces,"" Michael Kofman, the director of Russian studies at C.N.A., a research institute in Arlington, Va., told the Times in a telephone interview Saturday.

Ukraine's military also announced that Russian forces have retreated from other areas.

""Irpin, Bucha, Gostomel and the whole Kyiv region -- liberated from the enemy,"" Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Anna Malyar said Saturday in a Twitter post.

Still, attacks on other cities have continued, and the Pentagon has cautioned that Russian forces near Kyiv could be repositioning for renewed assaults.

Meanwhile, Russian forces attacked a major oil refinery Saturday in Kremenchuk, Ukraine, Russian officials announced.

The Russian military targeted the major oil refinery in the central Ukrainian city in a series of strikes, including ""high-precision long-range and sea-based weapons,"" Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov told CNN. The strikes destroyed storage facilities holding gasoline and diesel fuels for Ukrainian troops in the country's eastern and central regions.

Russian forces also used high precision air-based missiles to hit military airfields in cities to the east of Kremenchuk, including Poltava and Dnipro, Konashenkov added.

Since Russian forces seized the central Ukrainian town of Enerhodar, close to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, last month, there have been sporadic protests, according to CNN.

On Saturday, Russian forces dispersed these protesters with gunfire and explosions, National Nuclear Energy Generating Company of Ukraine Energoatom posted on Telegram on Saturday.

""The occupiers dispersed the protesters with explosions and shootings,"" a Telegram post read, according to CNN's English translation of the social media post.

""A series of loud explosions has taken place in Enerhodar,"" another Energoatom post read, Ukrinform reported. ""This morning, the town residents gathered for a peaceful rally in support of Ukraine. They sang the anthem and talked to each other. Russcist occupiers were watching them. When Enerhodar residents started to go away, paddy wagons approached, in which the invaders began to pack locals.""

The explosions injured about four people, according to Energoatom's posts on Telegram.

In Mykolaiv state, the death toll from an explosion that destroyed the regional state administration building on Tuesday has risen to 31, Ukraine's States Emergency Service said Saturday, adding that 34 were injured in the blast.

On Friday, a fire broke out at a fuel terminal in Belgorod, a Russian city near the Ukrainian border, which Russian officials blamed on a strike by two Ukrainian helicopters.

Firefighters have since put out the blaze engulfing half of the fuel tanks at the terminal, according to the Russian News Agency TASS, and no casualties resulted from the incident.

""Ukrainian forces continue to advance against withdrawing forces in the vicinity of Kyiv,"" according to the British Ministry of Defense update earlier Saturday. ""Along the northwestern axis, Ukrainian forces' attempts to advance from Irpin towards Bucha and Hostomel are ongoing. Russian forces are reported to have withdrawn from Hostomel airport, which has been subject to fighting since the first day of the conflict. Along the eastern axis, Ukraine has re-taken several villages.""

""In the east of Ukraine, Ukrainian forces have secured a key route in eastern Kharkhiv after heavy fighting,"" the update added. ""This follows the liberation of Trostyanets, in the vicinity of Sumy, earlier this week.""

Since the Russian Federation's invasion of Ukraine began on Feb. 24, 1,325 civilians have been killed and 2,017 have been injured, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights' latest update.

The OHCHR warned actual casualties could be even higher as receipt of information from some locations of intense fighting has been ""delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration.""

The Ukrainian counteroffensive is gaining effectiveness. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said in its last report that local troops successfully launched several attacks around Kyiv and Kherson. This progress also represents an additional difficulty for Russia’s attempt to reorganize its forces and redirect efforts to eastern Ukraine, a move that has been underway since Friday of last week. Ukrainian forces could recover even more territory in the coming days, according to the ISW. Some analysts believe that Ukraine has retaken more territory over the last week than it has lost.

Ukrainian activity went beyond local assaults. Before dawn on Friday, two Ukrainian helicopters struck an oil depot in the Russian city of Belgorod, some 20 miles (40 km) from the border, according to regional authorities there.

In Kyiv, the counterattacks coincided with a withdrawal of Russian troops from Brovary for redeployment on other fronts. For several days now, Putin’s army has also been bringing in some of its forces serving abroad. The UK Defense Ministry’s intelligence services view this apparently improvised restructuring of resources as a sign of Russia’s difficulties and of the losses it has suffered since the beginning of the invasion on February 24.

In the north, the Ukrainian counteroffensive has taken back Sloboda and Lukashivka along the axis between Chernihiv and Kyiv, according to the latest UK intelligence update.

In the east, Russian forces have regrouped to advance from Izyum to Donetsk and Luhansk, where air operations have intensified, according to Ukraine. Kharkov continued to sustain shelling, but Russian troops did not take any further territory in the last 24 hours.

In the south, the Ukrainian resistance took back the towns of Orlove, Zagradivka and Kochubeyevka, north of Kherson. In the port city of Mariupol, Russian troops continued to slowly take additional territory, and the ISW reiterated that the city could fall very soon.

March 31 | New shelling but no advance

Russian forces continued to shell major cities, including the capital Kyiv, Chernihiv and Kharkiv. Despite Moscow’s claims that it would scale back operations and focus on the eastern region of the Donbas, recent attacks appeared to be targeting key infrastructure in these cities, such as fuel storage sites, in order to inflict damage on Ukraine’s logistical operations, said regional authorities.

Fighting continued in Brovary, northeast of Kyiv, and there was movement of Russian troops in a northern direction, possibly signaling a redeployment to other axes of advance, said the Institute for the Study of War (ISW).

There was significant Russian shelling and missile strikes around Chernihiv, according to the UK Defense Ministry’s intelligence update, and also around Kharkiv, where around 15% of buildings have been destroyed, according to the mayor.

In the east, Ukrainian forces repelled several Russian attacks in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, according to the ISW. Further south, on the shore of the Sea of Azov, Russian troops continued to take territory in Mariupol, and reportedly have much of the city under their control.

Although Russia has not launched any clear offensives in the last few days, the ISW noted that it has been deploying support personnel and auxiliary units to replace combat losses. It is still unclear how the new strategy will play out.

According to the Ukrainian General Staff, the death of Russian officials is impeding the army’s ability to reorganize and find replacements.

March 30 | Russian troops still near Kyiv

The Russian army is maintaining its positions near Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, despite the strategy change announced by the Kremlin last week, when it said the focus would shift to the eastern Donbas region. According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), “Russian forces continued fighting to hold their forwardmost positions on the eastern and western Kyiv outskirts even as badly damaged units withdrew to Russia from elsewhere on the Kyiv and Chernihiv axes.”

The Russians continued to actively resist Ukrainian counteroffensives in Irpin and Hostomel, according to the ISW. There were troops in the areas of Bucha and Nemishyev, northwest of Irpin, and artillery fire was being aimed at Ukrainian positions north and west of the capital. There were strikes against Makariv and Irpin, which were shelled on Tuesday.

However, both the ISW and the UK Defense Ministry believe that the Russian offensive has failed in its attempt to encircle Kyiv, at least for now. Russian statements and reports of Russian troops retreating into Belarus might indicate that Russia has accepted the loss of initiative in the region.

Russia intensified its efforts in northeast Ukraine, probably to try to connect its positions southeast of Kharkiv and Izium with its forces in the eastern Luhansk region.

In the east, the Russian advance in Mariupol continued to gain ground. According to the ISW, the city could fall within days.

March 29 | Russia not giving up on Kyiv

Ukrainian troops may have regained control of Irpin, a suburb located northwest of Kyiv, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) and the Ukrainian General Staff. This would be the third area to be controlled by local forces around the capital in the last week. Maintaining this position will be key in the effort to repel the Russian troops that reached the outskirts of the capital from the Dnipro River.

Despite the Kremlin’s announcement that it was shifting its focus to the eastern Donbas region, the Russians do not appear to have given up on their attempts to encircle Kyiv.

Along the Chernihiv-Sumy axis, which is being used by Russian troops to advance towards Kyiv, the Ukrainian counteroffensive has achieved some results. Following several days of fighting in Brovary, Ukraine appears to have stalled the Russian forces and regained control of Rudinstke.

This may be happening, according to the same sources, because Ukrainian defenders are taking advantage of ongoing Russian force rotations. Russian troops have barely made any progress in recent days as they work to resolve logistical issues. According to the ISW, “Russian conscription efforts, which Ukrainian intelligence expects to begin on April 1, are unlikely to provide Russian forces around Ukraine with sufficient combat power to restart major offensive operations in the near term.”

In the east, Russian forces continued to bomb Kharkiv, the second-largest city in Ukraine, but made no significant gains and did not launch ground attacks. According to UK intelligence reports, the Russians may already be deploying a private mercenary group known as the Warner Group, whose members have combat experience in Syria and Lybia. Their presence had been noted earlier, but it was thought that the group was made up of small units. Now, over 1,000 fighters are expected to be deployed in the eastern area alone.

In the south, Russian troops continued to make gains in Mariupol, the Ukrainian General Staff admitted. However, the Russians have reportedly suffered “great losses.”

March 28 | Slow Russian advance

In the first hours since Russia changed its focus (it says it will now concentrate on the Donbas region), the only progress made by troops was near Mariupol, where they were said to be trying to capture the port, according to the UK Defense Ministry’s intelligence update. The city, which has been withstanding heavy attacks for a month, is a key location to control access to the Sea of Azov.

In northern Ukraine, fighting continued outside the capital, Kyiv, where loud explosions were heard before dawn, according to The New York Times. There have been several Ukrainian counterattacks in the areas of Brovary in the east and Irpin in the west. Two weeks ago, Russian advances in these areas suggested an imminent attack on the capital, but this has not yet happened, presumably due to Russia’s logistical problems.

The eastern front is taking on special relevance following the Kremlin’s strategy change. There were reports of recent fighting in Sumy and Izyum, where the Russians were moving south while the Ukrainian defense was holding out in the north, “likely hindering Russian capabilities to resume offensive operations in the southern direction,” according to the ISW.

March 27 | No change in sight

Although the Russian Defense Ministry said on Friday that efforts would be focused on the Donbas region, an assessment by the ISW did not observe any changes to Russian activities near Kyiv. According to this research institute, troops continued to try to secure positions from which to attack or encircle the Ukrainian capital. Allies and the Ukrainian government were also wary of Russia’s announcement.

Two missiles hit Lviv, 60 kilometers from the Polish border, on Saturday. And the UK Defense Ministry said on Sunday that the Russian air force continued to attack targets across Ukraine.

The battleground in northern Ukraine was largely static, said the UK intelligence report. In those areas, counterattacks are hindering Russian attempts to reorganize. On Saturday, Ukrainian forces launched small counterattacks near Kharkiv, in the northeast.

In the east, UK services said they believed that Russian forces are being concentrated in order to try to surround Ukrainian troops in the Donbas, advancing from Kharkiv in the north and Mariupol in the south.

The ISW believes that Mariupol may come under Russian control soon. Fighting continued in the city, and Russian forces continued to sustain significant losses.

March 26 | A change in strategy?

Reports varied regarding the situation on the fronts. Russian forces on Friday said they intended to reduce their military targets and shift their focus to the Donbas region. However, an assessment by the ISW questioned this statement and considered it an attempt to adjust the narrative so that Russia’s limited progress of the past few weeks will look like it was part of the plan.

The news agency Reuters on Saturday said that reports of intense fighting in different parts of the country suggest that there will be no swift end to the conflict. Two missiles struck Lviv on Saturday afternoon, producing large columns of smoke. The mayor confirmed that the attacks damaged an industrial facility used for fuel storage and injured five people.

Vadym left Ukraine with his wife Irina, their three sons and Irina’s grandfather on Feb. 28.

When did you know this was a war?

Around 4 a.m. on Feb. 24, I was woken up by the sound of an explosion. It shook our two-story house, and my wife Irina and our youngest son Anton, 2, who was sleeping with us that night, fell off the bed from the tremors. Three more explosions followed and this time they woke up our two other sons and my wife’s grandfather. We grabbed our emergency suitcases and drove to a village to stay with relatives. Irina started to stutter in the car and this condition stayed for weeks after. When we got to the village, we heard on TV the official government statement that Russia invaded Ukraine. It confirmed what we suspected since the first explosions that morning — if there were explosions in Bila Tserkva, which is a town quite far from the Russian border, it meant nothing good. We returned to Bila Tserkva to pack more, thinking we might have to leave the country.

Vaydm’s journey

All journeys have been simplified to reflect major stops along the way.

What was the moment you realized you had to leave Ukraine or your city?

We knew we had to leave on the third day of the war when we heard yet another blast around 3:30 am. The missile attacks didn’t stop, and we started to hear gun bursts. Irina could barely speak, and her hands were always shaking. We couldn’t calm down Anton. He started to bring us his clothes trying to explain that we should leave. “Here boom,” he said.

We discussed and decided to leave. Irina’s grandfather Leonid is 80 and he is paralyzed on the right side. We couldn’t rush him to a shelter when the sirens went off. Even then, that assumes there was a good one near us, but there were none. We weren’t safe there.

What did you pack?

We had packed our emergency suitcases in the beginning of the year and packed only the most important things — some clothes, documents, nonperishable food and medications. I bought gas in advance because I expected a shortage if something happened. We needed to be ready for everything.

We couldn’t calm down Anton. He started to bring us his clothes trying to explain that we should leave. “Here boom,” he said. Vadym Mykytiuk

What was the journey like?

We thought it would take us one day to get to the Polish border but because of the line of cars at the border it took us two. The cars moved very slowly — about 3 miles per hour. We were in the line for a whole day and tried not to sleep because if you fell asleep you lost your spot in the line. There were people who said they were in line for 3-4 days. When the line didn’t move for a long time, Irina walked further and saw that someone ahead in the line had fallen asleep. That was a cue for us that we could move around them in the line.

We crossed the Polish border without problems around 10:30 p.m. on February 28. We made a stop and volunteers offered us food and hot tea. After that, we drove about 600 miles without stopping to Czechia. After a stop for a couple of days, we made it to Prague, which is where we’re currently staying.

What is it like where you are now?

We’re currently staying in a house in Prague with two more refugee families. There are 13 of us here. We settled in comfortably. After we came here, Irina stopped stuttering and the kids calmed down and adjusted. The older sons are back to doing their Ukrainian school online; many schools haven’t shut down and are operating remotely now using online lesson plans they prepared during the pandemic. We want to sign them up for school in Czechia.

We’re receiving financial assistance from the Czech government — a little less than 12,000 Koruna or $550 a month for two adults and three kids. It’s not nearly enough. If my mom in the U.S. and a tourist from Denmark who stayed with us back in 2016 didn’t help us, we would have been struggling a lot. I’ve heard the amount of assistance recently increased but because of long lines we haven’t managed to get it yet.

Before everyone wakes up in the morning, I try to learn new skills online and I want to find a job soon. It’s not good to be a burden to the government. We want to start earning our own money and be able to start buying more groceries and things of first necessity. I want to start to help Ukraine financially.

What do you think about the U.S. and what is being done or should be done to help Ukraine?

The sky above Ukraine should be closed so there are no missile attacks killing civilians. Anyone who knows history knows that Russia won’t stop. If the U.S. and EU don’t make a decisive move to stop it, then the war will expand and touch other countries. It’s obvious; you don’t need a fortune-teller to tell you that.",https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/04/03/7-ukrainian-refugees-escaping-russias-war-00022175

KHRESTYSHCHE, UKRAINE — This town is slowly fading away. Most residents have fled after nearly a decade of bloody conflict since Russian-backed separatists in the eastern Ukrainian provinces took up arms against the Ukrainian state. One morning this week, a half dozen elderly women, some of the remaining 1,500 residents in town, huddled outside the only church in the village.

They were nervous. Here on the most hotly contested front line of the conflict, Russian airstrikes have drawn closer and the din of war grows louder. The incessant thud of artillery striking a village 10 miles away, echoed through the valley below, interrupting their prayer. “We don’t know who, or what is being fired at,” said 65-year-old Valentina, who said she was too afraid to give her last name.

The eastern region of Ukraine, known as the Donbas, has emerged as the most critical battlefield at this stage in the war between Russian invaders and Ukrainian forces trying to protect their homeland. Russian President Vladimir Putin has set his sights on taking full control of this region as he withdraws his forces from the outskirts of Kyiv, according to intelligence assessments. Analysts believe Putin will redeploy forces here for a new offensive and in an effort to save face after humiliating setbacks elsewhere, setting the stage for increasingly brutal battles for control.

Washington Post journalists spent two days this week traveling the region, approaching within six miles of advancing Russian military units. They interviewed Ukrainian military commanders and soldiers, local officials in towns under increasing pressure from Russian bombardments and terrified civilians whose ravaged homes, schools, churches and businesses are suddenly on the front lines of a war that is drawing ever closer.

“It’s like a dream, I can’t believe this is happening,” said 32-year-old Victoria Debediova, who fled with her son to this village last month, believing the rural hamlet would be safer than the nearby town of Slovyansk. “Nowhere is safe now and the Russians are getting closer every day.”

As she spoke, another loud explosion boomed in the distance. “It’s a Russian airstrike,” said a Ukrainian soldier hurriedly passing through the small town. His weary fellow fighters led him away, admonishing him in whispered tones for sharing information with journalists.

The war has brought new arrivals to the area as people flee from towns close to the fighting. Residents interviewed watched as Ukrainian military vehicles barreled through their village, shuttling nervous young men toward the sound of war. Hundreds of the heavily armed soldiers now roam small villages and rural encampments dotting the region.

Twenty miles away, the mayor of the strategically important town of Izyum announced Friday that Russian forces had taken control of the town after three weeks of ferocious fighting. Russian forces had encircled the town on March 26, pummeling those trapped inside with airstrikes and salvos of heavy artillery. Local officials said 20,000 residents and Ukrainian fighters still in the town are facing a “humanitarian catastrophe” and uncertain future at the hands of Russian troops.

“The battle for Izyum is not over,” Mayor Valeriy Marchenko said in a written statement released Friday evening. “Soon our army will surely liberate the town from Russian occupiers and save the people of Izyum.”

Izyum is located at the highest point of elevation in the Kharkiv region, on a strategic piece of ground called “Kramiyanets” or “Flint Hill.” The elevated position towers over the hills that define this land. From there, major roadways and adjoining villages are visible for miles. Taking it would give Russian forces the ability to control the surrounding areas and limit the movement of Ukrainian forces mounting any counteroffensive.

“Izyum is the last fighting position for our forces before the Donetsk region, the town is the gate to Donbas,” said Maksym Strelnik, a member of the city council. He said Russian forces seem to be trying to surround Ukrainian forces in Donetsk and Luhansk, two provinces that make up the Donbas region. Russia has also supported separatists that have been fighting Ukrainian forces there for years and now seems to be prioritizing a military campaign to take full control.

The Ukrainian military announced Thursday that Russian forces are gathering strength ahead of a planned offensive toward the nearby regional capital of Kramatorsk, just under 30 miles from Izyum. If successful, that would threaten supply lines to embattled Ukrainian combat forces that have endured weeks of fighting to avoid being encircled by Russian forces.

As the fighting inched closer to Kramatorsk, local government workers and engineers from the Ukrainian military placed concrete barricades and “hedgehog” antitank barriers across the city along all possible avenues of approach by invading forces. Fortified artillery firing positions, camouflaged from Russian reconnaissance units, were seen placed in wooded areas surrounding major towns and villages.

Over the course of two days, reporters from The Post observed more than 15 truckloads of heavily armed Ukrainian military personnel traveling toward the fighting in Donetsk. The military columns were made up of at least two dozen military vehicles, including air defense systems, armored troop carriers and tanks. They were supported by groups of soldiers who were seen patrolling country roads as backhoes cut through the black soil to create fortified trenches capable of withstanding Russian artillery strikes.

Ukrainian defensive lines close to borders that define separatist territories remained largely intact despite ceaseless missile barrages. Ukrainian officials have also alleged that separatist fighters from the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republic, as Russia refers to the areas, have also used white phosphorus, a highly flammable and deadly weapon. But Ukrainian military positions, hardened by eight years of war, have held, preventing a possible Russian advance from the eastern flank.

The governor of the Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko, has embraced his role as a wartime leader helping to organize the effort to defend his homeland. He said in an interview Tuesday that after more than a month of war, the days blur together. He said he spends long hours reviewing the latest damage reports from Russian shelling and fielding calls from local officials organizing the evacuation of civilians.

What little sleep he gets is interrupted regularly by air raid sirens. The large network of air-defense systems in the region targets Russian bombers entering Ukrainian airspace. Just 20 miles from active combat, Kramatorsk has been spared the destruction suffered in places like Mariupol and Kharkiv, largely because those air defense systems have kept Russian pilots at bay and stopped many missiles.

Kyrylenko, too, is concerned by the risk of encirclement by Russian forces. “We are looking at the map, all the time, every day, multiple times a day,” he said. As he spoke, with a Glock pistol on his hip and an assault rifle slung across his chest, he was interrupted by an air raid siren that forced him and visiting journalists to seek refuge in a bomb shelter.

“The risk definitely exists, and we are fortifying those locations where the enemy might target” so that “the Russian occupiers won’t just be pushed back but destroyed completely,” Kyrylenko said.

Preparations extend beyond fortifying defensive positions. Deep inside territory held by Ukraine, its security services have stepped up efforts to identify suspected collaborators and Russian intelligence assets operating within the region. Several have been captured.

The Ukrainian security services have found them with equipment to document coordinates of Ukrainian military positions. Officials found evidence that they have helped Russian forces adjust their artillery fire in real time. In addition, the Secret Service of Ukraine has arrested agents providing images and videos for Russian social media propaganda.

Kyrylenko said focusing attention on those agents ensures that Ukrainians “won’t get hit with a knife in the back.” He has suspended civilian rule and imposed military control in 11 districts near Kramatorsk previously controlled by the opposition party. On Tuesday, he submitted a request to President Volodymyr Zelensky to add another.

Since the start of the war in late February, the Secret Service of Ukraine has identified more than 550 suspected collaborators in the Donetsk region accused of treason. Many are in territory controlled by the Russian military. A Russian ballistic missile strike on March 6 obliterated the regional offices of the Ukrainian intelligence agency, further complicating the hunt for Russian collaborators. The powerful explosion also destroyed a nearby kindergarten.

In some cases, collaborators have included local government officials who have provided actionable intelligence to Russian forces, shelling neighbors and friends trapped inside their own towns, Ukrainian officials said. They have also used their detailed knowledge of the local terrain to help advancing Russian forces.

In Izyum, Strelnik said, a city council member from the opposition party guided a Russian armored column down an unguarded stretch of road to avoid the Ukrainian defensive positions. Ukrainian forces defending the city were encircled by the betrayal, he said. After a week of heavy fighting, Russians controlled the town.

Civilians continue to flee the area in record numbers. About 4,000 people from the Donetsk and Luhansk regions are evacuating daily on buses, trains and private vehicles, according to local officials. Those families able to evacuate on their own wait in packed vehicles for hours at lines stretching for miles at fortified checkpoints to have their documents checked.

Inside the Kramatorsk train station, the numbers of those fleeing the coming Russian forces has swelled in recent days. Many wait hours to secure a seat on the four trains leaving daily toward the relative safety of western Ukraine. Hundreds of people, mostly women and children, waited for one train to Lviv on Tuesday that had been organized by the local government.

Many of the recent arrivals to the train station are from Slovyansk. At least a fifth of those living in the city, located just miles away from Russian large artillery, and the deadly Smerch rocket systems, have fled, according to Vadim Liakh, head of city council.

“The whole city is a front line now,” said Lilya Borisova, who decided to evacuate her hometown after a heavy night of Russian bombardment. She gathered what belongings she could fit in two suitcases and took her teenage daughter to the Kramatorsk train station, hoping to secure a seat on a train evacuating civilians.

“We are trying to stay positive. Our parents, our husbands, are back protecting the city,” said Taesia Samoilenko, who left her husband behind in Slovyansk to protect their home. Her eyes briefly welled with tears as she spoke about her husband, looking away from her two children as she composed herself.

Back in the village of Khrestysche, those who remained waited nervously as Russian forces pushed closer to their homes. “If we survive, I’ll leave on foot with my suitcases,” said Debediova, standing outside a small store in the center of the village.

As she spoke, her voice cracked with emotion and she wiped away tears. She repeated over and over, “I don’t want to live in Russia. I don’t want to live in Russia.”

Soldiers from Vladimir Putin’s army reportedly bundled a number of demonstrators into detention vans after they gathered in the centre of the town on Saturday afternoon.

Local authorities shared a video on Telegram which appeared to show stun grenades being thrown in a square in the Sovremennik area, with loud bangs

Alongside the footage, they wrote: “The occupiers are dispersing the protesters with explosions.”

It also accused Russian forces of shelling another part of the town on Saturday and said as a result four people had been wounded and were being treated in hospital.

Residents of a number of towns and villages seized by Russian forces have been holding rallies against the occupation.

Enerhodar, which lies on the Dnipro river in Southern Ukraine, was captured by the Russian army last month. It is home to workers from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe.

Meanwhile, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it was renewing efforts to evacuate civilians in a convoy from the besieged port of Mariupol on Saturday.

The ICRC had sent a team on Friday to lead a convoy of around 54 Ukrainian vehicles out of the city, but was forced to turn back amid safety fears.

Russia has been criticised by Ukrainian officials for failing to safely allow the evacuation of citizens from cities and have been accused of shelling “humanitarian corridors”.

More than 4 million people have fled Ukraine since Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of the country on February 24, according to the United Nations.

Russia last week claimed it would focus its military offensive on the eastern Donbas region after failing to encircle Kyiv and capture other key cities.

Addressing the Ukrainian public on national television on Saturday, presidential adviser Oleksir Arestovych warned that “heavy battles for the south” would continue.",https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/finance/news/russian-troops-hurl-stun-grenades-163308748.html
