A Ukrainian photojournalist who worked for a number of major Western news outlets including Reuters and the BBC has been killed by Russian forces near Kyiv, the office of Ukraine’s attorney general said Saturday.

The body of Maksym (Maks) Levin – who had been capturing the ongoing conflict – was found with two gunshot wounds in the Vyshgorod district which sits just north of the capital, the attorney general’s office said in a Facebook post, citing preliminary reports.

“According to the preliminary information, the soldiers of the Russian Armed Forces killed the unarmed Maksym Levin with two gunshots,” it claimed. His next of kin have been informed, the office told CNN.

Photographer Markiian Lyseiko told CNN that he was last in touch with his friend, known as Maks, on March 12, the day before he went missing in a district north of Kyiv, where he had been reporting on the fighting and fleeing civilians.

In their final conversations, Lyseiko said that Levin had asked him to come to the Ukrainian capital so they could cover the war together.

Lyseiko, who worked alongside Levin since 2014 documenting the war in Donbas, where they embedded with Ukrainian soldiers for weeks at a time, described his friend in an interview with CNN on March 24 as an energetic and tenacious reporter, who often looked like he “had no fear.”

Since the war broke out eight years ago, Levin wanted to show the world what was happening in Ukraine, especially to Russia, Lyseiko said.

“The best way to understand Maks is to look at his work,” Lyseiko said. “When you watch Maks’ films or see his photos, you will understand him, without words.”

A criminal investigation is being carried out by the Vyshgorod District prosecutor's office into alleged violations of “laws and customs of war,” the attorney general’s office said, adding that “measures are being taken to establish all circumstances of the crime.”

Levin began working as a photojournalist in 2006, according to his bio on LensCulture, a photography resources website. He worked for Ukrainian news outlet LB.ua and was “well-known” in his field, having collaborated with Reuters, BBC, TRT World and Associated Press, according to the attorney general’s office.

In a statement online, LB.ua said Levin is survived by four sons, a civil partner and elderly parents. LB.ua said that in addition to journalism, Levin worked on dozens of photo and video projects for humanitarian organizations such as the World Health Organization, UNICEF and UN Women.

In his bio, Levin described himself as a “documentary photographer/videographer, father, human being.”

The Reuters news agency on Saturday said it is “deeply saddened” over Levin's death.

“We are deeply saddened to hear of the death of Maksym Levin, a long-time contributor to Reuters, in Ukraine,” John Pullman, Reuters' global managing editor for visuals, said in a statement to CNN.

“Maks has provided compelling photos and video from Ukraine to Reuters since 2013. His death is a huge loss to the world of journalism.

""Indeed, this is genocide. The elimination of the whole nation and the people.""

That's what Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview last night.

Genocide is defined as a mass extermination of a particular group of people - typified by the efforts of the Nazis to eradicate Jews in the 1940s.

But behind that simple definition is a complicated tangle of legal concepts concerning what constitutes genocide.

The United Nations Genocide Convention came into effect in 1951 and defines genocide as committing any of the following acts with ""the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group"":

Killing members of the group

Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members

Deliberately inflicting conditions calculated to bring about the group's physical destruction, in whole or in part

Putting measures in place to prevent births within the group

Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group

The convention imposes a duty on those who have signed up to it to prevent and punish genocide.

However, since its adoption it's come under criticism from different sides - mostly by people frustrated with the difficulty of applying it to specific cases. Some have argued that the definition is too narrow; others that it is devalued by overuse.

BUCHA, Ukraine — The Russian forces that were intent on overwhelming Kyiv at the war’s start with tanks and artillery retreated under fire across a broad front on Saturday, leaving behind them dead soldiers and burned vehicles, according to witnesses, Ukrainian officials, satellite images and military analysts.

The withdrawal suggested the possibility of a major turn in the six-week war — the collapse, at least for now, of Russia’s initial attempt to seize Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, and the end of its hopes for the quick subjugation of the nation.

Moscow has described the withdrawal as a tactical move to regroup and reposition its forces for a major push in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. While there are early indications that the military is following through on that plan, analysts say it cannot obscure the magnitude of the defeat.

“The initial Russian operation was a failure and one of its central goals — the capture of Kyiv — proved unobtainable for Russian forces,” Michael Kofman, the director of Russian studies at C.N.A., a research institute in Arlington, Va., said in a telephone interview Saturday.

Elsewhere in Ukraine, Russian attacks continued unabated, and the Pentagon has cautioned that the formations near Kyiv could be repositioning for renewed assaults.

In the south, an aid convoy organized by the International Committee of the Red Cross that had stalled on its way to bring some relief to the besieged city of Mariupol was on the move again. The hope, repeatedly frustrated by Russian shelling, was to bring emergency supplies to trapped residents and to evacuate hundreds of those who have endured weeks of bombardment that has left shortages of food and water.

In the suburban towns north of Kyiv, the Ukrainian army was advancing through a tableau of destruction, with dozens of wrecked tanks on streets, extensive damage to buildings and the bodies of civilians still lying uncollected. Kyiv and its surroundings, which had echoed with artillery booms and gunfire for weeks, had gone quiet.

Ukraine’s military on Saturday moved into Bucha, a key town on the west bank of the Dnipro River — which divides Kyiv — days after Russian forces had sacked it on their way out.

“They went from apartment to apartment collecting televisions and computers, loaded them on their tanks and left,” Svetlana Semenova, a retiree, said of the Russian departure, which she described as chaotic. “They left in a hurry.”

A few dozen people who had been living mostly in basements for a month staggered outside to collect food — bags of potatoes and bread — brought by Ukrainian soldiers.

Elena Shur, 43, an accountant for Ukraine’s national airline, said the first sign of the Ukrainian military came on Friday, when a civilian car carrying soldiers drove through town waving the country’s flag.

“We saw people on the street, and soldiers,” Ms. Shur said. “I cried.”

Reporters counted six bodies of civilians on the streets and sidewalks of Bucha. It was unclear under what circumstances they had died, but the discarded packaging of a Russian military ration was lying beside one man who had been shot in the head.

As photos of casualties in Bucha emerged, a senior adviser to Ukraine’s president said on Saturday that some of the dead wearing civilian clothes appeared to have been bound and executed.

“The bodies of people with tied hands, who were shot dead by soldiers lie in the streets,” the adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said on Twitter. “These people were not in the military. They had no weapons. They posed no threat.” He included an image of a scene, photographed by Agence France-Presse, showing three bodies on the side of a road, one with hands apparently tied behind the back. The New York Times was unable to independently verify Mr. Podolyak’s claim the people had been executed.

The town was the site of a major Ukrainian ambush of a Russian armored column in the first days of the war, and one street was blocked by dozens of incinerated tanks and trucks.

Despite that setback, the Russians had captured Bucha and held it for about a month. They executed half a dozen members of the Territorial Defense Force — the volunteer army many Ukrainians joined when the war started — leaving the bodies in a heavily mined part of town, said Varvara Kaminskaya, 69.

The Ukrainians have advanced at least another 15 miles to the northwest of Bucha, where they now fly Ukrainian flags over former Russian checkpoints.

After their initial assault on the capital failed, the Russian army had dug into defensive positions outside of Kyiv, suggesting an intention to hold a front line near the city. In an artillery war, trenches afford soldiers the best chance of survival.

Those were abandoned in and around Bucha on Saturday. On the northern edge of town were the abandoned berms that had sheltered Russian artillery emplacements, surrounded by green boxes and hundreds of empty shell cases.

“According to our information, they are running away from all areas around Kyiv,” said Sgt. Ihor Zaichuk, the commander of the 1st company of the 2nd Azov battalion in the Ukrainian army, which fought in Bucha.

“They can say on their own television stations, if they want, that they are the second most powerful army in the world,” he said. “But they aren’t anymore.”

He cautioned, however, that the Russians might return. “Only their commanders know if they will be re-equipped and return.” Even as cars lined up on some roads, making their way back into Kyiv, workers were building new defenses from heavy logs.

On the east bank of the Dnipro, Ukrainian forces were pressing forward in villages dozens of miles from the capital, according to an intelligence officer with the S.B.U., the Ukrainian domestic intelligence service, who declined to be identified for security reasons.

Analysts said that Moscow’s stated decision to refocus its military on the Donbas in eastern Ukraine is likely to be accurate, but mostly because they had little option.

“The Russians are adjusting their goals to reality,” Lawrence Freedman, emeritus professor of war studies at King’s College London, said in an interview on Saturday. “I think they know they’re in trouble, so I don’t think it’s a ruse to say they’re concentrating on the Donbas, because in reality that’s all they can do.”

Mr. Kofman, the expert on the Russian military, said the Russian army had lost about 2,000 pieces of equipment that was either destroyed, captured or abandoned, including about 350 tanks.

As the Russians retreated, they left mines and booby traps behind in an effort to slow the Ukrainians’ pursuit, according to Ukrainian officers in different towns. In the suburb of Irpin, which the Ukrainians had recaptured before Bucha, demining operations were in full swing on Saturday. Some civilian bodies had been booby-trapped to kill emergency workers, Ukrainian officials said.

One group of military engineers, dressed in heavy blue Kevlar armor, had tied a rope to a body. They pulled on it, to see if the motion would trigger booby traps. By late in the day, however, the body remained there, with the engineers apparently unable to ascertain if it was safe to collect.

In the village of Dmytrivka, west of the capital, there were signs of a hasty Russian retreat from a scene of carnage. On a forest road leading out of the village, nine tanks and armored vehicles lay destroyed and gutted by fire, the detritus of a tank battle three days earlier. The turrets and heavy guns of two tanks lay tossed aside. Inside one armored personnel carrier, the burned human remains of men were visible.

Valentina Yatsevich, 58, a villager walking past the wrecks toward her home, said, “They did not leave, they were destroyed.”

In Russia itself, the retreat caused consternation among the war’s cheerleaders, with state television having previously raised expectations that the Russian military would capture Kyiv.

Semyon Pegov, a popular pro-Kremlin war blogger embedded with the Russian troops, posted a video to the social messaging app Telegram on Saturday describing the move as “a withdrawal, not a flight.”

The retreat was necessitated, he said, by Russia’s stretched-out supply lines and the threat of further losses as its troops tried to survive in field conditions facing a much better supplied and fortified enemy.

It was an effort, mirrored by other pro-Kremlin outlets, to explain why Russia seemed to have sharply scaled back its war aims in recent days, after taking painful losses in fighting for the Kyiv suburbs.

Russian hard-liners calling for an assault on Kyiv saw the retreat as a disappointment. “I don’t know why this decision was made,” Aleksandr Kots, a war correspondent for the Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda, wrote on Telegram. “The war is only beginning. We’ll figure out later who was right and who was at fault.”

The Kremlin maintained its defiance as state television released an interview with Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin’s spokesman, characterizing the United States as being at the root of Europe’s ills. He expressed confidence that European countries would renew relations with Russia once they “sober up a little from the American bourbon.”

In Lithuania, President Gitanas Nauseda announced that his country would no longer import Russian gas starting this month. “If we can do it, the rest of Europe can do it too,” he wrote on Twitter. The European Union is looking for ways to reduce Europe’s dependency on Russian oil and gas.

In other developments on Saturday, Pope Francis, visiting the Mediterranean island nation of Malta, edged closer to blaming President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia for the war in Ukraine than he had before. In an address to Maltese dignitaries and officials, the pope blamed a “potentate, sadly caught up in anachronistic claims of nationalist interests” for casting “dark shadows of war” from Europe’s east.

Francis has declined to explicitly blame Mr. Putin or Russia as the aggressor for various reasons, including the Vatican’s hopes of playing a role in a potential peace agreement. But on Saturday, he clearly seemed to be speaking about Mr. Putin, who he said was “provoking and fomenting conflicts.”

DAY 35 (WEDNESDAY, MARCH 30): IN THE NERVE CENTER OF CATASTROPHE

THE ROOM I GREW UP IN no longer corresponds to the life I lead—the life that is unfolding outside the window. Looking around, it feels like a child’s room that was abandoned a long time ago. And now I have to spend the night here again. The room tells a story of peace that I can’t take seriously anymore as an “adult.” On the shelf there are books in Russian, German, Ukrainian, and English. They seem to belong to another era. Since the war started, I have rarely opened a book, and when I do, I read no more than two or three pages.

The word “war” is even less comprehensible during wartime than in peacetime, when it’s used quite differently. What is happening around me right now—the constant shelling and the warnings I hear—this is what “war” should mean. But this word seems meaningless, because in war reality breaks into parts, islands, pieces.

Next to the Kyiv apartment of an acquaintance of mine, buildings and houses are constantly damaged. In her own building, many window frames are empty of the glass that has been shattered by waves of detonations. It is dangerous to visit her neighborhood. Not only are there damaged houses and cars, but mines and explosives strewn throughout small parks. Then again, virtually nothing reaches this level of destruction in my neighborhood. I can think of only two or three routes that would lead to a dangerous zone if you were to walk for more than thirty minutes.

Another friend of mine from Kyiv hasn’t slept at night since the war began. The strikes are too near and she feels that her house could be damaged at any moment. She gets panic attacks and suffers heartache, but she stays in the city, independently distributing medicine and aid. By contrast, I am often out in the street during the air raid alarms, and always fall asleep at some point during the night.

The disjointedness of these experiences demonstrates that war and catastrophe have a local nervous system here in Kyiv. It is difficult for me to comprehend what is happening elsewhere, beyond the borders of the district I so rarely leave.

A street near the Kyiv Opera House.

Lysychansk is a city in eastern Ukraine, a small town bordering Sievierodonetsk. After the occupation of Luhansk, Sievierodonetsk became the new administrative center of the whole Luhansk Oblast. Lysychansk remained an almost invisible little town, its existence mostly tied up with a coal industry in its death throes. I visited this town several times in the past few years to work on a photo series about the mines in the area. In my mind, I named this place “The City of the Fox” because you can hear the Ukrainian word for fox, “Lyssa,” very clearly in its name.

When I was on the road there, all of Lysychansk seemed traumatized by the war that began in 2014. Many people told me stories of miraculous rescues, each with a variation on a singular inner voice that helped them escape death while they were under fire.

The war was terrible and it filled the city with fear. For the Lysychansk residents I met, any form of protest became unimaginable, even though the right to protest belongs to the political culture of Ukraine and has a long history among miners. I stayed in the only private hotel in this city and there, in my room, I experienced my first great episode of fear about Grad systems and rockets—despite the fact that I had already been to many cities in the Donbas.

It was a late evening in 2015. While talking to the receptionist, who told me how she shielded her granddaughter with her own body for several hours during an attack, I approached the window of my room and heard a wide but distinct roar. It was like a long rush of wind carrying metallic sounds. It seemed to be approaching us. The receptionist explained that this was the sound of missiles, and that one could not simply hide when an attack happened. At that moment, I felt an uncanny, almost panicky urge to leave this city right away. Eventually I was able to calm down and convince myself to continue conducting my interviews.

Now I learn that the City of the Fox is under fire. Early in the morning, prefab buildings were shelled, collapsing like houses of cards. I hear a confirmed update about a family there: Two small children were so badly injured that no one knows whether they can be saved. Legs may have to be amputated. The parents have been injured, but they will survive. The shelling endures as I write these words.

Almost none of my friends has ever been to this town, which is a hermetically sealed world of miners and their everyday culture. My Facebook timeline is silent about the bombardment of Lysychansk.

After the negotiations with Russia, it was reported that acts of war would be confined to the Donbas region. For me this means that cities are being attacked which hardly anyone visits or knows much about, and which have already long suffered from the Russian invasion.

DAY 34 (TUESDAY, MARCH 29): ISLANDS OF TEMPORARY CALM

WHEN I BEGAN THIS DIARY, I didn’t plan to pursue it for too long because I assumed the war would last only a few days. “It’s really impossible,” I thought, “that such a war won’t come to an end at once. It’s not doing anyone any good! The casualties are much greater than people think.” The losses for Ukraine, Russia, and the entire world were already enormous on the very first day; every additional hour felt unreasonable and unnecessary.

The most important thing is to not turn around and reevaluate our previous experiences from our current vantage. Every day at war is like a deadly disease that needs to be cured urgently. When I wake up, I watch the news with hungry curiosity, expecting something to shift, expecting the values of the days before the war to be restored and validated at last. It can’t be, I think, that the world simply watches as the residents of Mariupol are deported or brought to death in bomb shelters; as the people of Chernihiv are left to fend for themselves for days without food deliveries; as there is so much death, rape, plunder, and death again.

The tenderness of life is preserved on islands of temporary calm. And today I find that a rather daring, albeit inexplicable, thought. Even the soldiers I meet in the center of Kyiv seem to feel their former occupations within them—despite their weapons, despite having already been to the front. “What were you before the war?” I ask and hear in reply: a lawyer, a mechanic. When I take their pictures, they ask me to delete the photographs. I always do. After the war, my files will contain almost no pictures of soldiers or ruins.

In the early evening, on Khreshchatyk Street, I met an elderly lady who was walking slowly because her small shopping bag was too heavy. We had been walking in the same direction for some time when she spoke to me. “Have you heard about the negotiations?” she asked. Despite the old lady’s stark and hurried tone, she seemed much younger than her bent posture suggested. She meant the talks in Turkey between representatives of Russia and Ukraine. “How can we believe the Russians? Do you think that lives can be saved? After a hiatus they will surely attack us again.” She uttered the last sentence with such disappointment, but I also noticed a trace of hope in her voice. She belonged to those who still believe that this war is unthinkable and will promptly disappear, like a dream.

While negotiations between Russia and Ukraine continue in Istanbul, people in Kyiv wait for the end of the air raid alarm.

Today began with a report from Mykolayiv in the south of Ukraine. The city hall had been shelled. A giant hole gaped in a house. A projectile tore something out of the middle of two connected buildings, as if a destructive force were on the hunt for an organ that could put an end to urban life. Why do these images spread so easily? They convey something inhuman, a magnitude of destruction that demonstrates what is happening and, in the dimensions of abstraction, makes clear this alien pain. Only in the evening did it surface that twelve people have already died under the rubble. The search continues.

Toward the end of the negotiations, I was euphoric for an instant. I thought, this is a step in the right direction, some cities will be safer, including Kyiv. It means more lives will be saved.

As the negotiations went on, air raid sirens could be heard over and over again. On the street, I passed by groups of people who did not dare to leave the stores where they were shopping. They waited until the alarm was finished.

I write and I hear the sirens howling.

The day before yesterday I met an elderly woman who used to organize and lead something rather exotic for Kyiv: a fashion show. She was breathing heavily, walking behind me and talking as I kept turning to face her. Every day she walks five kilometers to a construction site, where she feeds animals whose owners have left the city. Several dogs and cats are hiding together there. They were left behind in Kyiv in panic and haste, and now they await the people they lived with, who miss them.

The lady explained how at the beginning of the war she saw a car loaded with suitcases and bags drive away, leaving a dog behind. A little boy cried and begged his mother to take the animal. But she sternly refused. The dog, which had a golden coat, ran beside the car for a long time to catch up with it. Having witnessed this scene, the lady decided to provide food for the street animals of Kyiv.

When I went home in the evening, I met a well-dressed woman carrying five dogs. She addressed them all with a jocular tone. She explained to me that these dogs, as well as the two cats waiting for her at home, were the only reason she had not left Kyiv. It’s not easy to travel with such a large party, she said. She looked happy.

DAY 33 (MONDAY, MARCH 28): ENDLESS CANNONADES

My previous entry was an eternity ago. At least that’s how I perceive it. I may have missed only one day, but it feels like my German has slipped away and that I can no longer get used to expressing my thoughts in it. When I stop to reflect, Russian, Ukrainian, and English mingle to form the voice in my head.

Time sometimes runs too fast—days and hours seem to differ rapidly from one another. A feeling of security arises under the ongoing bombardment, and becomes unbearable: It seems to be cobbled together from counterfeit sensations.

An artist, the acquaintance of a good friend, lives on the outskirts of Kyiv. She says that that the shelling sounds much louder in the forest than it does near me, in the center of town—as if there is fighting amongst the trees, someone on the hunt, shooting at someone else. Reflecting on the gunfire audio messages coming from all around her, she wondered: What if she lay down on a forest path and decided to accept her own death? She thinks this could be somewhat liberating.

Tomorrow, talks between Ukrainian and Russian negotiators will take place in Istanbul. Perhaps that’s why Kyiv has been shelled all day long. Early in the morning I heard endless cannonades, a composition of gunshots. My mother came by my apartment and we went for a walk. We told each other funny stories and imagined that all the sound explosions came from our air defenses protecting the city. But then we heard a long, deep, and rolling roar. A white line appeared like the trace of an airplane, but short and uneven. It was the trail of a missile. We heard the explosion.

The news was silent even an hour after impact. For several days, reports of attacks and strikes have become increasingly delayed—so as not to give the enemy any hint about whether they have injured us. As a consequence, you hardly know where you are anymore. Where and when does the feeling of security—even if fleeting—begin, and where does it end? There remain only the messages on Telegram channels: “Many Kyiv residents are reporting explosions. But we don’t want to write anything more specific about it now.”

You can learn more from talk around town. At the kiosk, where you can get one of the best espressos in Kyiv (or anywhere), the young barista confided in me that high-rises had been damaged within a fifteen-minute walk of his house. He reported this with a touch of irony in his intonation, as if he were talking about bad weather.

A good friend and human rights activist is now in Chernivtsi in southwestern Ukraine. Her boyfriend, who fled Mariupol on foot, just arrived there. The residents of Mariupol are constantly trying to leave the city—without cars and packing only the bare necessities. They flee in the direction of Berdyansk, where they get picked up. Often news arrives that these pedestrians have been shot on the way. I can’t imagine how people can learn about such crimes and not at once do something to stop them. A collective psychosis is sweeping Russian media right now, combined with an obvious enjoyment of impunity and the ability to strike fear into the most powerful countries.

I was awakened by a phone call. It was a young woman, who was practically a child in 2014 and who has been on the run since that very year. She cried as she explained that she really loves her new home, the city of Sloviansk in eastern Ukraine, and never wants to leave it. She got my number from acquaintances in order to ask about possible escape routes. I heard her tender, high-pitched voice—utterly incompatible with the sounds of gunfire and air defenses that are muffled by my tightly closed windows, and that have become the background to my everyday life.

During an air raid alarm, a lone woman leans against a tree in an empty park.

DAY 31 (SATURDAY, MARCH 26): A GAP IN THE WINDOW

THIS EVENING I COULDN’T CLOSE THE KITCHEN WINDOW. Some hidden metal piece had broken, and the window would not completely close. A gap remained, you could hear the wind blowing outside, and I feared that if there were another fire in the area, my apartment would fill with smoke. It was already evening and I wanted to darken the windows. To do this I always gather thick duvet covers, and, with such friendly and familiar blankets hanging over the windows, my kitchen becomes a safe place where I can spend the evening. The windows were darkened, the light almost extinguished, but air still penetrated through the gap. I decided to call my neighbor Andrij, a doctor, to ask him for help. But he was in a bomb shelter, where he spends almost every night offering medical assistance. Our phone conversation calmed me down somewhat, although it was a bit absurd.

“Don’t worry about it,” he said. “The oil repositories aren’t burning anymore and it’s going to rain. Thanks to the gap, you are going to finally get some fresh air at night!”

“When do you think this will come to an end?” I asked. It is, by this point, a rhetorical question, which has become typical.

“It’s becoming quite clear that soon they won’t be able to do anything. We’ll drive them out.”

“I heard Boyarka was shelled. How is your mother?” His mother lives in that village, just outside of Kyiv.

“Part of a missile hit close to her house. But she’s doing fine.” In the photos I could find from the area, the aftermath of this attack looked like someone had bitten off a piece of a wall as if it were an apple. It could have been a nightmarish illustration of the Grimm’s fairy tale about the gingerbread house.

“Can you imagine them running around Boyarka in small groups, firing at the commuter trains?” he asked. “That’s what the saboteur groups are busy with now.”

“But that’s not in the news at all,” I remarked.

“They just haven’t written about it yet, but my relatives from Boyarka reported it.”

Other relatives of Andrij live in the occupied villages near Chernihiv. They tell him that Russian soldiers raid homes and stores in search of alcohol. You can see them in the streets, often quite drunk. They gather to fire at apartment buildings or buses. They shell the trains that connect small towns. They keep breaking into the apartments and houses of the villagers, who, in talking to the soldiers, realize how little the occupiers know about the actual progress of the war. The soldiers’ smartphones have been taken away from them. Russian military officials claim that Kyiv is already half occupied and that Odessa has been under Russian control for a long time, with many other such successes. They ask about villages and use outdated national maps from 2015, when many places had different names. Then the soldiers try to take the cell phones of Andrij’s relatives and other villagers. They do this to sever people’s connection to the outside world, and perhaps to acquire some information themselves.

Andrij sounded chipper and ironic. His relatives keep calling him and reporting on all that’s going on in their village.

I forgot about the window. I remembered it only when I heard the air raid sirens during the night, with the stormy wind carrying the sound of distant explosions into my apartment.

I thought I had taken a lot of pictures today, but when I looked at the files, I realized how few there were. I was in one of the largest underpasses in Kyiv—in the city center, on Khreshchatyk Street, where I spent part of my childhood. All exits were monitored and the underpass, typically crowded with little shops and hurried pedestrians, stood empty, storing the sounds of war like a shell stores the sound of the sea. With trembling hands, I began to film part of the underpass. I thought that such a small video could say a lot about what was happening in the country. But I feared someone would misunderstand the reasons for my recording, and I counted every second I filmed.

I wanted to write more about Irina from Hirske, an acquaintance from the small, eastern town whom I started talking to yesterday. But I can’t find the words for it.

Irina’s sister-in-law worked as a doctor in the maternity ward of the hospital that was shelled. The shelling that made headlines around the world. One of her pregnant patients died. Her sister-in-law’s parents lived in Mariupol, across the street from the Dramatic Theater. Her mother collected old porcelain, jewelry, and trinkets. A few days later, after the shelling, bombs hit the cellar where her mother was hiding. Almost everyone in that cellar was killed, including her mother. Her father survived but he won’t leave Mariupol until he buries his wife. The shelling is so heavy, though, that a funeral is not possible. Almost nothing remains of a woman’s love for porcelain, or her memories. Only a story that is impossible to tell.

What is happening in Ukraine right now, what we are all experiencing, will define our existence forever. But not only ours. One must find the courage to stop the aggressor. The world will never forgive itself for these crimes.

I thought I had taken a lot of pictures today, but when I looked at the files, I realized how few there were.

DAY 30 (FRIDAY, MARCH 25)

TODAY’S GOAL: bring the train tickets I bought for my family and relatives back to the station so that someone else can use them. Online returns are not working right now.

Beginning of the day: a short and somewhat ironic conversation with a child psychologist, Irina, who lives in the small town of Hirske, not far from Lysychansk and Rubizhne, both the kind of small towns in Luhansk Oblast that journalists would typically never visit. They are under heavy artillery and rocket fire; the news reported that the day before yesterday phosphorus bombs were used in Rubizhne. Nevertheless, Irina remains on site, because every day she provides support to schoolchildren, little kids, and elderly people. Our conversation was interrupted when I had to go to the train station and Irina had to pick up the medicine delivered to her from another city. Pharmacies are no longer open in Hirske, and not a single ATM is working. Tomorrow we will continue our conversation.

As I was listening to Irina, I thought that it must be uncanny to remain in such a place. It was even harder to imagine that children, women, and elderly people go on living. Irina said that the school where she worked as a psychologist and art teacher was shelled by rockets this morning.

Maybe friends of mine who live outside of Ukraine have a similar difficulty imagining why we are still in Kyiv. What does it mean, really, to expose yourself to danger, even if only relative danger? From the outside, if viewed unkindly, it might even seem like a position that exudes ambiguity or indecision.

Russia exploited this ambiguity in 2014 to portray the people who did not flee the occupied territories of the Donbas as pro-Russian. Danger and inaccessibility functioned like a barrier at the time, so the media would report anything—probable or improbable—about the region.

My relatives want to leave Kyiv—we had already planned our exit. But as the day of departure ruthlessly approached, they had more and more complaints and objections.

Here in Kyiv, where every day you come across friends, acquaintances, and strangers you end up helping, you manage somehow to bear the unbearable news and events. The daily restlessness and the incessant air raid sirens structure your time, merging powerfully with your stream of consciousness, which might otherwise choose to linger on a painful thought as a passenger lingers at a bus stop.

My mother said to me today that she has not cried since the war began. But that my father almost cried when he learned that on March 20 in the small town of Kreminna—also in Luhansk Oblast, a little north of Hirske—a retirement home was shot to pieces by a tank. Almost all fifty-six residents were killed.

I listened to my mother and realized I somehow missed this inconceivable event, which made me feel ill. I felt anger rising within me and I too wanted to cry. At the same time, I couldn’t really grasp it. I pictured my father’s face as he read that news, and only through this image could I sense something burning and bleak.

We decided to postpone our departure for a few days, and perhaps to prepare a little better this time. And we resolved we would return to Kyiv as soon as possible.

On the way back from the train station, my mother and I met two people from the military who were sitting in front of a grocery store drinking coffee. They showed us a picture of a boy, who was only fourteen years old, posing in a uniform next to some soldiers.

“We are going to our military positions today to fetch him,” one of the soldiers explained. “He followed his father and wants to fight shoulder to shoulder with him, but he is too young. They have clearly lost everything—their house, their family—and now all he wants is to fight. We understand, of course, but cannot allow it.” They were obviously proud, both of this mission and also of the boy’s determination. They smiled with a little bit of tenderness, and their good mood even infected us.

Today I met Timofij, who is fourteen years old and has stayed in Kyiv with his family. Almost every day, he plays soccer with a friend on the empty streets.

DAY 29 (THURSDAY, MARCH 24): THE SMELL OF BURNING FORESTS

A LITTLE GIRL looked at me with a friendly expression. She was coloring the backrest of a wooden bench with a piece of chalk. She tried to tell me something, but she was interrupted by her grandfather, who seemed annoyed. “Listen here,” he said to me in a somewhat brazen voice, “I told my daughter, ‘Let’s buy the apartment in Kyiv.’ But she replied, ‘Nobody wants to live in Kyiv, with its stuffy big city air! We should get a nice apartment under the green trees of Bucha, outside of Kyiv.’ And, being the foolish person I am, I agreed!” He looked at me reproachfully, as if I were the one who had persuaded him to buy an apartment in a pleasant suburb now smothered in fire, rockets, and mortar shells.

I didn’t even want to talk to him at first, but he called out to me and asked me to walk a few steps in his direction. It was already evening; soon the curfew would begin. The little park I passed by was deserted, but it left an impression of being on guard.

The air raid alarm had just finished and I thought I only had a few minutes for a little conversation. But then the man mentioned Bucha and all of a sudden I decided to spend as much time with them as they wanted. The girl, who was about six years old, told me in a serious voice, “For two weeks we lived in the basement! We were twenty-one adults and seven children.”

The grandfather still seemed angry with me. “I come from a city where most people speak Russian. I come from Dnipro. But part of our family lives here in Bucha and in Kyiv. Two weeks in the basement with only water, some food, almost no heating, and barely any electricity! Constant shelling, especially when we tried to sneak a little fresh air. And then they found us! The Russians came to us in the cellar and explained—no, they barked—that they had come to denazify us. ‘If I were not seventy years old,’ I answered them, ‘I would rather throw you out than talk to you! Don’t speak to me, not even for a second!’ But now I’m here with my granddaughter. And so then they tried to force us to leave the basement.”

He continued to recount what happened but the story unraveled. At the end he got so furious that he said to me, “You should go there. To Bucha! If you were there, you wouldn’t look at me like that, you would understand everything. And here, in Kyiv, nothing has been made clear!”

It is evening now, and I am sitting in my room. The air is slowly filling with a faint smell of burning. Somewhere far away, on the right bank of the Dnieper, the forests are in flames, after fierce rocket fire. Two large apartment blocks are reported to have been hit. It is not clear how many victims there are.

Today, my childhood friend lost his family home. A week and a half ago, he left it in a hurry and with great difficulty, along with his uncle, who resisted—he did not want to leave under any circumstances. Early in life I used to visit his house all the time. I try to remember the rooms. I recall the traditional living room of a small house with a low ceiling, a resplendent cabinet with old photos behind a glass shelf, and the meals my friend’s grandmother used to prepare for us. This memory is not accompanied by any feeling.

Perhaps it will rain during the night, and the smoke will disappear, hopefully quickly. One has to drink a lot of water right now. That’s what they recommend on the Telegram channels, where people share pictures of the fires.

A downtrodden salesman who lives in my building reminded me that the war started exactly a month ago, on February 24. Then we both decided to fixate no longer on such dates. The little girl I met, along with her grandfather, would have had much more to say, I presume. It’s good to fall asleep knowing that they were rescued, that they called me over and told me their story, ultimately asking where they could buy jeans in Kyiv. They had not taken a change of clothes with them when they left. In Kyiv, stores are slowly beginning to open again. The little girl and her grandfather will certainly be able to buy something soon.

I met an elderly man and his granddaughter. The girl, who was about six years old, told me in a serious voice, “For two weeks we lived in the basement! We were twenty-one adults and seven children.”

DAY 27 (WEDNESDAY, MARCH 23): “RISK OF INJURY!”

IT WAS A DAY of contradictions, as if different realities were fighting one another. I woke up and saw white smoke outside. The air itself smelt burnt. The air raid alarm was sounding, in addition to a warning: “Do not approach your windows! There is a risk of injury!”

But a few hours later, around noon, the air was clean again. I had to do some shopping and was eager to leave the house after a long lockdown. But when I finally left my apartment, the sirens began to howl once more. I wanted to hurry home, but then I spotted two young people on a bench, in the middle of a peaceful conversation as if the alarm had never gone off.

They were two students, Nikolaj and Sonia. Sonia explained that she was studying law and had remained in Kyiv almost by accident. Twice she planned to leave, and each time it fell through for different reasons. Now they both try not to stray far from their neighboring apartments and, when they have time, to study on their own. They don’t want to be taught—they say it’s unimaginable under these circumstances. Teaching is an organized transmission of knowledge, work structured by others. That no longer makes sense. Nevertheless, they think that knowledge will continue to exist and remain important, so it seems reasonable to go on learning autonomously.

Together we tried to formulate this thought more clearly, but we didn’t quite succeed. They said that on April 4, depending on the circumstances, their formal education will start up again.

We talked about the air raid alarms that go off several times a day, which always portend new danger and new attacks. For every one you have to hope that nobody was injured. They both said they didn’t hear the last alarm, that’s why they were sitting in the park, talking and trying to enjoy this sunny day despite the fatigue of many sleepless nights.

There were few pedestrians on the streets in my neighborhood today, but the ones I did see were spreading warmth. Time and again I watched people hug each other.

Out in the streets, I saw young women and men who had gone for a jog, amid the shriek of sirens, on this first warm day of the year. Two florists had opened unexpectedly—I met a couple of pedestrians with bouquets in their hands. A woman who had just bought flowers was passing a recently reopened cafe on her way home after work. She stopped next to me and, in the middle of the street, we both read the news on her phone.

I wanted to tell her how brave she had been for staying and working in Kyiv. But she interrupted me and said that the really brave people were those who were gathering in the occupied cities of Kherson and Berdyansk to protest against the occupiers. People disappear there all the time, whether they’re arrested and deported to Russia, or injured and shot at during the protests.

She told me she has family near Berdyansk, in the small town of Polohy, which is occupied by the Russian army. She often loses contact with Polohy. The internet connection is unstable; the power goes out, and food is scarce. Her relatives are able to survive mainly due to a small bakery in the neighboring village that works to supply the whole district with bread. “Logistics can fail,” the woman opined. “Food warehouses can be blocked off. Yet sometimes there are people who keep it all running despite everything. At the moment, this bakery is saving lives.”

I was reminded of the news stories I keep reading: Russia is apparently attacking warehouses where provisions are stored. There are repeated attempts to cut off Kyiv from food supplies as well. The same thing is happening in Chernihiv, one of the most beautiful cities in Ukraine, which has been shelled and where there is hardly any water to be found, not to mention electricity or heating.

I know an elderly woman who recently travelled to Chernihiv because she lived alone in Kyiv and wanted to escape her loneliness. In vain I tried to reach her by phone. The city is in such great danger that the bodies of those who died in the attacks lie in the streets—for days they cannot be transported and buried on account of the continuous artillery fire.

There were few pedestrians on the streets in my neighborhood today, but the ones I did see were spreading warmth. Time and again I watched people hug each other. Even in the grocery store amidst hurried customers, a man and woman stopped to hug. I probably stared at the scene a bit too obviously. At one point, the woman turned to me and said in an almost cheerful voice, “I haven’t seen him in two weeks. He’s back from the war, and he’s alive!”

DAY 27 (TUESDAY, MARCH 22): THE HOUSES THAT DISAPPEARED

A DAY IN LOCKDOWN, without being allowed to leave the house, alone with the news and conjecture about the future. The end of the war is continually announced like a weather forecast. Some experts express themselves in newspapers, others through long and reassuring video monologues. In this way, by leaping into a distant news stream, one can slowly accept what is happening to my country. At the same time, such a thought is unbearable. I push it away. Besides, I know that “my country” sounds abstract enough as an idea that one could be able to “accept” what is happening—but you can never understand how something so brutal can be done to people.

When I walk through Kyiv, I see men and women standing like little statues, looking at their phones; they don’t seem to want to know what’s happening in their immediate surroundings anymore. They read the news, because only there, it seems, are hidden the secret answers to these dark questions arising every day in new and uncertain ways. Many phone numbers have been disconnected. A humanitarian catastrophe is in full swing in all occupied territories. Hunger reigns, and people are kidnapped and arrested.

Perhaps the tight narratives of the news cycle only testify to something that is missing. What’s really missing right now are words. I’m in my apartment, I found some time to write—but can I barely develop a thought.

I watch video clips of the shelling on my phone. They are shared via Telegram channels, posted by residents of Kyiv. I see how silver streaks glow and then settle from the sky onto the rooftops. Someone claims that’s what phosphorus ammunition looks like, while others think it’s rocket fire from a Grad system, a multiple rocket launcher. A few of the districts of Kyiv, including mine, were shelled today.

Then I think for the first time that this footage could be a forgery, that it is a recording of another reality. It is not aboutKyiv at all. Is it possible that right now—as I write this in my apartment while most of my neighbors spend the night in shelters—Grad missiles are flying through the air and white phosphorus is raining down on someone’s home, not so far from here, in my own city?

I miss all the walls, all the houses of this city that I haven’t seen yet, that I haven’t photographed, that have already disappeared and been destroyed, that have become unrecognizable, incinerated.

Around noon today a powerful strike could be felt throughout my house. The rules of news coverage are changing, so it is not clear right away what attacks are happening where. Only the body of the house and one’s own body sense the danger. For now they have become the most immediate sources of information.

A few hours ago, I spoke on the phone with Elena, an employee at a zoo outside Kharkiv, an area subject to constant onslaught. She is the director of a theater where children perform as actors together with dogs, mice, and rats. Time and again employees try to feed and evacuate the animals. But as soon as the Russian army sees cars, bullets begin to fly.

On March 7, Elena tried to reach the zoo one last time in order to bring food to the animals. On the phone she explained to me that many animals remain in their pens. “The deer were shot at. Some of them died. Others managed to escape through the ruined fence into the forest. When we arrived by bus, the shelling started. We ran out of the bus with the feed and made it to the pens. Some great apes had been shot. We ran through the damaged rooms trying to distribute as much of the feed as possible. Then we ran to the bus, but the driver was already dead. We tried to get another car to go back and transport his body to the city. Another colleague was fatally injured. Only one other colleague and I were able to escape.”

“I can’t cry,” she went on to say. “I can’t even believe it took place. Before my eyes I keep seeing the plastic display window where the monkeys were waiting for us. Many of them were standing there with babies pressed against their bodies. They were hoping for food, but we didn’t manage to feed them that day.” Elena has stopped going to the zoo for the moment, but other staff members are trying to reach the pens so that the animals, the ones still alive anyway, don’t die of hunger.

I don’t want to write a “last” sentence. Every day we encounter our choices.

A group of friends, colleagues, and veterinarians walking their dogs before the long curfew. They are staying in Kyiv to rescue animals.

DAY 26 (MONDAY, MARCH 21): “KYIV WILL BE AS CLEAN AS BERLIN!”

A MAN WAS STARING AT ME, pale with stress. He was an elderly gentleman with a large handtied broom, and he stood next to three big bags of trash from the street. He was a neighborhood building manager I hadn’t yet met. He noticed that I wanted to take his picture. After a while he approached and asked me if I was “working for the enemy.” I showed him my passport and my press credentials and asked him why he stayed in Kyiv. Satisfied with my documents, he leaned forward, his face growing large, as if in a close-up. Then he spoke to me confidentially, but also in the tone of an official announcement: “I am proud to be here in Kyiv in these difficult days, taking care of the cleanliness of our city!” He added, “Kyiv will be as clean as Berlin, just as clean! We will achieve it.”

He told me that for some time he had lived outside of Berlin, in Bernau, “a very nice little town that has seen so much history. It was even part of the GDR. Wonderful people!” I grew curious. Every day I see people taking care of Kyiv, cleaning up and working on repairs. Next to all the bullet-ridden doors and shattered windows, I see people using plywood to cover and preserve this heap of broken shells we call a city, so that one day we can install real glass panes, doors, and shop windows again.

The building manager wanted to say more about Berlin and Bernau, about the generosity of the people there and how much they would do for others. Then two members of the Territorial Defense approached us. They asked me to show my passport and credentials again. They looked anxiously at my camera and asked me several times to be careful when I publish any pictures.

Yesterday’s shelling, which terrified me, was apparently the result of a TikTok video that had revealed the location of Ukrainian tanks. The tanks, briefly visible in the background of the video, were long gone at the time of the bombing. But the aggressor sought to strike these tanks and, in the process, reduced a huge apartment building and a large shopping mall to burnt black skeletons. The apartments in the building, with their small, private, hidden worlds, no longer exist. People were injured and some lost their lives. The numbers that account for the losses change. One counts them again and again.

Pictures can be dangerous. They can reveal things without intending to. They transform the city into a military object just by existing, even though the documentation of one’s life through photos has become a modern habit that can help us process pain, fear, and danger. While language can be deceptive, a photograph seems to capture something irrevocably and at the same time speak for itself. One wants to give an account, not with words, but with the irrefutable image.

Today I wanted to write my diary entry earlier than usual. No longer did I want to join sentences together while shivering in the corridor when it’s dark outside, so late that Russia decides: Now is the time to shell residential buildings again. Experts claim that the attacks are taking place deep into the night because of the expectation that Ukrainian air defenses will not be as sharp then, due to exhaustion. A long lockdown has been announced for tomorrow. People will not be allowed to leave their homes. Despite the impending curfew, there were a few people in the streets today.

I went to the train station with my mother to see if we could get train tickets for ourselves and our relatives. We walked through the old city that my mother had once shown me, like a story one reads to a child. The train station was not as crowded as we had expected. All the shops had closed, and the only tickets available were for the evacuation trains. Several of these tickets were standing room only, and because some of my relatives have health concerns that keep them from standing, we decided to look for tickets again later.

At the station I saw a young woman with a baby. She asked me if I knew whether there was a train to Chernivtsi, in the south, not far from the Romanian border. She was from a village outside Kyiv and hoped to find safety in Chernivtsi. She smiled, and then her face became grave: “But my mother is still in our village. She didn’t want to leave! I want to go back! I want to go home!”

My mother and I walked back down the street and tried to cheer each other up with a few jokes. Then we saw little yellow buses with red crosses heading toward us in the direction of the train station. On each bus was written “Irpin,” a place north of Kyiv where so many artists and writers once lived and where now people die every day. Russia is annihilating this small town, block by block. In the dusty bus windows we saw the gray, tired faces of old people and children, all staring somewhere far away, into the distance. We stopped and looked. I could not take a photo.

In the evening I saw that train tickets were being sold again. Without much time to consider it, I bought six tickets for Friday. My parents still don’t want to leave Kyiv. I really don’t know what we should do. But there should be enough time before Friday to decide. After all, what is happening cannot last that long. This war can and should be interrupted at last. It must stop.

At the station I saw a young woman with a baby. She asked me if I knew whether there was a train to Chernivtsi, in the south, not far from the Romanian border. She was from a village outside Kyiv and hoped to find safety in Chernivtsi. She smiled, and then her face became grave: “But my mother is still in our village. She didn’t want to leave! I want to go back! I want to go home!”

DAY 25 (SUNDAY, MARCH 20): DRONES OVER KYIV

I AM TRYING TO WRITE, but cannot start. The air-raid alarm has been going for two hours. It is echoed by the sirens, as if within one warning a second is possible.

I see on Telegram the headline “KYIV IS BURNING!” Accompanying videos show rows of blazing houses—not just a single house, but an entire apartment block on fire.

Ten minutes ago, I heard a loud explosion. Just before the explosion, I had thought that I should finally sit down to write, but first I picked up my phone to make sure my parents and friends were safe.

An hour ago, my mother called me to report that she had been watching the sky when a plane started firing at targets. We all heard gunfire; it was unclear where it was coming from. Then I read some reassuring news: Enemy drones had been successfully eliminated. But almost immediately after that, I looked out the window and saw two drones flying over our house. One stopped above the building that houses the nearby shelter. The drones flew high in the sky. They looked like they were being shot at.

My headache from the previous sleepless night had disappeared, and I felt cold, fearful, and determined (for what?). I called the police to pass on the coordinates of the drones. Then my parents and I briefly discussed whether we should go downstairs to the ground floors of our buildings. I decided to stay in my apartment, and my parents decided to stay in theirs.

All the windows are blacked out and the lights are off, as in all the apartments I can see when I peek out my window. One tries to make oneself invisible, to hide one’s house and sink into the darkness of the night, so as not to become a target. Strange images come to mind: On the top floor of my apartment building, I feel like I’m standing atop a flower with a long, thin stem. I can understand the fear and anger an insect might feel when accidentally knocked from a flower’s petals.

In the meantime, high-definition videos of the attacks are being released. You can see the night being ripped apart by white flashes that grow taller than any skyscraper and blanket our houses below. When I try to tell myself that all this is happening right now to the people in my city—to those I meet every day on the streets, to passersby, doctors, vendors, artists, teachers—and that this deadly light threatens me at night too, I feel nausea and dizziness.

I can’t close my eyes, can’t find peace. That’s what I want to describe to you. Tomorrow morning I will read this text again. If I do, it will mean that we survived the night.

I was outside for only a short time today. I said goodbye to a friend, an artist, who is leaving Kyiv tomorrow, then I met a second friend, also an artist, who has returned to Kyiv to join the Territorial Defense as a paramedic.

An acquaintance sent me a letter from Melitopol, which is occupied by the Russian army. A friend of his was searching for escape routes. He, his wife, and a child are hiding in a small apartment, and they are slowly running out of food. The Russian secret service and military are arresting residents who have repeatedly demonstrated against the occupation. Demonstrators are shot in the legs. Nobody can find a way to help Melitopol now. There is no escape, and people are being kidnapped.

A friend today used the word genocide. This word penetrated deep into my mind. I still have a hard time using it. The term is the wrong size: Like many such words, it is both a little too small and much too big, like someone else’s clothes. Still—and this surprises me—it does in part describe the situation of Ukraine.

Our apartments look peaceful, even in the midst of war. Neighborhood balconies are blanketed in colorful bedsheets, which are supposed to protect and disguise residents. This is the kind of photo I wanted to choose for today’s entry, even though it might not fit: The bedsheets are nice and innocent, and they say little about death.

Is it possible to condemn me, my city, and the people of Mariupol, Melitopol, and other cities to death, to play with us in a game of annihilation, in front of the whole world? I keep asking myself this. What happened to us all that this became possible?

I think the answer to these questions will determine the future of a great many people. My cousin, a singer who is now in Kyiv, sings a lullaby for me. The burden of these past twenty-five days is great enough. This war is destroying everything that has been achieved since the nightmare of World War II. Putin and his unlawful armies must be stopped.

The apartments in Kyiv look peaceful, even in the midst of or some such war. Neighborhood balconies are blanketed in colorful bedsheets, which are supposed to protect and disguise residents.

DAY 24 (SATURDAY, MARCH 19): DECEPTIVE ILLUSION

TODAY AN OLD COUPLE made their way through the wreckage on Sich Riflemen’s Road. They walked shakily past shards of broken glass and heaps of rubble.

The man, speaking to his wife, reproached an invisible enemy: “Look how many windows, how much glass has been smashed! Jesus. They haven’t thought about the fact that they’ll have to clean this up. All this chaos just to say, ‘The Russians did it to us!’” The man spoke desperately and with an honest sadness. The woman nodded and sighed.

This elderly pair, who have lived their lives amid undying declarations of love between Russians and Ukrainians, two brotherly peoples, did not want to believe that fratricide was in full swing. Apparently, they thought Ukraine was just staging the destruction, and that the war would spare the nations’ true love for each other, like untouched nature. They walked straight past me. I didn’t approach them; their whole world was in a state of ruin.

On the ground, pigeons pecked at breadcrumbs among the shards of glass. Despite the damage, a woman had come to the marketplace, as she does every day, to feed the birds. It was sunny and awfully quiet, the streets felt free, and there was a deceptive illusion that a long walk was safe. In recent days, not two hours have passed without the sirens howling, but since 1:00 p.m., they had been turned off.

In truth, caution and fear are in the air. People discuss the safest spots of apartments—where to sleep and where, under any circumstances, not to. These thoughts infect my own. Lately, I have been sleeping in my small study until the sirens start wailing between four and five in the morning, at which point I move to the corridor, where I have spread blankets out on the floor. I try to fall asleep again on this colder and harder foundation, which is a poor substitute for a mattress. The shelter where I spent the first nights of the war is overcrowded, and one can hardly find any room.

I was already asleep in the corridor when my mother woke me. “Something is burning. Can’t you smell it?” she asked in the low voice that she reserves for real danger.

With an uneasy feeling, I went to the window and saw white smoke drifting down the street. An acrid smell came through the window. I checked the news and there was none. The curfew was still in place and both of us, my mother and I, decided to go back to sleep. Half awake, I thought how good it was to be in the corridor, protected. Then I woke to the first news: a garbage dump outside Kyiv was burning and the wind was carrying the smoke into the city; a village had been attacked too—Novi Petrivtsi—but without apparent success.

Nobody was murdered, nobody died as a result of this smoke! So perhaps this mini-ecological crisis was a stroke of luck. Maybe the aggressor had wanted to fire on residential buildings but hit a pile of garbage instead.

Most of the shelling takes place in the morning between four and six. Upon waking again, Kyiv could almost be characterized as calm, lacking any dire concern. And yet anxiety grows with each day of war. Behind anything that used to be only a minor breach of normality, and provoked almost no thought—dusty or smoky air, a loud knock in the distance—now lies danger. Even a day without disturbance cannot be trusted. You assume the break in attacks is preparation for something worse.

At sunset, during the last rays of light, I met Lisa not far from my house. She is a designer, and she told me she feels safe in Kyiv currently. A flower store was giving away bouquets, and she carried two with her. She was planning to give one to someone else. On her phone, she pulled up a video of her town, Ochtyrka, in northeastern Ukraine, which has ceaselessly been in the news. Her father, a member of the Territorial Defense, is still there. At the start of the war, Lisa feared for his life and could not sleep, but now that Ochtyrka has been almost entirely destroyed, she told me she is strangely confident he will be fine. He has been saved repeatedly by coincidences and miracles, she said.

In the video, all I saw was scorched earth, burnt walls, and piles of black metal. “This was the center of our city,” Lisa explained in a calm voice. “This was our municipal administration, this was the arts and culture center, here was the school I attended.”

In the evening I met Lisa, a designer. A flower shop was giving away bouquets; Lisa had taken two and wanted to give one to somebody.

DAY 23 (FRIDAY, MARCH 18): THE PICTURE OF THE MAN WITH THE CAT

THURSDAY PASSED QUICKLY, but I want to say something about it, even though I didn’t write anything then.

The air-raid alarm has just ended, so I have some time to concentrate and think about yesterday. Something important did in fact happen. I write for fifteen minutes, but the sirens with their threatening tone begin to howl again. So I have at least another twenty minutes, maybe even an hour, until I know if I am really in danger. This way I have the time to finish writing another section.

On the Internet and Telegram I look at photos of burning houses in Kyiv. I saved these pictures so as not to forget them, but I can’t even remember what day they are from—this morning, yesterday, or the day before yesterday.

It occurs to me that this morning I saw a photo of a man with old professor’s glasses standing in front of a multistory house. He wore a jacket that looked a little too big for him, and his face had a puzzled expression, although he did not appear sad. And yet with a desperate gesture, he pressed a beautiful long-haired cat to his chest. The cat clung to him, and in its look I read shock. Its nose was injured and bleeding. The man had saved the cat, and they both had survived.

A resident of a high-rise building in Podil died in an attack. Nineteen were injured, including four children. All this happened early in the morning. The man with professor glasses lost his home. He ran out of the burning apartment with his cat, but without a bag.

I remembered the couple I had met in the neighborhood a few days ago, the older people with the two small dogs. They were both eighty-five years old and had said, “We left our house as you see us now—without possessions. There was nothing we could take with us.”

Different scenes from Telegram channels race through my head. I wish I could concentrate, but instead a number pops into my head: 222. That’s how many people are said to have died in Kyiv since the war began. Among them, four children. Many more have been injured. I can’t do anything with this number. It is new and surprising. It includes not only civilians, but also members of the Territorial Defense in our city.

Yesterday was the second day of the Jewish holiday Purim. I went to Podil to pick something up from the post office, and I decided on my way back that I would visit the synagogue where my friends were celebrating.

To reach this old Kyiv district I went down Andriyivskyy Descent, a tourist street on which the writer and satirist Mikhail Bulgakov once lived and his museum now stands. The descent, in normal times one of the most popular streets in Kyiv, was absolutely deserted at noon. I noticed that in the midst of this desolation two cafes were open. I entered one of them, ordered an espresso, and learned that the owners were giving out free coffee to everyone. They wanted to reopen the cafe “so that the people of Kyiv could feel that peace is here after all and will soon return fully and irrevocably,” as one employee explained.

There was a line in front of the post office. My package, an order of various chargers, had not arrived. I looked around with the vague desire to buy something after all. There were a couple of options, but nothing really suited me. The air-raid alert started blaring. I wanted to stay a little longer with the other people in the store and noticed that I was not the only one ambling from shelf to shelf with searching, disappointed glances. It was more pleasant to stay together in this small space than to walk home alone through the bare and sunny streets.

Reluctantly, I made my way to the synagogue. Once there, I found a small group of revelers in a prayer room in the back. They were following the commandment that one must be so drunk on this day that one cannot tell a criminal from a saint. One member of the congregation is visually impaired and had been accompanied by his friend to the synagogue every day so that he could participate in prayer. My good friend, an artist, joined in the celebration. Everyone embraced several times, and someone even tried to run riot. But it was only a game.

My way home took me along the Andriyivskyy Descent again, since all other paths seemed unsafe.

On the way back I had the idea of photographing the most unspeakably banal views of Kyiv, replicating the photos that tourists always take when visiting the city for the first time. Following this idea, I came to the sculpture park, where a few parents with their children were walking among the dog owners. I was going to take a landscape photo, until suddenly I noticed purple-gray smoke drifting across the sky.

I couldn’t hear the impact! Was it just a cloud? But then other walkers came up to me with worried faces and said, “Did you see that? It was a rocket! Where did it fall? Was anyone injured, or were any houses hit? Let’s watch the news!” But the news provided nothing. For several days now, the media has not reported the damage immediately after impact, lest the aggressor correct his targets and fire again.

Angry and terrified, I stood there watching the smoke. I felt something else that I can’t even describe. What was happening in front of my eyes at that moment was a crime. The fire was so strong that the cloud of smoke continued to expand. I wanted to do something about this crime, though I couldn’t figure out what. But I knew action was necessary, and everything else could wait.

The walkers called for their children and quickly left. I went home, wanting to write a diary entry, but felt a great exhaustion that I couldn’t fight. I fell asleep without having written a word.

DAY 22 (THURSDAY, MARCH 17)

There is no entry for today.

DAY 21 (WEDNESDAY, MARCH 16): TACTICAL RETREAT

ONE DOES NOT SPEAK to a ruin. One contemplates it, holds it in their mind. It is war’s silent witness in the middle of the city. Looking at a ruin gives the observer a certain distance from events.

What does this distance mean? It is in no way an emotional distance, but a detachment that gives strength and the feeling that you can control how close the war comes to you. As a giant trace of an inhuman force, a ruin devours everything human that makes up the street you’re standing on.

I keep thinking about what it means to observe the consequences of the bombardment in the city. It is something of a construction site—one that is not built, but dismantled.

In front of the ruins yesterday, among shattered glass, deformed scraps of metal, and pieces of the roof, I met a woman: an elderly lady who was looking for cigarettes. The kiosk where she bought them every day was so badly damaged that all the glass covering the windows and doors had been blown out. The salesmen themselves were no longer around; the cigarettes lay unprotected in the shop window. The lady was asking everyone where to get a pack nearby. I suggested she leave the money in the shop window and take the pack, as a kind of self-service. Then I asked her why she decided to stay in Kyiv during these uncertain times.

She told me that her mother, who turned 100 three months ago, died this past week. In the war’s early days, it was unimaginable that she and her husband would leave the city. Now she was simply here. Maybe she would stay. Her eyes were shining; she even looked a little happy.

She was a mathematician, a scientist who came to Kyiv from Murmansk as a child. With many quips, she told me the tangled story of her family, saved time and again from war, hunger, and Stalin’s repressions. She spoke melodically and with a delicate touch, as if the words of the narrative had bound themselves together beforehand, only wanting for a listener. Despite her age, there was something young about her face, and she moved quickly and gracefully among the stones and splinters. Our conversation didn’t last long, but I keep thinking back to it. Sometimes in war you have the feeling that you don't want to lose other people, even after fleeting encounters. And now that I’ve described that meeting, I feel I did something to hold onto it.

On an otherwise empty street, a family takes a walk just before curfew.

The air-raid alarm doesn’t sound for the moment. We are safe. During the curfew, authorities recommend darkening the windows and turning on the lights as sparingly as possible. The streets are empty, and the houses look abandoned. It is a relief to think that at least these houses are not in danger right now as they try with all their might to mask the lives of their inhabitants, to make them invisible.

Urban life makes a tactical retreat during the lockdown, all the while hoping to return again tomorrow, when the street will be seen as a street rather than a source of danger.

Mariupol is undergoing something quite different. About 1,000 people whose houses had been destroyed found refuge in the Donetsk Regional Theater of Drama, a large building in the city center. In satellite images, you can see that next to the theater, the Russian word for “children” was written twice in chalk in capital letters. Perhaps this word was written on the ground at risk of death, in the hope that it would provide protection from the bombs and shelling.

The word looks like a warning, a dialogue with someone who could never imagine attacking such a place. A Kyiv friend of my mother’s who had worked as a theater director with Russian colleagues still insists that Russia is attacking only military infrastructure. When my mother objects, “But the apartment buildings are damaged,” he replies, “That was a mistake, and believe me, they will punish the responsible parties!”

When I read the word “children” in these photos, I can understand the belief that the unimaginable would never happen, even when the war has already become so ghastly.

Today the theater was bombed; we are talking about what has been called a “high-performance bomb.” What does that mean? It means that the building no longer exists. At the time of writing, because of the constant shelling, relief workers cannot approach the site to try to comb through the rubble for survivors.

I am safe; the air-raid alarm is silent, and theoretically one could even go to sleep. Tomorrow is the beginning of another day. New events will come, and tomorrow we will speak of them and contemplate them instead of the theater in Mariupol. I can’t imagine it. The days of the war should not draw to a close just like any other days in life. Someone has given this war permission. The world has deliberated, doubted, and still allowed it. It may be too late, but the sky over Mariupol must be closed at once!

The next morning I learn that rescue workers were able to reach the rubble of the theater after all. From the bunker underneath the theater, survivors are climbing out.

DAY 20 (TUESDAY, MARCH 15): IN WAR, ONE THINKS ALMOST ONLY OF WAR

THE PEOPLE OF KYIV are returning. It is hard to believe, but it is so. A friend reported to me, “In our house, all the residents are back, in the evening there is a light in every window.”

I notice it myself. The street where I live is full of young faces, even though houses were shelled not far away yesterday. A kiosk with coffee and cake is open and, in front of the window, a small line has formed.

Many people are walking their dogs through the city, as if such walks are becoming normal again. It is sunny and warm; the cold wind subsided, and everyone is trying to savor their time before the curfew begins. Once again, a long lockdown has been announced for Kyiv, and no one will be able to leave their homes other than to go to a shelter.

I watched a video statement from an advisor to Volodymyr Zelensky, who usually delivers good news. He said Ukraine was winning the war, by and large, simply because Russia’s attempt to divide the country, attack civil society, and seize major cities has failed. The sanctions have had a strong effect, but we still need some time to win militarily. Until then, unfortunately, Russian missiles could still hit some residential buildings—an intentional strategy, he said. Other experts apparently have expressed similar views elsewhere, giving shape to a new reality.

In Mariupol, according to media reports, a hospital was captured by a Russian task force. The doctors are currently unable to leave; they are locked in its basement along with four hundred residents from neighboring houses—all brought there by Russian soldiers. Many buildings around the hospital have been destroyed and fighting continues in the streets.

This casts a shadow on the news that I was so hoping for: today, 20,000 people from Mariupol are finally able to leave the city through a humanitarian corridor. This is what the relatives, friends, and loved ones of these people have been waiting on for weeks, watching with shudders the battle for Mariupol. Many people have now been freed from a place where life no longer seems possible—and yet, it seems, there are still some who stay. Some because they are trapped in occupied hospitals, others because of family reasons, or life’s general obligations.

An acquaintance of mine, a Ukrainian art scholar, fled from Irpin to Kyiv and on to Vinnytsia in central Ukraine. From there, she has written impeccably on Facebook about her grandmother, who lives in a beautiful little house in Irpin with a well-tended flower garden. I assumed she too had fled to Kyiv by now, and I wanted to inquire about her wellbeing and ask if she needed any help. I learned that she absolutely refused to leave her house in Irpin. She can’t imagine living anywhere else. My acquaintance tries to call her several times a day, but the number remains unreachable.

Is the celebratory mood in Kyiv today related to the humanitarian corridors that are finally open? Or is it the reassuring, almost hopeful thoughts about the outcome of the war expressed by these many experts?

A passerby in front of one of the buildings destroyed yesterday in the city center.



The number of victims is already so high that it is difficult to comprehend. Again and again, I hear the air defense over Kyiv catching Russian shells mid-flight, thundering and popping. In war, one thinks almost only of war. The concepts of big politics—abstract discussions about the “theater of war,” about what belongs to “the West” and what to Russia and Ukraine—serve as mental refuges within war’s own intolerability. One recovers in the space of analytical thought, a space where these lofty, immaterial questions are discussed, where it is no longer about concrete human lives, but about states whose strategies are often described as self-destiny, manifestations of their national traits.

Before curfew, I wanted to see the subway station that was shelled last night. I had to pass through checkpoints and take detours to get a glimpse of the wreckage. Shards of glass lay in a shockingly large radius around the station. A roof had caved in, plastic doors were deformed by the blast wave; hundreds of broken windows stared blackly into the street. A circle of silence formed around this place, where several houses and dozens of smaller stores were damaged in one fell swoop.

The ruins formed an eerie scene. I saw some women standing in front of the damaged buildings for several minutes, looking at the destroyed section of the street, as if they wanted to memorize every crack, every broken windowpane, forever.

DAY 19 (MONDAY, MARCH 14): ROCKETS OVER KYIV

IT IS AN ENDLESSLY LONG day. Sirens are constantly howling. By now, the residents of Kyiv have gotten used to the fact that the city is comparatively safe, at least for the moment. Even people from outside the city have fled here. Families from Irpin, from Bucha, from Vorsel come to Kyiv. In some villages there has been no food or water since the beginning of the war.

It’s a risky escape. Some families and groups of refugees have to walk long distances to reach safety. In some areas that are perpetually under fire, electricity has been down since the second day of the war. I heard from some acquaintances that a couple with five children were due to reach Kyiv yesterday. They had been on the road for days—not drinking fresh water, but thawing snow since February 25. Now, they could not be reached by phone.

This morning I talked with Sophia about fear. Sophia is eighteen years old. She’s a medical student and helps as a paramedic in the volunteer army. She is scared, she said, but still she is ready to go to war.

Sophia, a medical student, helps as a paramedic in the volunteer army.

The gunfire grew louder and more threatening, but next to Sophia I felt strangely safe—as if her military uniform were a guarantee that nothing would happen to us. Her father, a businessman from the central Ukrainian town of Kropivnytski, where the airport was shelled the day before yesterday, was sent to the front in 2014. For this family, war, or even the idea of war, did not exist until eight years ago. But since that year, both daughter and father live with the thought of having to defend their country.

Sophia said this war was inevitable. “I’ve said it over and over again. Even four years ago I was sure we had to prepare for it.” I agreed with her, thinking how wise that would have been then. But I had also long believed the opposite, convinced that such a war was impossible. As we talked, I forgot that Sophia would have been fourteen when she began to mentally prepare herself for war. Her father was always at the front, so she could not stop seeing the reality of war. As recently as last summer, she herself had been to the Donbas, to the heavily shelled Avdiivka, a town north of Donetsk. She was there with the Ukrainian Hospitallers Medical Battalion.

“I remembered my father calling from Kyiv at that time. In a quiet voice he told me, ‘Two more of our soldiers were killed in the Donbas yesterday, and another house was shelled.’” That was always on Sophia’s mind. And yet, when I talked to her, I thought she was far away from the actual war. She laughed and joked around, her expression only turning serious again with the sound of gunfire and artillery.

“When I was in Avdiivka,” she recounted, “it was relatively quiet. I was lucky and was able to learn a lot in the hospital. Only two of our soldiers were injured when I was there. But then came darker times.” She paused. “Wait a second! I can’t hear the air defense, that means targets in Kyiv might have been hit!” We had to interrupt the conversation. On the way back home I read the news.

A missile had hit a high-rise building. Seventy people were evacuated, ten injured. One person was killed. At about the same time, a bus carrying refugees from the eastern Ukrainian town of Izium was shelled. No one knows if there are any survivors. This all happened in the morning hours when representatives of the Ukrainian government were negotiating with Russia.

I think that the attack on Kyiv was a signal, a sign that no one in Ukraine can go to sleep thinking that they are safe in their house or apartment. The rockets breach the walls of the houses like the skin of the body. The whole idea of a house, of shelter and protection, seems to be in question for our city right now.

When I write about the attacks and the violence, I use the word “war,” but it hardly describes the terror, the targeted murder of the defenseless. “War” does not cover the merciless attacks against homes and buses carrying refugees. Official, internationally reported figures say that 2,357 people were killed in Mariupol, and in Kharkiv 600 residential houses were destroyed.

I wrote this text before falling asleep. Today, at five o'clock in the morning, my house shook with a strong explosion. I woke up with the feeling of cold spreading in my stomach. From the window I checked to see that everything was fine with the neighboring houses, as well as with my parents’ house. I thought about leaving, about the fact that at last I should make a plan to leave Kyiv.

How can the world put an end to this crime? It is not only a war, but also a continuous terrorist attack. And it looks like these crimes which subjugate and colonize the Ukrainian people are meant not only to intimidate us, but to terrify the whole world. Despair and fear help to make this terror possible.

DAY 18 (SUNDAY, MARCH 13): AN UNEXPECTED GIFT

WHEN DUSK COMES, I turn on as many lights as possible in the room in my apartment where I read. At this time of day, it is not yet dangerous to have lights on in the apartment. It is still somewhat bright outside, so the contrast with any light coming from my windows is not too extreme. I can only light my room this extremely for thirty or forty minutes—then comes the evening, which I spend in near-darkness.

Today, I want to write about two meetings. I went back to the street in Kyiv where I used to live for several years. With amazement I saw that welcoming lights were shining in a cozy cafe, which, like most cafes in the city, had been closed since the beginning of the war. I went inside and ordered a cappuccino, a drink I keep trying to find since the war started and, if successful, enjoy in a new way each time

It is a game I play with myself. Every day I wonder if a coffee kiosk will be open on my route. When I get a cup, I’m immensely happy, as if I’ve received an unexpected gift.

The coffeehouse was open because an employee who had quit before the war offered to come back and work alone. This former employee’s name is Aleksej. It was his birthday today, but he did not celebrate. He said to me, “I wanted to do something, anything, so I thought it over and decided that the best thing to do was to open the cafe.

He has nowhere else to go, he said, because he fled Luhansk Oblast after the Donbas war in 2014. He does not want to leave Kyiv now. He keeps thinking about his parents and sister, whom he hasn’t seen for years and who live somewhere near Luhansk in the occupied territories.

When I ask about his birthday, Aleksej says, “Everything has lost its former meaning. I only remembered yesterday that today is my birthday. Besides, it’s Sunday.” I said that maybe tomorrow, Monday, there would be more visitors to the cafe. Then we both had to laugh because it no longer makes any difference whether it is Sunday, Monday, or Friday. The breaks in the rhythm of life are determined differently during wartime and come without warning.

In town I met a couple, both eighty-five years old, and their two dogs. Alongside four of their relatives, who are also refugees, they are staying with their young grandchildren in a small apartment in Kyiv.

Then I met a couple with two small dogs. The woman’s name was the same as mine, Yevgenia. At first, they claimed to have escaped from Chernihiv. In reality, they went on to say, they escaped from a village on the left bank of the Dnieper, in Kyiv Oblast. They later said that they had not named their real town out of the caution demanded by the times.

Although their dogs couldn’t stand the rockets and explosions, they had stayed at home until the very last moment—and only then fled to Kyiv.

They are both eighty-five years old, and alongside four relatives, are refugees. They are all staying with their young grandchildren in a small apartment in Kyiv. They could not imagine going any farther away from their village than this, the two said.

The man looked at me. He asked, “Do you at least have a place to live here?” I just nodded, I could hardly pronounce the “yes.”

DAY 17 (SATURDAY, MARCH 12): TOO TIRED FOR THE SHELTER

IT WAS A SLEEPLESS NIGHT. The air-raid alarm, sounding its sirens over the city, kept me up all night. But I was too tired to go to the shelter. I heard explosions and hoped that no one was injured. Then I tried to find out what was going on, but on Telegram there were only reports from other places. They concerned the blockades that Russian units are forming around these cities, and the residents who spend day and night in the nightmare of a siege.

My plan for the day was to pick up my bulletproof vest, which had finally been delivered. Then I would visit a lady who, as a sort of concierge, watches over a house in the neighborhood and keeps an eye on the comings and goings. There are many such concierges in the city, but since the beginning of the war this lady has taken on an additional task—she must make sure that nothing is stolen from the abandoned apartments. Her name had a comforting ring to it that reminded me of childhood: Dussia.

Tonight, like every other other night, I was overcome with fear. The sirens with their long and melancholy trumpet notes made me uneasy. I imagined armed strangers invading Kyiv, bringing silence to every street and every house and every feature of this city, until everything vanishes. Again and again I told myself, it’s just a brief panic attack, it will be over soon.

When I called Dussia for the first time, I could sense in her voice both tenderness and restlessness. One of the residents from her building who had escaped had asked me to check in on her, which made her happy. Because she is alone, no one can relieve her of her watch. She also lives in the building where she works. She thought that I sounded suspicious at first, so she wanted to stay on the phone a while to convince herself that she could trust me—she is even afraid to go shopping.

I visited her in her small concierge room on the first floor. There was only space for a table and a sofa. The TV was on. She said, “So many people are escaping Kyiv, but I have nowhere to go. My relatives live outside Chernihiv and you know what happened there. Where should I go? Where can I go?”

In her face I saw helplessness, but she had made her decision to stay put. Fifteen families remained in the large apartment block she was looking after, and they wanted someone to rely on. I tried to lighten the mood with some not entirely clever jokes. I was happy that she smiled at me, and I decided to visit her again soon.

In the evening, a friend’s message arrived. She wrote that a group of women and children had tried to escape on foot today from an occupied village outside Kyiv. The village had a name from Soviet times: “Victory.” The group was fired on as they left the village. Seven women and one child died. My friend said that she understands why Ukrainians use the word “genocide” when describing this war. I don’t know if it is the right word to use. I just read this message again and again.

New work by the artist Nikita Kadan, who is still in Kyiv.

From time to time I look at the comments that readers post online about this diary, and I often see similar arguments. I recognize these sentences from analytical articles, where “experts,” who for years played the role of opponents to the Russian regime, express their allegedly independent opinions that just happen to always be the same: The Russian regime is inhumane and murderous, but also very dangerous and unpredictable. We cannot imagine what this ghastly person will do to the world if he loses the war in Ukraine. If he wins, however, then the world will gain a little time to prepare and to consider how to better understand the situation.

This kind of reasoning teaches the world that if you barely interfere then the suffering will not spread too widely. Fear continues to sell, with no sanctions imposed on it.

We are now living through the consequences of this thinking, which, like all the great crimes of the world, is spread in many languages by a thousand different voices. It is a question not only of history and suffering, which can be repeated over and over again, but also the habit of making sacrifices and satisfying monsters or perpetrators of violence.

And so, this monster flexes his strength by attacking women and children who leave “Victory” on foot and cannot protect themselves against his heavy weapons.

DAY 16 (FRIDAY, MARCH 11): MUSIC

THE WINDOWS IN MY LITTLE ROOM are darkened with duvet covers. There is a light on and it’s reasonably comfortable. An app on my phone announces “the air-raid alarm is over” in a woman’s voice. It’s one of those moments when I think I’ve discovered something fundamental: I understand what photography is for. I’ve occupied myself with photography for a long time, but I have never understood it as practically as I do now.

Only with the help of photos and pictures can I remember the course of today’s walk. In the daily life of war, only something like photography—unfamiliar, auxiliary, almost mechanical—is capable of holding together sequences and memories.

When I went for a walk, my thoughts were still on the morning news and I hardly paid attention to the street. With a deep sadness, I had to admit to myself the possibility that we might eventually be forced to leave Kyiv. I’d known all along it might come to that, of course, but today the possibility really struck me again.

Then I thought, at least I’m still in Kyiv for now, I must cherish every minute and look around—to see the city, the streets, the people. That was somewhat naive, however, and I quickly sank back into my thoughts, hardly noticing what was going on around me.

The soldiers of the Territorial Defense were warming their hands. I saw the beautiful faces of two young women who laughingly told me that they belonged to the “Volunteer Army of Ukraine.” They gave me their phone numbers. What that meant was: Maybe we will meet again.

To my surprise, a little later I heard music. I was walking through the sculpture park, along Landscape Avenue. From a distance I heard drums, a melodic whistling, and bells. The music came from the hills. I listened very carefully as the playing got a little louder with every step. Then I saw a small group of men and women playing musical instruments in the distance. What a combination of different fragments, tones, and pauses. I listened, enchanted. They approached me, passing me by with friendly glances. I was so impressed by having seen and heard these musicians that I cannot remember what happened afterwards.

But thanks to the photographs, which I continue to try to take, another important scene comes to mind. The municipal workers of Kyiv were out in the city, using spray paint to cover over tourist maps of the city center, which can be seen on boards all around that area. The workers were accompanied by armed members of the Territorial Defense. I was allowed to take photos on the condition that no face could be recognized in the images.

Now my memory jumps to another episode that has something to do with music: On March 8, International Women’s Day, I went to the pharmacy with my mother. On the way, we met an elderly woman carrying a rose. My mother approached her. They chatted and exchanged contact information so they cold help each other in case of emergency.

Then the woman began to recite a poem she had written in Russian during the war. It was about dictatorship, about war, and at the end there was a promise that this absolute senselessness, this evil, could never win. The woman wore a headscarf, looking modest, but the melody of her verses sounded musical and to the point.

The boards with tourist maps were painted over so that the saboteurs, who are constantly trying to enter Kyiv and other cities, will not be able to use the maps for orientation. Rumor has it that they often do not have smartphones and get lost in the settlements and streets.

Today’s news was excruciating. I think of the songs the people sing here anyway, I think of the music.

The air-raid alert sounds again. I wait and I hope that the sky will soon be closed.

A municipal worker uses spray paint to cover over tourist maps in Kyiv. The aim is to make it more difficult for Russian saboteurs to navigate the city.

DAY 15 (THURSDAY, MARCH 10): ILLUSIONS

IN A DIARY, a day feels like a self-contained unit. An entry feeds the illusion that conclusions can be drawn—the illusion of a logical narrative.

This war has many such illusions. For example, it had a preface that preceded the actual attacks: Russian divisions massed at the border of Ukraine, politicians spoke of war, diplomats left the country. The war followed after this prediction, like a play whose plot is told in a preamble, or like a fulfilled prophecy.

I am still struggling to understand what happens when you learn in advance that a war is coming, a war whose cycle will terrorize peaceful cities with bombs and murder thousands of people. Today, the news in Ukraine said that civilian casualties are much higher than military casualties.

I suspect that, before the war started, even the politicians who predicted it did not believe it would happen and kept hoping that it could be avoided. Otherwise, the world would have done everything—or much more than “everything”—to prevent this abyss. The war was unrealistic, absurd; it could not be imagined. And when you wake up in the midst of war, it remains the same: still unimaginable.

At the political level, the unimaginable was compounded by the fear of a huge phantom—a phantom that a corrupted and aggressive dictatorship had spent years building with propaganda. This phantom even managed to convince itself, assuring itself that it was powerful enough to take Ukraine in just a few days with a blitzkrieg. It would be like a vacation for the soldiers. They would be greeted with flowers. A quick victory was certain.

Fear tied our hands and caution seemed the wisest option. Everyone waited until the catastrophe really began. Now, in Kyiv, and together with the whole world, I have to watch as houses, lives, and memories disappear in a huge fire.

And still, in the midst of war, in the midst of senseless dying, injuries, suffering, and losses, more crimes are predicted. Russia comes forward almost daily with old and new demands, which are always based on territorial claims. A new preface is being written into the war narrative once again. If its demands for more territories are rejected, Russia will announce even more war, even more death.

As I write, a friend calls to say that her mother, who still lives in Kharkiv, was out on the balcony when she spotted a man speaking in Russian. He was relaying the coordinates for a bombing on the street outside her house. He was apparently a “navodchik,” an antiquated word from another era, meaning a “gunner”—someone who decides where the next strike should be, someone who helps shell peaceful districts. The distribution of food was supposed to happen next to her house. Perhaps that is why the navodchik chose this spot.

The father of another friend stayed in Kharkiv because the employees of his small company could not escape the city. He wanted to help people on the ground. For days he survived the rocket and mortar attacks unharmed. But now my friend is trying to find psychological help for him, in this city under fire. Her father can no longer understand where he is or what is happening around him.

In Kharkiv, during the first days of the war, the animals in a small private zoo were injured. The zoo staff stayed in the city to care for them. Today, some of the staff were deliberately shot at on their way home from the zoo. Some were injured. Some died.

An acquaintance of mine spent twelve days in her basement in a small town outside Kyiv—without light, almost without food. She was rescued today.

I myself was detained today by an elderly couple on the street in Kyiv. They noticed that I was taking photos and suspected that I might be spying for Russia. They took me to a checkpoint in the hope that I would be disarmed. And all I wanted to do was take a hopeful photo of the city. I wanted to show that food delivery services were operating again, bringing food to elderly and sick people. The few remaining employees walk around the city to make deliveries! This means that those who need help but cannot shop for themselves will have a little more security and care.

A food delivery man brings meals to elderly and sick people. The few remaining employees walk around the city to make deliveries.

DAY 14 (THURSDAY, MARCH 10): A FLAW IN THE LANDSCAPE

TODAY I WALKED—finally with almost no fear—along Landscape Avenue, one of the most beautiful and busy streets in Kyiv. It is an avenue with a magnificent view of the left bank of the Dnieper River and the city’s residential districts. This avenue is also called Sculpture Park. It runs past old Kyiv houses and down to the History Museum. Since the beginning of the war, this avenue has been almost completely deserted on most days. It has seemingly become too anxiety-inducing because of how open and unprotected it is.

Nowadays, it is visited by those who stayed in Kyiv and live nearby or walk their dogs there. Although there are very few pedestrians, it is no longer completely empty, like it was at the start of the war.

The sirens announced an air raid, but I stopped anyway and enjoyed the view. Then I noticed a large white cloud of smoke in the distance. Something was burning somewhere. I searched on Telegram, but found no clue as to what it could be.

The landscape looked dreamy, and only that distant sign of fire indicated a flaw in it. Then I heard a sobbing male voice approaching me.

A man who seemed homeless was walking down the avenue with an old backpack. He had wrapped plastic bags around his shoes to warm his feet. In his hand, he carried a small, half-drunk vodka bottle. As he walked, he spoke very loudly into his cell phone, repeatedly asking how someone was doing. With each answer, he broke into sobs, like a child, over and over again. I understood through fragments that he was talking about an evacuation. I caught up with him and slipped him some money, which he accepted without interrupting the conversation.

Wherever I go, I see mostly polite, caring, calm faces. Grocery store employees, volunteers, soldiers, and members of the Territorial Defense. I also meet exhausted, sad people, especially doctors. But this was the first time I’d seen someone crying since the beginning of the war. At least, that’s how it felt to me at that moment.

I read on Telegram that some residents of the embattled city of Chernihiv fled on foot. Maybe acquaintances or friends of his were among them? They evacuated without waiting for transport and then they were shot at outside the city. Some of them were killed. In Mariupol, a children’s hospital and a maternity clinic were destroyed by an air strike. People in Mariupol still don’t have electricity, water, food, and medicine, and many have died because of the attacks. Such events from today stand dimly in front of the doors of my memory.

The sky over Kyiv.

I went to the city center, where a small outdoor concert was taking place. I still heard the loud sobbing of the homeless man in my ears. Here in Kyiv, I thought, you get used to watching the unending days of war with tearless eyes—trying to do something every hour, every minute, to organize something, to help someone. For example, a small store next to my house, where bread and eggs are sold almost every day, remains open now only because an employee decided to spend the nights there.

A doctor told me today that she came to work on February 24 and has not gone home since. For the Kyiv residents who continue to stand at grocery store checkouts or care for the sick, driving to work has become too risky and unsafe. Whatever is still functioning in this city of three million people is only there because someone doesn’t sleep in their own bed for days on end and is helping others almost around the clock.

DAY 13 (TUESDAY, MARCH 8): “THE NIGHT IS STILL YOUNG”

WHEN I ENTERED TODAY’S DATE into my Word document, it looked suspicious and unnatural. Time goes on—one day after another, the sequence is assured, after brightness comes the night. At the same time, almost everything that happens is contrary to the state of living—I don’t want to say, “contrary to normality.” I search for a more appropriate word but cannot find it. The word should describe a total destruction, but at the same time keep open the possibility that much can still be saved.

Today I gave an interview to a journalist. I was a little late, but then we talked. Some questions were uncomfortable, but I couldn’t stop answering them. The journalist said to me: “When I hear you, everything around you seems to be functioning normally, you talk about the people in the streets . . . How do you even realize that the war is really there?”

The question tormented me. As I searched for an answer, I felt how I began to justify myself, how I tried to prove the catastrophe by describing the war—as if there could still be a doubt that the war is happening. But you can hardly describe the catastrophe at this scale; all you can do is stop it. It is the only thing you can do with it.

When I tell the people I meet that I am writing a public diary, most of them say to me, “The world has to help us close the sky over Ukraine. Can you pass this on?”

With my own eyes, I see the masked faces of Russian pilots who were lucky enough to survive their planes being shot down and were then arrested. There were video clips on Telegram of parts of their interrogation. They said, “We don’t know who we drop the bombs on, we just get the coordinates for the air strikes and then we follow the orders.”

A friend who was evacuated from a small town outside Kyiv told me that peaceful people are being taken prisoner in the parts of the city controlled by Putin’s army. The Russian army breaks into private homes and takes entire families away. How often does this happen? How many have already been captured in this barbaric way? Where are these people now?

The occupied neighborhoods, villages, and small towns are often the least visible. They sink in the deluge of news. Rarely is there electricity anymore, and so it is hard to keep in contact with these areas. Other voices report other plights and are heard much louder. And you want to listen to them because they are easier to hear, because you can help immediately—or at least hope to help.

Putin demands recognition of the occupied territories in Donbas and Luhansk Oblast. All the villages and towns that are left to his power will be silenced by the occupiers. Even under the circumstances of terror that Ukraine is experiencing right now, it is unimaginable to allow this further swallowing of villages and towns.

For International Women’s Day, someone gave flowers to women waiting in line at the pharmacy. This city lives on.

When I left my apartment today, I saw an empty street. No cars, no pedestrians. At such moments, Kyiv seems like a city that has yet to be inhabited—a city without a present, with only a past and a future. A few steps further along, I saw two pedestrians, both holding flowers in their hands. This is one tradition that has broken through the cold wall of war: On March 8, International Women’s Day, women are given flowers. Outside the pharmacy, I spotted many women with flowers, prepared for a long wait in the cold. A car had stopped at the pharmacy, and someone had gotten out and handed flowers to those in line.

This big city lives on. Somewhere there are still flowers. In the closed restaurants, food is being cooked for the defense of Kyiv. The elderly ladies and gentlemen who were actors in a theater group for seniors stay together. A few years ago, my mother took over as the director of this self-organized theater group, which is called “The Night is Still Young.”

Now these senior actors and actresses help with the territorial defense of Kyiv. They don’t want to leave the city. I must add that these talented people know hundreds of poems by heart and sing beautifully. They sometimes also write the scripts for their productions—even if some of them find it difficult to step onto the stage. Now they don’t just want to help; they want to join the Territorial Defense. I try to imagine this and suddenly think: With such defenders, nothing can happen to this city.

DAY 12 (MONDAY, MARCH 7): A WAY OF LIFE THAT SWALLOWS EVERYTHING

I’M HAVING A HARD TIME concentrating today and getting an overview of what’s happening. The war is ongoing and I am somewhere in the midst of the events that are developing chaotically around me. Peacetime seems far away. New laws and a new reality are unfolding.

I receive a utility bill for my Kyiv apartment. It is accompanied by a Telegram message that sounds like an apology: “We are writing to you with a request. If your financial means allow under the circumstances, please pay the utilities. Many Kyiv utility workers joined the Ukrainian army and are now fighting for our freedom. However, it is still important to pay the bills.”

The same text was posted on the Kyiv Utilities website. I remembered the faces of the employees of these companies—which are so incompatible with the war. Wherever I look, everywhere, I see war. It has become a total, all-encompassing way of life that swallows everything.

An abandoned stroller (right) in my favorite park in Kyiv, which I finally dared to visit.

During the day I met an old friend, a historian and sociologist who lives far away on the other side of the city. Early in the morning he went to the city center to help a friend’s mother evacuate.

The mother waited at the station with four small bags and a suitcase, even though my friend asked her to bring just one. I heard her voice on the phone, crying as she described the difficulties of boarding the crowded train, then crying again as she explained she had made it onto a train car and found a spot.

My friend can’t find peace. Yesterday, he helped his uncle escape a partially burned-out village near Kyiv and now he is looking for the phone numbers of those who are still there. In this quaint little village, called Horenka, the pharmacy was shelled and destroyed on February 28. Then, at the beginning of March, Horenka was repeatedly shelled again with Grad rockets.

Only a few load-bearing walls remain from most of the houses. I have visited several times in the past, but now I do not recognize anything from the pictures of the ruins.

In Zaporizhzhya Oblast, two postal workers were shot dead in their mail truck while trying to deliver pensions to elderly people who could no longer collect the money themselves. I can picture this kind of Ukrainian mail truck very well—several times when I was young, I saw postal workers deliver my grandma’s pension to her. She was weak and could not leave the apartment, but she was very proud when the small pension, which was rapidly devaluing due to inflation, was handed to her personally. She was almost friends with one of the postal workers. They always shared a little polite chat and, in my memory, they both looked happy while doing so. Two women who gave each other the gift of their presence and support.

The delivery of the pension was a symbol of care; it was a human gesture—more than simply welfare from the corrupt state. I can picture a mail truck, but picturing how such a truck could be shot at is beyond my imagination.

I wish that everyone who delivers something, who cares for someone, reaches their destinations safely tomorrow. That’s what I’m hoping for this March 8. I will be remembering those who, despite the danger to their lives, continue to take care of the people of this country and try to reach someone.

DAY 11 (SUNDAY, MARCH 6): “IT’S 3:30 P.M. AND WE’RE STILL ALIVE”

SOMETIMES these days, it’s hard to grasp tomorrow. Tomorrow seems an eternity away, as if it were happening on another planet. One can imagine tomorrow in theory, but not as a moment in one’s own passage of time—only as a story one tells oneself.

09:09 Yevhen Kramarenko, head of the State Agency of Ukraine on Exclusion Zone Management (GAZO), said Russian occupiers and about 10,000 vehicles entered and exited Ukraine through Chernobyl. This means that they and their military equipment are contaminated with radiation.

08:55 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on the air of the CBS TV channel that Belarusians do not support the war against Ukraine.

""People in Belarus do not support the war against us, and therefore even the Belarusian people filmed how aircraft fighters flew to attack us from Belarus,"" Zelensky said.

08:43 Mayor Oleksandr Senkevich said that, on the morning of April 4, Russian troops launched several missile strikes on Mykolaiv.

08:36 That's how missiles were launched at night, presumably, Odesa was targeted from Novorossiysk.

08:31 The National Police of Ukraine steps up patrols in areas of all the liberated cities of the Kyiv region, said the head of the National Police of Ukraine Ihor Klymenko. He also said that police units are clearing the territory from saboteurs, explosive objects and ammunition in the liberated settlements of the Kyiv region.

08:25 ""This is not a war of two states and not a war of nations. It is a war of civilization and savage mediaeval barbarism. We will definitely defeat this wild Moscow horde. But we must win and remain civilized,"" Hanna Maliar said about the essence of the current war.

08:11 ""Russia's cowardly attacks on civilians in Irpen and Bucha are further proof that Putin and his army are committing war crimes in Ukraine. No Kremlin's denials or disinformation can hide the truth we know: Putin is desperate, his invasion is failing, and Ukraine's resolve has never been stronger,"" British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said.

Zelensky urged to ""tell the truth"" about the military operation on social networks and on television. ""Support us by any means. But do not be silent,"" the Ukrainian leader asked. ""And then peace will come,"" he added.

07:48 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken believes Russia has completely failed to set goals during the invasion of Ukraine, suffered a strategic failure, and was possibly defeated.

Ukraine is now more united, Russia's power has been greatly reduced, and its army has fallen far behind.

The traffic will be possible in both directions, but only weights up to 5 tons will be supported.

07:36 Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said that the crimes committed by the Russian invaders in Bucha should be called genocide, and everyone who is directly or indirectly responsible for them should be severely punished.

He called on the EU to impose effective sanctions against the Russian Federation, including the immediate severance of all trade relations with Russia.

“This is our political and moral duty. No more fake gestures and avoidance tactics. Enough! The sanctions aren't working. Cut off the oxygen to the Russian genocide,"" Morawiecki said.

07:33 The Armed Forces of Ukraine liberated part of the Chernihiv region, mopping up continues. We are talking about the settlements of Kolichivka, Yahidne and Ivanivka.

""These settlements of the Chernihiv region will remember the horrors of the war for a long time. A pile of Russian scrap metal that was broken and burned by the Ukrainian military ""decorates"" the Chernihiv-Kozelets highway. Putin's killers themselves either lay dead on Ukrainian soil or ran away pathetically,"" Operational Command North said.

By James Mackenzie

ZAPORIZHZHIA, Ukraine (Reuters) - Ukraine said on Saturday its forces had seized back all areas around Kyiv, claiming complete control of the capital region for the first time since Russia launched the invasion.

As Russian troops regrouped for battles in east Ukraine, towns surrounding Kyiv bore scars of five weeks of fighting. Dead civilians laid scattered over streets, and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy accused Russian forces of leaving behind mines.

Ukraine's troops have retaken more than 30 towns and villages around Kyiv since Russia pulled back from the area this week, Ukrainian officials said.

""The whole Kyiv region is liberated from the invader,"" Ukraine's Deputy Defence Minister, Hanna Malyar, wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ: ). There was no Russian comment on the claim, which Reuters could not immediately verify.

In the recaptured town of Bucha, reached by Reuters, the sprawled remains of more than a dozen bodies lined one road. A mass grave in the grounds of a church was still open, with hands and feet poking through the red clay heaped on top.

Bucha's mayor, Anatoliy Fedoruk, said more than 300 residents had been killed. Many tearfully recalled brushes with death.

""We don't want them to come back,"" said Mariya Zhelezova, 74, who spoke of coming under fire by Russian soldiers. ""I had a dream today - that they left, and didn't come back.""

British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said she was appalled by atrocities in Bucha and voiced support for the International Criminal Court's inquiry into potential war crimes in Ukraine.

Russia denies targeting civilians and rejects war crimes allegations.

PUTIN-ZELENSKIY TALKS?

Since sending troops on Feb. 24 in what it calls a ""special operation"" to demilitarise its neighbour, Russia has failed to capture a single major city and has instead laid siege to urban areas, uprooting a quarter of Ukraine's population.

Ukraine's armed forces reported diminished Russian air and missile strikes on Saturday but said Russian troops retreating from near Kyiv were deploying mines.

Zelenskiy warned in a video address: ""They are mining all this territory. Houses are mined, equipment is mined, even the bodies of dead people."" He did not cite evidence.

Ukraine's emergencies service said over 1,500 explosives had been found in one day during a search of the village of Dmytrivka, west of Kyiv.

Russia's defence ministry did not reply to a request for comment on the mining allegations. Reuters could not independently verify them.

Russia has depicted its drawdown of forces near Kyiv as a goodwill gesture in peace talks. Ukraine and its allies say Russia was forced to shift its focus to east Ukraine after suffering heavy losses near Kyiv.

Both sides described talks held this week in Istanbul and by video link as ""difficult"". Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Saturday the ""main thing is that the talks continue, either in Istanbul or somewhere else"".

A new round of talks has not yet been announced. But Ukrainian negotiator David Arakhamia said on Saturday that enough progress had been made to allow direct talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelenskiy.

""The Russian side confirmed our thesis that the draft documents have been sufficiently developed to allow direct consultations between the two countries' leaders,"" Arakhamia said. Russia has not commented on the possibility.

FLEEING MARIUPOL

Among those killed near Kyiv was Maksim Levin, a Ukrainian photographer and videographer who was working for a local news website and was a long-time contributor to Reuters.

His body was found in a village north of Kyiv on April 1, the news website LB.ua where he worked said on Saturday.

In the east, a Red Cross convoy was again seeking to evacuate civilians from the besieged port of Mariupol after abandoning an attempt on Friday over security concerns. It was not expected to reach the city until at least Sunday.

Mariupol is Russia's main target in Ukraine's southeastern region of Donbas, and tens of thousands of civilians there are trapped with scant access to food and water.

Some civilians who have escaped Mariupol said Russian soldiers seeking Ukrainian fighters repeatedly stopped them as they fled.

""They stripped the men naked, looked for tattoos,"" said Dmytro Kartavov, a 32-year-old builder.

International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) spokesperson Ewan Watson said its convoy had departed the city of Zaporizhzhia, some 200 kilometres (124 miles) from Mariupol, and would spend the night en route. Russia blamed the ICRC for the delays.

MISSILE STRIKES

Pope Francis said a ""potentate"" was fomenting conflicts for nationalist interests, the closest he has come yet to criticising Putin, although he did not name the Russian president.

""Once again, some potentate, sadly caught up in anachronistic claims of nationalist interests, is provoking and fomenting conflicts, while ordinary people sense the need to build a future that will either be shared or not be at all,"" he said.

Ukrainian officials reported missile strikes in various parts of the country.

In the south-central Dnipro region, a Russian rocket hit a rail line, badly damaging tracks and suspending train traffic, Ukrainian officials said. Earlier, Russian missiles hit the central Ukrainian cities of Poltava and Kremenchuk, said Dmitry Lunin, head of the Poltava region.

Russia's defence ministry said its missiles had disabled military airfields in Poltava and Dnipro. It later said its forces had hit 28 Ukrainian military facilities across the country, including two weapons depots.

The Ukrainian military also reported Russian air strikes on the cities of Severodonetsk and Rubizhne in the Luhansk region.",https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/red-cross-heads-again-for-mariupol-as-russia-shifts-ukraine-focus-2796806

Article content All times CET: Sweden Revives Forces to Shield Baltic From Putin (7 a.m.) Sweden’s top army officer has been waiting a long time to get back to the windswept Baltic Sea island of Gotland. Karl Engelbrektson was a unit commander on Gotland in 2005 when Sweden withdrew its military from the crucial perch in the center of the Baltic, taking advantage of the post-Cold War peace. Even then, he thought the move was ill-judged. “Disbanding large parts of the armed forces, in the peace euphoria of that time, may have made sense to a lot of people,” Engelbrektson, clad in army fatigue next to a German-made Stridsvagn 122 tank, said in an interview at the Gotland base in late March. “History proves that this was a mistake.” Sanctions Will Increase Until Peace: Japan’s Hagiuda (4 a.m.)
