CIT investigators believe that the missile that hit the Kramatorsk station could have arrived from the Russian-occupied territories. They also think that it could not have been a ""provocation of Ukraine"".

Source: Conflict Intelligence Team

Quote: ""The photo of the wreckage clearly shows the rocket part of the ""Tochka U"".

Photographs and videos show that the rocket part faces the northeast, which means that the missile may have arrived from the west, southwest or south"".

Details: Investigators note that the rocket part fell to the ground and apparently did not roll over during the fall, otherwise it would have fallen apart. So this method can be applied for determining the trajectory.

It was stated that the Russian Ministry of Defence also points to the south-western direction of arrival, claiming that the launch was made from Dobropillia, which is controlled by Ukraine.

However, in the south-western direction (for example, south of Vuhledar and in the area of ​​Velyki Novosilky), within the flight range of the ""Tochka-U"" missile (120 km), there are positions of Russian and ""separatist"" forces, so the launch could have been made from there"", - admitted in the CIT.

If we ignore the direction of the missile unit, the investigators write, it is possible to assume that the launch was carried out from Shakhtarsk, controlled by the self-proclaimed ""Donetsk People's Republic"" (southeast of Kramatorsk), where before the hit there was a launch of some missiles - in this case, sooner or later the second rocket part will be also found.

However, investigators note that reports published by pro-Russian channels about falling into the ""accumulation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine"" can hardly be a direct admission of guilt by Russia.

""In our experience, such channels often publish footage of shelling of residential neighbourhoods found on the Internet and pass it off as strikes on Ukrainian military facilities,"" the statement said.

More suspicious was the warning issued by the pro-Russian channel on the night of 7-8 April, where residents of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk were advised not to evacuate by rail.

In addition, the Russian Defence Ministry has repeatedly reported attacks on railway stations west of Kramatorsk.

According to the claim of the Ministry of Defence of Russia, the country allegedly does not have ""Tochka-U"" complexes in its arsenal. But the CIT reminded: at the end of last year, it was reported that the 47th Missile Brigade of the 8th Army, stationed east of Donbass, was armed with the ""Tochka-U"" system and it could be seen in local television reports.

The 47th brigade received the ""Iskander-M"" only on 26 January 2022, less than a month before the invasion, and hardly had time to master it, investigators say.

It is also known that Russia used the ""Tochka-U"" complexes in the Kyiv direction. The echelon with launchers with the ""V"" sign (Russian military vehicles in Ukraine are prominently marked with this letter - ed.) was noticed in Gomel (Belarus) during the withdrawal of troops from the Kyiv region. Activists of the ""Motolko Pomohy"" project (""Motolko help"" - ed.) have previously reported on the supply of these complexes to Belarus.

Investigators consider the version of ""provocation of Ukraine"" spread by the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation unbelievable.

Background: On 8 April Russians hit the train station in Kramatorsk with ballistic missiles.

The hospitals in Kramatorsk are unable to keep up with the number of injured people, Kramatorsk Mayor Oleksandr Honcharenko reported. “A lot of people are seriously injured, missing arms and legs. 30-40 surgeons are operating on them at once,” said the mayor.

According to the Ukrainian police, the missile hit the station’s temporary waiting room. Parts of the missile were found 40 meters (about 130 feet) from the point of impact, which is an indication of how powerful it was, Honcharenko said. When the missile hit, there were about 4,000 people waiting to evacuate (the Ukrainian authorities called for civilians to leave Donetsk two days ago in anticipation of a Russian offensive).

Both Ukrainian Presidential Advisor Oleksiy Arestovych and Donetsk Regional Administration Head Pavlo Kyrylenko said that the station had been hit by a Iskander missile system, a weapon produced and used by the Russian military.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who commented on the missile strike later on, said that Tochka-U missiles had been used. Zelensky posted a video that appears to show a fragment of one of the missiles (Ukrainian and Russian media outlets had previously circulated videos and photos of the same fragment). The words “For the children,” phrased in Russian in a way that suggests retaliation, can be seen on the missile.

The territorial defense headquarters of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) also reported that the missile used in the strike was a Tochka-U missile, though they claimed the attack was carried out by Ukrainian forces.

The Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement that “the Russian armed forces had no fire missions planned for April 8 in the city of Kramatorsk, nor were any planned,” and that the strike in Kramatorsk was launched “by a missile division of the Ukrainian armed forces from the settlement of Dobropillia, 45 kilometers (28 miles) southwest of the city.”

Ukrainian media outlets pointed out that on April 8 at 10:24 and 10:25 am — about 20 minutes before the first report of the missile strike on the station — two videos that appear to show rockets being launched appeared on the Telegram Channel “Typical Donetsk.” The captions say the videos were filmed in the town of Shakhtarsk, which is controlled by the DNR.

Other Ukrainian outlets said that on April 7 and early on April 8, pro-Russian Telegram channels warned subscribers to leave Slavyansk, Kramatorsk, and other nearby areas “on non-railway transport” due to a “concentration of militants from the Ukrainian armed forces.”

Ukrainian Deputy Interior Minister Anton Herashchenko posted a video that reportedly shows the initial seconds after the missile strike on the station in Kramatorsk.

Tochka-U is the name of a Soviet tactical missile system. In 2017, the Russian Defense Ministry announced it would retire the Tochka-U from its arsenal and replace it with the Iskander missile system; the Tochka-U missiles would be put in storage.

Tochka-U missiles are still a part of Ukraine’s arsenal. DNR representatives said in a statement that these missiles were used in Donetsk on March 14, when 20 people were killed in the city.

The Ukrainian authorities and media have reported that Russian forces have also used Tochka-U missiles in the ongoing war, suggesting that they might have a shortage of Iskander missiles. The investigative news outlet Conflict Intelligence Team (CIT) has written about this. In February, the Russian Defense Ministry itself reported that Tochka-U missiles were used in joint Russian-Belarusian military exercises.

On Friday afternoon, Kramatorsk Mayor Oleksandr Honcharenko announced that the city would begin emergency evacuations using “all public transport and all private transport” and was looking for 30-40 drivers to evacuate people today. He also said that Donetsk residents who are able to get to Kramatorsk will be evacuated.",https://meduza.io/en/feature/2022/04/08/russian-missile-hits-kramatorsk-train-station

Death toll rose to 50 and over 100 injured following a missile attack in Kramatorsk, said Donetsk region authorities.

At least 50 civilians were killed and more than a hundred received injured following a missile strike on a railway station in Kramatorsk, Donetsk region, local authorities said.

The attack took place outside the station reportedly packed with thousands of residents waiting for their trains to evacuate from the area, as recommended by the regional authorities.

Ukraine and Russia are blaming each other for the attack, with Zelensky claiming it was a Tochka U rocket launched by Russian forces, and the Russian Defence Ministry slamming the strike as Kiev's ""provocation"".

In a tweet, the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen described the attack as 'despicable' and offered her condolences to the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.",https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/russia-ukraine-crisis/russia-ukraine-war-news-live-updates-day-43-april-7-2022-liveblog.html
