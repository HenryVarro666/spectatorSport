MUKACHEVO, Ukraine — Ukrainian officials say at least 11 people were killed and more were wounded in the eastern city of Kharkiv on Monday morning after Russia launched rocket strikes, targeting Ukraine’s second-largest city with some of the heaviest shelling since the invasion began Thursday. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight Suspected cluster munitions struck buildings in residential parts of the city, raising fears that as Russia escalates attacks in urban areas it could use tactics similar to those it used in Chechnya and Syria, where it has been accused of widespread wartime abuses.

The bombardments came as Russian and Ukrainian delegations held talks Monday for the first time. They met by Ukraine’s border with Belarus, a key Russian ally.

Oleh Synehubov, head of the Kharkiv Regional State Administration, said Monday that “dozens are dying” and that at least 11 people were confirmed dead. He called the attacks, in three areas of the predominantly Russian-speaking city that had been considered more friendly to Russia, “a war crime.”

“The Russian enemy is shelling entire residential areas of Kharkiv, where there is no critical infrastructure, where there are no positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine that the Russians could aim at,” he said in a message on Telegram.

As the shelling began, many Kharkiv residents were lining up at grocery stores and other shops to replenish supplies after being shut in for several days. In the aftermath, images circulated online of damaged buildings and streets dotted with blood and hastily discarded groceries. One video showed a still-smoldering children’s clothing factory entirely destroyed.

Kharkiv resident Alexey Zavrazhnyi, 32, said a rocket fell in a playground about 700 meters from his apartment. A second fell on the opposite side of the playground, damaging the area where Zavrazhnyi said he takes his 9-month-old daughter to play. Luckily no one was injured here, he said, but elsewhere in the city he saw blood on the street.

Mark Hiznay, associate director of the arms division at Human Rights Watch, told The Washington Post that Russian forces had used Smerch cluster munition rockets, which disperse submunitions or bomblets, according to footage he reviewed.

“This attack clearly illustrates the inherently indiscriminate nature of cluster munitions and should be unequivocally condemned,” he said.

Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the open-source group Bellingcat have identified the use of cluster munitions in other Russian attacks in Ukraine over recent of days in what analysts say is a worrying sign that Russia may be turning to even more-deadly military tactics.

'“As Putin’s ‘special operation’ plan to quickly demoralize the Ukrainian army and occupy large cities unopposed appears to have failed, we may see a return to area bombings, which caused so much harm to Chechen and Syrian civilians,” the Moscow-based Conflict Intelligence Team, an open-source intelligence group that monitors Russia’s military, said in a tweet Monday.

In Syria, where Russia has been allied with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad since 2015, Russian warplanes have become synonymous with the cluster bombs that have decimated Syrian cities such as Aleppo and civilian infrastructure such as hospitals. In Chechnya, Russia was similarly accused of indiscriminately targeting civilian populations, among other alleged war crimes, during the second Chechen conflict from 1999 to 2005.

Now Russia appears to be adopting siege warfare tactics against Kharkiv, firing long-range weapons into the city, a senior U.S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the Pentagon, said Monday.

U.S. officials assess that if Russia can take Kharkiv and also seize Mariupol in southeastern Ukraine, “that would allow them to section off the eastern part of Ukraine and fix whatever Ukrainian armed forces are in the east and keep them there,” far from the capital, Kyiv, the senior U.S. defense official said.

Siege tactics often include bombarding a target from a distance, even with civilians stuck in place, and cutting it off from food and ammunition resupply.

Ukrainian officials gave conflicting reports about the number of fatalities.

Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov said earlier Monday that the exact number of casualties remained unknown but that at least 15 Ukrainian fighters and 16 civilians had been wounded.

Ukrainian Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko wrote in a Facebook post Monday that “Kharkiv has just been massively fired upon by grads,” with “dozens of dead and hundreds of wounded,” Reuters reported.

He was referring to Russian BM-21 “Grad” 122-millimeter rockets fired from truck-mounted multiple-rocket launchers. A correspondent for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty photographed damage to Russian military equipment, including Grad missile launchers, near Kharkiv on Friday.

Authorities issued a curfew for the city beginning Monday afternoon.

Kharkiv, a city of 1.5 million people about 25 miles from the border with Russia, has emerged as a major linchpin in Russian efforts to push beyond the east and on to Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv.

The Post verified videos posted Monday of explosions in a northeastern Kharkiv neighborhood.

In two clips that were verified, flashes of light appear in rapid succession as columns of smoke rise. A woman observing the barrage is heard crying in the background of one of the videos.

Russian bombardments of Kharkiv started to accelerate Saturday evening. After days of fighting largely around Kharkiv, Russian forces briefly took the city Sunday, but they were repelled hours later by Ukrainian fighters.

“Ukrainian forces have put up a pretty strong fight … but the worst is yet to come,” Michael Kofman, director of Russia studies at CNA, a Virginia-based nonprofit research and analysis organization, told The Post on Sunday. “Russian forces haven’t [yet] tried to take Kharkiv, not seriously.”

He warned that after facing unexpectedly strong Ukrainian resistance, Russia was likely to increase its aerial campaign against Kharkiv, a densely packed city.

The senior U.S. defense official said that while Russia’s advance on Kyiv appears to still be its main effort, seizing Kharkiv remained a clear objective.

“In Ukraine right now, there is no safe place,” Boris Redin, an activist in Kharkiv, told The Post on Monday. “And Putin has to be stopped because there’ll be no safe place on the planet. But we’re standing and we’ll win.”

Widespread use of indiscriminate weapons such as multiple rocket launchers against civilian areas, as used on Monday in the city of Kharkiv, suggested that the Kremlin, having failed to land a knockout blow in the first days of the war, was prepared to unleash more desperate methods.

The prosecutor of the international criminal court said he would launch an investigation into possible war crimes or crimes against humanity in Ukraine.

Late on Monday, the Ukrainian ambassador to the US accused Russian forces of using a thermobaric weapons, which use oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a high-temperature explosion. “The devastation that Russia is trying to inflict on Ukraine is large,” said Oksana Markarova.

Satellite photos showed long Russian columns heading towards Kyiv. The satellite imaging company Maxar published a picture of a 40-mile convoy of forces about 30 miles from the capital. Inside Kyiv, air raid sirens sounded as evening fell and several detonations were reported. Blasts were also heard in Mariupol on the coast of the Sea of Azov. However, Russian forces have yet to take any major Ukrainian city. Turkey said it would ban all warships from crossing the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits leading to the Black Sea, blocking the route for at least four Russian vessels which are waiting to cross from the Mediterranean.

The Élysée Palace said after a call between Emmanuel Macron and Vladimir Putin that the Russian president had said he was “willing to commit” to ending attacks on civilians and civil infrastructure while ceasefire talks were taking place between Russian and Ukrainian officials in Belarus.

But on the fifth day of fighting and with Russian forces advancing more slowly than many analysts had expected, the Ukrainian interior ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko said on Monday Kharkiv had been “massively fired on”, leaving “dozens of dead and hundreds of wounded”.

After a classified briefing from US intelligence in Washington, Senator Chris Murphy said on Twitter: “The ability to keep supply lines running to Ukraine remains alive, but Russia will try to encircle and cut off Kiev in the next several weeks. The fight for Kiev will be long and bloody and Ukrainians are rapidly preparing for street to street combat.”

The talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations near the Belarus-Ukraine border ended inconclusively, with national news agencies quoting officials as saying the negotiators would return to their respective capitals for consultations before embarking on a second round of talks in the coming days.

The Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak described negotiations as “difficult” and said: “Unfortunately, the Russian side is still extremely biased regarding the destructive processes it launched.”

The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, urged Russian troops to abandon their equipment and leave the battlefield to save their lives, claiming 4,500 were already dead.

Russia’s nuclear forces were placed on high alert, it was announced on Monday, in line with Putin’s orders to his defence chiefs the day before, but it was unclear if the alert involved the movement of the country’s nuclear weapons, or the deployment of personnel to command and control facilities. Meanwhile Russia’s foreign ministry said on Monday that those supplying lethal weapons to Ukraine would bear responsibility should they be used during the war.

A senior US intelligence official said the president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, who has backed Putin’s military assault on Ukraine after earlier playing an intermediary role, could also send troops to help Russia in the next 24 hours.

Western analysts also said they were alarmed by a referendum vote in pro-Russian Belarus that could result in nuclear weapons being stationed on the country’s soil for the first time since the fall of the Soviet Union.

Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had taken control of the towns of Berdyansk and Enerhodar in Ukraine’s south-eastern Zaporizhzhia region, as well as the area around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it had information that “Russian forces were operational near the site but had not entered it at the time of reporting”. The IAEA’s director general, Rafael Grossi, “stressed that any military or other action that could threaten the plant’s safety or security must be avoided”.

At least 102 civilians in Ukraine have been killed, with 304 more wounded, but the real figure will be “considerably higher”, the UN human rights commissioner, Michelle Bachelet, said earlier on Monday. A US defence official said Russia had fired more than 350 missiles.

Karim Khan, the ICC prosecutor, said he would open an investigation into possible war crimes or crimes against humanity in Ukraine, based both on a prior report by his predecessor in 2020, and on current military operations. Khan said he had already instructed his team to take steps to preserve evidence.

Western officials said there would be “a requirement to record and capture” attacks on civilians to establish whether war crimes had been committed by the unnecessary targeting of civilians by Russian forces. At least seven were reported to have died after what appeared to be indiscriminate rocket strikes on Kharkiv on Monday, although an Ukrainian official said “dozens” had been killed.

“I think we will be very attentive and alert to war crimes or breaches of international humanitarian law in this conflict,” said one official, although they said it was too soon comment whether they thought the attack on Kharkiv was a breach, or whether they believed cluster munitions that are banned by the UK and many other European nations but not Russia or the US had been used.

On Monday, the UN general assembly began an emergency session to address the Russian invasion. Ukraine’s allies are hoping to get the support of more than 100 countries to support a resolution condemning Russia, in an attempt to press home Moscow’s isolation.

While the assembly was underway, the US mission to the UN announced it was expelling 12 Russian diplomats for allegedly “engaging in espionage activities” which threatened national security.

Russia’s ambassador to UN, Vassily Nebenzya, said the the diplomats had been told to leave by 7 March; He called it “another hostile” measure against the Russian mission.

The Kremlin conceded on Monday that Russia’s economic reality had changed, but said there was no reason to doubt its central bank, which raised interest rates to 20% as it sought to shield the economy from tough new western sanctions.

Panicked Russians withdrew savings and sought to exchange roubles for dollars and euros, while Russian businesses scrambled to protect their finances as the rouble lost nearly 30% of its value against the dollar on Monday.

Measures adopted by the US, the UK, EU member states and other countries have blocked some Russian banks from the Swift international payments system and severely restricted the Russian central bank’s ability to access its $640bn (£477bn) of reserves.

In a further crippling blow, the US on Monday imposed swingeing new sanctions, in effect blocking Americans from engaging in any transactions involving Russia’s central bank, finance ministry or national wealth fund.

“The economic reality has considerably changed,” said the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov. “These are heavy sanctions, they are problematic, but Russia has the potential to offset the harm. Russia has been making plans for quite a long time.”

The EU has also shut all Russian planes out of its airspace, forcing the Russian airline Aeroflot to cancel all flights to European destinations until further notice. The Russian state media outlets RT and Sputnik have also been banned in the EU.

Switzerland on Monday set aside its tradition of neutrality and said it would adopt all sanctions already imposed on Russia by the EU. “This is a big step for Switzerland,” said the country’s president, Ignazio Cassis.

On Monday, Shell announced it would follow BP in divesting from its joint ventures in Russia, withdrawing from projects with the Russian gas corporation, Gazprom.

In addition to sanctions, the US and several EU countries have announced they will send Stinger missiles and other military supplies to Ukraine. Germany has said it will increase defence spending massively, casting off decades of reluctance, while in a similarly radical change of policy Finland said it would send weapons and ammunition to Ukraine, the prime minister, Sanna Marin, said.

For the first time in its history, the EU signed off on an agreement to finance the purchase and delivery of weapons to a country under attack, providing €500m (£420m) of military equipment to the Ukrainian armed forces in a move described as a “watershed moment”. Nato partners are also providing Ukraine with air-defence missiles and anti-tank weapons, the alliance’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, tweeted on Monday.

Peskov doubled down on Monday on the Kremlin’s logic for sending Russian forces into Ukraine, saying western arms supplies showed that Moscow was right to try to demilitarise its neighbour and accusing the EU of hostile behaviour.

Russia’s growing diplomatic isolation continued, with the UN human rights council agreeing on Monday to Ukraine’s request to hold an urgent debate on the invasion.

Zelenskiy on Monday also formally signed an official request for Ukraine to join the EU. The bloc said it was is expecting Ukraine’s application “imminently”, which officials in Brussels said “would need to be assessed very rapidly by the council, and a decision made as to whether to request an urgent opinion from the Commission”.

Western officials believe Putin wants to overthrow Ukraine’s government and replace it with a puppet regime. His instructions on Sunday for Russian nuclear readiness raised fears that the invasion could lead to nuclear war by design or mistake.

3,e8b62875-835d-4f87-9563-ddec785cf941,"['Abc News', 'Patrick Reevell', 'February']",,"KYIV -- There is growing evidence that Ukraine is managing to inflict significant casualties on Russian forces as they try to advance deeper into the country -- and that the swift strike Russia hoped to carry out on the capital, Kyiv, has been slowed by intense and popular resistance.

Russia hasn't managed to make significant progress in the last two days. The main Russian force pushing down from Belarus towards Kyiv does not appear to have advanced closer towards the city since coming within about 20 miles, although smaller advanced groups have been fighting gun battles with Ukrainian forces inside the capital since at least Friday.

Ukraine's military claims the Russian troops are struggling with fuel and logistics supplies. Images and videos of destroyed Russian military vehicles and tanks, which have been verified, have been circulating online.

One example of the effective Ukrainian resistance took place Sunday when Russia appeared to mount a half-hearted attempt to destroy resistance in Ukraine's second city, Kharkiv.

Russian special forces units in light armored vehicles tried to push into Kharkiv after indiscriminately bombarding the city with artillery, but they were rapidly destroyed by Ukrainian troops and volunteer territorial defense, according to videos posted online.

Kharkiv's Mayor Oleg Sinegubov on Sunday night pushed a triumphant message, saying that ""control over Kharkiv is completely ours"" and that Ukrainian forces had succeeded ""in a full clearing of the city of the enemy.""

Sinegubov said dozens of Russian troops had surrendered with little fight, sometimes in whole groups of five to 10 men, with some abandoning their equipment.

A number of military analysts -- including those that correctly predicted the invasion -- believed Russia had hoped for a lightning ""shock and awe"" advance to the edge of Kyiv in the first days that would lead to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's government surrendering without Russia needing to actually seize the city. Instead, the resistance is growing, officials said.

""It is clear they hoped to get Zelenskyy to surrender quickly without inflicting heavy casualties on the Ukrainian military [and] civilians. That failed, but their execution still appears to be fairly restrained,"" Rob Lee, analyst from Kings College London's War Department, wrote on Twitter on Sunday.

Lee said that strategy had now failed, and that Russia would have to move to a plan B, which he feared would mean ""more force.""

Time is working against Russia. Ukrainian popular resistance is gaining in self-confidence, and the Russian piecemeal strategy so far has allowed cities more time to set up defenses, putting in place barricades and distributing thousands of weapons.

In Berdyansk, the only major city Russia has gained full control of, videos posted to social media Monday showed a crowd of residents angrily chanting a slogan insulting President Vladimir Putin at Russian troops guarding a government building on the main square.

At the same time, the international response is also growing, with more sanctions and moves aimed at crippling Russia's economy, while European countries are sending more and more weapons to bolster the Ukrainian defense, with the European Union also announcing that for the first time it would provide Ukrainian officials with military support.

Russia has so far held back its main army and has been using its air and artillery power against military targets, avoiding widespread, intense bombardment against civilian areas. Analysts, including Lee, said Russia appeared to have initially sought to inflict limited casualties on Ukrainian civilians and the military, likely out of concern about backlash in Russia and making it harder to achieve a swift political change in Ukraine, as well as a stronger international reaction.

U.S. officials and independent analyst now fear if Russia's attempt to overpower Ukraine quickly fails, it may turn to using more brute force to achieve it. That could mean unleashing indiscriminate artillery and airstrikes to destroy Ukraine's military and terrorize civilians, as well as besieging cities.

That already appears to be happening in Kharkiv, where Russia in the last two days has fired heavy artillery, including ""Grad"" multiple rocket launchers onto the city, causing significant damage to civilian buildings.

""I think today we've seen a shift in Russian targeting towards critical civilian infrastructure, greater use of MLRS, and artillery in suburban areas. Unfortunately, my concern that this was going to get a lot more ugly and affect civilians is starting to materialize,"" Michael Kofman, an analyst at CNA, who also predicted the invasion as likely, tweeted late Saturday.

U.S. officials caution, though, that Russia still has major combat power yet to be deployed, with roughly half its forces massed near Ukraine still not engaged. A massive 3-mile-long column of hundreds of vehicles has formed up in northern Ukraine after crossing from Belarus and appears to be moving towards Kyiv.",https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukraine-mounting-stiff-resistance-inflicting-painful-casualties-russia/story?id=83145245

February 28 shelling from Russia into Kharkiv resulted in at least eleven deaths in three separate neighborhoods

On February 28, 2022, Russia indiscriminately shelled Ukraine’s second largest city, Kharkiv, in an attack that claimed at least eleven civilian lives, wounding many more, and destroying homes. This incident was not isolated; as previously reported by the DFRLab, Russia has shelled the city since the beginning of the war.

Compared to attacks during previous days, though, the February 28 attack was significantly more violent and brazen in its targeting of highly populated civilian population areas. The DFRLab analyzed and geolocated available imagery of the attack, identifying three main neighborhoods affected by shelling. While other areas were also affected, the Saltovka, 6th Mikrorayon, and Horizont neighborhoods appeared the worst hit.

The DFRLab is mapping out areas of Kharkiv hit by artillery on Google Maps.

Geolocations

At 10:42am local time on February 28 in the eastern Kharkiv suburb of Horizont, a security camera at 128 Velika Kiltseva Street captured the moment when several explosions went off in rapid succession in the building’s adjacent parking lot and nearby pedestrian path.

At least four pedestrians were visible on the footpath behind the parking lot, all appearing to have sustained injury from the nearby explosions. In another video shot in Horizont, a dead body can be seen lying on the ground behind a Velmart supermarket, two hundred meters away from the security camera footage.

Horizont suffered at least two rounds of shelling, eventually causing serious damage to buildings in the southwestern part of the neighborhood.

Along August 23rd Street near school number 135, in the district known as the 6th Mikrorayon, one of the grimmest scenes of the war up until then unfolded. In one spot, four people laid dead at a drinking water dispenser. By referencing Google Street View imagery, the DFRLab was able to pinpoint the location of the footage to where Ozerniy Pereulok meets August 23rd Street.

As with the attack on Horizont, the shelling of the 6th Mikrorayon affected a large area, destroying cars and damaging homes in addition to the human toll.

In the northern residential neighborhood of Saltovka, shelling hit a large garage area bordering on Buchmy Street. Given the large area that rocket artillery covers, nearby homes were also damaged. Dashcam footage and residents of the area captured the attack as it unfolded.

In other parts of Kharkiv, boosters the size of telephone poles from BM-30 300mm multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) rained over the city, along with parts used to hold submunitions, also known as cluster bombs. Submunitions from BM-30 “Smerch” rockets were likely to blame for the carnage.

Following the debris patterns from Kharkiv city back into the Russian-Ukrainian border area, several potential burn marks were visible in Planet Labs imagery from February 27. In the above graphic, each number by the yellow pins on the right corresponds to the amount of burn marks identified at each site. Other tracks in the snow indicated likely howitzer firing positions, but these were far outnumbered by rocket launch sites.

While these may not all be rocket artillery launch sites, some of them verifiably are, since Planet Labs imagery showed an MLRS launch site where the smoke plume from recently fired rockets was still visible. The effects of the wind on the smoke cloud made it difficult to track the exact destination of the rockets, but it appeared to point in the general direction of Kharkiv.",https://medium.com/dfrlab/geolocating-russias-indiscriminate-shelling-of-kharkiv-deaccc830846
5,e8b62875-835d-4f87-9563-ddec785cf941,['Jamie Dettmer'],,"Fears are mounting that Russian forces will turn more to targeting critical civilian infrastructure and mount indiscriminate shelling as the defenders of Kyiv maintain their resistance and hold ground despite redoubled Kremlin efforts to subjugate Ukraine’s capital.

Some critical civilian infrastructure has already been hit and the Ukrainian military said it intercepted a missile heading for a nearby dam, which if breached could have caused major flooding of low-lying districts near the Dnieper River.

Russian forces also targeted a radioactive waste disposal site in Kyiv, Ukrainian authorities say.

“I think today we've seen a shift in Russian targeting towards critical civilian infrastructure, greater use of MLRS [multiple rocket launchers], and artillery in suburban areas,” tweeted Michael Kofman, an expert on the Russian military at CNA, an American defense research organization.

“Unfortunately, my concern that this was going to get a lot more ugly and affect civilians is starting to materialize,” he added.

In the dam incident, the Ukrainian military said it managed to shoot down a Russian missile heading toward the Kyiv Reservoir dam Saturday.

“If the dam is destroyed, the flood will lead to catastrophic casualties and damage, including flooding of residential areas in Kyiv and the suburbs,” the Infrastructure Ministry said on Telegram.

Water experts say if the dam north of the city is breached, it could trigger a cascade effect, causing other key dams to fail. There are even concerns that a nuclear power plant at Zaporizhzhya, about 550 kilometers southeast of Kyiv, could be affected.

Russian forces Saturday targeted an oil depot southwest of the city at Vasylkiv as Ukrainian forces repulsed a Russian assault on the capital.

Local authorities say Ukrainian forces are battling saboteurs and Russian special operations forces units who have infiltrated the capital. The Ukrainian government has reported 198 civilian deaths, including children, since the Russia's invasion, but they caution the numbers could be higher. Ukrainian authorities say at least 1,200 civilians have been injured.

Six people, including a 7-year-old girl, were killed in Russian shelling in Okhtyrka, in Sumy Oblast in northeastern Ukraine, Governor Dmitry Zhivitsky said Sunday. And in the south of the country the Russian military launched drones strikes in Odessa, according to Serhiy Bratchuk, head of the regional administration.

The Ukrainian military says it has inflicted heavy losses on Russia, saying its forces have managed to destroy 16 warplanes, 18 helicopters, 102 tanks, 504 armored vehicles and a Buk-1 missile system. They estimate they have killed 3,000 Russian soldiers and captured 200. VOA is unable to vouch for the accuracy of the claims.

Sunday morning the Ukrainians blew up a bridge on the northwest of Kyiv to try to hinder Russian forces.

Ukraine presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak told reporters that while a Russian delegation had arrived in Gomel in Belarus for peace talks, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has rejected a Russian offer of talks in Belarus on Sunday. Podolyak said Zelenskyy is open to negotiations elsewhere — the Ukrainians have suggested Warsaw, which is being refused by the Russians.

Zelenskyy described the fighting overnight in Kyiv and across the country as “brutal” in a statement Sunday. He said Russian occupying forces are “attacking civilian areas” where there is no military infrastructure. He said Russia is now “attacking everything,” including ambulances.

As worries mounted in Kyiv of a shift in Russian targeting from mainly military infrastructure, locals Sunday reported fierce street fighting in Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, where overnight shelling of residential districts preceded the entry of Russian ground forces.

Despite the Russian breach of Kharkiv, local Ukrainian commanders say they will continue to resist.

“There has been a breakthrough in light equipment including in the central part of the city,” Oleg Sinegubov, the head of the Kharkiv regional administration, announced, urging local residents to stay in shelters. He said Russian troops were still being blocked amid heavy fighting.

As in Kharkiv and Kyiv, so too elsewhere in the country defiance remains high — with resistance symbolized for many by a video posted on social media showing a Ukrainian civilian in Bakhmach in northern Ukraine attempting to stop a Russian tank by pushing against it.

In the video, the man first climbs on to the tank before jumping down and attempting to push it back, after that he kneels in front in a desperate bid to stop its advance. VOA cannot confirm the authenticity of the video, nonetheless it is one of many posted that Ukrainians point to as inspirational.

Ukrainian forces have notched up some significant successes. Zelenskyy aides confirmed that a convoy of Chechen special operations forces was intercepted near Hostomel and wiped out. Ukrainian forces have downed a cruise missile fired by a Russian Tu-22 strategic bomber from the territory of Belarus, Valery Zaluzhny, chief commander of the armed forces, said Sunday.

For civilians in cities and towns under siege — and even in towns unaffected directly by the fighting — getting basic goods and staples is becoming increasingly difficult. Many stores have closed, and supplies are difficult for owners to maintain. Village stores seem better supplied, being able to stock up with local produce, as witnessed by this VOA correspondent.

Seventy-two hours since the Russian invasion, Western experts estimate 80% of the country is still in Ukrainian hands, with around half of the forces Russian leader Vladimir Putin deployed along Ukraine’s borders now in action.

Franz-Stefan Gady, an analyst with the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a think tank in London, says the Russians are having to throw in more second-echelon units because “Ukrainian forces by and large are fighting orderly delaying actions; morale remains very high; air-defenses still operational; air force remains active.”

He says Ukraine’s mechanized forces are managing to mount counterattacks and that a race is on for Ukrainian forces to beat an orderly retreat from the East, where the bulk of Ukrainian forces have been deployed, to cross the Dnieper River and establish fresh defensive positions where possible. The Russian tactic seems to be to avoid losing contact with major Ukrainian units and to encircle major cities, as they are trying to do with Kyiv, and probe for weaknesses.

He, too, worries about the likelihood of mounting civilian casualties.

“Expect very heavy fighting and a noticeable increase in Russian ground-based mass fires to break Ukrainian resistance. This will be absolutely devastating for the civilian population, if caught in crossfires,” he tweeted.

The U.N. Refugee Agency said Sunday that more than 200,000 Ukrainians have fled to neighboring countries. Tens of thousands more are waiting on Poland’s borders to enter, with many more trying to make it across the country, as witnessed by this VOA correspondent during a journey from Kyiv to Lviv that took two days.

As blasts and explosions echoed around Kyiv, Zelenskyy, wearing olive green military-style clothing, assured residents of the capital that he remains with them.

“I am here. We will not lay down any weapons. We will defend our state, because our weapons are our truth,” he said. “Our truth is that this is our land, our country, our children and we will protect all of this,” he added.

By Daisy Stephens

The Deputy Prime Minister told LBC this morning that Vladimir Putin's Russian war machine is 'being starved' as it tries to take Ukraine's capital Kyiv.

Dominic Raab told LBC's Nick Ferrari at Breakfast today: “The sanctions that we’ve taken with our allies, we’ve seen the Russian Rouble fall by record margins.

“We’ve seen the Russian stock exchange fall by record margins.”

He said financial sanctions taken against Russia were the method being used to “starve Russia’s war machine.”

The Ukrainian capital Kyiv was rocked by fresh explosions on the fifth day of the Russian invasion, hours after Vladimir Putin was accused of using banned cluster munitions to indiscriminately target civilians in Kharkiv.

People in Kyiv reported windows shaking and air raid sirens ringing out on Monday evening following the explosions.

Video filmed in the embattled city shows a large fireball in the sky in the northwestern part of Kyiv, with reports claiming the site of the explosion was a military radar communication centre.

Broadcaster Clive Myrie has taken shelter underground after the building he was reporting from in Kyiv was shaken by nearby missile fire.

Writing on Twitter on Monday, the broadcaster and Mastermind host said the blast was the closest to their base yet and that it shook the windows.

Myrie, 57, tweeted: ""Now back in the underground shelter in Kyiv, our position shaken by nearby missile fire.

""Windows shook. Closest blast yet to our base. Fighting coming closer to heart of #kyiv.""

Russian troops are attacking on multiple fronts and are believed to be around 25km (15 miles) from Kyiv.

A huge convoy of hundreds of armoured vehicles, tanks, artillery and support vehicles has been spotted near the capital, according to satellite imagery from the Maxar company.

The fresh attack hit Kyiv as the first talks between Russia and Ukraine delegates came to an end, concluding without a ceasefire.

The talks ended with no deal but an agreement to keep talking, with delegations returning to their capitals.

It comes after Russia was accused of using banned cluster munitions to indiscriminately target civilians in Ukraine's east in a move that would constitute a war crime.

Videos on social media showed multiple explosions in rapid succession in the centre of the city of Kharkiv.

The city was hit by rockets fired from Russian positions today, with video showing the Serpnia area blanketed by explosions.

Graphic images reveal streets littered with the bodies of dead and badly wounded civilians. Cluster munitions were also used to destroy a pre-school in Okhtyrka, activist group Amnesty International said.

The human rights charity said ""a 220mm Uragan rocket dropped cluster munitions on the Sonechko nursery and kindergarten in the town of Okhtyrka in Sumy Oblast"" on Friday.

It added: ""The strike may constitute a war crime.""

Amnesty said three people were killed in the attack, including a child, while another child was wounded.

A Ukrainian minister said the city of Kharkiv had been ""massively fired upon"".

""Kharkiv has just been massively fired upon by grads (rockets),"" interior ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko wrote on Facebook.

""Dozens of dead and hundreds of wounded.""

Local media reported that at least five civilians and two soldiers had been killed, with 22 civilians and 20 soldiers injured.

A number of residential blocks were reportedly hit.

Footage shared on social media also showed a children's clothing factory in the city that had been razed to the ground by a Russian shell.

Kharkiv has a population of nearly 1.5 million people.

On Sunday Ukrainian forces said they fended off an attack from Russian forces, with regional governor Oleh Synehubov saying the city had been completely rid of Russian troops after intense fighting in the street.

A Ukrainian enduring shelling in Kyiv has urged Britons to ""close your eyes and imagine"" how it feels to experience bombs falling outside your home.

Vitaliy Rulyov, 36, from Trojeshchina, Desnyanskiy district of Kyiv, compared air raids in the capital to Britain during the Blitz but said his city is ""surviving and supporting one another"".

""To the people of Britain, I ask you that when you come home from work today, hug your family, hug your kids, close your eyes and for a second just imagine there are explosions outside your house,"" he said.

""Remember how your grandparents felt when they were bombed during the war with Hitler, because the British people suffered a lot... try to imagine that feeling for a second and I hope you never have to feel that feeling again.

""But here in Ukraine, we are feeling this right now and we're living through it.""

Watch: James O'Brien: Vladimir Putin has made a 'massive miscalculation' in Ukraine

Mr Rulyov said since the first attack on Thursday it has been ""impossible to distinguish what day of the week it is"" and instead counts the ""number of days of war"".

He described President Putin as ""sick"" and warned that the war is ""not about Ukraine"" and that ""people all over the world are in danger"" if the Russians are successful.

He also urged European partners to close the sky above Ukraine in a bid to stop the Russian missiles and warplanes from flying over.

Mr Rulyo - who attempted to enlist in the regional defence but was turned away as they already had enough people and weapons - said civilians in Kyiv are living through ""uncertainty and danger"" but added ""there is no fear"" and people are ""united.""

""We don't need anything except for medication, food and that kind of thing and I'm helping to provide that for now,"" he said.

""People are willing to do the job protecting this city and if Mr Putin wanted to scare Ukraine and divide it, well I think that he has done the opposite... people in Ukraine are united to overcome this dreadful time and hopefully we will see a peaceful sky again.""

Olena Vinnychenko, 43, who lives 2km outside Kyiv, said she will never be able to forgive Russia for the war.

""They killed a lot of people, a lot of children,"" she said.

And it's not the military operation as they are saying in their television... it's war. They're bombing us. They're killing us. And we can't forgive this.""

Ms Vinnychenko has been sheltering at her friends' house for four days along with six other families, including children.

She said the experience has been ""terrible"" and she has barely slept but added she is ""getting used"" to the sound of explosions and gunfire.

""Russian occupants are now on our territory so they can shoot, but we have guns to protect our families,"" she said.

""These guns are for animals (hunting) but also we can use them to protect ourselves.

""We don't panic, we are quiet, and our men are making territory protection on the streets of our neighbourhood.

She added: ""We are hoping for the best still because we can see that the world is supporting us.""

It comes as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned the next 24 hours would be ""crucial"" for his country.

The UN said at least 102 civilians have been killed - including a six-year-old girl who died when her home was shelled on Sunday - and over 300 injured.

The Ukraine health ministry claimed on Sunday that thousands of Russian troops had also died.

An estimated 500,000 civilians have fled the country since Putin invaded, according to the UN refugee agency.

On Sunday Putin put his nuclear deterrent forces on high alert - and on Monday a Kremlin spokesperson said the move was in response to comments made by UK foreign secretary Liz Truss.

It is not clear which comments he was referring to, but Ms Truss said on Sunday Putin could resort to ""the most unsavoury means"" and use ""even worse weapons"" if he felt his regime was threatened.

The TOS-1A, which Russia categorizes as a ""heavy flamethrower,"" is a unique type of multiple launch rocket system (MLRS) based on a T-72 tank chassis.

The TOS-1A has an infamous reputation based on the characteristics of the thermobaric rockets that it fires. There is also much misunderstanding of how it works and a good deal of speculation on how it’s likely to be used in this conflict, especially with the suggestion that Russia may be about to employ siege tactics in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, and even possibly Kyiv, its capital.

TOS-1A Rolls Into Ukraine

As early as February 24, the day Russia launched its large-scale invasion of Ukraine, cameras installed on the Belarus-Ukraine border revealed a TOS-1A among other military vehicles entering Ukraine.

Last Saturday, February 26, more footage began to emerge on social media showing TOS-1As, as well as other heavy artillery, heading toward Ukraine, this time moving south from Russia’s Belgorod region.

The same day, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio tweeted that “Russia has now deployed TOS-1A launchers to the outskirts of heavily populated areas.”

Most recently, the TOS-1 was identified near Mariupol, close to the Russian border, where there have also been reports of BM-21 Grad MLRS being used.

Other TOS-1As have also been spotted near Russia’s numerous fronts of its still very young invasion operation and the type was previously spotted in Russian-separatist-controlled eastern Ukraine in the past.

Recently, there were claims on social media that the TOS-1A was being used in the latest artillery strikes, including a massive, sustained barrage centered upon the hotly contested town of Vasylkiv, roughly 15 miles south of Kyiv. An enormous explosion here was the result of a fuel farm at Vasylkiv Air Base taking a direct hit, although some took this to be evidence of the use of the TOS-1A.

It seems unlikely, however, that the TOS-1A was employed on this occasion and, so far, we don’t have definitive evidence that it’s been used in the fighting here, or elsewhere in Ukraine... yet.

On the other hand, today the Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova, announced that Russia had used a “vacuum bomb” somewhere in Ukraine. This is typical shorthand to describe a thermobaric weapon, although it’s by no means clear what particular munition was being referred to.

Russia does produce thermobaric bombs, for aircraft use, including the TV-guided KAB-500-OD, although it is rarely seen in service. While “bomb” is not an accurate description of the TOS-1A's projectiles, it’s possible this was the weapon being referred to. Alternatively, the incident in question may not have involved a thermobaric weapon of any kind, and statements of this nature from Ukrainian officials during the conflict have not always been reliable.

TOS-1A: Terrifying Fact VS Fiction

The fact that Russian nomenclature describes the TOS-1A — which is nicknamed ‘Buratino’ by the troops, after the Russian equivalent of Pinocchio — as a flamethrower has led to descriptions of the weapon producing “a wall of napalm,” and “vaporizing human bodies.” In fact, the weapon has virtually nothing in common with traditional flamethrowers. Instead, this is a thermobaric, or fuel-air explosive (FAE) weapon, in the same class as certain U.S. weapons, like the AGM-114N Hellfire missile, with a special ‘augmented’ warhead, or the BLU-118/B that was used against cave complexes in Afghanistan. Essentially, this type of weapon uses oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a high-temperature explosion and a much more powerful blast wave over a longer duration than a conventional condensed explosive.

There have also been stories in the media that erroneously conflate the TOS-1A with the so-called “Father of All Bombs,” an enormous air-dropped thermobaric weapon. Despite reports of tests in the past, there is no evidence that such a weapon has ever actually been deployed.

Undoubtedly, however, the TOS-1A is a weapon that can have an enormous physiological effect on the enemy.

A firing exercise by Russian Ground Forces TOS-1A systems within the Southern Military District:

“The primary ... effect [created by the TOS-1’ss rockets] is a long-duration high-pressure blast wave which creates a vacuum – then precipitates a reverse wave,” according to the 2011 edition of U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command’s (TRADOC) unclassified World Equipment Guide (WEG). “These pressure/vacuum surges (up to 427 pounds per sq inch) cause a ripping effect on soft materials (such as airplane skin, radar surface, human lung tissue). Walls and surfaces within the affected area do not necessarily shield victims, rather cause multiple pressure waves, which amplify the tearing effects and can topple structures.”

""A secondary effect is high-temperature heat — 2,500-3,000° C. An incomplete explosion renders a near-devastating effect, wide-area long-duration high-temperature flame,” it continues. “Even those outside of the blast area will be rendered ineffective with debilitating mental and physical trauma.”

Each BM-1 launcher vehicle within the TOS-1A system carries 24 rockets of 220-millimeter caliber, which can reach a maximum range of 6 kilometers.

“The TOS-1 is designed primarily for use against emplacements, defilade areas (such as terrain folds and tunnels), fighting positions, ships, buildings, as well as personnel and other soft targets. High angles-of-fire and steep impact angles support use in defilade and urban areas,” according to TRADOC’s WEG. “Despite the seeming short range, the weapon was effectively used in Chechnya to disable defenders within a specific sector just prior to an assault, to halt assaults, and to level buildings.”

Clearly, there are now fears about Russia potentially using the TOS-1A in heavily populated areas, where its effect would be indiscriminate, perhaps as part of a psychological terror campaign to flush out the final resistance in a city.

In Ukraine, the TOS-1A would probably still be quite effective against troops on the battlefield. From the very beginning, the Soviets designed this weapon to provide general fire support alongside infantry and tanks. Its targets here would include enemy manpower in both open and closed firing positions, as well as light armored vehicles and soft-skinned support vehicles. It’s notable that, so far in the conflict, columns of lightly armored and unarmored Russian vehicles have been especially vulnerable to Ukrainian attack, whether by drone or by other means.

Today’s TOS-1A was preceded by the TOS-1, originally developed beginning in the late 1970s to provide a standoff weapon to be fielded by the Soviet military’s Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Protection Troops, which were also responsible for different types of incendiary weapons. The successors to these forces continue to operate the TOS-1A, as well as being responsible for the deployment of large smokescreens during major combat operations.

It seems only a small batch of the original TOS-1 were ever produced, with a capacity for 30 rockets, which had a maximum range of just 1.7 miles when fitted with a thermobaric warhead. The system was used in combat trials in Afghanistan in around 1987 and again in Chechnya in the 1990s.

Subsequently, production switched to the more numerous TOS-1A, which has been employed by Russia in Syria and also produced for export. Each TOS-1A system normally comprises a single BM-1 launcher vehicle and two TZM-T transporter/loader vehicles. The TZM-T is also mounted on a T-72 tank chassis and each provides 24 rocket reloads.

While the rockets themselves are unguided, the BM-1’s fire-control system includes an optical sight, a laser rangefinder, and a ballistic computer to provide a firing solution. Normally, all 24 rockets are fired in a salvo, within a space of 6 to 12 seconds, for the greatest destructive effect.

TOS-1A's Potential Use In Ukraine

Whether or not we see the TOS-1A deployed in an urban environment in Ukraine remains to be seen and will depend heavily on the course of the conflict in the days and weeks to come.

However, it’s clear that Russian forces are now using other MLRS systems in close proximity to civilian population centers, with evidence of rockets from Grad, Uragan, and Smerch systems having been identified already. These rockets do not carry thermobaric warheads but can be armed with submunitions, which are also notorious for their indiscriminate effects.

Earlier today Kharkiv was subjected to a large-scale bombardment by rocket artillery. In a Facebook post, the Ukrainian interior ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko stated: “Kharkiv has just been massively fired upon by Grads. Dozens of dead and hundreds of wounded.”

It has since become clear that this bombard included at least some 300mm rockets with cluster munition warheads fired by BM-30 Smerch launchers.

There has already been growing evidence that Russian forces have been carrying out indiscriminate attacks across Ukraine since the invasion began. “The Russian military has shown a blatant disregard for civilian lives by using ballistic missiles and other explosive weapons with wide-area effects in densely populated areas,” Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s secretary-general, said in a statement from February 25, after the opening wave of strikes against Kharkiv, and other objectives.

Kharkiv, in particular, has been earmarked by U.S. officials as the potential focus of Russian siege tactics — a type of warfare in which the TOS-1A has been engaged in previous conflicts, notably in Chechnya. In that kind of scenario, the TOS-1A could be used to uproot or otherwise disrupt the plans of the defending force, which would be expected to be holed up in urban areas, and it would clearly be a terrifying siege weapon. Even its use in the battle for Kyiv is quite possible.

With that in mind, and with continued reports of TOS-1As noted in or near urban areas, it’s certainly a possibility that these devastating weapons might be employed in such scenarios. We can only hope that this will not end up being the case.

(KYIV, Ukraine) — There is growing evidence that Ukraine is managing to inflict significant casualties on Russian forces as they try to advance deeper into the country — and that the swift strike Russia hoped to carry out on the capital, Kyiv, has been slowed by intense and popular resistance.

Russia hasn’t managed to make significant progress in the last two days. The main Russian force pushing down from Belarus towards Kyiv does not appear to have advanced closer towards the city since coming within about 20 miles, although smaller advanced groups have been fighting gun battles with Ukrainian forces inside the capital since at least Friday.

Ukraine’s military claims the Russian troops are struggling with fuel and logistics supplies. Images and videos of destroyed Russian military vehicles and tanks, which have been verified, have been circulating online.

One example of the effective Ukrainian resistance took place Sunday when Russia appeared to mount a half-hearted attempt to destroy resistance in Ukraine’s second city, Kharkiv.

Russian special forces units in light armored vehicles tried to push into Kharkiv after indiscriminately bombarding the city with artillery, but they were rapidly destroyed by Ukrainian troops and volunteer territorial defense, according to videos posted online.

Kharkiv’s Mayor Oleg Sinegubov on Sunday night pushed a triumphant message, saying that “control over Kharkiv is completely ours” and that Ukrainian forces had succeeded “in a full clearing of the city of the enemy.”

Sinegubov said dozens of Russian troops had surrendered with little fight, sometimes in whole groups of five to 10 men, with some abandoning their equipment.

A number of military analysts — including those that correctly predicted the invasion — believed Russia had hoped for a lightning “shock and awe” advance to the edge of Kyiv in the first days that would lead to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government surrendering without Russia needing to actually seize the city. Instead, the resistance is growing, officials said.

“It is clear they hoped to get Zelenskyy to surrender quickly without inflicting heavy casualties on the Ukrainian military [and] civilians. That failed, but their execution still appears to be fairly restrained,” Rob Lee, analyst from Kings College London’s War Department, wrote on Twitter on Sunday.

Lee said that strategy had now failed, and that Russia would have to move to a plan B, which he feared would mean “more force.”

Time is working against Russia. Ukrainian popular resistance is gaining in self-confidence, and the Russian piecemeal strategy so far has allowed cities more time to set up defenses, putting in place barricades and distributing thousands of weapons.

In Berdyansk, the only major city Russia has gained full control of, videos posted to social media Monday showed a crowd of residents angrily chanting a slogan insulting President Vladimir Putin at Russian troops guarding a government building on the main square.

At the same time, the international response is also growing, with more sanctions and moves aimed at crippling Russia’s economy, while European countries are sending more and more weapons to bolster the Ukrainian defense, with the European Union also announcing that for the first time it would provide Ukrainian officials with military support.

Russia has so far held back its main army and has been using its air and artillery power against military targets, avoiding widespread, intense bombardment against civilian areas. Analysts, including Lee, said Russia appeared to have initially sought to inflict limited casualties on Ukrainian civilians and the military, likely out of concern about backlash in Russia and making it harder to achieve a swift political change in Ukraine, as well as a stronger international reaction.

U.S. officials and independent analyst now fear if Russia’s attempt to overpower Ukraine quickly fails, it may turn to using more brute force to achieve it. That could mean unleashing indiscriminate artillery and airstrikes to destroy Ukraine’s military and terrorize civilians, as well as besieging cities.

That already appears to be happening in Kharkiv, where Russia in the last two days has fired heavy artillery, including “Grad” multiple rocket launchers onto the city, causing significant damage to civilian buildings.

“I think today we’ve seen a shift in Russian targeting towards critical civilian infrastructure, greater use of MLRS, and artillery in suburban areas. Unfortunately, my concern that this was going to get a lot more ugly and affect civilians is starting to materialize,” Michael Kofman, an analyst at CNA, who also predicted the invasion as likely, tweeted late Saturday.

U.S. officials caution, though, that Russia still has major combat power yet to be deployed, with roughly half its forces massed near Ukraine still not engaged. A massive 3-mile-long column of hundreds of vehicles has formed up in northern Ukraine after crossing from Belarus and appears to be moving towards Kyiv.
