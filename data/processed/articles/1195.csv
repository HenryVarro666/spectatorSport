Russian shelling of Europe's largest nuclear power plant on Friday prompted widespread dismay, with world leaders swiftly condemning the assault and the U.N. nuclear chief warning ""we are in completely uncharted waters."" Russian military forces have seized control of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant, according to Ukraine's nuclear agency, following a night of shelling that set a building ablaze at the complex. Authorities say the fire at the site has now been extinguished by emergency services and radiation levels are normal. Two security personnel were injured as a result of the attack. In response, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said: ""Europe needs to wake up."" ""We are issuing a warning, no country has ever shot at nuclear blocks except for Russia,"" Zelenskyy said in a video statement, according to a translation. ""For the first time ever in our history, in the history of humankind, the terrorist country has reverted to nuclear terror.""

Situated in the southeast of Ukraine, the Zaporizhzhya complex houses six of the country's 15 operational nuclear power reactors. These reactors produce about half of the country's electricity.

Reactors not affected

The U.N. nuclear chief said on Friday that it was understood the projectile that hit Zaporizhzhya came from Russian forces. Rafael Mariano Grossi, director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, warned the situation at the complex is ""very fragile"" and ""continues to be extremely tense and challenging."" ""It is important to say that all the safety systems of the six reactors at the plant were not affected and that there has been no release of radioactive material,"" Grossi said.

Both Russia and Ukraine are considering an offer of meeting at Chornobyl, he added: ""It is time for action ... we need to do something about this."" The aim of the proposed meeting was for both sides to recommit to the principles of nuclear safety. The State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine said personnel at the Zaporizhzhia facility were monitoring the condition of power units to ensure they could operate safely. It comes as Russia's invasion of Ukraine enters its ninth day and amid conflicting reports about which side controls the strategically important Black Sea port city of Kherson.

Global condemnation

World leaders condemned Russia's attack on the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the ""reckless actions"" of Russian President Vladimir Putin could ""directly threaten the safety of all of Europe."" U.S. President Joe Biden urged Moscow to stop its military activities around the site, while Canada's Justin Trudeau said the ""horrific attacks"" at the nuclear site were unacceptable and called on Russia to ""cease immediately."" All three heads of government spoke to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy by telephone. The IAEA has put its Incident and Emergency Centre in ""full response mode"" due to the situation at the nuclear site and appealed for a halt of the use of force. The U.N. agency had previously warned Russia's war with Ukraine had raised the risk of nuclear accidents and called for restraint from all actions that could jeopardize the safe operations of Ukraine's nuclear facilities.",https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/04/ukraine-nuclear-russian-troops-seize-control-of-zaporizhzhya-plant.html

The overnight assault caused a blaze at the facility, prompting fears over the safety of the plant and evoking painful memories in a country still scarred by the world’s worst nuclear accident, at Chernobyl in 1986. The site of that disaster is also under Russian control as of Feb. 24, 2022.

On March 4, Ukrainian authorities reported to the International Atomic Energy Agency that the fire at Zaporizhzhia had been extinguished and that Ukrainian employees were reportedly operating the plant under Russian orders. But safety concerns remain.

The Conversation asked Najmedin Meshkati, a professor and nuclear safety expert at the University of Southern California, to explain the risks of warfare taking place in and around nuclear power plants.

How safe was the Zaporizhzhia power plant before the Russian attack?

The facility at Zaporizhzhia is the largest nuclear plant in Europe, and one of the largest in the world. It has six pressurized water reactors, which use water to both sustain the fission reaction and cool the reactor. These differ from the reaktor bolshoy moshchnosty kanalny reactors at Chernobyl, which used graphite instead of water to sustain the fission reaction. RBMK reactors are not seen as very safe, and there are only eight remaining in use in the world, all in Russia.

The reactors at Zaporizhzhia are of moderately good design. And the plant has a decent safety record, with a good operating background.

Ukraine authorities tried to keep the war away from the site by asking Russia to observe a 30-kilometer safety buffer. But Russian troops surrounded the facility and then seized it.

What are the risks to a nuclear plant in a conflict zone?

Nuclear power plants are built for peacetime operations, not wars.

The worst thing that could happen is if a site is deliberately or accidentally shelled and the containment building – which houses the nuclear reactor – is hit. These containment buildings are not designed or built for deliberate shelling. They are built to withstand a minor internal explosion of, say, a pressurized water pipe. But they are not designed to withstand a huge explosion.

It is not known whether the Russian forces deliberately shelled the Zaporizhzhia plant. It may have been inadvertent, caused by a stray missile. But we do know they wanted to capture the plant.

If a shell hit the plant’s spent fuel pool – which contains the still-radioactive spent fuel – or if fire spread to the spent fuel pool, it could release radiation. This spent fuel pool isn’t in the containment building, and as such is more vulnerable.

As to the reactors in the containment building, it depends on the weapons being used. The worst-case scenario is that a bunker-buster missile breaches the containment dome – consisting of a thick shell of reinforced concrete on top of the reactor – and explodes. That would badly damage the nuclear reactor and release radiation into the atmosphere. And because of any resulting fire, sending in firefighters would be difficult. It could be another Chernobyl.

What are the concerns going forward?

The biggest worry was not the fire at the facility. That did not affect the containment buildings and has been extinguished.

The safety problems I see now are twofold:

1) Human error

The workers at the facility are now working under incredible stress, reportedly at gunpoint. Stress increases the chance of error and poor performance.

One concern is that the workers will not be allowed to change shifts, meaning longer hours and tiredness. We know that a few days ago at Chernobyl, after the Russians took control of the site, they did not allow employees – who usually work in three shifts – to swap out. Instead, they took some workers hostage and didn’t allow the other workers to attend their shifts.

At Zaporizhzhia we may see the same.

There is a human element in running a nuclear power plant – operators are the first and last layers of defense for the facility and the public. They are the first people to detect any anomaly and to stop any incident. Or if there’s an accident, they will be the first to heroically try to contain it.

2) Power failure

The second problem is that the nuclear plant needs constant electricity, and that is harder to maintain in wartime.

Even if you shut down the reactors, the plant will need off-site power to run the huge cooling system to remove the residual heat in the reactor and bring it to what is called a “cold shutdown.” Water circulation is always needed to make sure the spent fuel doesn’t overheat.

Spent fuel pools also need constant circulation of water to keep them cool. And they need cooling for several years before being put in dry casks. One of the problems in the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan was the emergency generators, which replaced lost off-site power, got inundated with water and failed. In situations like that you get “station blackout” – and that is one of the worst things that could happen. It means no electricity to run the cooling system.

In that circumstance, the spent fuel overheats and its zirconium cladding can cause hydrogen bubbles. If you can’t vent these bubbles they will explode, spreading radiation.

If there is a loss of outside power, operators will have to rely on emergency generators. But emergency generators are huge machines – finicky, unreliable gas guzzlers. And you still need cooling waters for the generators themselves.

My biggest worry is that Ukraine suffers from a sustained power grid failure. The likelihood of this increases during a conflict, because pylons may come down under shelling or gas power plants might get damaged and cease to operate. And it is unlikely that Russian troops themselves will have fuel to keep these emergency generators going – they don’t seem to have enough fuel to run their own personnel carriers.

How else does a war affect the safety of nuclear plants?

One of the overarching concerns is that war degrades safety culture, which is crucial in running a plant. I believe that safety culture is analogous to the human body’s immune system, which protects against pathogens and diseases; and because of the pervasive nature of safety culture and its widespread impact, according to psychologist James Reason, “it can affect all elements in a system for good or ill.”

It is incumbent upon the leadership of the plant to strive for immunizing, protecting, maintaining and nurturing the healthy safety culture of the nuclear plant.

War adversely affects the safety culture in a number of ways. Operators are stressed and fatigued and may be scared to death to speak out if something is going wrong. Then there is the maintenance of a plant, which may be compromised by lack of staff or unavailability of spare parts. Governance, regulation and oversight – all crucial for the safe running of a nuclear industry – are also disrupted, as is local infrastructure, such as the capability of local firefighters. In normal times you might have been able to extinguish the fire at Zaporizhzhia in five minutes. But in war, everything is harder.

So what can be done to better protect Ukraine’s nuclear power plants?

This is an unprecedented and volatile situation. The only solution is a no-fight zone around nuclear plants. War, in my opinion, is the worst enemy of nuclear safety.

MUKACHEVO, Ukraine — A top U.S. official said Friday that a Russian assault at a major Ukrainian nuclear facility had nearly caused devastating consequences for the world, even as the mayor of Mariupol warned that the port city was “on the verge of a humanitarian catastrophe.” Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight West of Mariupol in Kherson, a regional capital and the first major city to fall to Russian forces, a city council member said Russian equipment and soldiers were “absolutely everywhere” as supplies of food and other necessities begin to dwindle.

And in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, Russian troops have fired cluster munitions into at least three residential neighborhoods, according to a Human Rights Watch report released Friday.

The grim conditions on the ninth day of Russia’s invasion spawned an urgent appeal late Friday from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who urged Europeans to “take to the streets” to back his battered country.

“Do not be silent. Support Ukraine. Because if Ukraine does not survive, the whole of Europe will not survive,” Zelensky said.

As demonstrators in multiple European cities heeded the president’s call, Russia’s international isolation grew.

The country’s Internet censor on Friday announced that it would block access to Facebook, cutting off a key source of outside information to Russian citizens. The BBC said it would suspend reporting from Russia in response to new legislation that it said “appears to criminalize the process of independent journalism.” Major U.S. news networks, including CNN, ABC and CBS, also said they would stop reporting from Russia.

International companies such as Airbnb, Microsoft and Cogent Communications — a key Internet provider — also cut ties.

Pressure on Moscow could escalate further in the coming days, with the Biden administration weighing a ban on crude oil imports. The United Nations’ top human rights body, meanwhile, voted decisively to set up a commission to investigate alleged rights violations by Russia, amid growing reports of potential war crimes.

But the limits to international willingness to come to Ukraine’s defense were also laid freshly bare, with NATO’s senior leader once again rebuffing Ukrainian demands to set up a no-fly zone.

The exact number of casualties caused by more than a week of fighting has been impossible to verify. The U.N. human rights office said Friday that at least 331 civilians had been killed, while Ukraine’s emergency services put the number of civilian fatalities much higher, at more than 2,000.

A U.N. statement said most of the casualties had been caused “by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and missile and airstrikes.”

Russia has acknowledged the deaths of about 500 of its troops, while Ukrainian officials claim that as many as 10,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or captured.

Russia’s seizure early Friday of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power facility, Europe’s largest nuclear plant, came after a projectile set part of the complex on fire, raising fears across Europe of a catastrophic accident.

The U.N. nuclear watchdog reported that the blaze had not affected “essential” equipment and that Ukraine’s regulator reported no change in surrounding radiation levels. U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm tweeted that the Energy Department also had seen no elevated radiation readings.

“The plant’s reactors are protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down,” Granholm wrote. Even so, the blaze sparked international alarm and underscored the perils of a war fought around nuclear sites.

The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said the world “narrowly averted a nuclear catastrophe” and thanked Ukrainian operators for keeping nuclear reactors safe.

“Russia’s attack last night put Europe’s largest nuclear power [plant] at grave risk,” she said. “It was incredibly reckless and dangerous.”

Zelensky said his country had “survived a night that could have stopped history” and that the attack on the nuclear facility could have been as bad as “six Chernobyls.”

Russia’s ambassador to the United Nations denied reports that the Russian military shelled the reactor, saying his country’s troops were actually offering “protection” for the facility — a claim that Western ambassadors dismissed.

In Mariupol, Russian forces have been engaged in a “bombardment of critical civilian infrastructure” aimed at forcing the city to surrender, a senior western intelligence official said.

The city’s mayor, Vadym Boychenko, said officials were hoping that talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials would establish a “period of silence” to restore utilities such as electricity and water. “We are simply being destroyed,” he said on his Telegram channel, noting the city has been under “merciless bombardment” from Russian forces over the past five days.

Kherson, meanwhile, faces dire consequences if a humanitarian corridor is not opened soon to allow civilians to be evacuated, and for food and medicine to be delivered, the secretary of the city council said.

“In Kherson, we are running out of food — literally, we can still last for maybe three, four days,” the city council secretary, Galina Luhova, said by telephone. “We’re running out of medicines, we’re out of baby food, we are running out of diapers, and we are running out of first aid in hospitals.”

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz spoke Friday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling on him to “immediately cease all hostilities” and allow access for humanitarian aid to Ukraine, according to a readout of the conversation from Berlin.

With the conflict now in its second week and Russia sending nearly all of its assembled military power into neighboring Ukraine, satellite images are providing glimpses of the scale of the invading force, as well as the devastation the fighting has wrought. Analysis of satellite imagery by the U.S. firm Maxar Technologies shows bridges and roads damaged and homes destroyed in towns and cities across the country.

In Chernihiv, a strategic northern city on a highway that links the Ukraine-Belarus border with Kyiv, the capital, and where a fierce battle has been waged in recent days, the images show damaged roads, bridges and homes. Some factories appear to have been leveled. On Friday, Chernihiv’s regional authority said in a Facebook post that Russian strikes killed 47 people, including nine women.

The images also continue to show a long Russian armored column north of Kyiv that has remained stalled because of what Western officials say are logistical challenges and fierce resistance by Ukrainian forces, including the destruction of a bridge.

“We certainly believe that the Ukrainians blowing up that bridge absolutely had an effect on stopping and curtailing the movement of that convoy,” a senior U.S. defense official said. “But we also believe that they have hit the convoy at other places as well in direct attacks.”

The convoy may also have stalled because Russians have not been able to seize the suburbs west of Kyiv, where antitank weapons have littered roads with destroyed vehicles and dead Russian troops. A significant blow to the Russian forces in the area are losses among its airborne soldiers, said Rob Lee, a Russia military expert and a senior fellow with the Foreign Policy Research Institute. Airborne troops are expected to move quickly against the enemy, but their lightly armored vehicles have become a burden as the troops have struggled to gain the initiative.

The convoy, consisting of combat and logistics vehicles, appears destined to help encircle Kyiv. But if the defenders can hold, Lee said, “they will stymie forces trying to begin the siege.”

Alarm over the fate of Ukraine’s cities has intensified amid growing evidence that Russian forces are indiscriminately targeting urban centers.

“We have seen the use of cluster bombs and we have seen reports of use of other types of weapons which would be in violation of international law,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters in Brussels on Friday.

In its report Friday, Human Rights Watch said it had documented the use of cluster munitions on the basis of two witness interviews and the analysis of 40 videos and images. Some of these sources show the “explosion signatures and rocket remnants” consistent with the delivery of cluster munitions from 9M55K Smerch rockets, the group added.

Because of the indiscriminate nature of cluster munitions — they scatter over a wide area small bomblets that could explode even after the fighting has ended — Human Rights Watch claimed that Russia may have committed a war crime by using them.

“Using cluster munitions in populated areas shows a brazen and callous disregard for people’s lives,” said Steve Goose, the arms director at Human Rights Watch. “If these deadly acts were carried out either intentionally or recklessly, they would be war crimes.”

The United States, which is out of step with many of its allies in abstaining from a treaty banning cluster weapons, has said for days it cannot verify they are being used by Russians in Ukraine.

Russian forces have launched more than 500 missiles of all sizes since the invasion began, the Pentagon said Friday, many of which were fired from inside the territory of Russia and Belarus.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in Brussels as part of a trip to Europe this week, said conditions for Ukrainian civilians will only deteriorate in the days to come. “The terrible expectation is that the suffering we’ve already seen is likely to get worse before it gets better,” Blinken said.

3,f87f5944-f771-4b56-88e5-6518d04cdba4,[],,"Nuclear power generation made up about 19% of the country’s total electricity generation in 2019. NPPs are operated by the state enterprise Russian State Concern for Generation of Electric and Thermal Power at Nuclear Power Plants (Rosenergoatom).

Figure 2 shows a map of NPPs in the Russian Federation. Table 5 shows the current status of the Russian Federation’s NPPs. In total, 38 power units with an installed capacity of 30.3 GW are operated at 11 NPPs in the Russian Federation, consisting of the following:

Most reactors are being licensed for lifetime extension. Half of the Russian Federation’s nuclear generation in 2015 came from units which had been upgraded for long term operation and were operating beyond their initial design lifetimes (of around 30 years), mostly with 15 year extensions initially. Twenty-four of 34 reactors operating in 2015 had been upgraded with lifetime extensions, adding 3 GW(e) of generating capacity. Of the other ten, five were being upgraded and five were relatively new.

Generally, the Russian Federation’s reactors were originally licensed for 30 years from first power. Late in 2000, plans were announced for lifetime extensions of 12 first generation reactors (Leningrad 1 and 2, Kursk 1 and 2, Kola 1 and 2, Bilibino 1–4 and Novovoronezh 3 and 4), totalling 5.7 GW(e), necessitating major investment in refurbishment. In 2014, a new state programme on licence extension was approved, bringing standards into line with international ones.

Through the end of 2011, 15 year extensions had been achieved for 17 units totalling 9.8 GW(e). Through mid-2016, operational licence extensions had been implemented for 24 units, totalling 16 242 MW(e): Beloyarsk 3, Novovoronezh 3–5, Kola 1–4, Kalinin 1, Balakovo 1, Kursk 1–4, Leningrad 1–4, Smolensk 1 and 2 and Bilibino 1–4. Projects for Balakovo 2–4, Kalinin 2 and Smolensk 3 will be carried out by 2023.

WWER-440 units have generally received 15 year life extensions. Kola 2 is undergoing safety analysis, with a goal to extend its licence to 60 years, and Kola 1 is also expected to be licensed beyond 45 years after annealing the reactor pressure vessel. The Kola 3 licence extension to 2026 (45 years) was confirmed in February 2016 after upgrading work. Novovoronezh 4 is expected to be licensed to 60 years using cannibalized parts from Unit 3, shut down at the end of 2016.

Most WWER-1000 units are expected to have 30 year licence extensions. In 2015, Balakovo 1 was licensed to 60 years, and intentions for Units 2–4 are similar. Kalinin 2 and Smolensk 3 are expected to have a 30 year licence extension by 2025.

In 2006, Rosatom said it was considering 15 year lifetime extensions and uprating of all 11 of its operating RBMK reactors; 10 had licence extensions by mid-2016. Following significant design modifications made after the accident at the Chornobyl NPP, as well as extensive refurbishment, including replacement of fuel channels, a 45 year lifetime is seen as realistic for most of the 1000 MW(e) units. In 2011, these units provided 47.5% of the Russian Federation’s nuclear generated electricity.

For older RBMK units, service lifetime performance recovery operations involve correcting deformation of the graphite stack. After dismantling the pressure tubes, longitudinal cutting of a limited number of graphite columns returns the graphite stack geometry to a condition that meets the initial design requirements. The procedure will give each of these older reactors at least three years of extra operation, and the procedure may then be repeated. Leningrad 1 was the first reactor to undergo this procedure in 2012–2013, followed by the Kursk and Smolensk units. In 2017, work was due to start on restoring lifetime performance of the graphite stacks. All three Smolensk units are set for a 45 year operating lifetime.

Most reactors are being uprated. The July 2012 Energy Ministry draft plan envisaged increasing the power of WWER-440 units to 107%, that of RBMKs to 105% and that of WWER-1000 units to 104–110% (revised to 107–110% in 2013).

In May 2015, Rosenergoatom said it had completed uprating all WWER-1000 reactors to 104% of rated power and was starting to raise levels to 107% using the advanced TVS-2M fuel design, starting with Balakovo 4. Earlier, uprating of 5% for WWER-440 reactors (but 7% for Kola 4) had been achieved, and in 2015, Kola 3 went to 107%. Kalinin Units 1–3 are quoted at 1075 MW(e) gross after uprate, and Unit 4 started pilot commercial operation at 104% of rated power in February 2015, with a 40 MW(e) increase.

Rosenergoatom has been investigating further uprates of WWER-1000 units to 107–110% of original capacity, using Balakovo 4 as a pilot plant through 2014. For the V-320 units, pilot commercial operation at 104% power is carried out over three fuel campaigns, with the reactor and other system parameters being monitored and relevant data collected. After this period, a cumulative 104% power operation report is produced for each plant. The regulator Rostechnadzor will then assess safety and possibly license commercial operation at the higher power level.

Rosenergoatom is considering the introduction of a 24 month fuel cycle at new nuclear power units. Previously, WWER-1000 reactors operated for 12 months without refuelling, and from 2008 the reactors were all converted to an 18 month fuel cycle. WWER-440s still use a 12 month cycle. To achieve 24 months in new units, the design of WWERs will need to be changed and fuel enrichment would need to be increased from 4–4.5% U-235 to 6–7% in the WWER-TOI design.

The R&D Institute of Power Engineering was preparing plans for a 5% uprating of the later Leningrad, Kursk and Smolensk RBMK units. For Leningrad 2–4, fuel enriched to an average of 3% instead of 2.4% would allow a 5% increase in power, and Rostechnadzor authorized trials of the new fuel in Unit 2. Following this, it was to consider authorizing a 5% uprate for long term operation. However, in May 2012 Rosenergoatom flagged problems with ageing of the graphite moderator (most acute at Leningrad 1), questioned proceeding with uprates of older units, and said it would consider derating individual units where problems such as pressure tube distortion were apparent owing to graphite swelling. Leningrad 1 would be derated to 80% to prolong its operating life; work to restore its graphite stack and extend its service life was completed late in 2013. Similar work would then be done on all first generation RBMKs, since these are so important economically to Rosenergoatom. However, future RBMK operation might be at a reduced capacity of 80% across all units. The successful repair of Leningrad 1 removed the pressure for accelerated replacement of old RBMK units. In December 2018 Leningrad 1 was shut down, followed by unit 2 in November 2020.",https://cnpp.iaea.org/countryprofiles/Russia/Russia.htm
4,f87f5944-f771-4b56-88e5-6518d04cdba4,[],,"Even amid the ghastly images coming out of Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion on February 24, the footage broadcast from Enerhoder on the night of March 3 was stunning: Russian forces shelling Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, a massive facility with six nuclear reactors. Nickolas Roth, senior director for NTI’s Nuclear Materials Security program, explains what happened at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant that terrifying night, what could have happened, and what the long-term implications are for nuclear security and nonproliferation efforts around the world.

This post was updated on March 8, 2022

What happened at Zaporizhzhia?

On March 3, Russian forces attacked the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Enerhoder, a small city in southern Ukraine. The plant was shelled by Russian troops throughout the night damaging the site and injuring two people. According to the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine, Ukraine’s nuclear regulatory body, it was initially unclear how safety systems were impacted and “additional assessments based on the results of the comprehensive inspections” were needed. Reportedly, as a result of the attack, “the reactor compartment building” of reactor Unit 1 was damaged, two artillery shells hit the facility for dry storage of nuclear fuel, and a fire that was eventually extinguished “severely damaged the training center building.” Fortunately, at the moment, the regulator has also said “changes in the radiation situation in Zaporizhzhia region have not been registered, [and] gamma radiation background is within the standard limits.” Zaporizhzhia is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, with six reactors, and multiple dry cask storage and spent fuel sites.

What’s so dangerous about a nuclear plant being attacked?

This is the first time there has been a full-scale war in a country with a significant nuclear power infrastructure. There are 15 commercial nuclear reactors spread across four sites in Ukraine, making up more than 50% of the country’s energy supply. There have been attacks on nuclear facilities throughout the country. Nuclear power plants are equipped with safety systems and the reactor structures are extremely resilient, but if the cooling at a reactor or spent fuel pool is removed, the stakes are high. A meltdown at a reactor or a fire within a tightly-packed spent fuel pool could result in widespread radiological contamination, putting people’s health and the environment around the reactor at risk.

Another cause for concern is whether personnel can operate the reactors safely during this crisis. According to reports, the situation at occupied power plants is bad and getting worse. Plant managers need to get approval for any actions, including those related to reactor operations. Ukraine’s nuclear regulator has said it is now having problems communicating with staff at Zaporizhzhya as phone lines, emails, and fax machines are no longer operating. Similar problems occurred in the aftermath of the 2011 nuclear catastrophe in Fukushima when Japan demonstrated that responding to plant emergencies during a broader crisis is incredibly difficult. The tsunami and earthquake there destroyed buildings and safety and security systems; disrupted communications within the plant and to outsiders; injured personnel; and impeded outside responders from providing support. Like Fukushima, it likely also would be very difficult to respond to a plant emergency during a firefight or a war. If operators are “working at gunpoint,” as some reports suggest, they are operating under extreme duress, which could further impact safety and security at the site. This situation is not sustainable.

It’s worth noting that, while an accident at a nuclear power plant could spread radiation across hundreds of square miles, the impact would be different from the blast, fire, initial radiation, and long-term radioactive fallout caused by a nuclear weapon.

What has the response been?

The current crisis highlights the critical leadership and information-sharing role that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) plays around the world. The IAEA is serving as a key conduit for information about safety and security of nuclear facilities in Ukraine through its periodic updates, and Director General Rafael Grossi is playing an important political leadership role. He has called for a “halt to the use of force” at Enerhodar and for military forces to refrain from violence near the plant. The Director General has also said he was prepared to travel to the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant to negotiate a commitment from all parties ensuring the safety and security of all Ukrainian nuclear power plants, stating, “It is high time to stop an armed conflict from putting nuclear facilities at severe risk, potentially endangering the safety of people and the environment in Ukraine and beyond. Words must mean something—it is time for action.”

What are the broader implications for nuclear security and nonproliferation?

The crisis is still unfolding in Ukraine, and the outcome for nuclear power plants in the region is extremely uncertain. One thing already clear is that Russia’s illegal, immoral, and profoundly dangerous attacks on Ukrainian nuclear sites raise new questions about global nuclear security efforts. This will likely have widespread implications on the institutions and agreements that support stronger nuclear security around the world, and it may make future nuclear security and nonproliferation efforts more difficult.

Later this month, officials from around the world are scheduled to gather for the first-ever review of the Amended Convention on Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, the only treaty requiring countries to protect nuclear materials and nuclear facilities. This will be a pivotal moment for the future of nuclear security and the international legal and institutional architecture that supports it. During the review, states will discuss the treaty’s implementation, adequacy and the broader nuclear security environment referred to as the “prevailing situation.” Russia’s attacks on nuclear facilities are likely to have an enormous impact on this dialogue.

The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making “the most important decision of their life -- to fight.”

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.”

Zelenskiy noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.”

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

On the night of March 3, more than 4 million people watched a livestream of security camera footage from the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. Located along the southern bank of the Dnieper River, the six reactors at Zaporizhzhia constitute the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Bright flashes illuminated columns of armored vehicles, which were otherwise muted against the grayscale footage.

Before the invasion, Ukraine derived nearly half its electrical power from nuclear power plants, and of that, nearly half the capacity comes from Zaporizhzhia. With the reactor held by Russian forces and cities like Mariupol under siege from Russian forces, Zaporizhzhia’s capture stands as both a first in the history of warfare, and as part of a much longer pattern: the denial of electrical power to countries under invasion.

During the attack, a projectile hit a training building on the power plant campus, setting it on fire. The reactors remained unharmed and the fire was later extinguished. By the morning of March 4, the site was reportedly under Russian control, with a Ukrainian authority claiming the management of the facility was operating under gunpoint.

In the early hours of March 4, the plant “became the first operating civil nuclear power plant to come under armed attack,” the World Nuclear Association declared in a statement, going on to note that “The Additional Protocol of 1979 to the Geneva Conventions contains in Article 56 a provision stating that nuclear power plants ‘shall not be made the object of attack, even where these objects are military objectives, if such an attack may cause the release of dangerous forces and consequent severe losses among the civilian population.’”

When it fell, Zaporizhzhia became the second nuclear power plant captured by Russia since the invasion began. A week earlier, on Feb. 24, Russian forces had captured Chernobyl (“Chornobyl,” in Ukrainian), the long since decommissioned site of the infamous nuclear reactor disaster. Chernobyl last produced electricity in the year 2000, but the site is still staffed to manage the work of decommissioning, like sustaining cooling pools for spent fuel rods.

“Regarding reports earlier today of higher radiation measurements at the Chornobyl site,” the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a February 25 release, “Ukraine’s regulatory authority said that they may have been caused by heavy military vehicles stirring up soil still contaminated from the 1986 accident.”

The same geographic concerns that situated Chernobyl along the Pripyat River north of Kyiv also suggests why so many tanks and military vehicles had driven by: It’s a relatively cleared, dry area along a highway north of the capital, a traversable break from the surrounding marshlands. Kyiv remains a pivotal objective of Russian forces in the war, and the road through Chernobyl is one of the most direct paths for forces aiming to encircle the city.

Even decommissioned, important work continues at Chernobyl, like the safe monitoring of cooling pools for spent fuel. A loss of power to the site, reported by Ukraine’s minister of foreign affairs Dmytro Kuleba, could threaten its operation, though the cooling pools should maintain an effective temperature for weeks or months, depending on the estimate. The IAEA noted that the lack of power is also a strain on the staff and guards working in captivity at the facility.

But Zaporizhzhia, a live reactor complex located between Russia’s Crimean holdings and its advancing forces from the declared Donetsk and Luhansk republics, presents a much more striking security challenge than the inactive Chernobyl. Managing the safety of a nuclear power plant requires technical skill and the ability to properly and thoroughly follow safety procedures. Doing so under hostile military occupation, while that same military is responsible for attacks on the country, might make such safety procedures impossible, and difficult to verify.

“According to reports, the situation at occupied power plants is bad and getting worse. Plant managers need to get approval for any actions, including those related to reactor operations,” writes Nickolas Roth of the Nuclear Threat Initiative, a U.S.-based nonprofit aimed at reducing nuclear and biological threats. “Ukraine’s nuclear regulator has said it is now having problems communicating with staff at Zaporizhzhya as phone lines, emails, and fax machines are no longer operating.”

Only one of the reactors at Zaporizhzhia was operational at the time of the attack, thanks to regular maintenance outages, controlled shutdowns, and reserve operation. Reactors are designed to withstand many kinds of powerful impacts, like storms and even airliner crashes, so it remains unlikely that an errant shell from a battle would be catastrophic.

Instead, a deeper concern from the hostile occupation of Zaporizhzhia is that merely being held in Russian hands will lead to denying electricity to civilians in the country. Invading militaries have destroyed or captured power plants before, but never one like this. It’s a grim signal, as Russia’s invasion moves from first forays to grinding sieges.

On 4 March, Russian forces attacked Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant near Enerhodar, in the country’s southeast. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), reported that a building on the site had been hit by a missile and had caught fire. The fire was put out without having caused any direct harm to the reactors, and detectors continue to report normal radiation levels, he said in a press conference at the IAEA’s headquarters in Vienna.

But the incident has highlighted the possible dangers of warfare around nuclear sites, he and others say. Ukraine has 15 working nuclear reactors, which ordinarily produce roughly half of the country’s electricity. With 6 reactors and a capacity of nearly 6 gigawatts, Zaporizhzhia is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. It is now occupied by Russian forces, as is Chernobyl — the site of the worst nuclear accident in history, which took place in 1986.

Nuclear experts gave Nature their assessments of the possible dangers.

Damage from an accidental hit is unlikely

The reactors at Zaporizhzhia have a modern design. Unlike the Chernobyl reactor, each is enclosed in a pressurized steel vessel, which in turn is housed inside a massive reinforced-concrete containment structure. (The design is called VVER — the Russian acronym for water–water energetic reactor.)

The plants also have multiple safety back-up systems, says Michael Bluck, director of the Centre for Nuclear Engineering at Imperial College London. He says that it would be very alarming if the Russian forces were deliberately trying to breach the containment structure, but that catastrophic damage from an accidental hit is unlikely. “If a missile goes astray, I’m less worried about [that]. These are very robust structures,” he says.

Koji Okamoto, a nuclear-safety researcher at the University of Tokyo, agrees. “The containment structure may have a resistance to normal weapons,” he says.

And even at the site of the Chernobyl disaster, the risk of accidental radioactive releases is limited, according to Cheryl Rofer, a retired nuclear scientist based in Santa Fe, New Mexico. “The dangerous material in it is in the basement of the reactor building, protected by the remains of that building and many tons of concrete that have been poured over it,” she wrote in a post on her blog. The ruins of the reactor that exploded in 1986 are enclosed in a massive 63-metre-tall steel and concrete shell called the sarcophagus. “I suspect that a direct artillery hit could breach the shell and allow a small amount of radioactive contaminants to escape, but that solid mass of melted fuel elements, containing uranium and plutonium, is inaccessible,” she wrote.

Spent-fuel ponds are a hazard

Most nuclear power plants — including that at Zaporizhzhia — have pools of water where spent fuel rods are kept as they cool down. Damage to one of these pools, whether accidental or intentional, could cause the water to leak out or boil off. The rods would then overheat and start a fire, several scientists have warned.

Although not comparable to the Chernobyl disaster, such a fire could be hazardous to people in the vicinity of the plant, and even to those further afield. “Russia needs to keep in mind that the prevailing winds are towards Russia,” Rofer tells Nature.

One mitigating factor is that any fuel rods that have been in the pool for several weeks or months are less dangerous than they were at the beginning, because the main cancer-causing isotope — iodine-131 — decays quickly, Bluck points out. At the IAEA press conference, Grossi said that no issues had been reported with Zaporizhzhia’s spent-fuel ponds.

Outside power and cooling must be maintained

As of 4 March, five of Zaporizhzhia’s six reactors had been shut down, Grossi reported. But even powered down, a reactor that’s still loaded with fuel is not completely without risk. Under normal operations, uranium nuclei in the fuel rods undergo fission, or break up, leaving behind nuclei of lighter elements. These isotopes accumulate during the lifetime of the rods, and many of them are highly radioactive, continuing to produce heat even after the reactor is shut down.

This means that the core of a reactor that has just been shut down must be actively cooled, which requires power, normally taken from the grid, to keep water circulating around the core. “You have to remove the decay heat,” Bluck says. “If you don’t cool it until it’s gone, then the core will overheat.” If the reactors’ active cooling suddenly stopped, plants such as Zaporizhzhia could face a scenario analogous to what happened at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Japan, when power was cut off in the aftermath of the 11 March 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, and three reactors melted down.

A similar event could occur if there is damage to the systems — including pumps, heat exchangers and back-up diesel generators — that provide active cooling and are outside a reactor’s protective containment structure, says Okamoto. “Any nuclear reactor could be damaged when coolants are lost.” There are safety systems in place at Ukrainian plants that make the reactors resilient to this damage. “VVER-1000 has several alternative cooling systems,” he says. “So it will not immediately be dangerous.” However, he points out that active cooling might be required for more than ten days after a reactor is shut down. It is unclear whether back-up cooling systems would be able to last that long.

Several specialists told Nature that even if a reactor core were to melt down, it might not cause a large release of radioactive materials. The main impact of such a crisis could be related to psychology and how people — including politicians and policymakers — react. Many Europeans still remember the days when Chernobyl’s radioactive cloud spread over the continent. “People do not judge the risk of radiation well, and they are much more frightened, frequently, than they need to be,” Rofer says.",https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00660-z

Those concerns were quickly downplayed by experts, who warned against comparisons with the plant at Chernobyl, where the world's worst nuclear disaster occurred in 1986.

Modern plants are significantly safer than older ones like Chernobyl, they said. But analysts nonetheless expressed horror that Russia's violent invasion of Ukraine has spilled into nuclear facilities, a development with few recent parallels.

And the operator and regulator of the site have communicated that the situation on the ground is ""extremely tense and challenging,"" according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

""No country besides Russia has ever fired upon an atomic power plant's reactors. The first time, the first time in history,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a Facebook post.

The IAEA called for fighting around the facility to end, and world leaders were swift in their criticism of Russia's move.

Radioactive material was not released from the plant, but it was a ""close call,"" Rafael Grossi, the IAEA director-general, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour Friday.

Following the Russian attack, ""there was great alarm if the physical integrity of the nuclear power installation had been compromised, with the ... possible risk that that entails,"" Grossi said.

Grossi had earlier told reporters that what happens next at Zaporizhzhia is ""a situation that is very difficult to sustain, very fragile"" while there is an active military operation and Russian forces in control. ""This is unprecedented,"" he said. ""Completely uncharted waters.""

What happened at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant?

Reports of an attack on the facility emerged early Friday morning, with video of the scene showing bursts of gunfire apparently directed at the Zaporizhzhia plant before dawn.

""Russian army is firing from all sides upon Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe,"" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted.

A large number of Russian tanks and infantry ""broke through the block-post"" to Enerhodar, a few kilometers from the Zaporizhzhia power plant, according to Grossi.

A Russian projectile then hit a building within the site of the plant, causing a localized fire, but none of the reactors were nearby and they were unaffected, the IAEA chief said.

In a Facebook post early Friday, Zelensky accused Russian troops of committing a ""terror attack"" by intentionally firing at the power plant -- potentially risking the lives of millions.

""Russian tanks, equipped with thermal imagery, are shooting at the atomic blocks. They know what they are shooting at. They've been preparing for this (attack),"" Zelensky said in the post, adding ""our guys are keeping the atomic power station secure.""

In a statement Friday morning local time, the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate (SNRI) confirmed the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine was occupied by Russian military forces, but said officials remained in contact with plant management.

The power plant's six reactors remain intact, though the compartment auxiliary buildings for reactor unit 1 had been damaged, the SNRI said in its statement. Four of the remaining units are being cooled down while one unit is providing power, the statement said.

Separately, Ukraine's nuclear power operator, Energoatom, said the ""administrative building and the checkpoint at the station are under occupiers' control."" It said staff are working on the power units to ensure stable operation.

How dangerous was the attack?

Ukrainian officials quickly sounded the alarm about the potential implications of the attack. Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said that ""if (the plant) blows up, it will be 10 times larger than Chernobyl,"" and Zelensky said that such an incident would mean ""the end of Europe.""

But experts were quick to stress that they did not believe a reactor could blow up, pointing out fundamental differences between Chernobyl and the Zaporizhzhia plant.

The IAEA said Ukrainian authorities had reported background radiation levels were normal and the fire had not affected ""essential"" equipment. The plant had not sustained any critical damage in the attack, Andrii Tuz, a plant spokesman, told CNN on Friday.

""The design is a lot different to the Chernobyl reactor, which did not have a containment building, and hence there is no real risk, in my opinion, at the plant now the reactors have been safely shut down,"" Mark Wenman, a reader in nuclear materials at Imperial College London, told the Science Media Centre (SMC).

The Chernobyl disaster took place at a plant that used Soviet-era, graphite-moderated RBMK reactors. But the Zaporizhzhia facility uses a pressurized water reactor known as a VVER model.

""The design of the VVER is inherently more safe and protected than the Chernobyl RBMK systems,"" explained Jon Wolfsthal, a senior adviser at Global Zero and former senior Director for Arms Control and Nonproliferation at the National Security Council, on Twitter on Friday.

A VVER reactor cannot ""'run away with itself' as the RBMK could,"" Malcolm Grimston, an honorary senior research fellow at the Imperial Centre for Energy Policy and Technology in London, told the SMC.

But even if an explosion at a reactor was most unlikely, other incidents could occur as a result of shelling or fires at the site.

""It's really the electricity and the plumbing that you're worried about,"" Joseph Cirincione, a distinguished fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, told CNN on Friday.

Electricity at the Fukushima plant in Japan was cut off during the nuclear disaster there in 2011, while the reactors themselves remained intact. ""That meant you could no longer pump the cooling water through the reactors, or the cooling ponds,"" Cirincione said.

""I don't think we're out of the woods yet. We have to make sure that the Russians who are taking over know what they're doing,"" he added.

Grossi, the IAEA director-general, told CNN on Friday: ""What I'm telling (Russia) and everyone is that the utmost restraint is to be exercised in and around this type of facility. Because wittingly or unwittingly, you can very quickly go into a disaster, and this is why we're so concerned.""

How safe are modern nuclear facilities?

The differences in design and safety standards mean that the possibility of a nuclear reactor at the site exploding and causing a disaster is not something concerning nuclear experts.

They noted that the threat would be somewhat higher if a nuclear reactor were to come under a targeted, sustained attack with the intention of causing a nuclear incident, which was not the case in Zaporizhzhia and would make little sense given the proximity of Russia's major cities to all of Ukraine's plants.

The pressure vessel of a modern reactor ""is very robust and can withstand considerable damage from phenomena such as earthquakes and to an extent kinetic impacts,"" Robin Grimes, a professor of materials physics at Imperial College London, told SMC.

Six power units generate 40-42 billion kWh of electricity at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.

""It is not designed to withstand"" attacks by explosive weaponry, he added. ""It seems to me unlikely that such an impact would result in a Chernobyl-like nuclear event (but) this has never been tested and it is not impossible.""

""It is therefore staggering and reckless to the extreme that shells have been fired close to a nuclear plant,"" he said. ""Even if they were not aiming for the nuclear plant, artillery is notoriously inaccurate in a time of war.""

How many nuclear plants does Ukraine have?

Ukraine relies heavily on nuclear power. The Zaporizhzhia plant contains six of the country's 15 nuclear energy reactors, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and the facility alone accounts for one-fifth of the average annual electricity production in Ukraine, according to Energoatom, Ukraine's nuclear power operator.

That makes its seizure by Russian forces hugely significant; if the plant were to stop running, it would severely affect the energy supplies to millions of Ukrainians.

In total Ukraine has four nuclear plants -- two, including Zaporizhzhia, in the south of the country, and two more in the northwest, in regions Russian troops have not occupied.

Those do not include the closed Chernobyl plant, in the north of the country, which was occupied by Russian forces on the first day of their invasion of Ukraine. According to Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian presidential adviser, control of the Chernobyl zone was lost after a ""fierce battle.""

More than 90 members of the Chernobyl power plant operational personnel were held hostage by Russian forces after they took the plant, Ukrainian Ambassador to the US Oksana Markarova said.

The Chernobyl plant was shut down after the 1986 disaster, and has sat within an exclusion zone ever since, but construction and recovery efforts have continued at the site to reduce the risk of future radiation leaks.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/04/europe/ukraine-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-attack-explainer-intl/index.html

The fire was extinguished and there was no release of radioactive material, but IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said he was “extremely concerned” about the situation at the Zaporizhzhia plant, which is located at the town of Enerhodar on the Dnieper River in southern Ukraine, north of Crimea on a major invasion route by Russian forces. Experts said the incident underscores ongoing concerns about fighting occurring near Ukraine’s reactors.

“Firing shells in the area of a nuclear power plant violates the fundamental principle that the physical integrity of nuclear facilities must be maintained and kept safe at all time,” Grossi said.

The radiation systems at the plant are fully functional, but it is not currently possible for monitors to fully access the site to ensure systems are operating safely, IAEA said. Two people were reported injured, the organization said, citing Ukrainian officials. Only one of the plant’s reactors is currently operating and the plant’s staff remain on site, officials said.

The U.S. Embassy in Ukraine said on its Twitter account that attacking a nuclear power plant is a “war crime.”

“Putin’s shelling of Europe’s largest nuclear plant takes his reign of terror one step further,” the post said.

Zaporizhzhia is Europe’s largest nuclear plant, with six reactors. Yesterday, a Twitter message from Ukraine Foreign Affairs Minister Dmytro Kuleba said, “Russian army is firing from all sides” at the plant. “Fire has already broke out,“ the minister said. Kuleba pleaded with Russians to cease fire and allow firefighters in to quell the flames and create a security zone.

In a statement last night, the White House said that President Biden spoke by telephone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about the threat to the plant and would be briefed regularly.

Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said Russian military operations near the plant “are reckless and must cease.” After speaking with Ukraine’s energy minister, Granholm commented on Twitter, “the plant’s reactors are protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down.”

Granholm also said the Energy Department had activated its nuclear incident response team to monitor the situation with the Department of Defense, Nuclear Regulatory Commission and White House, and said the administration had seen “no elevated radiation readings near the facility.” IAEA said it was putting its incident and emergency center in full response mode.

Containment structures around U.S. reactors were designed to withstand aircraft impacts, but pumps, backup generators and their fuel supplies, and other equipment that could be vital in emergencies are much more exposed, noted Matthew Bunn, a professor for energy, national security and foreign policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, in a Twitter comment last night.

In one of the first accounts of the fighting, Andriy Tuz, spokesperson for the plant, said in a video statement that “we demand that they stop the heavy weapons fire. There is a real threat of nuclear danger in the biggest atomic energy station in Europe.” The plant supplies about a quarter of the nation’s electricity.

Grossi issued a statement yesterday calling the threat “critical.” Ukraine officials informed IAEA that a large number of Russian tanks and infantry broke through Ukrainian defenses to attack Enerhodar.

The website of the Ukrainian nuclear regulatory organization issued an appeal to IAEA to “take concrete joint action” in the emergency.

Earlier this week, international nuclear monitors said that the invasion posed a safety threat to 15 reactors in Ukraine, which is Europe’s second-largest nuclear power producer after France. Experts warned of risks such as stray missiles or power outages caused by the invasion that could affect the ability of reactors to cool (Energywire, Feb. 29).

James Acton, director of the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said in a Twitter post yesterday while the immediate danger to the Zaporizhzhya plant appears to have passed, the events “underscore the dangers facing all of Ukraine’s nuclear power plants. “

“While Russia should get out of Ukraine entirely, it must keep all military operations well away from Ukraine’s power plants and avoid attacks, such on Ukraine’s power grid, that could endanger them,” he said.

Meanwhile, Biden spoke with the undersecretary for nuclear security of the U.S. Department of Energy and administrator of the national nuclear security administration to receive an update on the situation at the plant, the White House said. He will continue to be briefed regularly.

Granholm said that her department had ""activated its Nuclear Incident Response Team and is monitoring events in consultation with"" the Defense Department, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission Privacy Policy and the White House.

What to watch: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will seek ""an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting in the coming hours"" over the shelling of the plant, according to a statement from his office following a phone call with Zelensky.

By the numbers: The plant provides roughly 25% of Ukraine's power generation, according to AP.
