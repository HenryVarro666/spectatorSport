It has been 16 days since Moscow began its attack on Ukraine citing ‘threats to freedom’.

During the conversation, both Erdogan and Biden highlighted the need for an immediate ceasefire and also welcomed the coordinated international response to the crisis. Notably, the US has been constantly supplying stinger missiles and other aid to Ukraine. Turkey, on the other hand, is balancing on a tightrope between Ukraine and Russia. However, on Thursday, it hosted a landmark meeting between Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and Russia's Sergei Lavrov in the southern resort city of Antalya.

We discussed the importance of continued international efforts to hold Moscow accountable for its aggression and to support the Ukrainian people as they confront this crisis. — President Biden (@POTUS) March 10, 2022

Since the start of the conflict, Turkey has been walking a diplomatic tightrope between allies Russian and Ukraine. Earlier this week, Ankara shut down the strategic Bosporus Strait to warships of ""belligerent countries."" It is to mention that Kyiv had asked Ankara to block Russian warships, but it has taken no firm step till now. Meanwhile, in a telephonic conversation with his Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said that Moscow is ready to work closely with constructive forces to find a resolution to the Ukrainian crisis in the interest of peace and stability, according to Russian news agency Interfax.

Zelenskyy ready to meet Putin in Istanbul

Previously, Ukraine’s embattled president Volodymyr Zelenskyy told Recep Tayyip Erdoğan that he was ready to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Turkish cities of Istanbul or Ankara. The actor turned politician held a telephonic conversation with Erdoğan wherein he reckoned that he was ready to meet Putin in any Turkish city that he wants, according to Turkey’s Presidential spokesperson Ibrahim Kalin. Notably, Erdoğan has informed Putin about the offer.

ISTANBUL, March 10 (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan told U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday it was important for Ankara to maintain dialogue with both Ukraine and Russia to prevent their conflict from worsening.

Erdogan also told Biden in a phone call that Turkey's facilitator role in trying to find a solution to the conflict was important, according to a statement from his office.

NATO member Turkey, which shares a maritime border with Russia and Ukraine in the Black Sea, has good relations with both countries. It has called Russia's invasion unacceptable although it opposes sanctions against Moscow.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba met in Turkey's southern Antalya province on Thursday under Ankara's auspices.

But the highest-level contact between the two sides since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine made no apparent progress towards a ceasefire. read more

It also did not reach a solution for a humanitarian corridor from the southern Ukrainian port of Mariupol.

In the call with Biden, Erdogan said arranging the meeting between Lavrov and Kuleba was in itself a diplomatic victory.

Both Kuleba and Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, who hosted the talks, said it was not an easy meeting.

Erdoğan stressed on the talks the importance of Turkey's facilitator position in search for solution, in case Russia-Ukraine crisis deepens further.

President Erdoğan added that even organizing Turkey-Russia-Ukraine tripartite meeting in Antalya is a diplomatic victory by itself.

In a separate statement, the White House said that U.S. President Joe Biden and Turkish President Tayyip Erdoğan discussed their ""shared concern"" about Russia's invasion of Ukraine and reaffirmed their support for Ukraine in a call on Thursday.

Biden expressed ""appreciation"" for Turkey's efforts to support a diplomatic resolution to the conflict, the White House said in a statement.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki added the call lasted for about an hour.

The foreign ministers of Turkey, Ukraine, and Russia met early Thursday with the aim of reaching a lasting peace as the Russia-Ukraine war has entered its third week.

The high-level tripartite meeting began at 11.20 a.m. local time (0820GMT) on the sidelines of the Antalya Diplomacy Forum in Turkey and lasted for more than an hour.

TURKEY'S DEMAND FOR NEW AIRCRAFT, F-16 JETS MODERNIZATION

Erdoğan said he expects that Ankara's demand, which includes the purchase of 40 new aircraft from the US and modernization of Turkey's F-16 jets, will be finalized as soon as possible.

Time has already come to lift all unjust sanctions on Turkey in the defense industry, added the Turkish president.

In 2019, Washington announced that it was taking Turkey out of the F-35 program over Ankara's purchase of Russia's S-400 air defense system.

Turkey, however, stressed that the S-400s would not be integrated into NATO systems and so pose no threat to the alliance or its armaments.

Ankara has also repeatedly proposed setting up a commission to clarify the issue.",https://www.anews.com.tr/world/2022/03/10/erdogan-biden-discuss-ukraine-russia-conflict-over-phone

Poland’s Ambassador to the United States, Marek Magierowski, told CNN Thursday that sanctions on Russia should “last for a decade, maybe 15 years” following Moscow’s invasion and assault on Ukraine.

“I think that if we wanted to retaliate for that invasion against Ukraine with punitive measures and by crippling the Russian economy, we have to be determined and ready to uphold the sanctions in a longer term. Maybe they should last for a decade, maybe 15 years, because I'm afraid we are going to live with Mr. Putin for many years to come,” Magierowski told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour in an interview.

Magierowski said that Russian forces have committed “acts of barbarism in Ukraine” that he said were “war crimes, atrocities.”

“I do believe and I am confident that Mr. Putin and his cronies and all his closest aides will end up in the dock, in the Hague, in the International Criminal Court, because this is what he has already fully deserved,” he said.

When pressed on Poland not sending MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, Magierowski told Amanpour that it was not a feasible strategy for the Polish government.

“We could not, and we cannot deplete the arsenal of our aircraft by one-third without any back up and compensation,” he said.

The Pentagon said Wednesday that it is bluntly opposed to a Polish plan to provide fighter jets to Ukraine. Poland's initial proposal, which officials verbalized Tuesday, was to deploy all its MiG-29 fighter jets to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia — but by first sending the jets to US Ramstein Air Base in Germany, also a NATO nation.

“We decided to put the aircraft at the disposal of the US government and transfer them. We announced our willingness and our readiness to transfer these aircraft to the NATO air base in Germany,"" Magierowski said. ""The proposal has been rejected by our American partners who have come to the conclusion that it could be too escalatory and too risky, and actually this is what we were saying at the beginning of the debate about the Soviet made fighter jets at our disposal.”

US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said Wednesday the intelligence community came to the conclusion that ""the transfer of MiG-29’s to Ukraine may be mistaken as escalatory and could result in significant Russian reaction that might increase the prospects of a military escalation with NATO.”

Magierowski admitted to Amanpour that it’s “very hard to foresee a situation in which Russia would start making serious concessions,” in any diplomatic talks, but said that he did not believe that Putin’s forces were currently succeeding on the ground in Ukraine.

“Russia is losing this war right now. Not only in the hearts and mind of Europeans and Americans or the societies of the so-called free world but Russia is losing this war literally,” Magierowski told CNN.

“I don't know whether we will find a diplomatic solution, but maybe a military solution… I believe the Ukrainian army is capable of defeating the Russian army right now,” he said.",https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-10-22/h_c2cb4c1b7d42deccf49404f7c060f946

Biden's involvement comes as top diplomats from Russia and Ukraine failed to make progress during talks on Thursday, dashing hopes for a quick resolution to the invasion.

President Erdogan had said on Wednesday that the meeting could 'crack the door open to a permanent cease-fire.' But both sides left with no ceasefire in place nor an agreement for safe passage for Ukrainian civilians caught in the war zone.

Relations between Turkey and the United States have been strained the past few years over several issues, including Turkey's purchase of Russian S-400 air defence systems. Washington imposed sanctions on Ankara in December 2020 over the S-400s.

Biden and Erdogan met on the sidelines of the G20 meeting in Rome in October, where the American president warned his counterpart that they must manage their relationship better.

Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris is in Poland, where met with Polish President Andrzej Duda

Ankara's purchase of the Russian defense system caused tensions with NATO allies and led to questions about Turkey's committment to the alliance.

Turkey shares a maritime border with Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea. Ankara has called Vladimir Putin's invasion of the Ukraine unacceptable but also has opposed sanctions on Russia and Putin's inner circle.

The U.S. is stepping up its involvement of its principal leaders in the conflict.

Vice President Kamala Harris is in Poland, where she dodged questions on why the U.S. declined a deal to send fighter jets to Ukraine during a joint press conference with Polish President Andrzej Duda.

She did pledge $50 million more in humanitarian aid to the Ukrainian people.

'The issue facing the Ukrainian people and our allies in the Eastern flank is something that occupies one of our highest priorities,' the vice president said, calling it a 'dynamic situation' that 'requires us to be nimble and to be swift.'

Duda, however, did address the issue of warplanes, explaining that the situation is 'extremely complicated', and that the mix up came because Poland was making these aircraft available for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to decide if they wanted to send them to Ukraine.

'We are trying to do our best,' Duda said in a frank moment during his joint briefing with the vice president as Poland takes in millions of refugees fleeing their neighbor Ukraine.

'Some expectations were addressed in a very strong and a vocal way, also towards us, towards Poland,' he added. 'However, we are members of the North Atlantic Treaty alliance and as far as security issues are concerned we have to look at this not only through our own lens – through the prism of the security of Poland – but we also have to adopt the perspective of the security of NATO as a whole.'

Meanwhile the U.S. and its allies are working to stop attacks on Ukrainian citizens after Russian forces bombed the Mariupol hospital that killed three, including a young girl.

Ukraine accused Russia of war crimes with that attack.

Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu (centre), Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov (left)and Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba (right) take part in peace talks in Turkey

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, however, accused the U.S. and its allies of using Kyiv to threaten Moscow during a meeting with Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba in the Turkish coastal city of Antalya.

He and Kuleba could not come to an agreement on a cease-fire or allowing civilians in attacked areas safe passage.

In fact, Lavrov made the stunning claim Russia didn't attack the Ukraine.

Speaking after the failed talks, Lavrov said: 'We are not planning to attack other countries. We didn't attack Ukraine, either.'

And there were indications Lavrov didn't have the power to negotiate a cease fire.

'The broad narrative he conveyed to me is that they will continue their aggression until Ukraine meets their demands, and the least of these demands is surrender,' Kuleba told reporters after his meeting with Lavrov and Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu of Turkey.

Lavrov said Putin would not refuse a meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky but it would have to be substantive and focus on specifics.

And he said in reference to the hospital attack: 'It is not the first time we see pathetic outcries concerning the so-called atrocities perpetrated by the Russian military.'

He made outlandish claims that the hospital had been taken over by Ukrainian radicals and all the 'mothers and nurses were chased out of there'.

The foreign minister also accused the West of providing Ukraine with weapons.

He said: 'We see how dangerously our Western colleagues, including in the European Union, are acting now, which, in violation of all its so-called principles and values, encourages the supply of deadly weapons to Ukraine.'

Meanwhile his counterpart Kuleba blasted the 'difficult' meeting, accusing Lavrov of bringing 'traditional narratives' about Ukraine to the negotiating table.

He said after the failed talks: 'I want to repeat that Ukraine has not surrendered, does not surrender, and will not surrender.'

Russia has demanded that Ukraine cease military action, change its constitution to enshrine neutrality so it cannot join the EU or NATO, recognise Crimea as sovereign Russian territory and recognise the separatist republics of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent territories.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10598625/Biden-call-Turkeys-President-Erdogen-Putin-moves-Kyiv.html
