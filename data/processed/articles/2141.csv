MEDYKA, Poland, Feb 24 (Reuters) – A siren went off on Thursday in the Polish town of Medyka, a border crossing with Ukraine, a Reuters witness said.

After weeks of denying plans to attack neighbouring Ukraine, Russian forces fired missiles at several cities in Ukraine and landed troops on its coast on Thursday.

Ukrainians walk for miles to Polish border in search of safety

By Loveday Morris | 12:26 a.m. ET

MEDYKA-SHEHYNI CROSSING, Ukraine — Carrying children on their shoulders, dragging suitcases and the little they could carry, Ukrainians fleeing Russia’s assault on their country walked for miles to border crossings with Poland on Thursday, seeking safety outside their homeland.

Lines of barely moving cars stretched at least five miles into Ukraine from the Medyka-Shehyni border point, prompting some frustrated passengers to abandon their vehicles and continue on foot. Some said they woke up to the sound of rockets and decided it was finally time to flee.

“We didn’t expect it to happen so fast,” said Khrystyna Spilnyk, 22, who was walking to the border with her mother after leaving their car at the side of the road. “We are stressed, confused.”

Traffic was jammed in both directions at points. One farmer, apparently irked at people fleeing the country instead of staying put, drove a tractor and trailer across the road to block cars from exiting. Some people said they would just be in Poland long enough to assess the situation. Others, especially foreign residents, questioned whether they would ever be back.

They said they were heading to countries across Europe, from Germany to France and Finland — wherever they had a network to rely on. But many said they would stay in Poland, already home to as many as 2 million Ukrainians. Officials in Warsaw have said authorities were preparing for the arrival of as many as a million Ukrainians.

Vitalii Koval, 50, who was crossing into Poland with his wife and two daughters, ages 3 and 5, said he left his home in Kyiv for the western city of Lviv around 10 days ago. But after Thursday’s early-morning attack, they decided it was time to leave Ukraine.

“It’s just terrible, unbelievable,” he said, turning away to stop the tears. “It’s the 21st century. Why?”

Ivan Yurochko, 24, an engineer, was leaving on foot with nothing but a small backpack. “I didn’t have time to pack,” he said. He said he planned to stay with colleagues in a town on the border, but his mother and other family members had chosen to remain in the country.

Many people don’t have the financial means to leave, he said. “Sometimes I just have this emotional breakdown, just crying,” Yurochko said. “I don’t know if I’ll come back to Ukraine.”

As the sun rose over Ukraine Thursday, Russian forces had launched a massive assault on the European country, bombarding cities and leaving residents scrambling. They got in their cars to drive west, they fled to train stations, they looked on as smoke from Russian bombardments rose into the sky.

Heavy Russian military traffic across the border from Ukraine

By Mary Ilyushina | 9:40 a.m. ET

ROSSOSH, Russia — Russian military hardware is still on the move near the border with Ukraine on Thursday. A Washington Post journalist saw cargo trucks, armored vehicles and fuel transporters on highways close to separatist-controlled areas of Ukraine’s Donbas region, where heavy fighting was reported earlier.

Transportation in southern Russia has been disrupted as authorities closed the airspace over 12 airports, all along the border with Ukraine, until March 2. Moscow airports also canceled several international flights.

Emergency services said they would organize ground and rail transportation for people who need to travel outside Rostov, Voronezh, Volgograd and several other regions where air traffic was cut.

Highways connecting these areas are being patrolled by traffic and border police. The Post’s team on the ground was stopped twice for document checks.

Ukraine says Russian forces suffering casualties

By David L. Stern | 9:09 a.m. ET

LVIV, Ukraine — Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said Thursday that Russian forces have suffered significant losses in their attack on Ukraine.

“Tens, if not hundreds, of bodies are returning to Russia,” he said in a video message from Kyiv without disclosing evidence for the claim. He asserted that the Ukrainian army has destroyed six planes, two helicopters and five tanks.

Reznikov also urged all Ukrainians who are “ready to take up arms” to enlist in the armed forces. Authorities have simplified procedures for enlisting, he noted. “Take only your passport,” he said.

According to Ukraine’s border guard force, Russia is attacking in multiple regions. It said the border guards, along with the armed forces of Ukraine and other security and defense forces, continue to defend Ukraine.

The Border Guard Service said Russian forces invaded from many directions and fired on the border units and checkpoints with artillery and aircraft. “In particular, Russian aggression took place within the Luhansk, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, Zhytomyr, Kherson, Odessa regions, Zminy Island and in the JFO zone,” it said, referring to the Joint Forces Operation area in eastern Ukraine where government forces have been battling Moscow-backed separatists.

A spokesman for the Border Guards later said Russian troops have entered the Chernobyl zone.

In Moscow, Russia’s Defense Ministry said its forces have destroyed 74 “objects of aboveground military infrastructure” in Ukraine, including 11 airfields, three command centers and a naval base, state media reported.

A Russian Defense Ministry spokesman, Igor Konashenkov, also said that “18 radio-locating stations for S-300 and Buk-M1 antiaircraft missile systems” were hit, and that a Ukrainian “combat helicopter and four Bayraktar TB2 attack drones were shot down.”

Kremlin says Russia will not stop attacks until Ukraine is ‘cleansed of Nazis’

By Robyn Dixon | 7:42 a.m. ET

MOSCOW — Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday that Russian attacks on Ukraine were “a special operation,” not a war, carried out in the interests of Russia.

“Ukraine should ideally be freed, cleansed of Nazis,” Peskov said. He acknowledged that President Vladimir Putin’s move against Ukraine was “quite worrisome” for Russians.

“But as the president explained in the address to Russians, this is all truly dictated by our national interests and dictated by care for the future of our country,” he said during a daily press call with journalists.

Peskov said Russia would stop only after achieving its goals — the “demilitarization and denazification” of Ukraine — adding that such a decision would be made by Putin.

He said Russia was not happy about Western calls for punitive sanctions but added, “Let us analyze events and consider our next moves as these problems arise.”

Several protests against the war broke out in Moscow and eight other cities. At least 26 people were arrested, including 13 in Moscow, according to rights monitor OVD-Info, which was declared a foreign agent by Russian authorities last year.

After police cordons went up around Red Square, Peskov said that there was a need for “higher vigilance and caution.”

Lines at border crossings as Ukrainians flee to Poland

By Loveday Morris | 7:07 a.m. ET

MEDYKA, Poland — Lines formed at border crossings from Ukraine to Poland on Thursday as Ukrainians sought safety across the border.

Carrying backpacks and dragging suitcases, a steady stream of people came out on foot and by car at the Medyka-Shehyni border point. Vitalii Koval, 50, had left his home in Kyiv for the western city of Lviv about 10 days ago with his wife and two daughters, ages 3 and 5. But after the assault overnight, they decided it was time to leave the country.

“It’s just terrible, unbelievable,” he said, turning away to stop the tears. “It’s the 21st century. Why?”

He said that others who had left later were stuck on the roads. “I’m shocked,” said his wife, Oleksandra, adding that it had not sunk in yet. They planned to leave to stay with friends in Cyprus.

Officials in Warsaw have said that authorities are preparing for as many as 1 million Ukrainians fleeing into Poland. Ukrainians can cross the border without a visa, and there are already as many as 2 million living in Poland.

Ivan Yurochko, 24, was leaving on foot with nothing but a small backpack. He had left the city of Lviv at around 3 a.m. “I didn’t have time to pack,” he said. “It feels super unsafe and uncomfortable and right now just completely unknown.”

He planned to stay with colleagues in a town on the border; his mother and other family members chose to remain in Ukraine. Many people don’t have the financial means to leave, he said. “I do have an option,” he said. “Thank God.”

“Sometimes I just have this emotional breakdown, just crying,” he added. “I don’t know if I’ll come back to Ukraine.”

Police will issue weapons to veterans ‘who are ready to protect Ukraine’

By Sudarsan Raghavan | 6:38 a.m. ET

KYIV, Ukraine — Weapons are to be issued to veterans of the police and other internal security services willing to fight Russian forces and maintain order, the country’s national police announced hours into the attack on Ukraine orchestrated by Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The weapons, according to a statement posted on the national police’s Facebook page, will be given to those veterans “who are ready to protect Ukraine,” and the process of acquiring the weapons “will be simplified to the maximum due to the aggression” of Russia.

The issuance of weapons also “aims to strengthen the activity of Ukrainian law enforcement agencies,” the statement continued.

The weapons are expected to be handed out Thursday in Kyiv and in Kharkiv, where numerous explosions have taken place and concern is growing over Russian ground troops entering the city in the coming hours. The weapons distributions will probably also take place in other areas under pressure from Russian forces.

Police are urging citizens to report any suspicious people and objects in their areas and have set up a dedicated phone line for such reports.

Traffic stretches for miles as many flee Kyiv, others take shelter

By Siobhán O’Grady and Jennifer Hassan | 6:20 a.m. ET

KYIV — Main roads out of the Ukrainian capital were blocked with heavy traffic Thursday as people attempted to flee the capital, with ride-sharing app Uber telling its users that the service would “be available where possible” despite the threat of more explosions.

Footage shared to social media showed lines stretching for miles into the distance as the crisis unfolded and sirens rang out.

“Remember that you can cancel a trip anytime if you feel conditions are unsafe to ride,” Uber said Thursday in an email to users that advised them to follow official guidance in case of emergency.

At a subway station, some people packed together underground, holding their children and belongings close as sirens and explosions were heard in key cities.

Others tried to obtain bus and rail tickets at the city’s main train station — some to destinations they were not even familiar with — as they desperately sought safety.

Governments including those of the United States and Ireland urged their citizens in Ukraine to “shelter in place,” with the Irish Foreign Ministry instructing those there not to “move around the country in the coming hours.”

Russia’s military claims videos of civilian casualties in Ukrainian cities ‘staged’

By Robyn Dixon | 5:48 a.m. ET

MOSCOW — Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov claimed Thursday that videos of civilian casualties in Ukraine during Russian attacks were “staged.”

“Their goal is to accuse Russia of supposedly indiscriminate and disproportionate strikes to intimidate the civilian population and broadcast on Western television channels,” Konashenkov said.

Russia’s military has a history of indiscriminate military strikes on civilian areas, notably in the 1994-96 war against Chechnya, when the military bombed the region’s capital, Grozny, and many towns and villages, causing massive casualties.

In the Syrian civil war, rights group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group based in Britain, reported that Russian airstrikes caused thousands of civilian casualties after Russian President Vladimir Putin intervened in 2015 answering at the request of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

Russia’s military claimed Thursday that it was targeting military infrastructure, not civilians.

‘You need to get up, the war has started’ — voices from Kharkiv

By Isabelle Khurshudyan | 5:00 a.m. ET

KHARKIV, Ukraine — After the early-morning sounds of explosions on the city’s outskirts, Kharkiv residents, until now skeptical of Western claims that a Russian attack would come to their homes, turned to the tasks they had been putting off.

Lines at gas stations were more than 10 cars back. People walked through the city with suitcases and grocery bags, stocking up on essential goods. Though the local government urged people to stay home and closed schools and offices, many went straight for an ATM.

One young woman who was waiting in line for gas downtown said her apartment window was blown out by the blast.

“My boyfriend had called me right before that and said, ‘You need to get up, the war has started,’ ” said 18-year-old Kristina Nimenko. “Now we’ve come to get gas just to be ready for everything.”

“We just want peace,” she added.

For Agniia and Emile Nkoyok and their 5-month-old daughter, the booming outside their window prompted them to head into town and look to take cover in the subway system. But they saw no one else hiding there, so they walked their bulldog and tried to gauge how others were reacting.

“I’m upset that the government is saying nothing,” Emile said. Agniia and her daughter, Emily Grace, planned to fly on Friday morning but are unsure of what they’ll do now that airspace is closed.

Nimenko said she plans to meet family Thursday to discuss plans, but, “in any case, we will stay in Ukraine.”

“We will stay at home because we are from Ukraine,” she said.

Russian military says airstrikes hit Ukrainian military targets only

By Robyn Dixon | 4:06 a.m. ET

MOSCOW — As Moscow launched massive airstrikes on Ukraine early Thursday, Russia’s military said its armed forces were targeting military infrastructure.

The military said the civilian population and members of the military who surrendered were not being targeted, claims for which it offered no evidence.

The military made its first statement after President Vladimir Putin’s early-morning address announcing the assault, claiming that Ukraine was a threat to Russia.

“High-precision weapons disable only military infrastructure, air defense facilities, military airfields, aviation of the armed forces of Ukraine,” the Defense Ministry said in a statement.

Russia made similar claims during its 1994-96 military operation in Chechnya when it bombed cities and villages to quash a separatist uprising.

Also on Thursday, a Russian-backed militia leader in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic claimed to have taken control of two Ukrainian villages, Viktorivka and Bohdanivka, south of Donetsk.

Ukraine reports Russian attacks across the country, including in the west

By Sudarsan Raghavan | 2:45 a.m. ET

KYIV, Ukraine — By 9 a.m. Thursday, roughly four hours after launching their attack on Ukraine, Russian forces had targeted Ukrainian military sites across the Texas-size country, according to Ukraine’s defense forces.

Intensive shelling hit Ukrainian military units in the east, and rockets and bombs fell on several airfields, including Boryspil, the main international airport outside the capital, Kyiv. Other military facilities were also targeted in what appeared to be an effort to significantly weaken Ukraine’s military infrastructure.

“At the same time, the aggressor began shelling the territory and settlements of Ukraine along the state border,” a statement from the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine read. “The country’s defense forces are in full combat readiness. They have occupied and are holding defensive positions.”

In a second statement, the military said its air force repelled a Russian attack, shooting down five Russian aircraft and a helicopter in the Donbas region of southeastern Ukraine, one of the primary theaters of the spreading conflict.

The report could not be independently verified. The military also said that media reports of Russian troops landing in the southern city of Odessa were not true.

Ukraine’s State Emergency Service reported several Russian attacks far from the disputed eastern regions, including the shelling of an airfield in the northwestern city of Lutsk, fire engulfing military warehouses in a central part of the country, and the shelling of a military unit in the village of Kamenka Buzhskaya, in the western Lviv region.

Distant booms heard in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city

By Isabelle Khurshudyan | 2:01 a.m. ET

KHARKIV, Ukraine — Just after Russian President Vladimir Putin finished his speech announcing military action against Ukraine, distant booms could be heard in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, which is 50 miles from the Russian border.

It’s unclear what caused the explosion or what targets were hit.

Russian troops, tanks and missile launchers had been massing in Belgorod, a Russian city 90 minutes from downtown Kharkiv. This is a majority Russian-speaking city that was long considered a target in a full-scale invasion by Moscow.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has declared martial law, according to a Ukrainian government official.

As the sun rose, some people in the city reacted with confusion. At one hotel, a staff member asked a guest what was happening. Told this was likely a Russian invasion, she cursed.

“I don’t watch the news,” she said.

Outside of the hotel, a mother and child packed their car to leave Kharkiv. There were commuters with suitcases on the subway and people were in line at a water-filing station near the city center.

3,55bab78b-e3c8-4247-88ae-048af48d6239,[],,"In an address to the US nation, Biden assails Putin and accuses him of a “flagrant violation of international law.”

Recounting the intelligence his administration has been declassifying and sharing with US allies over the past few weeks, as Russia geared up for war, Biden says, “We’ve been transparent with the world… so that there can be no confusion or cover-up about what Putin was doing.”

He accuses the Russian leader of planning the invasion for a long time and of lying to create pretexts for his actions in Ukraine.

“Putin is the aggressor, Putin chose this war,” Biden says, predicting that the Russian leader “will be a pariah on the international stage.”

“He has much larger ambitions than Ukraine. He wants to reestablish the former Soviet Union. That’s what this is all about,” he charges.

The US president, whose address comes after a meeting earlier today with leaders of the G7 group of nations, warns that powerful sanctions will exact a “severe cost” from Russia’s economy, “both immediately and over time.”

“We’ve been building a coalition of partners representing well over half of the global economy,” he says. “We’re in full and total agreement. We will limit… Russia’s ability to participate in the global economy.”

Watch live as I deliver remarks on Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified attack on Ukraine. https://t.co/fsc84Sq6F6 — President Biden (@POTUS) February 24, 2022

He says the steps imposed in coordination with Europe will block top Russian banks from the US financial system and “cut off more than half of Russia’s high-tech imports.”

The penalties fall in line with the White House’s insistence that it will look to hit Russia’s financial system and Putin’s inner circle, while also imposing export controls that aim to starve Russia’s industries and military of US semiconductors and other high-tech products.

But Biden, for now, holds off on imposing some of the most severe sanctions, including cutting Russia out of the SWIFT payment system, which allows for the transfers of money from bank to bank around the globe, or Russia’s energy sector.

On the military front, he vows to defend “every inch” of NATO territory, but reaffirms that no American troops will be deployed to Washington’s ally.

“As I made crystal clear, the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory with a full force of American power,” Biden says.

The president adds, however: “Our forces will not be engaged in a conflict with Russia in Ukraine.”

michael barbaro

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily. As Russia’s full-scale assault on Ukraine enters its second day, the people of Ukraine are starting to come to terms with the reality that the unthinkable has actually happened. Today, my colleague Anton Troianovski explains the significance of this moment. And Sabrina Tavernise, Lynsea Garrison, and Michael Schwirtz speak to Ukrainians about the agonizing decisions that they now must make.

[music]

It’s Friday, February 25. Anton, we are talking to you on Thursday night in Moscow. We are coming to the end of day one of this invasion. Help us wrap our heads around what’s happening and the significance of what we’re all witnessing. Because even if we’ve been hearing warnings about this for weeks, it’s hard to believe that we’re now experiencing a full scale attack on Ukraine by Russia.

anton troianovski

Yeah. It is really hard to believe. It’s the biggest attack of one nation on another nation in Europe since World War II. It is really kind of the worst case scenario of all those scenarios of a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine that have been discussed. It’s something that I’ve spent just about every day writing about this crisis for the last two months or so. And honestly, even until yesterday I didn’t think that this could actually happen. It’s Europe’s most powerful military, bearing, basically, its entire firepower, much of its firepower against the neighboring country. So since about 5:00 AM, we have seen cruise missile, ballistic missile strikes against infrastructure targets, military targets in Ukraine. Then during the day, today, we started seeing footage coming in of helicopter assaults, of paratroopers landing, of tanks rolling across the border. And this is happening from 3 sides, from the North, Belarus, from the East, Russia, from the South, from the Black Sea in Crimea. It started, what, like 18 hours ago or so, and it’s still very hard to just wrap our heads around the magnitude of what’s happening.

michael barbaro

And what do we understand to be the end goal here at this point?

anton troianovski

Well, Putin laid it out quite clearly in his early morning speech. He said, our goal is to demilitarize and de-Nazify, in his words, Ukraine.

michael barbaro

And just explain that because—

anton troianovski

Yeah.

michael barbaro

De-nazification is not a familiar phrase in 2022.

anton troianovski

Exactly. And I mean, I will say, until recently, it hasn’t been a familiar phrase in Russia either. But the Kremlin in their propaganda they consider the democratically elected government of Ukraine a Nazi regime. They claim falsely that it has perpetrated a genocide on Russian speakers in Eastern Ukraine. And so Putin is trying to claim the moral high ground here. He is saying he’s going in to remove this evil regime. And what that means is this is a full scale military assault to topple the government, most likely, of another country. This is just a massive undertaking that we’re only seeing the beginnings of.

michael barbaro

So we’re talking about a sovereign nation in Europe being attacked by another European nation. And its democratically elected leadership being, by what you just described, deposed. And these are developments that are unheard of in modern Europe. So how should we think about that?

anton troianovski

Yeah. I think it’s really the end of a certain post-Cold War order in Europe. It’s the end of 30 years of Russia trying to find a place in that kind of Western led order. It’s the end of 20 years of Putin trying to use diplomacy as well as his kind of hybrid warfare tactics to try to further his interests in Europe. That’s all gone now. We’re in a new reality now, where Russia is showing it is prepared to fight a large land war in Europe to achieve what it describes to be its aims. It’s just a totally different world that we’re in now.

michael barbaro

Well, so let’s talk about the consequences of that for all involved.

anton troianovski

Yeah. I mean, I would break it up into a few different parts, the consequences for Ukraine, for Russia, for Europe, and the U.S., and the rest of the world. So starting with Ukraine. This is just the beginning, I fear. If this continues, if this continues the way we think it’s going to, to Putin pursuing regime change, it could get much more bloody. So we don’t know yet what happens to the cities. There is a fight for territory going on in Eastern Ukraine, where those separatist regions are. But the big question is, will they go into Kyiv?

michael barbaro

Right.

anton troianovski

Very scarily, it looks like they may well.

michael barbaro

OK. So what about Russia, where you are based? What are the consequences you are seeing and expecting there?

anton troianovski

Well, so people are expecting a new crackdown on civil liberties, on freedom of speech, freedom of the press, even on business. The reason being that whenever we’ve had crackdowns here in Russia, the justification has always been that the Kremlin is hunting down internal enemies, who are serving some kind of foreign agenda to destabilize the country. So that’s certainly one thing to watch over the coming days and weeks is how much of an additional crackdown is there.

protesters [CHANTING]

anton troianovski

Tonight, we had pretty significant anti-war protests—

protesters [CHANTING]

anton troianovski

—in Moscow, and St. Petersburg, and in a number of cities in Siberia all told several thousand people were in the streets and there were more than 1,500 arrests. So—

michael barbaro

Wow.

anton troianovski

—one thing that’s very important to point out is, there has been next to no outpouring of support for this. And there is a lot of anger, disbelief, fear to see your country inflicting so much suffering on a neighboring country is awful, and this narrative for why it was necessary to do it. It really does fall apart quite quickly upon inspection. Why— How does Ukraine actually threaten Russia? Can it really be true that the Ukrainians were planning an invasion of these pro-Russian separatist areas in the East just as 150,000 plus troops were surrounding Ukraine on three sides? There’s just so much in the Kremlin propaganda narrative that doesn’t hold up, that I think a lot of people aren’t buying that story.

michael barbaro

OK. Finally, let’s talk about the consequences for the United States and for the rest of the world.

anton troianovski

So President Biden and the E.U. announced major sanctions today against Russia. And Russia has promised to respond potentially asymmetrically. So we might not see sanctions by Russia against the U.S., but we might see Russia take other actions that could cause harm and pain in the U.S. And they’re— We can really only speculate what that would be. Some folks are talking about the potential for cyber attacks here in Moscow. There’s been a lot of talk that Russia could base missiles or other military assets in Latin America, to more directly threaten the United States. Russia, obviously, is one of the world’s biggest energy suppliers, especially to Europe. If it were to turn that spigot, that could cause incredible problems for Europeans. So there is so much uncertainty here still, not just in Ukraine, not just in Russia, but really about how this crisis plays out and what it means for the rest of the world.

michael barbaro

And Anton, as you’re preparing to sign-off for the night, I want to return to Ukraine and where this situation leaves its people at this moment.

anton troianovski

I mean, it’s a horrible situation. These are people who— I think there was so little expectation that Russia could actually go ahead with this kind of invasion. And now they are making choices they would never thought they would have to make. Do they stay in Kyiv? Do they try to flee West? Do they try to get out of the country? Do you sleep in the basement? It’s really an unimaginable situation for millions and millions of people right now.

michael barbaro

Well, Anton, thank you. We’ll talk again soon. Stay safe.

anton troianovski

Thank you.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

[music]

All day yesterday, my colleagues in Ukraine and back in the U.S. we’re speaking with Ukrainians around the country about their experiences of the past 24 hours.

denis surkov

Hello.

lynsea garrison

Hi. How are you?

denis surkov

Hi, Lynsey. Not good.

lynsea garrison

Not good.

denis surkov

It’s not the same.

michael barbaro

Lynsea Garrison got on the phone with Denis Surkov, who lives in a city called Dnipro in Eastern Ukraine.

denis surkov

I am doctor, Chief of Dnipro Regional Children’s Hospital.

lynsea garrison

You’re a doctor at Dnipro Regional Children’s Hospital.

denis surkov

Yep.

lynsea garrison

OK.

denis surkov

And I am Chief of NICU and I.C.U.

lynsea garrison

Chief of NICU?

denis surkov

Exactly.

lynsea garrison

Got it. Can you just tell me a little bit about what the past 24 hours have been like for you?

denis surkov

So in the morning, we wake up and we have heard, first, rocket explosions near Dnipro Airport. So I was in my hospital. We were nervous. We were confused. Everybody was near their laptops or iPhones.

lynsea garrison

Yeah.

denis surkov

And checked the news. And the news were and are dramatic.

lynsea garrison

Dramatic. How were you understanding this? Did you think that this would happen?

denis surkov

Honestly, no. We were expected for the beginning of the attack, but we didn’t know that it could be so, so fast, so right now. And now, the borders between Ukrainian regions are closed. We had some possibilities and some efforts to go last week.

lynsea garrison

OK.

denis surkov

I can’t explain, but something stopped us. We hoped that finally everything will resolve. But now, honestly, I don’t know exactly what to do.

lynsea garrison

What do you think stopped you?

denis surkov

My family didn’t want to leave Ukraine because we love Ukraine, and we wanted to live here happy and in peace, and so on. So I said, OK, maybe everything will be not so bad. Let’s wait. So my main question for myself is, if I made a very, very big mistake not to move from Ukraine when I had an opportunity to do this.

lynsea garrison

That’s a heavy question.

denis surkov

Yes. If there was a big mistake or not so big, and I have no answer. I can ask you, do you want to wake up in the morning and understand you should go forever, not for one day, not for two days, forever? Can you make such a decision in— I don’t know, in 10 minutes? My question to you.

lynsea garrison

Yeah.

denis surkov

To bring just a bit of water, just a bit of food, single cloth, documents, money, and go outside your home forever, can you make such a decision? Just imagine.

lynsea garrison

Yeah.

denis surkov

So this was my family feeling last week. Even though yesterday in the evening, I told to my wife that this is the last calm day we can evacuate. In the morning, we realized that war came to Ukraine, not conflict, not disturbs, war, conventional war.

lynsea garrison

What are your children asking you? Like, how are you talking about this with them?

denis surkov

I say to my children, everything will be OK, your father will care about you.

lynsea garrison

How old are they?

denis surkov

My elder daughter is 30 and she lives abroad. And my younger daughter, she is 14. She’s with me.

lynsea garrison

How is she doing?

denis surkov

She believed me.

lynsea garrison

That you’ll protect her? And how does that make you feel that she believes you?

denis surkov

I will do all I can to protect her. I don’t know exactly what, but I will do everything, everything can.

lynsea garrison

Are you worried it won’t be enough?

denis surkov

I am worried. Everything could be changed, I don’t know, next few hours or even next few maybe minutes.

[music]

It does feel ominous.

michael schwirtz Day one of the war it’s been a very long day. The town I’m in, Slovyansk, kind of continued on as normal. There were bits of panic that could be evident. There were lines at the A.T.M.s. And people were stocking up on medications. But overall, the mood was pretty calm and collected, probably because these people have been through this before, the town came under heavy attack in 2014 when Ukrainian forces clashed with Russian backed rebels who had come in from the East. And so when I’m walking around town, people are telling me that this is just part of their lives. Very few people I met around town today said that they had any intention of leaving even though rocket attacks hit an airport nearby and Russian forces were fighting with the Ukrainian military just a few dozen kilometers away. lera alekseevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] lera alekseevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz I met a woman named Lera Alekseevna, who was in the courtyard near my hotel. Oh, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] lera alekseevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz And she had stuffed her pet hairless cat in her jacket and it was shivering. lera alekseevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] And she was telling me how she was planning on going to work at a company that sells cash registers and bringing her animals with her, so that they wouldn’t have to be alone. So if she had to make a quick dash for it, she could be with her animals. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] lera alekseevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz But she said she had no intention of leaving, mostly out of fear that she would be forced to leave behind her pets. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] lera alekseevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz Outside a blood bank in Slovyansk, I met a young man named Bogdan Kravchenko,

[non-english singing]

who was just sitting in his car listening to the Ukrainian national anthem cranked up on high volume.

bogdan kravchenko [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] He had just gone and donated blood. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] bogdan kravchenko [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz And he said he wasn’t panicked, but he said that he was acting according to the situation and that things had only just begun. bogdan kravchenko [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] I walked up to a base of the National Guard Unit here in Slovyansk. And out front there were a few couples, men dressed in drab green uniforms, and women— all of them were being sent off. The men, they were all being sent off somewhere. Some of them said they couldn’t tell me where they were being sent. Some of them admitted that they didn’t even know. I met one couple, Yelena and Eugenia. Yelena had brought Eugenia, her husband, some clothes that he was going to take with him on his deployment wherever he was headed. Another couple just held each other for what seemed like 15, 20, 30 minutes, just held each other on the street in the sun ahead of whatever deployment this young man was being sent on. speaker 11 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] speaker 12 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz You both [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] speaker 11 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] speaker 11 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] speaker 11 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] And then, I met Lyubov Vasilyevna, a 75-year-old pensioner, she was carrying a bag filled with newly purchased loaves of bread. And she said she had spent her last bit of cash on. And was waiting in line at an A.T.M., it would appear that there was no cash left. lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz All she wanted, she said, was to live in peace in her native Donbass, which is what this Eastern region is called. lyubov vasilavna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz And then, she paused and recited a poem that she said she wrote 2 years ago. It was supposed to be evocative, the piece that she was looking for. lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz And I’ll read that poem that I translated from the Russian into English. I’m so looking forward to peace, but it is coming to us so slowly. lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz We still have a little patience. Peace is close at hand, and we’re waiting for it to arrive without gunfire, without blood. Enough has been spilled in Donbass. lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz Let the sun smile, and the sky brighten, and the children smile. Let it go in a black moment. There will be peace for all. And people will say, god hurt us. lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz Let all stormy skies leave us. lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Donbass [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz And hail Donbass and the city of Slovyansk. lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

[music]

The airstrikes are beginning again. You can hear the siren. We’re trying to decide whether to leave. Our colleagues, a few of them drove out this morning because it’s really unclear what’s going to happen. Will there be a big fight with the Ukrainian military? Or will the Russians just come in? What will happen if they take the city? And it seems like that is imminent. So we’re trying to make arrangements. Our hotel doesn’t have a generator, which means we would be out of power if the power gets cut off in the city, which is a pretty good chance. Yeah. We’re trying to figure it out. I guess, like a lot of people here, we’re trying to make that decision. Should we leave or should we stay?

As of Friday afternoon in Kyiv, Ukrainian officials were bracing for an attack on the capital city as Russia’s military offenses pressed closer to the heart of the government.

Kramer', 'Stephen Castle', 'Stanley Reed', 'Liz Alderman', 'Chris Stanford', 'Jason Gutierrez']",2022-02-26 00:00:00,"A currency exchange shop in Moscow. The announcement was a remarkable change of direction for European powers that, until recent days, were reluctant to end a 30-year effort to integrate Russia into the European economy.

WASHINGTON — The Biden administration and key allies announced on Saturday that they would remove some Russian banks from the SWIFT financial messaging system, essentially barring them from international transactions. They also said they would impose new restrictions on Russia’s central bank to prevent it from using its large international reserves to undermine sanctions.

The actions, agreed to by the European Commission, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and the United States, represented a significant escalation in the effort to impose severe economic costs on Russia over President Vladimir V. Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine.

“Russia’s war represents an assault on fundamental international rules and norms that have prevailed since the Second World War, which we are committed to defending,” the countries said in a joint statement. “We will hold Russia to account and collectively ensure that this war is a strategic failure for Putin.”

The announcement was a remarkable change of direction for European powers that, until recent days, were reluctant to end a 30-year effort to integrate Russia into the European economy. Now, like the Biden administration, European nations appear to be headed toward a policy of containment.

But, out of a sense of political self-preservation, they stopped short of barring energy transactions with Russia. The result is that Germany, Italy and other European nations will continue purchasing and paying for natural gas that flows through pipelines from Russia — through Ukrainian territory that is suddenly a war zone.

Some in Europe, along with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, had called for all Russian institutions and individuals to be cut off from SWIFT in an effort to bring the Russian economy to its knees. About 40 percent of the Russian government’s budget comes from energy sales.

While the announcement on Saturday was limited in its scope, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said that “cutting banks off will stop them from conducting most of their financial transactions worldwide and effectively block Russian exports and imports.”

Ms. von der Leyen said the trans-Atlantic coalition would also try to cripple Russia’s central bank by freezing its transactions and making it “impossible for the central bank to liquidate assets.”

The targeting of the central bank could, in the end, prove more consequential than the action regarding SWIFT. Russia has spent the last several years bolstering its defenses against sanctions, amassing more than $630 billion in foreign currency reserves by diverting its oil and gas revenue. Those reserves can be used to prop up the ruble, whose value has fallen dramatically amid the latest rounds of sanctions.

Biden administration officials said on Saturday that there would be new restrictions by the United States and its allies against selling rubles to Russia, undercutting the country’s ability to support its currency in the face of new sanctions on its financial sector. That, in turn, could cause inflation — and while administration officials did not say so explicitly, they are clearly hoping that could fuel protests against Mr. Putin’s rule in Russia.

“We know that Russia has been taking steps since 2014 to sanctions-proof its economy, in part through the stockpiling of foreign exchange reserves,” said Emily Kilcrease, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. “The central bank sanctions will limit their ability to leverage this asset, along with constraining their ability to conduct monetary policy of any sort to manage the economic damage from other sanctions.”

The United States and its allies also announced steps to put pressure on Russia’s elites, including creating a task force that the White House said would “identify, hunt down and freeze the assets of sanctioned Russian companies and oligarchs — their yachts, their mansions and any other ill-gotten gains that we can find and freeze under the law.”

The idea is to strike those who are closest to Mr. Putin and undermine their ability to live in both Russia and the West. In another new move, the United States and its allies said they would seek to limit the sale of so-called golden passports that allow wealthy Russians who are connected to the Russian government to become citizens of Western nations and gain access to their financial systems.

While the steps are some of the harshest taken yet, the announcement falls short of a blanket cutoff of Russia from SWIFT, which some officials see as a nuclear option of sorts. Such a move would have essentially severed Russia from much of the global financial system.

And some experts say that it may only drive Russia to expand the alternative to the SWIFT system that it created several years ago when it began trying to “sanction-proof” its economy. But Russia’s equivalent system is primarily domestic; making it a competitor to SWIFT, officials say, would require teaming up with China.

The moves on Saturday came on the same day that Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, announced that his government was approving a transfer of antitank weapons to the Ukrainian military, ending his insistence on providing only nonlethal aid, such as helmets.

At the same time, in a post on Twitter, Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, and its economy minister, Robert Habeck, acknowledged that the country was moving from opposing a SWIFT ban to favoring a narrowly targeted one.

“We are working intensively on how to limit the collateral damage of a disconnection from #SWIFT so that it hits the right people,” they said. “What we need is a targeted and functional restriction of SWIFT.”

The announcement by the United States and its allies did not specify which banks would be cut off from the system.

SWIFT, a Belgian messaging service formally known as the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, connects more than 11,000 financial institutions around the world. It does not hold or transfer funds, but it lets banks and financial institutions alert one another of transactions about to take place.

For weeks, the Biden administration publicly played down the notion of cutting Russia off from the system, suggesting that while all options were on the table, such a move could create more problems than it would solve.

But behind the scenes, American officials were pressing European allies to give some kind of indication to Mr. Putin that Europe was moving toward greater economic isolation of his country.

Moreover, because SWIFT is a European organization, the United States has been allowing European countries to take the lead on the issue. The only unilateral lever that the United States could use would be to impose sanctions, or threaten them, on the SWIFT organization itself if it continued to transmit messages for Russian institutions.

Some experts on sanctions have argued that barring Russian financial institutions from SWIFT is overblown as a tool for punishing Russia, saying that strict sanctions on the country’s banks will have the same effect.

But others have argued that blocking Russian institutions from the system would deal a blow to the country’s financial sector and that barring only a handful of banks does not go far enough.

“A targeted cutoff would not achieve what is needed,” said Marshall S. Billingslea, who was the assistant Treasury secretary for terrorist financing in the Trump administration. “They’ll simply reorganize the banking sector to put somebody else forward. The much more straightforward approach is to simply detach SWIFT from all of the Russian financial institutions.”

Two Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion stood in the cold with their bags at the Hungarian border on Thursday, waiting for relatives living in Hungary to arrive and take them to safety.

Csaba Bodnar (27) and his younger brother Tamas, both from the large ethnic Hungarian minority in western Ukraine, woke to the news of the invasion and set off immediately, fearing conscription into Ukraine's military.

""No one wants to get conscripted, no one wants to die,"" said Tamas. ""It's clear that those who can, they flee.""

The pair were among small groups of people leaving Ukraine at the Beregsurany crossing into Hungary, some coming from as far as the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, more than 800 km to the east, after Russia invaded.

The brothers had planned to start work in Hungary from next week in the town of Komarom near the Slovakian border, but the attack accelerated their plans.

The Indo Daily: Ukraine crisis - why Ireland should be worried about a war 3000km away

Tamas had worked as a driver with his brother in the Ukrainian town of Berehove/Beregszasz.

Some people could be seen entering Hungary by car, but many came on foot, dragging suitcases over the frontier by hand.

The new arrivals in Hungary gathered at a small kiosk just a few hundred meters from the border, discussing plans and warming their hands in the cold.

A woman in her 40s wearing a winter jacket stood by the road with her 15-year-old son and just one large bag. She said she had brought her son as she feared he could be conscripted into the army if authorities lowered the age limit.

""I am afraid they will take my son,"" she said.

The woman, from Ukraine's ethnic Hungarian minority, works as a pastor in a nearby village, which she did not want to identify. She declined to give her name as she said she had to go back, not wanting to leave her parish behind. She said relatives living in Hungary would come and collect the boy.

A couple, Dmitry and Ksenia, both 23, left Kyiv late on Wednesday night by car. They crossed on foot into Hungary and plan to take a train to Germany where Dmitry's sister lives.

Dmitry says he is not fleeing conscription as he has heart problems and so would be unsuitable for army service.

""I am very worried for my mother, she could not yet make it (out of Kyiv),"" he adds.

Tens of thousands of Ukrainians, many of them ethnic Hungarians, have worked in Hungary for years as wages are higher in Hungary. Among them is Eva, in her 40s, who works in the kiosk where those leaving Ukraine gathered on Thursday.

She said she had sent her two boys to the Czech Republic and her partner to Slovakia, afraid that they could be conscripted into the army.

""I am scared, I fear for my family ... for the men to be taken away into the army. I am a mother, how is it that I would have to send my child to die?"" she said.

Ukraine’s capital awoke just before dawn to the thud of distant explosions as Russia’s offensive was unleashed.

An air-raid siren wailed close to the foreign ministry, which is in the heart of Kyiv, apparently a rehearsal for a war that had already started.

By early morning, lines of vehicles could be seen at petrol stations, queuing for fuel, while roads leading out of the capital filled with traffic.

It was not immediately clear where they are headed.

But a woman said she had her car already filled with petrol and bags packed to escape with her husband and 10-year-old son and drive west as soon as any invasion started.

The thinking amongst Ukrainians is that the west of their vast country, which borders European Union nations such as Poland and Romania, is the safest place and the area least-likely to be seized, at least in the initial phase, by invading Russian troops.

It is why Britain’s ambassador and a small, remaining team of staff fled to the main western city of Lviv last week.

The sight of a number of residents seemingly choosing to leave Kyiv is a significant change for this city.

Most people had spent the past couple of months trying to continue with their daily lives as normal despite increasingly stark warnings from the UK, the US and other western allies that a Russian invasion of Ukraine appeared imminent.

At the same time, they had been quietly preparing for the worst.

Sales of personal guns and ammunition have soared since December.

At one weapons store called Tactica, the logo read: Shooting is life.

A flag made out of bullets in the national colours of yellow and blue summed up a mood of patriotism and a willingness to fight.

There was also a chess board with bullets instead of chess pieces.

On one wall was a stretched glass cabinet filled with assault rifles, hunting rifles, shot guns and even a machete.

A shooting-range was attached to the store where people can come and learn how to shoot or fine-tune their skills.

On Wednesday – the day before the invasion started – one Ukrainian man enjoyed a session of target practice as a birthday present from his wife.

“I once served in the army and I wanted to renew my skills,” Anatoly Arefyanov (39) said.

He held up what he had used for target practice – a large piece of paper with the outline of the top half of a man – peppered with bullet holes.

“The situation is difficult and we need to be ready for anything now,” he said.

The shooting range had two lanes, with a rifle fixed at one end and the target hanging from a wire at the other.

Anyone using the facility must wear ear defenders and eye protection.

Pop music played out of an old-looking stereo on a shelf fixed to the back wall – which could be heard even with the ear protection.

Demand to use the facility has rocketed by up to 200 per cent over the past three months – an indicator perhaps of their will to prepare to resist should Russia troops reach their streets.

As Marek Mahdal watched news reports of Russian bombs pounding Ukraine, he felt he couldn’t sit at home in Prague and do nothing.

So he and two friends jumped in their cars Thursday night and drove 770 kilometres to the Ukrainian border crossing near the city of Przemysl, in eastern Poland.

They arrived at around noon on Friday and stood on a sidewalk outside the crossing’s pedestrian gate, holding a sign written in Ukrainian that offered free rides to Prague and help finding shelter, food and work. “It’s unthinkable what’s happening and I would be really quite happy if someone showed up with this offer,” said Mr. Mahdal, a 22-year-old student. “We’ve got the time and, most importantly, we’ve got the means.”

Volunteers serve free soup, snacks and hot drinks to refugees in Medyka.

The trio are part of an informal network of families, friends and do-gooders that have descended on border towns in Poland and Moldova to help tens of thousands of Ukrainians seeking refuge from Russia’s invasion.

On Friday, the highway to the Polish border near Przemysl was jammed with cars bearing licence plates from Germany, Denmark, the Czech Republic, Lithuania and Austria. Most had come to pick up relatives who were walking over from Ukraine, but many had made the trip to offer shelter to refugees or just spoon out hot soup.

“We have been very busy, but at first people thought we were charging for everything,” said Alex Marenych, who was part of a group of 50 people from Krakow who were handing out soup, tea, coffee and snacks near the border’s pedestrian gate. Mr. Marenych said five van loads of donated food were expected from Krakow later on Friday.

Several hundred kilometres away in Moldova, volunteers with the charity Casa Buna had collected so many bags of donated food, clothing and bedding for arriving Ukrainians that it was difficult to walk through the centre’s large backyard. “There were old people coming with cans and five or 10 bananas, saying, ‘This is all we have, but we want to help,’ "" said Casa Buna founder Doina Cernavca.

Dumitru Pietri, second from right, offers bedrooms to Ilia Nicolaenko in Moldova.

Among those in need was Ilia Nicolaenko, who arrived in Moldova early Friday with a group of people in three cars carrying 31 children and five adults. Shortly after they entered the Moldovan capital of Chisinau, a man hopped into his own car and led them first to the Ukrainian embassy, then to Moldexpo, an exhibition venue that has been turned into a refugee centre.

Then, as Mr. Nicolaenko stood outside the centre, Dumitru Pietri, a Moldovan, walked up and said: “I have a house – a big house. If you need it, just write down our number. I can take three families.”

It was an offer motivated by generosity, and by a feeling of common plight. Many Moldovans worry that what’s happening in Ukraine could also happen to them. Part of Moldova, Transnistria, has been occupied by Russian-backed troops since 1990. Mr. Petri said he has given thought to whether he, too, might need to flee in the future.

At top, cots cover the gym floor at Przemysl's Ukrainian-language school; at bottom, Konstantyn Pisotskyi, second from right, talks with volunteers at a reception centre for refugees in Medyka.

Not all volunteers in Poland found it easy to be of service.

Konstantyn Pisotskyi and three friends drove more than 400 kilometres on Friday from Lodz, in central Poland, to Medyka, a village next to the border. They wanted to help out at a refugee reception centre that had been set up by the government in the village sports hall. It’s one of eight facilities Polish officials have opened in public buildings across the country to cope with a possible surge in arrivals from Ukraine.

But the sports hall was guarded by police on Friday, who made it clear the building was off limits to the public and the media. Mr. Pisotskyi spent much of the afternoon talking across the fence to one of the organizers, asking if he and his friends could volunteer.

“I don’t know if they’ll let us in,” he said, forlornly. “I think no, because there is police and border man here.”

There were signs at both borders of just how devastating the Russian invasion has been for many families.

Polish officials said 29,000 Ukrainians have arrived in the country so far, while in Moldova, the figure is 16,000. In many cases, those trying to leave Ukraine have waited up to 16 hours to get across the borders, often in lines stretching more than eight kilometres. Both Poland and Moldova have said they will accept Ukrainians without passports, and have exempted them from COVID-19 entry requirements.

Reiner Heinrich of Cologne, Germany, and his wife stand by a highway to the border, awaiting word about their teenage children.

Reiner Heinrich was among a throng of people waiting on the Polish side for news of family members trying to cross. He stood bleary eyed, holding hands with his pregnant wife, who is from Ukraine.

The couple live in Cologne, Germany, and they drove all night to get to the border in the hope of retrieving their two teenage children, who were supposed to be arriving on foot with a family friend from a small town near Lviv.

By late afternoon, they had yet to hear anything.

“They telephoned every day before, but it’s hard now,” Mr. Heinrich said as his wife wiped away tears. “Now we don’t know what happened.”

Nearby, a woman named Natasha slowly pulled her suitcase along the pavement as she headed back to Ukraine.

A friend said Natasha wanted to return home to look after her children – ages 12 and 14 – who have been living on their own in Ivano-Frankivsk, a small city in western Ukraine. The friend sobbed as she walked with Natasha to the crossing, too upset to contemplate what will happen to her.

A woman named Natasha heads back to Ukraine to look after her children.

A steady stream of young men also made their way back to Ukraine, some in a triumphant mood and eager to take on the Russians. “We want to go to the war,” said Voloymyr Telehii as he waited on the Polish side for a van to take him, his brother Ivan and two friends – Wasel and Andrej – home to Ukraine. The four had been working in Germany, but they rushed to the border when the invasion started.

On the Ukrainian side, many families had to cope with a government order banning adult men from leaving the country.

Vitaliy Kolomeets, 34, was forced to return home with his wife and three young children after being told he couldn’t emigrate. “We live in a European country, and should be able to choose if we are able to defend our country. If you want to do that, then you go,” he said. “But if you have more important priorities, like a family and children that need protection, I think you need to take care of your children first, then your country.”

Dmytro Yelenets was among the few Ukrainian men who managed to get across before the government issued its decree. He arrived in Moldova with his wife, daughter and two brothers.

He choked back tears as he described why he thinks it would be senseless for him to return and take up arms. “If we are going to all die tomorrow, what are we fighting for?” he said.

If the world wants Ukrainians to fight, he added, it should supply them with better weapons.

They came in a steady stream, looking weary and confused as they made their way through the train station in Przemysl, a small Polish city about 10 kilometres from the border with Ukraine. Some had come from Kyiv, others from Lviv, in western Ukraine, and still more from farther east.

“It’s very terrible in Ukraine,” Anastasia said as she held her 14-month-old son. They left Lviv in the morning, shortly after air raid sirens screamed warnings of a Russian attack. “We could not last in Ukraine in this situation.” Her plan was to stay briefly somewhere in Przemysl, then head to friends in Krakow. “And after, I don’t know.”

Olgah Martynyuk, a history professor at Kyiv’s Polytechnic Institute, made a mad rush for the train after hearing bombs drop around the capital Thursday morning. “I woke up from blasts in the morning and I packed up,” Prof. Martynyuk said as she sat in Przemysl’s train station after a 14-hour journey. She was happy to be safe but felt unsettled about leaving her country. “I still feel enormous guilt,” she said. “What did we do wrong that all of this is happening?”

Poland has been bracing for months for the possibility of as many as one million refugees from Ukraine in the wake of a Russian invasion. Preparations have been slow to roll out, and on Thursday officials in Przemysl, the Polish city closest to the border, still appeared to be scrambling to come up with some kind of support structure.

On Thursday night the train station was expecting as many as 2,000 refugees to arrive on two trains from Kyiv early Friday morning. But just two local officials were on hand to help. “I’m afraid that we will lose control,” one said.

A makeshift reception centre in the train station had been set up, and by late evening some hot soup, tea and coffee were on offer.

“All the people here left Ukraine today or yesterday and they are looking for a safe place,” Przemysl Mayor Wojciech Bakun said as he toured the centre. “We are just here to help all the people to reach their destination.”

Mr. Bakun expected that most people would likely move on to other cities in Poland. But he said Przemysl had 2,500 beds ready in shelters for those who had nowhere else to go, and officials would be offering medical help. The national government has said eight similar reception centres will be set up in other parts of the country.

A group of 20 volunteers from the Ukrainian community centre were also on hand at the train station, providing translation and arranging buses. They had also set up a shelter at Ukraine House and a local Ukrainian school. “We wanted to do something,” said one of the volunteers, Tatiana Nakoneiczna. “This is just the first wave. There will more tomorrow and on and on.”

The refugees began to arrive early Thursday, walking across the border at Medyka, a few kilometres east of Przemysl.

The Koval family – father Vitali, mother Oleksandra and daughters Alisa, bottom, and Eleonora, left – stand in Medyka, Poland, after crossing from Ukraine on Feb. 24.

Vitali Koval and his family were among the first to arrive. He and his wife, Oleksandra, had quickly stuffed three big suitcases for themselves and their children, five-year-old Alisa and three-year-old Eleonora. They jumped in a cab in Lviv, headed for the Polish border and walked the last short stretch across the boundary, pulling their bags along the highway.

“There is a big queue of cars on that side,” Mr. Koval said as he pointed across to Ukraine. “There are huge queues at petrol stations and in the markets. People are buying rice or pasta or something.”

The family relocated to Lviv from Kyiv a few days ago and now hope to stay with friends in Poland until they can figure out what to do next.

“We will need some help,” Mr. Koval said as he rushed off to buy some food and water at a nearby grocery store.

Oleksandra and Alisa wait outside a grocery store in Medyka.

While the numbers of refugees were still small, the fear and anxiety among the arrivals was real.

“We heard many shots,” said Vlad Slovak, who fled the small city of Boryslav, about 100 kilometres from the Polish border, with his father and sister. “It was so scary.” They have relatives in Chicago and hope to make it there eventually.

Mr. Slovak held up a video taken by one of his neighbours that showed explosions and fires. While they didn’t hear the shelling, they saw black smoke from what they believed were bombs.

“I got up at 5, heard about the bombing, and that was it,” said Mr. Slovak’s father, Roman. “We got in the car and came here. We left the car with a friend and walked across.” Then he shouted an expletive at Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Danylo Pikko left his village, Sambor, which is about five kilometres from the border. He saw smoke billowing up from a local military base and rushed out the door with his bag. He, too, got a ride to the border and walked across. “I don’t know what I’ll do now,” he said.

Others took a defiant stand and vowed to return to Ukraine one day to fight. “We’re not afraid of this attack,” said Sofia Makhnyut, a 21-year-old university student from Lviv who studies in Poland. She’d been planning to return to school soon but decided to go on Thursday because of the bombing, fearing the border would close.

She and her friends said they were determined to return to Ukraine and take up arms if necessary. “This is a panic, yes, this is a fear, yes. But we can fight for our country because this is my city. Why must I give someone who are terrorists my city or my country? This is my country.”

For some people, the decision to leave was wrenching. They left family members behind who didn’t know what to do.

“My parents don’t want to leave,” said Yaryna, a 22-year-old from Lviv who declined to give her last name. “They have everything there. They don’t know what to do abroad. They have a job there, a house, so they are not ready to leave. And they hope for the best.”

When asked if she thought she’d have a country to return to, Yaryna replied: “I don’t know what to think right now. I am worried about my family.”

At top, a U.S. embassy welcome centre is set up at Przemysl's Gloria Hotel for Americans leaving Ukraine; at bottom, Igor Harkow visits the theatre of the Ukrainian community centre he manages, which could be used to house refugees.

Przemysl is home to about 2,500 Ukrainians, a small fraction of the city’s 60,000 residents. And they have not always been welcome. Most, like Katarzyna Komar, are the descendants of thousands of Ukrainians who were forced by the Soviets after the Second World War to relocate from Przemysl to other parts of Poland. Ms. Komar’s mother and grandmother were among those who had to leave, but she returned four years ago because “this is where my family comes from. This is home.”

It hasn’t been easy. There have been violent clashes over the years between Ukrainians and local Polish nationalists who harbour historic resentments over atrocities committed by Ukrainians during the Second World War.

Local activist Anna Grad-Mizgala has been working to improve relations between the communities and is hoping the war in Ukraine will bring the city together. She is organizing a rally in support of Ukraine on Saturday. “We are fighting for life and for freedom,” she said.

At top, activist Anna Grad-Mizgala watches a newscast about the Russian attack; at bottom, Katarzyna Komar who returned to in Przemysl because of her family’s roots in the city, works at the community centre with Mr. Harkow.

In Odessa, Katerina Balyutova left her home within half an hour of the 5 a.m. initial strikes Thursday and drove toward Lviv.

But as Russian air attacks hit targets across the country, including less than 300 kilometres from Odessa, Ms. Balyutova reached a military roadblock near the site where an army depot was rocked by huge explosions.

Other obstacles to the exodus arose quickly. Across Ukraine, long lines formed at gas stations, some stretching for hundreds of metres. People also queued at foreign exchange shops and ATMs, some of which had run out of money. By early afternoon, some gas stations began to block their entrances after running out of fuel.

Those who could travel passed a landscape of jarring paradoxes: the percussive sound of explosions, workers tending vineyards, a column of tanks clattering down a city street, swans circling in a pond, cars bouncing across muddy potholes.

And roads already rendered impassable by war. When Ms. Balyutova reached the roadblock, she turned around, abandoning her flight – for the time being.

It’s possible that Russian forces will attempt to take Odessa by sea, she said. She was determined to provide help in any way she could to Ukrainian fighters defending her home, joining a countrywide rush of volunteers that have created lines at blood donation centres and military recruiting offices.

“This is our war,” Ms. Balyutova said. “We will stay in Ukraine – and we will take this war.”
