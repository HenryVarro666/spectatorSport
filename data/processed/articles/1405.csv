UKRAINE CONFLICT UPDATE 14

Mar 3, 2022 - Press ISW

Institute for the Study of War, Russia Team

with the Critical Threats Project, AEI

March 3, 2022

ISW published its most recent Russian campaign assessment at 4:00 pm EST on March 3.

This daily synthetic product covers key events related to renewed Russian aggression against Ukraine.

Key Takeaways March 3

Russian forces opened a new line of advance from Belarus south toward Zhytomyr Oblast, west of Kyiv, as Russian forces attempting to encircle Kyiv from the northwest were driven further west by determined Ukrainian resistance and counterattacks. Russian forces will struggle to complete an encirclement of Kyiv at all if they have to advance along ring roads as far from the city center as those they are now using.

Russian forces on the east bank of the Dnipro River remain unable to secure the important town of Chernihiv or to break through Ukrainian defenses in the northeastern outskirts of Kyiv.

Russian ground forces have remained relatively static near Kharkiv as Russian artillery, air, and missile bombardments wreak devastation in the city, though the Ukrainian military indicates that a regiment-sized Russian formation will try to envelop or bypass Kharkiv in the coming days.

Russian forces are attempting once again to open a line of advance through northern Luhansk Oblast, possibly to assist efforts at Kharkiv or, as the Ukrainian General Staff assesses, to drive on Dnipro and Zaprozhya. The Russian forces currently reported as engaging in that drive are far too small to attack either city successfully and are probably insufficient to sustain a long drive on their own.

Russian troops have surrounded Mariupol and are attacking it brutally to compel its capitulation or destroy it.

The mayor of Kherson conditionally surrendered to the Russians, allowing Russian forces to renew their advance on Mykolayiv. The Ukrainian military nevertheless reportedly defeated an attempted Russian air assault to take an airfield near Mykolayiv.

The Kremlin escalated domestic censorship of Ukraine coverage and accused Western platforms of launching disinformation campaigns.

Sweden and Finland are increasing cooperation with each other and NATO and may consider NATO membership due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Georgia and Moldova officially applied to join the European Union.

Western intelligence sources reported that Chinese President Xi Jinping had prior knowledge of the Russian invasion and asked Russia to delay operations until after the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.

Key Events March 2, 4:00 pm EST – March 3, 4:00 pm EST

Military Events:

The Russian military has continued its unsuccessful attempts to encircle Kyiv and capture Kharkiv. The Russians continued to attack piecemeal, committing a few battalion tactical groups at a time rather than concentrating overwhelming force to achieve decisive effects. Russian commanders appear to prefer opening up new lines of advance for regiment-sized operations but have been unable to achieve meaningful synergies between efforts along different axes toward the same objectives. They have also continued conducting operations in southern Ukraine along three diverging axes rather than concentrating on one or attempting mutually supporting efforts. These failures of basic operational art—long a strong suit of the Soviet military and heavily studied at Russian military academies—remain inexplicable as does the Russian military’s failure to gain air superiority or at least to ground the Ukrainian Air Force. The Russian conventional military continues to underperform badly, although it may still wear down and defeat the conventional Ukrainian military by sheer force of numbers and brutality. Initial indications that Russia is mobilizing reinforcements from as far away as the Pacific Ocean are concerning in this respect. Those indications also suggest, however, that the Russian General Staff has concluded that the forces it initially concentrated for the invasion of Ukraine will be insufficient to achieve Moscow’s military objectives.

Operations to envelop Kyiv remain Russia’s main effort. Russian troops are also continuing three supporting efforts, one to seize Kharkiv, one to take Mariupol and secure the “land bridge” connecting Rostov-on-Don to Crimea, and one to secure Kherson and set conditions for a drive west toward Mykolayiv and Odesa.

The Russian attack on Kyiv likely consists of a main effort aimed at enveloping and ultimately encircling the city from the west and a supporting effort along the axes from Chernihiv and Sumy to encircle it from the east.

Russian forces in the south resumed offensive operations toward Mykolayiv on March 3 after securing Kherson on March 2, but do not appear to pose an imminent danger to Odesa. Russian forces likely seek to force Mariupol to capitulate by destroying critical civilian infrastructure and killing civilians to create a humanitarian catastrophe—an approach Russian forces have repeatedly taken in Syria.

Russian forces are engaged in four primary efforts at this time:

1) Main effort—Kyiv; Russian operations on the Kyiv axis consist of a main effort aimed at enveloping and ultimately encircling the city from the west and supporting efforts along the Chernihiv and Sumy axes to encircle it from the northeast and east. Russia has not achieved air superiority over Ukraine as of March 3. Russia is likely mobilizing reinforcements to support its existing axis against Kyiv from the northwest. Russian forces did not attempt assaults on the cities of Chernihiv or Sumy on March 3, instead bypassing the city to advance on the outskirts of Kyiv.

2) Supporting effort 1—Kharkiv: Russian forces will likely attempt to encircle Kharkiv in the next 24-48 hours but may not succeed with the forces they are committing to the operation. Russian forces likely seek to encircle and bypass Kharkiv before bombarding it to force a capitulation.

3) Supporting effort 2—Mariupol: Russian forces fully encircled Mariupol as of March 2 and are conducting a deliberate campaign to destroy critical civilian infrastructure and residential areas in a likely attempt to force the city to surrender.

4) Supporting effort 3—Kherson and advances westward: Russian forces secured a negotiated surrender of Kherson on March 2 and continued advances toward Mykolayiv on March 3, including a failed airborne landing. Russian forces will likely struggle to fully resource three simultaneous lines of effort from Crimea—Mikoayiv, Zaporizhya, and Mariupol. Russian forces have not made territorial advances towards Zaporizhya since March 1.

Russian Activity

The Kremlin increased legal penalties for spreading what the Kremlin claims is false information about Russia’s war in Ukraine, forced key liberal Russian media outlets offline, and limited domestic access to non-Russian-controlled social media on March 3. A Russian State Duma (Parliament) Committee approved an amendment to Russia’s existing law against spreading false information about the Armed Forces on March 3 to imprison any person “spreading fakes” about the Russian military and its operations for 10 to 15 years.[1] State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin called for Russia to adopt a law criminalizing false information about the Russian Armed Forces and to combat disinformation campaigns allegedly targeting Russia on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube on March 3.[2] Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Maria Zakharova baselessly alleged that the BBC has undermined Russia’s domestic security; Russia may attempt to ban BBC coverage in Russia to retaliate for the EU‘s ban of the Russian state-run RT and Sputnik.[3] The Russian Prosecutor General’s Office stated that outlets promoting “supposedly peaceful anti-war actions” are banned in Russia due to their “connections with extremist activities” on March 3.[4] The Prosecutor General’s Office also announced it will begin investigations on allegedly extremist platforms and their calls for Russian citizens to protest Russian actions in Ukraine on March 3.[5]

The Kremlin is increasingly limiting Russia’s domestic information space to include only Kremlin propaganda. The board of Russia’s last liberal, publicly broadcast radio station, Echo Moskvy, closed the radio station on March 3 to avoid prosecution.[6] Russian censoring body Roskomnadzor previously forced Echo Moskvy off the air on March 1, falsely claiming the station promoted extremist activities and published false information about the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[7] Roskomnadzor also demanded that Google block “false information” YouTube ads targeting Russia and remove the “foreign” media outlet Dozhd’s online TV channel for promoting disinformation on March 3.[8] Dozhd General Director Natalia Sindeeva announced on March 3 that Dozhd will “temporarily stop” its operations but assured that the channel plans to return to the air.[9]

The Kremlin is also attempting to limit Russian domestic usage of Western social media platforms. Russian state officials and social media experts accused Facebook of launching a disinformation campaign against Russia and suggested that Russian-owned Telegram and VKontakte are among the suitable alternatives for Russian citizens.[10] Russian social media network MirTesen claimed it tripled its userbase as Russian censoring body Roskomnadzor restricted and slowed access to Western platforms.[11] The United States condemned Russia’s censorship on March 3 for blocking Russian citizens from witnessing the human costs of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.[12]

Kremlin officials continued to frame the invasion of Ukraine as a necessary and successful “limited operation” to protect Donetsk and Luhansk and obfuscated the true extent of Russian losses on March 3. Russian President Vladimir Putin told Russia’s national security council that his “special military operation” is on schedule and going according to plan.[13] Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov expressed their full confidence that Russia will complete its objectives in Ukraine and claimed that “a solution to the situation around Ukraine will definitely be found, and the Western hysteria will pass.”[14] The Kremlin reiterated that the objective of its “limited operation” is to restore the borders of the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics (DNR and LNR) to the full extent of Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, premised on the “self-determination” of DNR and LNR residents.[15] The Kremlin cited a UN “arms expert” who stated that the Ukrainian military has no chance against Russian forces.[16] Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov warned against “hoaxes” that misrepresent Russian casualty numbers.[17]

Russia rejected US attempts to ease nuclear tensions with Russia and Belarus on March 3 and continued to paint the United States as the aggressor in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The United States canceled a test launch of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) on March 2.[18] Department of Defense spokesperson John Kirby stated the United States has “no intention of engaging in any actions that can be misunderstood or misconstrued.”[19] The United States warned Russia and Belarus against deploying nuclear arms in Belarus during a UN arms control meeting on March 3.[20] US envoy Aud-Frances McKernan told the Conference on Disarmament that “any movement of Russian nuclear weapons into Belarus would be dangerously provocative and further destabilize the region.”[21]

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated that it is NATO, not Russia, that presents a risk of nuclear war on March 3.[22] Lavrov would not rule out the possibility of the United States launching an attack against Russia and claimed that the United States is acting like Napolean and Hitler towards ""European countries.”[23] Lavrov stated Russia is not considering a nuclear deployment but that the West is continuing to escalate concerns and ”go crazy” over Russian nuclear capabilities.[24] Russian State Duma Chairman Vyacheslav Volodin claimed that if Russia had not launched its operation in Ukraine, ”literally the next day the operation would have started from NATO, but only by the hands of neo-Nazis of Ukraine.”[25] Volodin also claimed that the Russian operation has saved hundreds of thousands of lives. Multiple Russian media outlets reported that Russia is finally retaliating after years of the United States humiliating Russia.[26] Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said that Russia’s relations with the West will improve after having reached rock bottom, but that such an improvement would require US initiative.[27]

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denied Ukrainian claims that Russia is preparing for martial law on March 3.[28] Ukrainian Presidential Advisor Mikhail Podolyak claimed earlier on March 3 that the Russian Duma will meet to discuss implementing martial law on March 4.[29] Peskov also rejected reports that Russia plans to restrict all men from leaving the country.[30] Russian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Ryabkov stated on March 3 that the Foreign Ministry is working in crisis mode after the West imposed harsh sanctions against Russia.[31] Some Russian men received conscription letters or orders to appear at Russian military enlistment centers on March 3; lawyers stated that these letters and orders do not have legal authority and warned that those who appear to the enlistment centers may be forced to sign a legal summons or short-term contract for military service under false pretenses.[32]

Belarusian Activity

N/A

Ukrainian Activity

Ukrainian and Russian negotiators agreed on the potential future establishment of humanitarian corridors but did not reach a ceasefire agreement during their second round of negotiations in Belarus on March 3. Head Russian negotiator Vladimir Medinsky stated the two parties agreed on the possibility of creating humanitarian corridors to facilitate civilian evacuation and food and medical supply delivery.[33] The establishment of corridors includes the potential for a ceasefire in the agreed-upon areas during civilian evacuations.[34] Ukrainian presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak stated that the objectives of the Ukrainian delegation were to achieve an immediate ceasefire, an armistice, and humanitarian corridors, but that the Ukrainian delegation did not get the results they wanted.[35] Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky maintained that he is ready to discuss all issues with Putin directly, including the status of the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics.[36] Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov outlined additional demands for the negotiations and stated that the agreement “must include a clause on the elimination of weapons that threaten Belarus,” likely setting conditions to demand the “demilitarization” of Ukraine.[37]

Ukraine and the international community called on Russia to implement nuclear fallout prevention measures on March 3. The Ukrainian Energy Ministry called on NATO to enforce a no-fly zone over nuclear power plants and ask Russia to agree to a ceasefire that would prevent Russian ground forces from moving within 30 kilometers of a nuclear power plant.[38] The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) called on Russia to let Ukraine control its nuclear facilities on March 3. Russian IAEA Envoy Mikhail Ulyanov called the IAEA resolution full of “politically motivated lies,” indicating that the Kremlin may not agree to proposed nuclear fallout mitigation measures that involve ongoing Ukrainian control of nuclear facilities.[39] Ukraine’s nuclear agency said that it still controls the Zaporizhzhia nuclear powerplant as of March 3 despite encroaching Russian forces and shelling in nearby towns.[40]

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that the first of 16,000 expected foreign volunteer fighters began arriving in Ukraine on March 3.[41] Numerous outlets reported that small numbers of Japanese, US, French, and UK volunteers are among the foreign fighters, as well as many citizens from former Soviet states.[42]

Military Support to Ukraine

NATO and EU countries provided additional lethal defense equipment and humanitarian aid to Ukraine on March 3.[43]

Germany announced on March 3 it will add 2,700 anti-aircraft Strela rockets to its next arms shipment to Ukraine.[44] German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also approved the export of German-origin weapons from the Netherlands and Estonia to Ukraine.

Spain is sending 1,370 anti-tank grenade launchers, an unspecified number of light machine guns, and 700,000 rounds of ammunition as part of its first arms shipment to Ukraine on March 4.[45]

Norway delivered 2,000 M72 anti-tank launchers to Ukraine on March 3.[46]

Canadian Defense Minister Anita Anand said on March 3 that Canada will send up to 4,500 M72 rocket launchers and up to 7,500 hand grenades to Ukraine.[47]

The White House asked Congress on March 2 to approve $10 billion in lethal and humanitarian aid for Ukraine as part of a $32.5 billion emergency funding request.[48]

A deputy Turkish foreign minister described Turkish drone shipments to Ukraine as “private sales,” not “military aid,” on March 3. Turkey is attempting to balance its relationships with both Russia and Ukraine.[49]

Sanctions and Economic Activity

Japan joined sanctions targeting Russian and Belarusian businessmen and trade as EU and NATO countries prepared to remove Russia and Belarus’ most-favored nation status. Calls to ban Russian and Belarusian banks from SWIFT and for the US to ban oil imports grew.

Japan sanctioned Russian businessmen and Belarusian officials on March 3.[50] Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida stated that Japan will freeze the assets of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, other key government officials, and wealthy businessmen. Kishida said Japan will ban financial transactions with seven Russian banks and implement restrictions on transactions with the Russian Central Bank.

Canada removed Russia and Belarus’ “most-favored nation” (MFN) status on March 3.[51] Canada announced it revoked Russia and Belarus’ MFN status as trading partners, resulting in a 35 percent tariff on Russian and Belarusian goods imported into Canada.[52] An anonymous European Commission spokesperson told Reuters on March 3 that the EU is discussing the possible suspension of Russia’s MFN status at the World Trade Organization (WTO).[53] The MFN principle requires equal treatment of all WTO members. Further suspensions would greatly increase tariffs on Russian exports to member states.

UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss pushed on March 3 for Western allies to ban all Russian banks from SWIFT and for the West to further reduce dependency on Russian hydrocarbons. Both moves would likely harm Europe’s energy supply and raise global oil prices.[54]

An anonymous EU official told Reuters on March 3 that the EU is considering excluding Belarusian banks from SWIFT.[55]

US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced her support for a bipartisan effort to ban Russian oil imports into the US during a news conference on March 3.[56] Pelosi said she “is all for [banning] the oil coming from Russia.”[57]

The Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank suspended all operations with Russia and Belarus on March 3.[58] The Chinese government founded the bank and is the largest shareholder at 30 percent.[59]

The Kremlin continued implementing capital control measures in a likely unsuccessful attempt to mitigate Western sanctions on March 3. The Russian Central Bank kept the stock market closed for the fourth consecutive day in a likely attempt to defer selloffs.[60] Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on March 2 prohibiting citizens and foreigners from transporting more than 10 thousand USD of foreign currency outside of Russia, likely to prevent further loss of foreign capital.[61] The State Duma submitted a draft law to protect Russian citizens from the effects of Western sanctions on March 3. The draft law promotes domestic social assistance programs, protects domestic consumers of foreign companies, and prevents foreign countries from further divesting from the Russian market.[62] Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that the Kremlin is not considering nationalizing foreign assets on March 3 despite Russian Security Council Deputy Dmitry Medvedev’s February 26 call to nationalize the assets of foreigners from “the US, EU, and other unfriendly jurisdictions.”[63] The Russian Federal Space Agency announced that it would stop exporting rockets to the United States on March 3; this attempt is likely an ineffective countermeasure due to a US store of Russian engines and existing contracts with US domestic producers.[64] CEOs of Russian diamond company Alrosa and the Federal Space Agency reduced their salaries on March 3 to mitigate the impact of Western sanctions on their workforces and research.[65] Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska predicted that Western sanctions would drive Russia into a prolonged economic crisis and called for a peace deal to end the Ukraine war in a March 3 speech to other businessmen.[66]

Humanitarian Concerns

Russian sieges deteriorated living conditions in southern Ukraine and indiscriminate Russian attacks killed more civilians in northern Ukraine, causing more demands for war crimes investigations.

The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) will send an expert delegation to Ukraine to investigate war crimes and violations and abuses of international human rights laws after 45 member states called for an investigation.[67]

The US mission to the OSCE stated on March 3 that Russian forces plan to execute some Ukrainian opponents and send others to camps after a military occupation. The US mission warned of Russian planning to use lethal population control measures to counter-protests and Ukrainian resistance during a Russian occupation of Ukraine.[68]

International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor Karim Khan launched an immediate criminal investigation of alleged Russian war crimes on March 3.[69] Khan expedited normal procedures and sent a team to Ukraine after 39 ICC member states called for action.

Lithuanian prosecutors launched a war crimes investigation into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on March 3.[70]

Other International Activity

Sweden and Finland are increasing cooperation with each other and NATO in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and may be considering NATO membership.

NATO announced on March 2 that the foreign ministers of Finland and Sweden will attend a scheduled meeting of the North Atlantic Council (NAC) Ministers of Foreign Affairs on March 4.[71] Non-NATO members Finland and Sweden typically send delegations to relevant NATO meetings.[72]

Sweden and Finland conducted a joint air and sea exercise in the Baltic Sea as part of increased joint military cooperation “against the backdrop of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.”[73]

Finland's parliament met on March 2 to discuss a petition calling for a vote on NATO membership.[74] Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin stated that because the petition reached the necessary threshold of 50,000 signatures, “it made sense to hear views on the issue.”[75] 53% of Finns now support joining NATO according to a poll conducted by Finnish broadcaster Yle on February 28.[76] Reuters reported that Finnish officials are considering a referendum on NATO membership rather than a parliamentary vote.[77] Russia threatened military and political consequences on February 25 if Sweden or Finland join NATO.[78]

Seven of the eight Arctic Council members—Finland, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, the United States, Canada, and Denmark—announced on March 3 that they would boycott future talks in Russia.[79] Russia holds the Arctic Council’s rotating chairmanship and was scheduled to host talks in May in Arkhangelsk.

Georgia and Moldova formally applied to join the EU on March 3 following Ukraine’s request to join the bloc on February 28.[80] Applicants must first have their candidacies unanimously approved by all 27 EU member states.[81] Then Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova must all make their political, judiciary, and economic systems compatible with the EU system of common law and extensive regulations in a process that can take as long as a decade.

A Western intelligence report leaked on March 3 says that Chinese President Xi Jinping knew ahead of time about the Russian invasion and asked Russia to delay operations until after the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.[82] The Chinese Foreign Ministry called the report “pure fake news” designed to shift blame.[83]

RUSSIAN OFFENSIVE CAMPAIGN ASSESSMENT, MARCH 3

Mar 3, 2022 - Press ISW

Mason Clark, George Barros, and Kateryna Stepanenko

March 3, 4:00 pm EST

The Russian military has continued its unsuccessful attempts to encircle Kyiv and capture Kharkiv. The Russians continued to attack piecemeal, committing a few battalion tactical groups at a time rather than concentrating overwhelming force to achieve decisive effects. Russian commanders appear to prefer opening up new lines of advance for regiment-sized operations but have been unable to achieve meaningful synergies between efforts along different axes toward the same objectives. They have also continued conducting operations in southern Ukraine along three diverging axes rather than concentrating on one or attempting mutually supporting efforts. These failures of basic operational art—long a strong suit of the Soviet military and heavily studied at Russian military academies—remain inexplicable as does the Russian military’s failure to gain air superiority or at least to ground the Ukrainian Air Force. The Russian conventional military continues to underperform badly, although it may still wear down and defeat the conventional Ukrainian military by sheer force of numbers and brutality. Initial indications that Russia is mobilizing reinforcements from as far away as the Pacific Ocean are concerning in this respect. Those indications also suggest, however, that the Russian General Staff has concluded that the forces it initially concentrated for the invasion of Ukraine will be insufficient to achieve Moscow’s military objectives.

Operations to envelop Kyiv remain Russia’s main effort. Russian troops are also continuing three supporting efforts, one to seize Kharkiv, one to take Mariupol and secure the “land bridge” connecting Rostov-on-Don to Crimea, and one to secure Kherson and set conditions for a drive west toward Mykolayiv and Odesa.

The Russian attack on Kyiv likely consists of a main effort aimed at enveloping and ultimately encircling the city from the west and a supporting effort along the axes from Chernihiv and Sumy to encircle it from the east.

Russian forces in the south resumed offensive operations toward Mykolayiv on March 3 after securing Kherson on March 2, but do not appear to pose an imminent danger to Odesa. Russian forces likely seek to force Mariupol to capitulate by destroying critical civilian infrastructure and killing civilians to create a humanitarian catastrophe—an approach Russian forces have repeatedly taken in Syria.[1]

Key Takeaways

Russian forces opened a new line of advance from Belarus south toward Zhytomyr Oblast, west of Kyiv, as Russian forces attempting to encircle Kyiv from the northwest were driven further west by determined Ukrainian resistance and counterattacks. Russian forces will struggle to complete an encirclement of Kyiv at all if they have to advance along ring roads as far from the city center as those they are now using.

Russian forces on the east bank of the Dnipro River remain unable to secure the important town of Chernihiv or to break through Ukrainian defenses in the northeastern outskirts of Kyiv.

Russian ground forces have remained relatively static near Kharkiv as Russian artillery, air, and missile bombardments wreak devastation in the city. The Ukrainian military indicates that a regiment-sized Russian formation will try to envelop or bypass Kharkiv in the coming days. Similar Russian attempts at such operations elsewhere in Ukraine render the success of such an undertaking at that scale unlikely.

Russian forces are attempting once again to open a line of advance through northern Luhansk Oblast, possibly to assist efforts at Kharkiv or, as the Ukrainian General Staff assesses, to drive on Dnipro and Zaprozhya. The Russian forces currently reported as engaging in that drive are far too small to attack either city successfully and are probably insufficient to sustain a long drive on their own.

Russian troops have surrounded Mariupol and are attacking it brutally to compel its capitulation or destroy it.

The mayor of Kherson conditionally surrendered to the Russians, allowing Russian forces to renew their advance on Mykolayiv, which they have done. The Ukrainian military nevertheless reportedly defeated an attempted Russian air assault to take an airfield near Mykolayiv.





Russian forces are engaged in four primary efforts at this time:

Main effort—Kyiv (comprised of three subordinate supporting efforts);

Supporting effort 1—Kharkiv;

Supporting effort 2—Mariupol; and

Supporting effort 3—Kherson and advances westward.

Main effort—Kyiv axis: Russian operations on the Kyiv axis consist of a main effort aimed at enveloping and ultimately encircling the city from the west and supporting efforts along the Chernihiv and Sumy axes to encircle it from the northeast and east.

The Ukrainian General Staff published an assessment of Russia’s likely plan to encircle Kyiv on March 3. The Ukrainian General Staff reported at 6:00 am local time on March 3 that Russian forces are attempting to conduct offensive operations in the area of Kozarovychi (40km north of Kyiv) on the west bank of the Dnipro River toward Vyshhorod (15km north of Kyiv); Fastiv (70km southwest of Kyiv and approximately 50km south of Russia’s current furthest point of advance west of Kyiv); and Obukhiv (40km directly south of Kyiv).[2] The Ukrainian General Staff likely assesses that Russian forces seek to encircle Kyiv from the west along a line running through these towns. Russian forces remain far from all four towns except Kozarovychi and likely will require further combat power to complete the encirclement of Kyiv. The Ukrainian General Staff reported at noon local time on March 3 that Russian forces committed an additional battalion tactical group (BTG) to operations against Kyiv along an unspecified axis.[3]

Ukrainian Airspace Remains Contested

Russia has not achieved air superiority over Ukraine as of March 3. The Ukrainian Air Force continues operating a week after the invasion began, with the Ukrainian General Staff reporting that Ukrainian Su-24s and Su-25s conducted airstrikes in Kyiv, Sumy, Chernihiv, and Kharkiv oblasts in the last 24 hours.[4] Ukrainian air defenses reportedly intercepted a Russian missile targeting Kyiv’s main railway station, which remains packed with refugees, the night of March 2.[5] Russian failures to secure air superiority likely reduce the effectiveness and extent of Russian air and missile attacks, increase the risk to Russian airborne and air assault operations, and force Russian ground combat units to face periodic air attack, likely degrading their operations to some extent. Russia’s failures in the air superiority fight are very surprising; ISW cannot offer any explanations for them at this time.

Russia Continues Clandestine Operations and Prepares More Disinformation

Russian efforts within and in the immediate vicinity of Kyiv have reportedly relied on saboteurs and reconnaissance elements, often out of uniform or wearing Ukrainian uniforms, rather than on attacks by regular combat forces. ISW cannot confirm any new developments in central Kyiv on March 3. Ukraine’s Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) warned Ukrainians that Russian forces may employ a deepfake video depicting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s surrender to Russia on March 3.[6] The GUR warned that Russia could use such a deepfake video to demoralize the Ukrainian population and convince Ukrainians to surrender.

Russia Likely Mobilizing Reinforcements from the Far East and Donbas

Russian social media users observed new trains loaded with combat vehicles likely of the Eastern Military District (EMD) in Khabarovsk, far eastern Russia.[7] These elements will likely deploy to Belarus to reinforce the EMD’s existing axis against Kyiv from the northwest. Ukraine’s commander in chief claimed on March 3 that Russia mobilized residents of the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics (DNR and LNR) and is transporting them to Belgorod via mainland Russia to support assaults on Kyiv.[8] Ukraine’s commander in chief also claimed that Russia is transporting DNR and LNR citizens via Krasnodar to Crimea to support a Russian assault on Odesa.[9]

Subordinate main effort along the west bank of the Dnipro

Ukrainian forces halted Russian efforts to extend their western envelopment of Kyiv into Zhytomyr Oblast directly west of Kyiv. The Ukrainian General Staff reported halting Russian forces in Pirozhky, Rizniya, and Ukrainka as of noon local time on March 3.[10] These towns are just west of Makariv, where Ukrainian forces halted Russian advances on March 2. Ukrainian forces additionally likely shot down a Russian Su-30 over Irpin on March 3.[11] Russian forces are likely unsuccessfully attempting to extend their envelopment of Kyiv westward to bypass Ukrainian forces around Makariv.

Russian forces additionally opened a new line of advance into northern Zhytomyr Oblast from Belarus, advancing roughly 20km into Ukraine toward Bihun and Ovruch as of noon local time on March 3.[12] ISW cannot currently assess the concentration of Russian forces on this new axis of advance. The Ukrainian General Staff reported two Russian BTGs are operating in Zhytomyr Oblast as a whole but did not differentiate between operations west of Makariv and new Russian advances across the Belarusian border.[13]

Russian forces continued to assemble supplies in Borodyanka, Katyuzhanka, and Gavronshchyn, north of Kyiv.[14] The Ukrainian General Staff reported Russian forces began assembling logistics camps in these towns on March 2. Russian forces are likely further deploying supplies and munitions forward from Belarus, but heavy cloud cover impeded satellite imagery north of Kyiv on March 2-3.

Subordinate supporting effort — Chernihiv axis

Russian forces did not attempt assaults on Chernihiv on March 3, instead bypassing the city to advance on the outskirts of Kyiv.[15] Elements of Russia’s 41st Combined Arms Army and 90th Tank Division remain concentrated in Lyubech and Mena west and east of Chernihiv, respectively.[16] Russian forces continued to shell Chernihiv on March 3, destroying a school and killing nine civilians.[17]

Ukrainian forces reported that two BTGs of Russia’s 2nd Combined Arms Army are advancing toward eastern Kyiv along the “Peremoha-Brovary” axis.[18] Elements of the Russian 200th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade are additionally participating in this line of advance.[19] Ukrainian forces likely halted Russian forces in Peremoha on March 2.[20] Ukrainian forces additionally halted Russian advances in Korosten, 30km south of Chernihiv.[21]

ISW cannot confirm the presence of any Belarusian forces in operations on the Chernihiv axis. Ukrainian Territorial Defense authorities claimed on March 1 that Belarusian combat troops have entered Chernihiv District in support of the Russian offensive.[22]

Subordinate supporting effort — Sumy axis

Ukrainian forces halted Russian offensive operations towards Nizhyn and Pryluky (approximately 130km northeast of Kyiv) by seven BTGs of Russia’s 2nd and 6th Combined Arms Armies, supported by missile and artillery assets, as of noon local time on March 3.[23]

Russian forces did not attempt assaults on Sumy March 3, instead concentrating on further advances toward Kyiv’s northeastern outskirts.[24] Two BTGs from the Pacific Fleet’s 200th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade continued to keep Sumy, Lebedyn and Okntyrka ”under siege” as of March 2.[25] Ukraine’s 93rd Separate Motorized Brigade reported destroying several Russian tanks near Sumy on March 2 and 3.[26]

Supporting Effort #1—Kharkiv: Russian forces will likely attempt to encircle Kharkiv in the next 24-48 hours. The Ukrainian General Staff reported six Russian BTGs around Kharkiv “moved to the defense” on March 3, but additionally assessed that three BTGs will “probably make an attempt to surround Kharkiv from the south.”[27] Russian forces likely seek to encircle and bypass Kharkiv before bombarding it to force a capitulation—as Russian forces are currently similarly attempting against Mariupol. Russian forces continued to deliberately target civilian infrastructure in Kharkiv with multiple-launch-rocket systems (MLRS), tube artillery, cluster munitions, and Kalibr cruise missiles on March 3.[28] The Russian air, artillery, and missile barrage may be intended to generate panic and reduce the morale of Ukrainian defenders in Kharkiv and elsewhere. It is not likely to achieve that effect. It is too early to evaluate the likelihood that a renewed Russian ground offensive will succeed in taking the city.

The Ukrainian General Staff reported on March 3 that two Russian BTGs will “probably try to advance in the direction of Izum [south of Kharkiv]” from northern Luhansk Oblast with the eventual objective of taking Dnipro and Zaporizhya from the north.[29] If confirmed, this would be a wide Russian enveloping maneuver, likely seeking to cut off all Ukrainian forces in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts. Two BTGs would be unable to complete this encirclement, let alone attack two large cities.

Supporting Effort #2—Mariupol: Russian forces fully encircled Mariupol as of March 2 and are conducting a deliberate campaign to destroy critical civilian infrastructure and residential areas in a likely attempt to force the city to surrender. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Mariupol is “stable” as of noon local time on March 3, though LNR forces (likely supported by Russia’s 8th Combined Arms Army) continued attacks on the city.[30] ISW cannot confirm the status of Ukrainian defenders or the extent of Russian attacks on the city on March 3.

The LNR announced that it captured the seven towns of Novoaidar, Krasnorichens'ke, Epifanovka, Stepnoy Yar, Havrylivka, Starobilsk, and Andriivka in Luhansk Oblast on March 3.[31] ISW assesses that Russian proxy forces control Havrylivka, Starobilsk, and Krasnorichens'ke, but cannot confirm Russian proxy control over Novoaidar, Krasnorichens'ke, Epifanovka, and Andriivka at this time.[32] Ukraine’s General Staff acknowledged that that LNR forces continued offensive operations near Novoaidar at 6:00 am local time on March 3.[33]

The Ukrainian General Staff additionally published photos on March 2 of a Russian plan Ukrainian forces captured from a battalion of the Black Sea Fleet’s 810th Naval Infantry Brigade.[34] The plans stated that Putin authorized a Russian invasion of Ukraine on January 18, planned at that time to run from February 20 to March 6. The BTG reportedly planned to conduct an amphibious landing at Stepanovka, on the Sea of Azov, before operating with elements of the 58th CAA and 117th Naval Infantry Regiment to surround and seize Melitopol. No such landing occurred.

Supporting Effort #3—Kherson and west: Russian forces secured a negotiated surrender of Kherson on March 2 and continued advances toward Mykolayiv on March 3, including a failed airborne landing. The mayor of Kherson confirmed that no Ukrainian forces remain in the city and that ""for the Ukrainian flag to continue flying over us"" he negotiated several conditions with Russian forces, including a strict curfew from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. and forbidding civilians from walking in groups larger than two or confronting Russian forces.[35] Russian forces deployed additional reserves and resumed offensive operations toward Mykolayiv on March 3.[36] Ukrainian forces additionally defeated a heliborne assault by Russian VDV (airborne) or special forces on Balovne, an airport near Mykolayiv.[37]

The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian forces committed reserve elements of the 205th Motor Rifle Brigade of the 49th Combined Arms Army towards both Mariupol and Zaporizhya on March 3.[38] Russian forces will likely struggle to fully resource three simultaneous lines of effort from Crimea – Mikoayiv, Zaporizhya, and Mariupol. Russian forces have not made territorial advances towardsZaporizhya since March 1.

3. What Putin’s Nuclear Threats Mean for the U.S.





Excerpts:

Similarly, the U.S. should focus its own conventional posture on the goal of denying Russia and China the ability to conduct rapid military campaigns that revise the territorial status quo. In coordination with allies, the U.S. should prioritize intelligence assets, forward deployment of munitions and equipment, and investment in weapons systems such as nuclear-powered attack submarines and penetrating bombers that have the best chance of surviving a fight with a highly capable adversary. Even in the presence of large nuclear arsenals, these conventional capabilities will remain vital to keeping the peace against opponents who may otherwise believe that nuclear weapons give them cover for aggression.

The U.S. nuclear arsenal remains the ultimate backstop of its alliance commitments. Distasteful as it is to contemplate, having the ability to threaten limited nuclear attacks, particularly against military targets, remains important for deterring Russia and China, both of which are readily deploying such weapons. The key is to signal prior to any war both that the U.S. has no desire to initiate conflict and that threats of nuclear escalation won’t force the U.S. to back down. The presence of the American arsenal can also help reassure allies that the U.S. will defend them, making them less likely to seek nuclear weapons of their own.





What Putin’s Nuclear Threats Mean for the U.S.

Washington needs to develop new strategies for a world where nuclear weapons don’t deter conventional aggression

WSJ · by Caitlin Talmadge

The U.S. cannot overlook these chilling threats. They are part of a deliberate strategy to advance Russia’s revisionist political and military goals. Countering them will require the U.S. and its friends to tailor both their conventional and their nuclear postures to the emerging danger—not only in the current crisis with Russia but also to prepare for the possibility that China might follow the same playbook in a future war over Taiwan.

Mr. Putin’s unusually explicit rhetoric has sent a clear message to the West: Stay out of my attack on a third party or risk nuclear conflict. Having bolstered in recent years its arsenal of nuclear weapons that can evade missile defenses and hit targets in Europe and the U.S., Russia is attempting to use these forces as a shield for conventional aggression. Mr. Putin is betting that despite the conventional military might of the U.S. and its allies, they will shrink from confrontation at least partly out of fear of nuclear escalation.

“Precisely because all-out nuclear war would be so costly for both the U.S. and Russia, Mr. Putin likely believes it won’t happen.”

This approach to nuclear deterrence calls into question the often-cited logic of mutually assured destruction, or “MAD.” This traditional notion assumes that mutual nuclear vulnerability—that is, a situation in which both sides have nuclear forces that can inflict significant retaliation on the other, even after suffering a nuclear first strike—can actually stabilize world politics and make conflict between nuclear adversaries, even over third parties, less likely. Under this condition, the risks of nuclear escalation become so dangerous and so inescapable that countries will hesitate even to provoke a crisis, much less to fight wars. Many credit MAD with keeping the Cold War cold.

The problem is that precisely because all-out nuclear war would be so costly for both the U.S. and Russia, Mr. Putin likely believes it won’t happen. As a result, he may feel relatively safe engaging in conventional aggression or even limited nuclear use below that threshold—demonstration strikes, for example, or attacks on military targets—without much risk of a Western response. In general, he appears to believe that Russian nuclear weapons provide cover for Russian aggression, while American nuclear weapons don’t provide reciprocal freedom to respond, perhaps because the U.S. is less invested in defending the status quo than Mr. Putin is in challenging it. Pakistan has honed exactly this strategy against India, and now a revisionist Russia is adopting it too.

Russia has longstanding grievances with the geopolitical status quo, including most notably the expansion of NATO after the humiliating contraction of the Soviet empire. These resentments, combined with a serious miscalculation about how the West would respond to his invasion, may have emboldened Mr. Putin to make nuclear threats, despite the powerful U.S. arsenal. Ultimately, however, Russia doesn’t want to get into a nuclear war with NATO. It just wants NATO to stay out of Russia’s conventional war against Ukraine.

Unfortunately for the U.S., Russia isn’t the only opponent that could use its nuclear arsenal as a shield for conventional aggression against third parties. China is in the midst of modernizing its nuclear forces, building better nuclear weapons in larger numbers than it ever has before. These include both long-range forces that can threaten the U.S. and medium-range nuclear weapons well-suited to limited attacks on U.S. military targets and allies in the western Pacific.

“An opponent that has little desire to fight a nuclear war with the U.S. may nevertheless rely on its nuclear forces to stiff-arm an American conventional response.”

China’s arsenal likely will remain significantly smaller than those of both Russia and the U.S. for some time. Nevertheless, Beijing is pushing Washington into a state of deeper mutual nuclear vulnerability. As with Russia, the U.S. would find an all-out nuclear war with China extremely costly, and both sides will have strong incentives to avoid it. Yet this strategic nuclear stalemate is unlikely to be stabilizing given that China, like Russia, is deeply dissatisfied with the status quo, especially over Taiwan.

A more robust nuclear arsenal may not make China more cautious. Instead it may give China confidence that if it conventionally challenges U.S. friends or allies in the region, the U.S. can’t simply lean on its nuclear status to get China to back down.

By attempting to neutralize the U.S. ability to make credible nuclear threats in a crisis, China may believe it can keep the fight conventional—which would play to China’s strengths. China overmatches Taiwan conventionally, just as Russia does Ukraine. Likewise, Beijing cares about Taipei’s status more than Washington does. Again, an opponent that has little desire to fight a nuclear war with the U.S. may nevertheless rely on its nuclear forces to stiff-arm an American conventional response.

Russia and China have distinct relationships with the U.S., but they present a common problem: The U.S. seeks to maintain credible commitments to allies and friends in the two regions. But how can it do this when conventionally strong, nuclear-armed U.S. opponents seek to revise the status quo through the use of force?

As Ukrainian resistance has already demonstrated, robust conventional forces are a critical part of the answer, both on NATO’s eastern flank and along the first island chain in East Asia. An adversary’s nuclear threats aimed at keeping the U.S. out of a conventional fight will matter much less if allies can make that fight conventionally costly for the opponent, regardless of whether, when or how the U.S. intervenes. The key is to provide allies with defensive capabilities that don’t threaten adversaries unless they attack.

Especially for Taiwan, that means investing less in high-prestige aircraft and ships and more in mines, submarines, drones, missiles and air defenses that can impose heavy costs on a Chinese attempt to cross the strait. Improving the island’s economic and military resilience in the event of air and missile attacks is also important, as is publicly signaling these measures.

Similarly, the U.S. should focus its own conventional posture on the goal of denying Russia and China the ability to conduct rapid military campaigns that revise the territorial status quo. In coordination with allies, the U.S. should prioritize intelligence assets, forward deployment of munitions and equipment, and investment in weapons systems such as nuclear-powered attack submarines and penetrating bombers that have the best chance of surviving a fight with a highly capable adversary. Even in the presence of large nuclear arsenals, these conventional capabilities will remain vital to keeping the peace against opponents who may otherwise believe that nuclear weapons give them cover for aggression.

The U.S. nuclear arsenal remains the ultimate backstop of its alliance commitments. Distasteful as it is to contemplate, having the ability to threaten limited nuclear attacks, particularly against military targets, remains important for deterring Russia and China, both of which are readily deploying such weapons. The key is to signal prior to any war both that the U.S. has no desire to initiate conflict and that threats of nuclear escalation won’t force the U.S. to back down. The presence of the American arsenal can also help reassure allies that the U.S. will defend them, making them less likely to seek nuclear weapons of their own.

4. Putin Thought Ukraine Would Fall Quickly. An Airport Battle Proved Him Wrong.

“When the hour of crisis comes, remember that 40 selected men can shake the world” Yasotay (Mongol Warlord)





And it is all about the assumptions in strategy. Get those wrong and if you do not adjust your strategy, you fail.





Excerpts:





Russia’s bid to seize the airport embodied its military planners’ ambitious assumptions that Ukrainian defense would collapse under overwhelming firepower. Russian officials and propagandists have for years boasted that Moscow’s forces could overrun its smaller neighbor in days.

But the resistance by Ukraine’s army and soldiers such as Lt. Kharchenko, backed by volunteer fighters, has slowed the Russian advance, halting it entirely in the area around Hostomel Airport after a day of back-and-forth fighting. The airport standoff has emerged as the key to Ukrainian resistance and one big reason Russian forces have become bogged down so far . On Thursday, the Russian military made gains in the south, penetrating the city of Kherson and pushing toward Zaporizhya.

Putin Thought Ukraine Would Fall Quickly. An Airport Battle Proved Him Wrong.

Russia wanted to use Hostomel Airport outside Kyiv to bring troops directly to the capital. A band of Ukrainian soldiers fought to keep the Russians from using the landing strip, forcing them to move soldiers and supplies over land.

WSJ · by James Marson

Elite Russian airborne troops had landed in helicopters hours earlier on the first day of Russia’s war against Ukraine. If they could hold the airfield, Russia would be able to fly in hundreds of soldiers and move rapidly to seize the Ukrainian capital, part of Mr. Putin’s plan to force a quick capitulation.

The Russians, protected by a concrete barrier topped with barbed wire, were directing withering fire at Lt. Kharchenko’s unit. Another Ukrainian force speeding to join the fight was delayed.

The paratroopers pressed on. “We knew what was at stake,” Lt. Kharchenko said.

Russia’s bid to seize the airport embodied its military planners’ ambitious assumptions that Ukrainian defense would collapse under overwhelming firepower. Russian officials and propagandists have for years boasted that Moscow’s forces could overrun its smaller neighbor in days.

But the resistance by Ukraine’s army and soldiers such as Lt. Kharchenko, backed by volunteer fighters, has slowed the Russian advance, halting it entirely in the area around Hostomel Airport after a day of back-and-forth fighting. The airport standoff has emerged as the key to Ukrainian resistance and one big reason Russian forces have become bogged down so far . On Thursday, the Russian military made gains in the south, penetrating the city of Kherson and pushing toward Zaporizhya.

This account of scenes in one of the most significant battles during the week-old conflict is based on firsthand reports of two soldiers involved in the chaotic fighting, official Ukrainian military reports and videos and images of events at the airfield.

The first sign of war in Hostomel came at 7 a.m. on Feb. 24, hours after Mr. Putin announced the invasion, when a cruise missile slammed into the ground meters from an apartment block, blasting a crater and blowing out the building’s windows.

The airport has a long runway used to test aircraft and for cargo, making it a juicy target for airborne forces to seek control of.

The Ukrainian National Guard unit defending the airport was below full strength. Most of its heavy equipment and personnel were hundreds of miles to the east, on the front lines of a war that Russia had fomented eight years earlier.

Still, this was the elite Rapid Reaction Brigade, based at the airport precisely because of its fighting skills and ability to deploy quickly. Formed in 2015, it had spent years fighting Russian proxies in eastern Ukraine.





National Guard Lt. Andriy Kulish, a 36-year-old who left his job in communications to join the army in 2014, had just made tea for two comrades a few hours after the missile hit when he heard the chopping of helicopter blades.

The attack aircraft had flown in low, avoiding Ukrainian radar. They unleashed a barrage of rockets and machine-gun fire on the airport and adjoining military base, sending the Ukrainian soldiers diving for cover.

The Ukrainians felt outmatched. “It was like turning up with a knife to a gunfight,” said Lt. Kulish in an interview.

After the first barrage, he saw two soldiers sheltering near his room.

“Do you want your tea now?” he called out. The incongruous question drew laughter.

Coming under aerial bombardment was a new experience for the unit, because the Russian-led militants in the east have no air force. But the defenders, including officers, contract soldiers and conscripts, soon got their bearings.

They spread out throughout the base and the airport and fired back “passionately and fiercely” with everything they had, said Lt. Kulish: automatic rifles, antiaircraft guns and a few shoulder-fired missiles.

The Russian military said it sent 200 helicopters on the mission. Ukrainian officials and soldiers defending the airport described some 30 or more helicopters.

The aircraft flew in twos and threes, circling for strike runs on the airport and the base.

The initial Russian barrage badly damaged the Antonov airplane Mriya, Ukrainian for Dream, the largest transport aircraft in the world. Lt. Kulish said he saw a plume of smoke rising from the hangar where it was undergoing repairs.

The defenders said they downed three helicopters with missiles. Lt. Kulish said the sheer number of bullets they pumped into two others forced them down despite their armor.

After nearly three hours of fighting, the Russian helicopters began to land and disgorge airborne troops, who fanned out and began firing.

The Ukrainian defenders had run out of antiaircraft missiles and were running low on other ammunition. Now facing an enemy on the ground as well as in the air, the brigade commander ordered a withdrawal, stuffing the unit’s flag down his jacket before they left.

The Russian military said its paratroopers suffered no losses and killed 200 of what it calls “nationalists,” part of Moscow’s false claim that its military is primarily facing nationalists rather than regular army units, which it portrays as weak and demoralized.

Lt. Kulish said his unit had no dead and one injured.

The Russians moved quickly to establish themselves at the base. A CNN crew shot video of the Russian paratroopers running with a machine gun and ammunition in green wooden boxes and exchanging fire with adversaries.

As the foreign forces dug in, Ukrainian intelligence got wind of the Russian plan: to send 18 Il-76 transport aircraft into Ukraine from Belarus. Sixty miles to the west, Lt. Kharchenko’s unit of 48 paratroopers jumped into three helicopters and sped toward Hostomel.

Their mission: get close enough to the landing strip to take out at least the first Il-76 so no other pilots would dare land.

Reaching a field west of the airport, the paratroopers spilled from their helicopters. Lt. Kharchenko led the way quickly but silently across a road flanked by houses, a field and a ditch filled with trees and branches.

As they approached the landing strip, a microdrone buzzed overhead. They had been spotted.

The paratroopers rushed forward, but then hit a 7-foot concrete wall topped with barbed wire. Lacking explosives to blast through, Lt. Kharchenko cut a hole in the wire and started helping his comrades over the wall. Five made it over. Then Russian machine-gun fire burst at them.





Three of the Ukrainians were badly hurt. Lt. Kharchenko radioed for help from another unit of Ukrainian paratroopers in armored vehicles, who were supposed to be assaulting the airport from the north. Their commander, call-sign Monk, replied they weren’t there yet.

The Russians pinned down Lt. Kharchenko’s paratroopers with heavy fire. A grenade exploded and set alight the grass where they were lying.

Lt. Kharchenko tried to calm the soldiers on the other side of the wall, worried that their screaming would direct the Russians to pick them off.

“We understood that the situation had changed radically,” he said. “The enemy had managed to build a good line of defense.”

The paratroopers pulled out small shovels and hurriedly dug a tunnel under the wall, managing to drag one of their comrades out.

Lt. Kharchenko called in coordinates for Ukrainian artillery to hit the enemy from the south.

The radio brought good news: Monk and his men had begun attacking from the north. And another Ukrainian unit was rushing in from the southeast in civilian vehicles.

The paratroopers set up a firing point for antiaircraft missiles in the field outside the wall.

Hours after the fighting began, the tide was turning. The Russians were pinned down. The Ukrainian commander told them over the radio that the latest intelligence indicated the Il-76s had aborted their mission. They wouldn’t risk a landing.

There was no time to celebrate. Monk came over the radio: A Russian armored column was approaching from the north. Lt. Kharchenko decided he would have to leave the men behind who were trapped on the other side of the fence. Two of them were unconscious.

“My conscience was tortured,” he said, “because losing people is a heavy burden for any commander.”

The paratroopers withdrew to the south, moving slowly because several were wounded, including Lt. Kharchenko, who had been shot in the leg. It took them 40 minutes to cross a field that they had sped across in 10 minutes in the other direction.

Suddenly, they heard the roar of Russian armored vehicles heading their way. They quickly set up an ambush, taking out the tank at the front of the column and firing rocket-propelled grenades at the other vehicles. The remaining vehicles turned around.

As the Ukrainians trudged south toward Kyiv, a civilian car pulled up. In the dark, Lt. Kharchenko worried whether the driver was friend or foe. Then he saw a Ukrainian flag in the passenger window and collapsed inside with relief.

The paratroopers hadn’t retaken the airport, but they had foiled the Russian airborne operation. Ukraine quickly brought up reinforcements that have halted Russian forces on a front line around Hostomel and in neighboring towns that have seen heavy fighting in recent days. The big troop carriers from Belarus haven’t landed at Hostomel.

Lt. Kharchenko is recovering in a hospital in a nearby town. He was smoking outside the day after the raid when a soldier he didn’t recognize approached him.

“I am your eyes,” the soldier told him. It was the first paratrooper who had jumped over the fence at the airport. He had crawled out despite severe back wounds from a grenade and been taken to a hospital by locals.

5. Russian troops may soon be fighting Ukrainian special operators with years of secretive training from the US





Just as a reminder:





2016 NDAA Sec 1099: (d) Unconventional Warfare Defined.—In this section, the term “unconventional warfare” means activities conducted to enable a resistance movement or insurgency to coerce, disrupt, or overthrow a government or occupying power by operating through or with an underground, auxiliary, or guerrilla force in a denied area.""





Essence of UW





UW thinking informs everything SOF should do





UW is fundamentally problem solving; using unique, non-doctrinal and non-conventional methods, techniques, people, equipment to solve (or assist in solving) complex political-military problems





And creating dilemmas for our adversaries





UW is fundamentally about influencing behavior of target audiences (which can include a population, a segment of the population, a political structure, or a military force); therefore, it is integral to the action arms of IO/PSYOP/CA.





Traditional strategic unconventional warfare objectives may include the following:





• Undermining the domestic and international legitimacy of the target authority.

• Neutralizing the target authority’s power and shifting that power to the resistance organization.

• Destroying the confidence and will of the target authority’s leadership.

• Isolating the target authority from international diplomatic and material support while obtaining such support for the resistance organization.

• Obtaining the support or neutrality of the various segments of the society.

Russia's offensive against Ukraine comes eight years after it seized Crimea and stoked a separatist movement in eastern Ukraine.

Since that 2014 invasion, US and Western special-operations forces have trained Ukrainian troops to conduct unconventional warfare.

Should the conventional fight in Ukraine end in Russia's favor, Ukrainians could put those unconventional skills to use.

Get a daily selection of our top stories based on your reading preferences.

The invasion of Ukraine isn't going as planned for Russian President Vladimir Putin. Days into the operation, his forces are struggling to meet their objectives and facing fiercer-than-expected Ukrainian resistance.

Sooner or later, Russian quantitative and qualitative military superiority might give Putin his so-desired victory. But then the unconventional war will begin, and Ukrainians have been preparing for that since Russia's invasion and seizure of Crimea in 2014.

US and Western special-operations forces have worked extensively with the Ukrainian military in the years since, setting up commando units, training them, and preparing them to wage a guerrilla campaign against an occupying force.

Now that Putin has invaded Ukraine for the second time in less than a decade, the lessons that US commandos taught their Ukrainian counterparts have deadly relevance.

Unconventional warfare is the bread and butter of the US Army's Special Forces Regiment — the Green Berets — and members of the 10th Special Forces Group, which has Europe as its area of responsibility, have worked with Ukrainian special-operations forces.

Reports also indicate that the US intelligence community has provided special-operations and intelligence training to Ukraine.

Guerrilla warfare

Thus far, Russian forces appear to have tried not to engage civilians, which may be an effort to avoid alienating Ukrainians in keeping with Moscow's attempts to portray the invasion as "" liberating "" Ukraine.

But there have been hundreds of civilian deaths, according to the Ukrainian government, and a guerrilla war in Ukraine, home to 44 million people, will also be bloody for defenders, insurgents, and bystanders.

When it comes to guerrilla tactics, Ukrainian resistance would target Russian soft spots. A column of T-90 main battle tanks that is supported by mechanized infantry is a hard target, but the supply trucks and depots that support them are softer targets that Ukrainian guerrillas would zero in on to counter Russia's numerical and technological superiority.

""The Russians' logistics chain, which is already in a mess trying to keep their troops supplied, would become a primary target. They are soft-skinned, road-bound, and are staffed by conscripts, not professional warriors,"" Steve Balestrieri , a journalist and retired Army Special Forces warrant officer, told Insider.

""They won't attack a battalion tactical group head-on. They attack and exploit gaps in the formations. The rear-echelon troops are especially vulnerable,"" Balestrieri said.

The morale of the Russian occupiers will be another target. A US defense official has said morale is low among Russians in Ukraine now, and footage of the fighting shows that Russian troops are not being welcomed.

Civilians are already openly protesting the Russian invaders, even going as far as standing in front of tanks to stop military movements. Russian soldiers occupying the country will be targeted early and often.

""[Occupied] government buildings, isolated outposts, small groups of Russian soldiers would all be targets. If any high-ranking officers or politicians visit, they would all be likely targets for guerrilla attacks. The Russian battalion tactical groups are ill-prepared for being occupying powers in the cities of Ukraine,"" Balestrieri added.

Guerrilla forces draw their strength from surprise, not might, and US and Western special operators would have trained Ukrainians to bide their time and strike when an enemy is most vulnerable, a Green Beret assigned to a National Guard Special Forces group told Insider.

""An untrained guerrilla with an anti-tank weapon will just want to shoot at the first tank he sees and scoot to the woods for safety. But a well-trained guerrilla will know to let the first few tanks pass and then strike them either from behind or strike the supply trucks,"" said the Green Beret, who was not authorized to speak publicly.

Ukraine's borders with four NATO members would also facilitate an insurgency by making it easier to support. Weapons, supplies, and reinforcements would have a relatively easy time entering and exiting the country.

""The guerrilla force will have plenty of external sanctuaries to the west where NATO will provide plenty of support. While the terrain doesn't offer the kind of concealment that we've previously considered, Ukraine is vast — the second-largest country in Europe — and the guerrillas can strike at any place of their choosing,"" Balestrieri added.

Using improvised explosive devices, guerrillas ""would wreak havoc on the Russians trying to cover a country the size of Texas,"" Balestrieri said.

As the defenders against an invading force, they would also have an advantage in the information domain.

""Controlling the narrative would be a big boost for the Ukrainians,"" Balestrieri told Insider. ""Putin framed this as a war against Nazis and fascists, but he really fears democracy on his border, which could result in regime change"" in Russia.

""Wanted: Dead or Alive"": Russian Tycoon Puts $1M Bounty on Putin's Head

Newsweek · by Jake Thomas · March 2, 2022

A Russian businessman is offering $1 million to any military officer who apprehends Russian President Vladimir Putin ""dead or alive"" for committing war crimes in his invasion of Ukraine.

Alex Konanykhin, an entrepreneur and former banker, posted the bounty on social media as Russia enters a full week of military action against the neighboring country. Western governments and companies have responded to the invasion by seeking to economically punish Putin and Russia's ruling elite. The bounty offered by Konanykhin, who is now based in the U.S., places an even more direct target on the Russian leader as backlash over the invasion continues to escalate.

Konanykhin said in a Facebook post Tuesday that he promised to pay the officer or officers the money for arresting ""Putin as a war criminal under Russian and international laws.""

""As an ethnic Russian and a Russia citizen, I see it as my moral duty to facilitate the denazification of Russia,"" Konanykhin said in the post. Putin has sought to justify his invasion of Ukraine by saying Russian forces would ""denazify"" the country, an explanation that has been dismissed by Western powers.

Konanykhin, whose profile picture shows him wearing a shirt with the yellow and blue colors of the Ukrainian national flag, said in his post that he would continue his ""assistance to Ukraine in its heroic efforts to withstand the onslaught of Putin's Orda."" ""Orda"" means ""horde"" in Russian.

An earlier version of Konanykhin's post on LinkedIn included a photo of Putin with the words ""Wanted: Dead or alive. Vladimir Putin for mass murder,"" according to The Jerusalem Post. The post appears to have been taken down.

Konanykhin, who made his fortune and rose to prominence after the collapse of the Soviet Union, said in his post that Putin came to power ""as the result of a special operation of blowing up apartment buildings in Russia, then violated the Constitution by eliminating free elections and murdering his opponents.""

Earlier in the invasion, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russian military forces marked him and his family as top targets during a televised address last week.

""The enemy marked me as target number one, and my family as target number two,"" Zelensky said last week.

Konanykhin had started more than 100 companies by the age of 25, following the fall of communism in Russia, according to a 1996 article in According to his website, Konanykhin is currently based in New York City and is the CEO of TransparentBusiness, a digital work platform.

Newsweek has reached out to Konanykhin for comment.

A top Russian general has been killed amid bitter fighting in Ukraine in what represents a major blow to the Russian invasion.

Major General Andrey Sukhovetsky, who was the deputy commander of the 41st Combined Arms Army of Russia's Central Military District, died yesterday as Ukrainian defence forces repelled the Russian offensive.

His death has not yet been officially confirmed by Russia's Ministry of Defence, but was announced on social media by his colleague Sergey Chipilyov and was widely reported by several Russian and Ukrainian news outlets.

A military source confirmed that he was killed 'by a sniper', and suggested a funeral for the Major General - by far the most senior Russian figure to have died in the conflict thus far - will be held in Russia on Saturday.

After days of denial, the Kremlin yesterday admitted that 498 of its troops have been killed and 1,600 injured in the 'special military operation' in Ukraine, but the true figure is almost certainly higher.

Ukraine's armed forces meanwhile claimed today that Russia's army had suffered 9,000 casualties - though the statement recognised that the calculation of the death toll 'is complicated by the high intensity of hostilities'.

Chipilyov, of the Airborne Forces Union of Russian Paratroopers, confirmed Sukhovetsky's death on social media earlier today in perhaps the most definitive proof of the general's passing.

'With great pain, we received the tragic news about the death of our friend, Major-General Andrey Aleksandrovich Sukhovetsky, in Ukraine during a special operation.

'We express our deepest condolences to his family,' the post read.

It was not clear where Sukhovetsky was killed.

The 47-year-old was a highly decorated veteran who was appointed deputy army commander of the 41st division in October 2021.

Prior to that, he commanded the 7th Airborne Assault Division in Novorossiysk for three years, and had completed several combat deployments in the Chechen war, Abkhazia and the intervention in Syria.

Sukhovetsky twice participated in the Victory Parade in Moscow's Red Square, and was awarded two Orders of Courage, the Order of Military Merit and the Medal of Courage.

He also received special commendation for his participation in Russia's annexation of Crimea.

His loss will be taken in Ukraine as yet another encouraging sign that the Russian invasion is not progressing as planned.





Day eight of Russia's invasion dawned today with the city of Kherson, in the south of Ukraine, having fallen into Moscow's hands. Kherson, a city of 300,000 on the Black Sea, appears to have fallen under Russian control after the mayor said 'armed visitors' had taken over a council meeting and imposed curfews. But defences elsewhere are still holding fast despite coming under heavy bombardment

Day eight of Russia's invasion dawned today with the city of Kherson, in the south of Ukraine, having fallen into Moscow's hands.

Kerson is the first regional capital to have been taken by Putin's men after a week of fighting that has seen his army suffer heavy casualties as Ukraine's forces continue to defy the Russian onslaught.

Defences elsewhere are still holding fast despite several cities - Chernihiv, Mariupol and Kharkiv chief among them - coming under heavy Russian bombardment.

Kyiv was struck by four large missiles overnight, one of which hit the central train station and three of which struck TV or radio stations.

In a video address to the nation early Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky praised his country's resistance and vowed that the nation's cities will be rebuilt with Russian money

The Ukrainian president claimed that 'all lines of defence are holding' with the cities of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Mykolaiv all resisting Russian attacks.

'They wanted to destroy us. They failed. We've been through so much. And if anyone thinks that, having overcome all this, Ukrainians will be frightened, broken or surrender, they know nothing about Ukraine,' Zelensky said, adding: 'We will restore every house, every street, every city and we say to Russia: learn the word 'reparations'.

'You will reimburse us for everything you did against our state, against every Ukrainian, in full.'

'We are a people who in a week have destroyed the plans of the enemy,' he said. 'They will have no peace here. They will have no food. They will have here not one quiet moment.'

He said the fighting is taking a toll on the morale of Russian soldiers, who 'go into grocery stores and try to find something to eat.'

'These are not warriors of a superpower,' he said. 'These are confused children who have been used.'

How Ukraine is winning the propaganda war

armytimes.com · by Sarah Sicard · March 4, 2022

The laundry list accomplishments of the “Ghost of Kyiv,” Europe’s first Ace pilot since World War II, continues to grow as the Russian invasion in Ukraine, which began Feb. 23, rages throughout its cities.

Latest kill count reports suggest the Ghost has downed six Russian aircraft . But is he real? Nobody knows, though it‘s unlikely. For now, the phantom flying legend is proving to be, more or less, a great piece of Ukrainian propaganda.

Though its troops face what some would call an insurmountable challenge from the Russian military, Ukrainian media, with the help of organic reach, is currently winning the hearts of minds of people in the Western world with tales of old ladies standing up to Russian troops, 80-year-old grandfathers volunteering to fight, Army cats that catch snipers, and one brave soul who punched a convoy of Russian trucks in the face.

The veracity of these stories have proven impossible to independently verify as firefights rage across the country. But the enigmatic nature of these stories, as New America strategist and the author of ‘ Likewar: The Weaponization of Social Media ’ Peter Singer notes, may actually be helping the cause.

“It is more about the story of a hero fighting back against the odds than his name or even the truth of the story,” Singer told Military Times.

And the internet is abuzz with rumors of Ukrainian citizens showing unparalleled bravery in the face of impossible odds against Russia, the supposed propaganda pros.

“They have flipped the script on the supposed Russian masters of it,” Singer said. “Ukraine was not only able to keep its population in the fight when the key Russian goal was to cause the quick collapse, but it also energized the West into levels of support that few imagined before all this.”

Social media has played a large role in endearing the West to the Ukrainian cause.

The Ukrainian media is highlighting the Russians as aggressors committing atrocities against an otherwise peaceful neighbor, a former senior Army information warfare officer told Military Times, who asked to speak on background to discuss propaganda missions freely.

“On the Russian side, they are trying to portray themselves as not as being the aggressors, but rather as number one defenders of ethnic Russians located inside of the Ukraine,” the retired officer said. “That’s why they try to portray that Ukraine is committing atrocities against ethnic Russians.”

Russia has largely relied on its tight state-held grip over information flow within its own borders.

“Most of the traditional media inside Russia is controlled and they are also on different social media platforms, with high levels of censorship,” Singer noted. “If the war drags on, casualties grow, and the economy slumps further, it will be harder and harder for Putin to sustain their early narrative of an emergency ‘rescue’ and quick and easy win.”

Both the officer and Singer believe that Ukraine is winning the propaganda war at the moment.

“When even Switzerland is joining in the sanctions, you’ve lost that narrative battle,” Singer said.

Ukrainian media has been particularly savvy in playing up the eleventh hour rise of its president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whose line, “I need ammunition; not a ride,” may rival the likes of William Shakespeare’s “cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war” in terms of quotability.

“He went from relatively little known outside Europe to global icon,” Singer said. “That rise of support and sympathy was a key part of Ukraine convincing other states to aid its cause. Great strategy, from a natural communicator.”

Zelenskyy essentially became a hero, the voice of freedom from tyrannical oppression overnight. But to Russians, he is the villain.

“I heard one media source refer to him as the the George Washington of Ukraine,” the former officer said. “But in Russian media, he’s portrayed as being illegitimate and the guy responsible for these atrocities against ethnic Russians within the Ukraine.”

It is, as the intelligence officer noted, up to the media to help determine truth from sensationalism.

“Both sides are trying to control the narrative,” he said. “For me, that’s the story. Right. They’re using these unconfirmed reports and social media to portray things the way they want them portrayed to garner global public opinion.”

Ukraine, however successful it has been with sharing and having signals boosted on feel-good stories, it’s not without its share of disinformation, however.

Early in the conflict, the Defense Ministry’s official Facebook page was caught sharing footage of a supposed aerial dogfigh with the caption “MiG-29 of the Air Force of the Armed Forces destroys the ‘unparalleled’ Su-35 of the Russian occupiers”. It turned out to be from a video game called “Digital Combat Simulator, according to BBC .

Social media has made it increasingly difficult to find fact from fiction, the former intelligence officer said, adding that journalists need to be the ones defining that line.

“It’s Western media’s responsibility to be more objective in their reporting,” the Army officer noted. “What’s changed is that now, the media has become so ubiquitous sources of media are so ubiquitous, that how those stories get written and portrayed is it even more important than it ever has been.”

Ukraine Conflict Update - March 4, 2022 | SOF News

sof.news · by SOF News · March 4, 2022

Curated news, analysis, and commentary about the Russian invasion of Ukraine, tactical situation on the ground, Ukrainian defense, and NATO.

Do you receive our daily newsletter? If not, you can sign up here and enjoy it five (almost) days a week with your morning coffee (or afternoon tea depending on where in the world you are).

Russian Campaign Update. The Russians are continuing their attacks against Ukraine. The effort in the north is somewhat stalled while gains are being made by the Russians in the south. The Russians don’t appear to have an operational plan where the different columns are in a supporting posture – it seems more of a piecemeal effort with separate battles going on in different parts of Ukraine. The White House is reporting that 90% of the pre-invasion force on the borders of Ukraine has now entered the country.

The capture of Kyiv is the main effort. The cities of Kharkiv, Mariupol, and Mykolayiv are secondary targets. The 40-mile long Russian column advancing into the interior of Ukraine has been slow moving and has come under attack frequently by Ukrainian forces. As of Thursday (Mar 3) the column was 15 miles from the capital city – Kyiv. The forward elements of the convoy are likely moving into their staging areas, with some elements heading south and then west to complete the encirclement of the capital city.

Fight for the Skies. The Russians have yet to commit the full force of its air force and its long-range and short-range missiles. This is a failure of planning, an attempt to minimize civilian casualties, or some other factor. But it remains a mystery to military analysts. The Ukrainian Air Force, although diminished, is still flying. The anti-air capabilities of Ukraine are reduced but still active. Stingers appear to be making a difference.

Maritime Activities. An Estonian cargo ship was reportedly sunk in the Black Sea after hitting a naval mine of the coast of Odessa. A Bangladeshi-flagged ship was also hit by a Russian missile. An amphibious force of four large landing ships is off the coast of Odessa. They will likely take part in an operation once the Russian forces from the Crimea spearhead start moving west along the coast of the Black Sea. Or, they are a feint to keep Ukrainian forces in the Odessa region while the Crimea-based Russian forces either head to Kyiv or conduct a pincer movement to cut off Ukrainian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Kyiv. The capital city is almost completely encircled. Open roads leading out of the capital are likely to the southwest. The train heading west is running . . . and always full of passengers. It is likely that the Russians want to take the city and install a puppet regime. There is probably a plane waiting in Moscow to board the ‘new government’ and fly them to Kyiv once the city is secured by the Russians.

Kharkiv. The second largest city of Ukraine is Kharkiv located in the northeast of the country. There is a fierce fight for this city that is close to the Russian border. A lot of artillery and rocket attacks by the Russians have occurred. Most reports say that the city is completely encircled.

Mariupol. Located on the Sea of Azov, the coastal city of Mariupol is under siege by the Russians. This city is situated along the coastal road network that would provide Russia with a land bridge between Russia and the Crimea.

Going West? With the capture of Kherson by the Russians, attention is now focused on Mykolayiv and Odessa . The question is, will this concentration of Russian troops that emerged from Russian-occupied Crimea push north to Kyiv or head west towards Odessa?





Western Arms. Over 20 countries – most from NATO and the European Union – are sending weapons, ammunition, and military supplies to Ukraine from across the Polish border. Rocket launchers, Stinger surface-to-air missiles, and Javelin antitank missiles are among the more important weapons being sent to Ukraine. Turkey is providing Bayraktar TB2 drones that have proved surprisingly effective against Russian forces.

Fight at Nuclear Power Plant. Russian forces fired at buildings in a complex housing the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant . This took place in the southern city of Enerhodar . The fire has since been put out, no news on radiation leaks. The International Atomic Energy Agency reports that the Ukraine regulator has not detected a change in radiation levels. Russian news reports that a joint Russian-Ukrainian exercise was held on Thursday to practice procedures at the power plant. The exercise is now over and completed all of its training objectives.

Russian General Killed. The former commander of Russian 7th Airborne Assault Division was killed by a Ukrainian sniper on Wednesday (Mar 2). At the time of his death he was the deputy commander of the 41st Combined Arms Army of the Central Military District. “Ukraine Forces Reportedly Kill Russia General Andrei Sukhovetsky in Blow to Invading Army” , Newsweek, March 3, 2022.

Negotiations. Talks are ongoing each day at the Belarusian town of Gomel just across the Belarus border. Ukraine has demanded a ceasefire and the establishment of humanitarian corridors at the talks. Ukrainian President Zelensky has requested direct talks with Russian President Putin.

Refugees. Over a million people have fled Ukraine in the past seven days according to the United Nations. This is about 2% of the country’s total population. Most are being taken in by Poland and Hungary.

“Volunteer Formations of Territorial Communities”. The provisions of Article 8 of the Law of Ukraine “On Fundamentals of National Resistance” have established civilian organizations that are under the command and control of the commander of the military unit of the Territorial Defence Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The tasks of the Volunteer Formations of Territorial Communities is to construct checkpoints, block movement of the enemy, and perform other tasks given them. The most significant change to the law included the clearly defined powers of the Special Operations Forces, which will lead the resistance movement, as well as giving volunteer fighters the right to use small arms.

“Members of voluntary formations of territorial communities have the right to use personal hunting weapons, small arms, other weapons and ammunition while performing territorial defense tasks, in accordance with the procedure established by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine.”

Foreign Volunteers? Russia Will Prosecute. Volunteers from across the globe are traveling to Ukraine to fight against the Russians. Apparently several hundred volunteers have arrived in Ukraine to fight alongside Ukrainian forces. The Ukrainian embassy in Washington, D.C. says they have received more than 3,000 applications for U.S. citizens wanting to help out. Many of them are military veterans. Once in the Ukraine they are integrated into the International Legion of Territorial Defense of Ukraine. The Russian Defense Ministry says that military contractors sent by Western countries and ‘foreign mercenaries’ will be prosecuted. It is likely that this announcement will not apply to the Wagner Group . Read more:

The Coming Resistance

U.S. SOF and Ukraine. From intelligence gathering to training civilians in guerrilla tactics, here’s what the U.S. and NATO might do to push back against the Russian invasion while avoiding escalation. “How U.S. Special Forces Can Fight Putin Without Starting World War III” , by Jeremy Kryt, Daily Beast, March 1, 2022.

Insurgency? Long and Bloody. Thomas Pepinsky, a professor of government and public policy at Cornell University, writes that the Ukrainians should steel themselves for a long and difficult insurgency in the months and years ahead. The Ukrainians are unlikely to defeat the larger and better equipped Russian army they are confronted with. So an insurgency seems to be the only alternative to capitulation. Insurgent warfare is designed to grind down the occupying force’s resolve. But that takes months if not years. “A Ukrainian Insurgency Will Be Long and Bloody” , Modern War Institute at West Point, March 3, 2022.





Cyber and Information Operations

Hackers on both sides of the conflict continue their efforts in cyberspace. Some social media platforms are being restricted or shutdown – in Russia and around the world by respective nations. The United States is considering a bill in Congress entitled Strengthening American Cybersecurity Act of 2022 . Despite the fact that Russia has a huge army of cyber warriors it seems to have not coordinated a pre-invasion cyber attack very effectively, and its current operations are not decisive. It cyberwar overrated ?

Hackers Targeting Refugee Orgs. Cyber hackers from Belarus are going after organizations that are helping Ukrainian refugees and delivering humanitarian aid to Ukraine. Phishing attacks have been launched from emails pretending to be from the Ukrainian security services. “Warning: Hackers are Targeting the Ukraine Refugee Crisis” , Forbes, March 2, 2022.

Hacktivists and Cyber War. Some computer techies have a criminal focus. But we now see them opposing each other as they align with Russia or Ukraine in the current conflict. Hacktivists around the world have got involved in the Ukraine War. Ukraine put out a call for a digital army to help it resist the Russian invasion. Anonymous and o",https://myemail.constantcontact.com/3-4-22-National-Security-News-and-Commentary.html?soid=1114009586911&aid=15wEHWuBNc4
3,a135872d-cd5f-4397-b02e-17996ff2a1c3,[],,"IN AUGUST SAMANTHA POWER, America’s aid chief, visited Ethiopia. Not long ago, such an important official from the world’s only superpower would have been welcomed with deference. Instead, her request for a meeting with Ethiopia’s prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, was ignored. However, Abiy did find time that day to appear on television inspecting drones apparently made by America’s arch-enemy, Iran.

It was an extraordinary snub. America until recently enjoyed friendly relations with Ethiopia. It has been a big donor to a government that depends heavily on aid, and energetically backed the democratic reforms that Abiy had promised when he came to power in 2018. But relations have now soured. America has criticised Abiy for his increasingly authoritarian ways and for waging a brutal civil war. Abiy has responded by thumbing his nose at Uncle Sam and finding less preachy friends.

Turkey, Iran, Israel and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have all reportedly been selling weapons to Ethiopia. Eritrea has sent troops. The UAE has been accused of flying drones for Abiy. It also pledged billions in aid, and has reportedly trained Abiy’s personal bodyguard. Such help may have given him the confidence to wage total war on rebels in Tigray, a northern region, rather than negotiate with them.

The results have been ugly. Jemal Ibrahim (not his real name) was hiding in the Tigrayan mountains when the drones came. One night he saw what he believes were unmanned spy planes buzzing across a cloudless sky. The next morning, he heard explosions in the fields below.

When he went down to look, “what I saw was really dreadful,” he says, his voice faltering. The charred remains of tanks lay twisted by the side of the road. Once, he says, he saw a Land Cruiser ferrying journalists working for a Tigrayan broadcaster explode before his eyes.

Bombs and bullets were supposed to cow the Tigrayan rebels. Instead they have enraged them. The rebels have regrouped, repelled the Ethiopian army and advanced towards the capital, Addis Ababa, which is also threatened by insurgents from the south. The government is arresting ethnic Tigrayans and urging other civilians to arm themselves. Because of the war, millions of Ethiopians are at risk of going hungry.

The disaster unfolding in Ethiopia cannot wholly be blamed on outside interference. But it has not helped. Like many autocratic rulers, Abiy likes dealing with other autocrats. They don’t fuss about democracy and human rights. Their diplomacy is personalised and transactional—we’ll sell you arms, and perhaps our firms will win construction contracts in your country.

Abiy’s refusal to listen to America, which counselled restraint, has cost Ethiopians dearly. And the support of a clutch of medium-sized autocratic powers has hastened Ethiopia’s descent into the abyss.

It is also part of a broader trend. As America retreats from the world, middle-sized powers are throwing their weight around more. No one is surprised that China and Russia project hard power abroad. What is new is that smaller menaces like Belarus, Cuba, Egypt, Iran, Pakistan, Turkey and Saudi Arabia are doing so more brazenly than at any point in recent history. Middle-sized powers now have “an enormous capacity for messing [things] up”, laments a senior UN official.

America is still the world’s greatest power. But since the late 2000s its ability to deter foes and reassure friends has waned. George Bush’s invasion of Iraq ended in failure. Barack Obama drew a “red line” against the use of chemical weapons but did nothing when Bashar al-Assad crossed it in Syria. Donald Trump scorned America’s allies. Joe Biden ditched Afghanistan.

Other countries sense, not exactly a vacuum, but many areas of the world where American power is unlikely to be deployed vigorously. Mr Biden says he had to ditch Afghanistan to concentrate on China. If all his attention is on China, other regimes may calculate that they are free to flex their muscles elsewhere.

They do so for a variety of reasons. Some have legitimate security concerns, and no longer feel they can rely on a superpower to protect them. Some venture abroad to distract attention from failures at home. Some leaders trade military support for commercial advantage—typically for their cronies, not their people. Some are driven by ideology, but more are driven by something cruder: an understanding that if autocrats help each other, they can stay in power longer.

Probably most meddlers have multiple motives, which is why the new world disorder is so much more complicated than the cold war. Consider Venezuela. Under President Nicolás Maduro, its economy has collapsed by 75%. Yet his awful regime survives, with the help of two medium-sized malefactors (Cuba and Iran), and two large ones (Russia and China).

It is hardly surprising that Russia would have the means and motive to back a regime America loathes, or that China would lend it money. But what of Venezuela’s littler helpers? Cuba’s leaders support Mr Maduro because they are soulmates: autocratic, far-left and brutal. Venezuela sends Cuba cut-price oil; Cuba sends back thousands of doctors and spies. The Cubans train Venezuelan medics and interrogators. They also help Mr Maduro snoop on his own security services, to weed out potential coup plotters.

Iran supports his regime for different reasons. At first glance, Shia theocrats have little in common with the hard-drinking, pork-guzzling socialists who rule Venezuela. But they are united by their hatred of the United States and contempt for the wishes of their own people.

Iran is a “mentor” to Venezuela. It teaches it how to dodge United States sanctions, to which it has been subject for far longer, says a former official of Mr Maduro’s government. Since 2019 trade between Iran and Venezuela has risen sharply. Iran sends Venezuela food and fuel in exchange for gold, which has been smuggled via Turkey. Passengers joke that even near-empty flights between Caracas and Istanbul seem strangely heavy at take-off.

In Ethiopia and Venezuela midsized meddlers have emboldened dismal regimes. In Afghanistan a midsized meddler helped install one. Three weeks after the Taliban seized power, reporters spotted a suave guest in Kabul’s swankiest hotel. Though the Afghan capital was overrun by gun-toting jihadists, Lieutenant-General Faiz Hameed, who was then Pakistan’s chief spy, seemed relaxed. “Don’t worry, everything will be OK,” he told a reporter.

Pakistan meddles for geopolitical reasons. The military men who really call the shots there are afraid of India, their great enemy to the south, and also have an interest in exaggerating that fear, since they use it to justify their huge budget, unaccountable power and splendid perks. They long argued that India wanted to encircle Pakistan by forging ties with Afghanistan. So they supported the Taliban, not least by allowing them to use Pakistan as a rear base.

In August, as America pulled out of Afghanistan, the Taliban took over. Pakistani military officers are crowing. India has lost its influence (which was never as great as Pakistan said it was) and Pakistan has gained a friendlier neighbour.

Meddlers are often muddlers

Yet Pakistan’s victory in Afghanistan could prove pyrrhic. “Pakistan is too poor to support a satellite state,” says Husain Haqqani of the Hudson Institute, an American think-tank. The Taliban are woeful administrators. Under them, Afghanistan's economy is collapsing. Some families are selling their daughters to buy food. Pakistan has no wish to host another surge of Afghan refugees, but if the Taliban provoke another civil war it may have no choice. Fearful of this, Pakistan is pleading with the West to resume aid to Afghanistan, and with the Taliban to be more inclusive. Neither has given much ground yet. Of the two, the Taliban may prove more obstinate.

Turkey, like Pakistan, has real security concerns, even if its ruler, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, often exaggerates them. Kurdish fighters in Syria, allied to Turkey’s home-grown Kurdish separatists, tried to carve out a statelet on Turkey’s border. Turkey saw this as a threat. Mr Erdogan responded by invading and occupying much of northern Syria. Shops there now sell Turkish goods, the Turkish lira has replaced the Syrian dinar, and Turkish flags hang from government buildings rebuilt by Turkish contractors. Locals complain about abuses by the Syrian mercenaries Turkey uses to police the area.

Until the early 2010s Mr Erdogan tended to rely on diplomacy and mediation to defuse complex regional disputes. Today, he seems to think Gordian knots are best torn apart by a Turkish drone. He has deployed warships to the eastern Mediterranean to lay claim to waters Greece and Cyprus consider their own. He has sent troops to Libya. He has helped Azerbaijan win a war against Armenia.

Mr Erdogan does such things partly because nationalism plays well at home. Even the opposition goes quiet when he wraps himself in the flag. And displays of martial prowess take voters’ minds off the economy, which has suffered under his erratic management. Yet Turkey’s new foreign adventurism also derives from a conviction that the country should deploy its army, NATO’s second biggest, to get its way, no matter what its allies think. Mr Erdogan does not want to leave NATO. But he is ready to push relations with the West to breaking point.

Many Turks began to question their reliance on America after its debacle in Iraq, says Alper Coskun, a Turkish ex-diplomat. The questioning accelerated when, in Syria, America outsourced the ground war against Islamic State to Kurdish forces that Turkey considers terrorists. “There is a feeling we’re not getting anywhere with our traditional partners,” says Mr Coskun.

The Turkish government, which detests Mr Assad, was disappointed when Barack Obama failed to punish him for using chemical weapons in 2013. Russia’s subsequent intervention to prop up Mr Assad ended Turkey’s hopes of toppling him, but also taught Mr Erdogan that Turkey too needed to move fast and break things. The thinking in Ankara was that “If the Russians can get things done with hard power, we can follow their path,” says a Turkish official.

In some ways, Turkey’s interventions have succeeded. Turkey helped Azerbaijan win back territory previously occupied by Armenian forces. The armistice gave Turkey a land corridor to Azerbaijan and the rest of the Turkic world. In Libya a government saved from overthrow by Turkish troops recognised dubious Turkish claims in the eastern Mediterranean. By deploying gunboats, Mr Erdogan showed that Turkey was ready to use force to defend what it considers its maritime borders.

But these victories have damaged relations with Europe, America and Middle Eastern powers. “Trust with allies has been completely lost,” says Soli Ozel, of Kadir Has University in Istanbul. Also, stepping into the vacuum left by American inaction and European weakness means having to deal more with Russia. “When Turkey is left alone in the room with Russia, its hand is not as strong as it once thought,” says Asli Aydintasbas of the European Council on Foreign Relations, a think-tank. It was Russia that greenlit three of the offensives Mr Erdogan launched in Syria—and also set limits on how far Turkish troops could go.

From minnow to mischief-maker

The trailer for “The Ambush” starts like a Hollywood action flick. Soldiers swap jokes and lift weights before setting out on patrol in an armoured vehicle. Insurgents surround them in a valley. Comrades rush to the rescue, while helicopters swoop overhead. Viewers will have to wait until November 25th to find out if they survive.

The good guys in this film, however, are not from America but from the United Arab Emirates (UAE). And the war they are fighting, as part of a Saudi-led coalition battling rebels in Yemen, is one in which America played only a supporting role.

With just 1m citizens in a population of 10m, and a standing army smaller than the Delhi police, the UAE is surely one of the tiniest countries to make a big-budget blockbuster about its martial exploits. Until recently, when the UAE sent troops abroad, it did so as part of larger Western-led missions. Its troops helped America liberate Kuwait and served with NATO in Afghanistan; its warplanes helped America bomb Islamic State. Like the other Gulf states, the UAE long felt comfortable under an American security umbrella.

Lately, though, the Emiratis have struck out on their own. They deployed thousands of ground troops to Yemen. Emirati drones have bombed faraway Libya. Emirati bases have popped up in Eritrea and Somaliland. The country introduced conscription for male citizens in 2014, and in 2018 extended it from 12 to 16 months.

The UAE is not the only Arab country to get involved in regional conflict. Saudi Arabia is still fighting in Yemen, a battle the Emiratis largely quit in 2019. Egypt has intervened in Libya’s civil war. But both acted against what they saw as neighbouring countries’ threats to their own security.

The UAE’s motives are more diffuse. One is ideological: the UAE views political Islam as an existential threat. It has bankrolled anti-Islamist politicians in Egypt and Tunisia. It has sent countless planes stuffed with weapons to Khalifa Haftar, a warlord who in 2019 nearly overthrew the Islamist-aligned government of Libya.

The UAE’s military policy is intertwined with commerce. Tahnoun bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the national-security adviser, also oversees a business portfolio that includes ports and arms. DP World, a Dubai ports conglomerate, runs terminals in the Horn of Africa. And where it goes, so too goes its army. A base in Assab, on the Eritrean coast, served as a jumping-off point for the war in Yemen. The UAE has trained military and police forces in Somalia. It views the region as strategic, not only for defence but also for trade and food security.

Interventions boost the UAE’s mostly state-owned arms industry. The UAE is one of the world’s ten biggest arms importers, says the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, a think-tank. By 2030 it aims to produce a third of its military kit at home. Emirati-made armoured vehicles have already been spotted in Libya.

Yet for all its swagger, the UAE has found foreign intervention hard. Since its withdrawal from Yemen it has dismantled part of its base in Assab. It has also scaled back its role in Libya. Officials cast this in high-minded terms—a pandemic-era effort to focus on the home front. In reality, the UAE is pulling back because it has been unsuccessful. The war in Yemen has become a quagmire; Mr Haftar’s march on Tripoli, the Libyan capital, ended in failure.

The master meddler

Early this month a drone laden with explosives crashed into the Iraqi prime minister’s house, injuring seven bodyguards. No one claimed responsibility, but fingers were pointed at Iranian-backed militias.

Iran is perhaps the most successful medium-sized meddler. It backs Hizbullah, a Shia militia with a chokehold on Lebanon, and Hamas, a Sunni Islamist group that rules Gaza. It helped save Mr Assad in Syria and arms the Houthi rebels in Yemen.

In 2003 America toppled Saddam Hussein, an Iraqi despot, thereby removing a crucial (if odious) counterweight to Iran. Now Iranian-backed militias in Iraq are so strong that the state fears to confront them. America has occasionally pushed back, most notably when Donald Trump ordered the assassination of Qassem Suleimani, the mastermind of Iran’s covert foreign policy. But his influence lingers.

At home, Iran is a mess. Iranians have been growing poorer for a decade. Most are so frustrated that they boycotted an unfair presidential election this year. Yet the foreign armed groups that Iran supports are thriving. Much of the Middle East is now under their sway.

They are not lavishly funded. Nor are they popular. Most avoid elections, or do badly in them And yet Iran has proved adept at setting up ideological franchises. These are not mere automatons. Iran could not tame the Houthis in Yemen even if it wanted to. In Syria Mr Assad flirts with Iran’s Arab foes. Even Hizbullah, Iran’s most loyal Arab offshoot, controls its own arsenal and decides when to launch wars.

But loose control lets Iran’s franchises dig local roots. Iran may provide seed capital, arms and a guide to assembling drones. Its clients are then expected quickly to start financing themselves, through smuggling, extortion or drug-dealing. Mr Assad, Hizbullah and the Houthis peddle amphetamines, hashish and qat (a narcotic leaf). Iran’s main clients have also captured states, wholly (Syria) or in part (Lebanon, Iraq). The Iraqi state pays the salaries of the pro-Iranian militias that undermine it, handing lump sums to their commanders—hardly a recipe for curbing graft.

Franchising violence spares Iranian blood as well as treasure. Iranians fight for Palestine to the last Palestinian, Israelis quip. Fewer Iranians died fighting in Syria and Iraq than other Shia foreigners. Iran has recruited Shia refugees from Pakistan and Afghanistan to join their ranks.

Iran sometimes works with Sunnis but its main aim is to inspire Shias, of whom there are some 100m in the Middle East, to fight its wars. At a warehouse near Basra in Iraq, it signs up volunteers and schools them in its revolutionary creed. Portraits of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, line the walls, along with poems about martyrs. Most Shias reject Iran’s ideology. But those who embrace it have missiles. Indeed, Iran’s franchises add up to what is arguably the Middle East’s most powerful military force. Certainly it can upset the world’s oil supply. In 2019 Iran’s allies in southern Iraq disabled Abqaiq, the world’s largest oil refinery, in Saudi Arabia.

In a multipolar world, the influence of medium-sized powers will surely grow. Many will be benign: think of Japan, Germany or Canada. But as the constraints on midsized malefactors slip, expect more trouble, too. Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute, a think-tank, puts it bluntly: “The international order is going to get a lot messier as a result of the US being less involved.” ■",https://www.economist.com/taxonomy/term/42/0?page=18

#COVID-19

Which leads is to the big question here, which is why this was allowed to get to this point. One can speculate — the mainland let them do it to serve as an example of how bad the virus is, affirming the elimination policy; or they let them do it for the opposite reason — to start gradually getting people accustomed to the virus; or the HK authorities did in defiance of the mainland, for whatever reason. I have no idea, I am not familiar with the local political situation there. But it is a disaster whatever the sequence of events that resulted in it.

The first and biggest reason is that they refused to lock down properly when they had just a few cases and they refused to do mass testing either — there has been talk about doing it in **March** for several weeks now. What is the point of doing it so late?

So in a way this is the only control group left in the world to judge Omicron’s inherent severity — everyone else is either vaccinated or infected already. And the answer is, as suspected, that it is about the same as the OG Wuhan virus. Recall that NYC went past 100 DPM/d at its peak. Hong Kong is at 20 DPM/d now, but that is from the cases two weeks ago, and cases were 1/10th of what they are now then. So one should expect deaths to keep shooting up for a while and they may well reach NYC levels. Complete disaster.

The second reason is that they did not try hard enough to vaccinate the elderly, who were hesitant to do it and had no real reason to when there was no virus around.

Note scientist GM says this Twitter account tends to hyperbole and alarm. There is a high death rate in Hong Kong but the BA.2 mutation is not the reason. Via e-mail:

New Not So Cold War

Ukraine and Russia Agree to Open Corridors for Civilians to Evacuate Mariupol Wall Street Journal. And Volnovakha. So they are encircled.

Ukraine Update: Russia Said to Violate Evacuation Ceasefires Bloomberg. The headline does say “said to” but that is not what readers will remember. Why would it be in Russia’s interest to do so? They could have flattened cities by air and killed plenty of civilians well before now. By contrast, the Azov Battalion has the motive and the means.

An important tidbit from Lambert. Recall the Estonian cargo ship that sank near Odessa yesterday. The assumption is it hit a mine, which means at least parts of the the Odessa port and potentially the Black Sea has been mined, which would tend to have a chilling effect on transport. Lambert’s sitrep: “Two ships in Odessa, this one (moored) and a tug. No other movement in or out. Not a lot of grain or fertilizer, then.”

And this is becoming a very big deal very quickly (hat tip guurst):

Ukraine + Russia account for 1/3 of global wheat exports. The bulk moves from Black Sea ports which analyst says are effectively closed.

A reader recommended this Russian sitrep on Telegram: https://t.me/s/strelkovii. You can run it through a translation service. Having said that, the proprietor is concerned that he will be caught in the heightened information controls in Russia. Apparently he is reading the same materials many Russian-readers are following, e.g., Col Cassad, and does not have additional intel from on the ground sources.

RUSSIA UKRAINE 2 Patrick Armstrong. Since I am hearing way too much about all those Russia tanks:

So far the Russian military operation in Ukraine has been a reconnaissance in force preceded by the destruction of the supplies and headquarters of the Ukrainian Armed Forces by standoff weapons. The object being to suss out where the Ukrainian forces are, to surround them, to check existing Russian intelligence against reality and, at the same time, destroy known headquarters, air and naval assets, supplies and ammunition depots. And, perhaps, there was the hope that the speed and success (Russian/LDPR forces dominated an area of Ukraine about the size of the United Kingdom in the first week) would force an early end (aka recognition of reality). At the moment they are readying for the next phase. The long column that so obsessed the “experts” on CNN is the preparation for the next phase. And that is this: “You didn’t get the hint, so now we have to hit you”. The fact that the column has been sitting there indicates that the Russians know they have complete air superiority. Secondly it is a message to the Ukrainian armed forces that it’s over, give up. (And one should never forget that the Russians/Soviets have always been the best at strategic deception, so who knows what’s actually there versus what the images show?)

What is Russia’s Near Term Objective in Ukraine? Turcopilier (resilc). Consistent with Russell Bentley says the actual plan is, take Ukraine on a line from Chernobyl-Kiev to Odessa, let the West have the rest and let NATO save face, since the West is too Europeanized for Russia to try to install a friendly and not wind up with a massive insurgency.

Putin is NOT crazy and the Russian invasion is NOT failing. The West’s delusions about this war – and its failure to understand the enemy – will prevent it from saving Ukraine, writes military analyst BILL ROGGIO Daily Mail. Several have already linked to this in comments, so ICYMI….

Putin May Have Played Himself. Will We? Matt Taibbi. I hate criticizing Taibbi, but this is not one of his better moments. The US commentary is astute, the Russian part is an entirely different kettle of fish. Starts by presuming Putin is the Decider (which is an error even sites like ours enable by saying “Putin” as opposed to a more wordy formulation). John Helmer (who recall was part of the Carter Administration and therefore has seen official decision-making at very close range:

1. There are no sources on the Stavka, General Staff, DefMin.

2. Putin is not a sole decision-maker and never has been.

3. There is no doubt that some officials were not confided in. In the governments in which I’ve served, especially the USG, I remember how angry that makes those on the out, and how they plot their revenge. (Cf. the story Kissinger used to tell about how Haig arranged to move the walls of the staff assistants’ offices on the weekend to drive them mad and discredit them on Monday morning with Kissinger, to Haig’s advantage. It did.)

4. Bershitsky hasn’t matured with time. Matt seems to have forgotten.

5. There is no comparing the Russian Army of the 1990s with now.

6. Hasn’t Matt been watching the MH17 case for the past 8 years? Nothing made in the Ukraine purporting to be a still picture or moving picture or an audio tape is evidence of anything but crude faking.

7. Anatoly Sobchak’s widow (Narusova) is not a credible source of anything to me except her (and her daughter’s) pursuit of self-enrichment and power.

Dodgy Russian money has destabilised Britain’s democracy. We have to crack down on it Guardian (furzy). Right. In middle of Brexit, the UK is gonna have its prime residential real estate market collapse. However, the dirty money presumably went through offshore corps than can’t readily be traced. We’ve seen similar accounts from the US, the top Russian money can’t readily be found, so we and the UK will go after the small fry who leave footprints.

„Główne wysiłki okupantów są skoncentrowane na okrążeniu Kijowa i osłabieniu oporu w zablokowanych przez niego miejscowościach” - poinformował sztab w komunikacie. Jak dodał, wojska rosyjskie „nadal prowadzą uderzenia przy użyciu pocisków i bomb na tereny zamieszkałe”. Sztab ocenia, że przeciwnik używa systemów artyleryjskich, by niszczyć „krytyczną infrastrukturę i domy mieszkalne”.

Opisując sytuację w Kijowie, sztab podkreślił, że „obrońcy miasta nadal aktywnie przeciwstawiają się atakowi przeciwnika” i utrzymują dotychczasowe pozycje.

W pozostałych częściach kraju „bohaterską obronę prowadzi Czernihów”, gdzie obrońcy utrzymują pozycje na dotychczasowych granicach. Na południu grupa sił ukraińskich „ochrania wybrzeże i pełni zadania w celu niedopuszczenia do okrążenia Mikołajewa”.

Sztab zapewnił, że nadal prowadzi uderzenia ukraińskie lotnictwo, a Rosjanie stracili 37 samolotów i śmigłowców.

Podkreślił też, że na Ukrainie ""ludność miejscowa na wszelkie sposoby udowadnia, że Rosja nie jest tu mile widziana”.

Sztab zaapelował do obywateli, by nie ulegali panice i aby opierali się „wyłącznie na sprawdzonych źródłach informacji”.
