WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden has added a stop in Poland to his trip this week to Europe for urgent talks with NATO and European allies, as Russian forces concentrate their fire upon cities and trapped civilians in a nearly month-old invasion of Ukraine.

Biden will first travel to Brussels and then to Poland to meet with leaders there, press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement Sunday night.

Poland is a crucial ally in the Ukraine crisis. It is hosting thousands of American troops and is taking in more people fleeing the war in Ukraine — more than 2 million — than any other nation in the midst of the largest European refugee crisis in decades.

Biden will head to Warsaw for a bilateral meeting with President Andrzej Duda scheduled for Saturday. Biden will discuss how the U.S., along with its allies and partners, is responding to “the humanitarian and human rights crisis that Russia’s unjustified and unprovoked war on Ukraine has created,” Psaki said.

On Monday ahead of his trip, Biden will discuss the war with European leaders. President Emmanuel Macron of France, Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, Prime Minister Mario Draghi of Italy and Prime Minister Boris Johnson of the United Kingdom are expected to take part, the White House said Sunday.

White House officials have said Biden has no plans to travel to Ukraine. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, while in Poland this month, briefly crossed into neighboring Ukraine in a show of solidarity alongside that country’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba. Poland has been one of the most vocal countries in asking fellow NATO members to consider getting more involved to rein in the bloodshed.

Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine largely has united the U.S. and NATO and European allies, as well as allies in Asia and elsewhere. The United States and European governments see Moscow’s military aggression as a threat to their security and strategic interests.

Biden and NATO have said repeatedly that while the U.S. and NATO will provide weapons and other defensive support to non-NATO member Ukraine, they are determined to avoid any escalation on behalf of Kyiv that risks a broader war with Russia.

The Pentagon on March 9 rejected a Polish proposal for providing Ukraine with MiG fighter jets via a NATO air base, saying allied efforts against the Russian invasion should focus on more useful weaponry and that the MiG transfer with a U.S. and NATO connection would run a “high risk” of escalating the war.

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has pleaded for the U.S. to provide his military with more aircraft and advanced air-defense systems. NATO and the United States have rejected his appeals to establish a “no-fly zone” over Ukraine to suppress Russian air power, saying it would put Western forces in direct conflict with Russian ones.

Determined resistance by Ukrainian fighters when Russian tanks and troops rolled into Ukraine in late February quickly defeated Russian forces’ attempts to storm Ukraine’s capital and unseat the westward-looking government. Denied an easy and early victory, Russia’s military is reverting to the scorched earth tactics of its past offensives in Syria and Chechnya, and pounding population centers with airstrikes and artillery barrages that leave civilians like those in the port city of Mariupol able to safely venture out for food or water, to bury the dead, or to flee.

After Biden rallied European allies to join in sweeping sanctions against Russia over the invasion at the outset, his tasks now include dealing with some NATO members that are pushing for more involvement directly in the fighting. That includes proposals by Poland for peacekeepers.

Biden’s trip includes a summit Thursday of NATO leaders, who will use the meeting to look at strengthening the bloc’s own deterrence and defense, immediately and in the long term, to deal with the now openly confrontational Putin.

That gathering is intended not just to show NATO’s “support to Ukraine, but also our readiness to protect and defend all NATO allies,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday.

“And by sending that message, we are preventing an escalation of the conflict to a full-fledged war between NATO and Russia,” Stoltenberg said.

Front-line NATO members on the alliance’s eastern flank are also asking for advanced U.S. and British air defense systems to guard against the kind of missile and air assaults Russia is unleashing on Ukraine.

“We have to strengthen our eastern flank of NATO. We have been talking about this for years, but now it’s time for action,″ Estonia’s prime minister, Kaja Kallas, told CNN’s ”State of the Union.”

She added: “We need some more capabilities to support ourselves and defend ourselves by air defense systems, what is definitely necessary here, but also the troops that are present that act as a deterrent also to the Russian military.”

Noting that Russia is firing missiles “from such a long range that they can also reach Paris from where they are shooting right now,” Kallas said European leaders must “understand that this defense is our common issue, and it’s not a theoretical discussion, but issue in real life.”

Biden also will participate in a European Council summit to discuss the allies’ sanctions on Russia and humanitarian efforts for the millions of Ukraine’s people displaced by Russia’s attacks, Psaki said last week.

His agenda includes a meeting of leaders of the the Group of Seven countries to discuss the punishing financial and economic penalties that the West and its allies have leveled on Russia over its invasion, Psaki said.",https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-biden-united-states-europe-jen-psaki-91f79d3c9270cdedb6e702d41195fca8

WASHINGTON, March 20 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joseph Biden will travel to Poland on Friday to discuss the international response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine that has sparked a ""humanitarian and human rights crisis,"" White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said late Sunday.

Biden will travel to Warsaw where he will hold a bilateral meeting with President Andrzej Duda, the White House said. Over 2 million refugees have entered Poland from Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion on Feb. 24, the Polish border guard said on Friday.

Biden's Poland trip will come a day after he meets in Brussels with NATO Allies, G7 Leaders and European Union Leaders to discuss international efforts to support Ukraine after Russia's invasion, the White House said.

The White House also said Biden will host a call Monday at 11 a.m. EST with President Emmanuel Macron of France, Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, Prime Minister Mario Draghi of Italy, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson of the United Kingdom to discuss their coordinated responses to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

United Nations data showed as of Thursday about 3.2 million have fled abroad from Ukraine since last month, in what has become Europe's fastest growing refugee crisis since World War Two. The U.N. said some of the 2 million people entering Poland from Ukraine have moved on to other countries in the EU but the ""the majority are believed to be still in Poland.""

On Thursday, Biden will attend an emergency NATO Summit on Ukraine as well as a G7 meeting. He will also join a scheduled European Council Summit to discuss Ukraine ""including transatlantic efforts to impose economic costs on Russia, provide humanitarian support to those affected by the violence, and address other challenges related to the conflict,"" the White House said.

Earlier on Sunday, Psaki said Biden was not planning to visit Ukraine during his European trip this week.

The big idea

NATO leaders will be under pressure to announce something

President Biden heads to Europe this week on what could be one of his most consequential overseas trips, showcasing unity with NATO and European Union partners and setting the stage for the next phase of the West’s response to Russia’s war in Ukraine.

On Thursday, Biden will attend an emergency meeting of NATO, then a previously scheduled European Council meeting, followed by a gathering of the Group of Seven rich countries — Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.

On Friday, he’ll travel to Warsaw, to discuss efforts to help countries that have taken in the lion’s share of nearly 3.5 million Ukrainian refugees.

Will Biden go to Ukraine?

Mostly for security reasons, this is a very long shot. Kind of like Saint Peter’s upsetting No. 2 seed Kentucky in “March Madness,” except with worse odds.

Former Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko, who’s known Biden for years, pushed this weekend for Biden to do it.

“Why don't — very good friend of mine, very good friend of Ukraine, Joe Biden, the leader of the global world, who demonstrate now the leadership — why don't he come visit here next week as a symbol of our solidarity?” Poroshenko asked Saturday on CNN.

“That would be extremely right step for demonstration, the whole world is together with us against Russia,” Poroshenko said.

On Twitter, White House press secretary Jen Psaki poured cold water on the possibility without completely ruling it out, saying there were “no plans” for Biden to visit Ukraine this week.

We will have additional details of @potus trip to Europe to announce later today. The trip will be focused on continuing to rally the world in support of the Ukrainian people and against President Putin’s invasion of Ukraine,

but there are no plans to travel into Ukraine. — Jen Psaki (@PressSec) March 20, 2022

It’s not that American presidents don’t visit war zones — they do, and quite frequently.

Think of President Donald Trump visiting the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea in June 2019. Or President Barack Obama’s December 2010 stop at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. Or President George W. Bush ducking two thrown shoes during a stop in Iraq in December 2008.

It’s just that their destinations tend to be places where the United States has combat troops. Their presence means a whole network of U.S. logistical and security support (that doesn’t necessarily exist elsewhere) can facilitate a president’s in-and-out, and safety on the ground.

What will NATO announce?

The centerpiece of Biden’s visit is an emergency NATO summit in Brussels.

The United States and the alliance have ruled out setting up a “no-fly zone” over Ukraine, despite entreaties from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Prospects also seem dim for facilitating the transfer of Soviet-era warplanes to Ukraine.

Beyond restating an “ironclad commitment” to defend “every inch” of NATO territory, and a likely new push to give Ukrainian anti-armor and air-defense systems, it’s not clear what the alliance could announce.

One long-shot possibility would also be an astonishing act of poetic justice. As I mentioned on Julie Mason’s SiriusXM show on Friday, NATO member Turkey recently acquired Russian-made S-400 missile defense systems over strenuous U.S. objections. It could now transfer them to Ukraine, where troops have operated the older S-300 system.

Will there be new aid for countries that have taken in refugees?

In a roundtable with journalists on Thursday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken described the situation in Ukraine’s neighbors as a “refugee crisis.” When Vice President Harris recently visited Poland, that country’s President Andrzej Duda warned it could turn into a “refugee disaster.”

Advertisement

Nearly 3.5 million Ukrainians have fled their war-torn homeland, more than 2 million of them seeking shelter in Poland. That’s about 500,000 more people than live in Philadelphia.

Biden’s stop at the European Council could be a venue for announcing expanded aid. So could his visit to Poland on Friday, since it focuses on what Psaki called the “humanitarian and human rights crisis.”

Last Thursday, Blinken said the United States and European Union were looking at “how we can effectively channel our resources to support countries, particularly the neighboring countries that are bearing such a burden — Poland, little Moldova, Romania, others” and promised “more on that in the days to come.”

Any message to China?

Biden spoke for nearly two hours Friday with Chinese President Xi Jinping, warning him against providing Moscow with military or economic aid as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war drags on. It’s not clear whether he’ll seek a similar statement from NATO or the European Council this week.

How does Russia respond?

Lurking in the backdrop of Biden’s trip is how the man running the Kremlin will respond. Some experts think the war could soon reach a stalemate of sorts, with Putin’s forces unable to take over and secure areas they’d hoped to capture. At the same time, Russian forces have delivered bloody destruction to civilian areas, in particular the besieged and battered city of Mariupol.

Putin has warned convoys delivering weapons to Ukraine are fair game, then followed up with an airstrike near the Polish border, some 10 miles inside Ukraine.

But he has not (yet?) turned his cyberweapons on America, or breached NATO territory.

The United States and its allies will likely watch and wait for any clue from Moscow.

Lunchtime reads from The Post

Some Black women leaders are wary of how Ketanji Brown Jackson will be questioned

“The caution that [Glynda Carr, president and chief executive of Higher Heights,] and other Black women are feeling ahead of this week’s hearings has multiple causes, they say, including how some Republicans have sought to undermine Jackson’s qualifications in the weeks since President Biden announced her nomination; the biases other women nominees — and women of color nominees in particular — have faced in seeking some of the most elite jobs in government; and Black women’s own lived experiences facing discrimination in hiring processes and feeling like they’re held to higher standards than White and male candidates,” Julianne McShane reports.

… and beyond

‘We were the last journalists in Mariupol. Now there are none.’

“The Russians were hunting us down. They had a list of names, including ours, and they were closing in,” the AP’s Mstyslav Chernov writes.

“We had been documenting the siege of the Ukrainian city by Russian troops for more than two weeks and were the only international journalists left in the city. We were reporting inside the hospital when gunmen began stalking the corridors. Surgeons gave us white scrubs to wear as camouflage.”

Mstyslav Chernov is a video journalist for the AP. This is his account of the siege of Mariupol, as relayed to AP reporter Lori Hinnant.

Russia failed to win an early victory in Ukraine. Now it’s shifting to ‘Plan B.’

“After Russian forces failed to secure a quick victory over Ukraine, senior U.S. officials see signs the Kremlin is shifting to a new strategy to secure key territorial objectives while seeking leverage to compel the Ukrainian government to accept neutrality between Russia and the West,” the Wall Street Journal’s Michael R. Gordon and Alex Leary report.

What if that fails, too? “Should Mr. Putin’s demands for territory and neutrality be rebuffed, he is expected to try to hold all of the ground his forces have taken, and fight on, U.S. officials said.”

The Biden agenda

US official says Biden fortified Saudi’s Patriot missile supply

“The U.S. has transferred a significant number of Patriot antimissile interceptors to Saudi Arabia in recent weeks as the Biden administration looks to ease what has been a point of tension in the increasingly complicated U.S.-Saudi relationship,” the AP’s Aamer Madhani reports.

Speaking on the condition of anonymity, a senior administration said the decision is in line with Biden’s promise that “America will have the backs of our friends in the region.”

The U.S. and E.U. are coordinating to warn China against helping Putin

“The European Union looks set to reinforce the U.S. warning to China that Beijing would face serious consequences if it tried to cushion the blow of sanctions against Russia or provide Moscow with military support,” Bloomberg’s Jenny Leonard and Alberto Nardelli report.

Biden targets ocean shipping amid inflation surge

“With inflation surging at its fastest pace in 40 years, President Biden has identified a new culprit that he says is helping fuel America’s skyrocketing prices: The ocean vessels that ferry containers stuffed with foreign products to America’s shores each year,” the New York Times’s Ana Swanson reports.

Costs, time both up: “The price to transport a container from China to the West Coast of the United States costs 12 times as much as it did two years ago, while the time it takes a container to make that journey has nearly doubled.”

How Russia’s aggression in Ukraine during the Obama era is shaping Biden’s actions today

“Biden’s role as chief Ukraine envoy during Russia’s brazen seizure of Crimea and fomenting of conflict in eastern Ukraine — for which it faced few significant consequences — deeply informs his handling of the current crisis in Ukraine, according to current Biden and former Obama officials,” Ashley Parker and Ellen Nakashima report.

The careers of Supreme Court justices, visualized

“Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, President Biden’s nominee to fill the upcoming Supreme Court vacancy, faces four days of Senate hearings starting today that are sure to include questions about her career. Jackson is the first Black woman to be nominated to the nation’s highest court in its 233-year history and in other ways she would bring less-common experiences, namely having served as a district court judge and public defender.” our colleagues Adrian Blanco and Shelly Tan report.

The Democrats’ challenge: Building a Latino vote firewall in the West

“Trump has amassed a bigger war chest than any of the GOP party committees that are focused on the midterms, but for a second straight month didn’t donate any of it to other Republicans.”

The numbers: “After taking in $3.5 million and spending just $1.2 million, Trump’s Save America ended February with $110 million in the bank.”

BRUSSELS — President Biden will confront the growing Ukrainian refugee crisis in the most direct way yet when he visits Poland this week, where he will pledge more American aid to alleviate human suffering, discuss the emergency with Polish leaders and potentially meet Ukrainians who have fled their homeland. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The visit is part of a trip to Brussels and Warsaw where Biden aims to reiterate American global leadership and, at a time when the Russian invasion of Ukraine threatens to settle into an indefinite slog, bolster the NATO alliance and reassure Ukraine that the U.S. commitment is ongoing.

“For the past few months, the West has been united,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Tuesday. “The president is traveling to Europe to ensure we stay united, to cement our collective resolve, to send a powerful message that we are prepared and committed to this for as long as it takes.”

When Biden meets with European leaders on Thursday, the heads of state plan to announce new sanctions on Russia as well as new ways of cracking down on those who seek to evade the current sanctions. He will also seek to smooth over the emerging splits between allies who want to supply offensive weapons such as fighter jets to Ukraine and those who fear that doing so would escalate the confrontation with Moscow.

Biden’s decision to visit Poland was added to the itinerary only in the past few days, reflecting the country’s position at the center of an intensifying refugee crisis, as more than 2 million Ukrainian refugees have sought safety in Poland since the conflict began.

“Poland has taken the brunt of the humanitarian impact outside of Ukraine in terms of the refugee flows,” Sullivan said. “Poland is where the United States has surged a significant number of forces to be able to help defend and shore up the eastern flank.”

The United States has moved additional forces into Poland, one of the NATO countries closest to Russia, Sullivan noted. “Poland has to contend not just with the war in Ukraine, but with Russia’s military deployments to Belarus, which have fundamentally changed the security equation there,” he said.

While in Poland, Biden plans to hold an event related to refugees, which could include meeting with some of the Ukrainians who have been streaming across the border, but the details are still being worked out, according to three people familiar with the planning who requested anonymity to describe plans that were not yet finalized.

Amy Gutmann, the U.S. ambassador to Germany, told reporters this week in Berlin that the Biden administration is intent on “making sure that the U.S.’s concern and interest in helping with the refugee situation is front and center.” The United States is prepared to ease the burden on Europe by taking refugees, Gutmann said, but many of those fleeing the fighting may wish to remain closer to Ukraine in hopes of eventually returning home.

“Most refugees want to go back, if they can, when they can,” the ambassador said. “And most don’t want to move farther from home than they have to. That said, I know there’s a willingness on the part of the U.S. to accept Ukrainian refugees if they want to come to the U.S.”

At minimum, Biden will meet with experts involved in the humanitarian response, Sullivan said. “He will announce further American contributions to a coordinated humanitarian response to ease the suffering of civilians inside Ukraine and to respond to the growing flow of refugees,” he told reporters.

Biden has grappled with refugee issues since taking office. He faced criticism from liberal activists for wavering on whether to raise the refugee cap from the low levels of the Trump era. He wrestled with resettling thousands of refugees from Afghanistan after the U.S. withdrawal from that country last summer.

Poland is the biggest — and arguably the most pivotal — country on Europe’s eastern flank, with Ukraine and Belarus on one side and Germany on the other. Washington and Warsaw were recently at odds over whether to provide fighter jets to Ukraine, and Biden’s visit is an opportunity to assert that the alliance remains united despite such differences.

Biden’s trip, only his third overseas journey since taking office, will begin in Brussels where he will attend a NATO summit, a Group of 7 meeting and a session with heads of state from the European Union. He will then travel to Poland, a visit that will include a meeting with President Andrzej Duda on Saturday.

Despite some calls for him to do so, Biden does not plan to visit Ukraine, the White House said, given the dangers of entering a war zone.

In Brussels, Biden will coordinate with allies on the next phases of military assistance to Ukraine as well as on ways to tighten the economic squeeze the West is seeking to inflict on Russia. Ensuring that companies and countries cannot find ways to evade existing sanctions, U.S. officials said, is at least as important as imposing new ones.

Sullivan said that Biden will also announce actions to enhance European energy security, including by cutting the continent’s dependence on Russian gas. The call to ban oil and gas imports from Russia has been sensitive for some Western allies, particularly Germany, which is far more dependent on that source.

Biden announced this month that he was banning all U.S. imports of oil and gas from Russia effective immediately, a dramatic effort to further isolate Moscow economically. The E.U. unveiled a separate plan to slash Russian gas imports by approximately two-thirds this year, but questions remain about how quickly member nations can achieve that goal.

In one sense, Biden’s trip to Europe may prove to be more symbolic than substantive, since it remains unclear just how much further the allies are prepared to go to punish Russia and bolster Ukraine’s defenses. The West has already unleashed a far-reaching package of sanctions against Moscow and provided billions of dollars in military assistance to Kyiv.

But diplomats and analysts said Biden’s visit to the heart of Europe at a time of war and upheaval has a powerful symbolic value nonetheless.

“The most fundamental deliverable is for the U.S. president to show up at the time of the greatest crisis in European security since the end of the Second World War,” said Ian Lesser, the vice president of the German Marshall Fund. “There’s an opportunity for American leadership, there’s an expectation for American leadership. That symbolism is actually highly important.”

Biden has made it clear since taking office that one of his top foreign policy goals is to reclaim America’s leadership role on the global stage, following President Donald Trump’s hostility toward key U.S. allies and his disdain for international alliances and agreements. From rejoining the Paris climate pact to seeking to renegotiate the Iran nuclear deal, Biden has tried to reengage the United States in efforts by the international community to take on large, complex problems.

Some allies were wary of this push initially, saying they had no guarantee that Trump or someone like him would not be elected later, and the rocky U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan further eroded some foreign officials’ confidence in American leadership. In rallying democracies’ opposition to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Biden appears to have restored some confidence levels.

Biden will probably receive a friendly greeting from European leaders in Brussels. The visit to Warsaw, however, could be trickier.

The influx of Ukrainians has rapidly become a crisis. Warsaw’s mayor warned in a recent interview with The Washington Post that the city is on the brink, struggling to provide enough housing, schooling and medical care for the refugees who continue to cross the border.

Biden will face pressure not only to pledge funds and other assistance to alleviate that problem, but also to smooth over a recent diplomatic spat between the United States and Poland.

The two nations recently engaged in a public disagreement after the United States essentially declined an offer from Poland to deliver MiG-29 fighter jets to an American military base for use in Ukraine. Biden administration officials raised concerns that Poland’s offer could increase tensions with Russia, which has said that any country hosting Ukraine’s military aircraft would be considered part of the ongoing conflict.

The United States, while supplying equipment such as antitank Javelin missiles to Ukraine, has shied away from anything that Moscow could interpret as a direct American confrontation with Russian troops.

“To my knowledge, it wasn’t pre-consulted with us that they plan to give these planes to us,” Victoria Nuland, the undersecretary of state for political affairs, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee this month. She characterized Poland’s unusual public offer as a “surprise move by the Poles.”

Biden also heads to Europe as coronavirus cases have been rising on the continent, fueled by BA.2, a version of the omicron variant of the virus. On Tuesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki disclosed that she had tested positive for the virus and would not join Biden on the trip as planned.

Psaki also missed Biden’s international trip in October, when she contracted the virus for the first time.

In a statement, Psaki said she had two socially distanced meetings with Biden on Monday, but that the president is not considered a close contact as defined by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. The CDC defines a close contact as someone who was less than six feet away from an infected person for a cumulative total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period.

Biden tested negative on Tuesday, Psaki said.

It was heartwarming to see how they have opened their hearts, doors and homes to the women and children, the elderly and infirm trying to make their way out of Ukraine for safety,” Texas Republican Sen. Cornyn said Monday. “Ukrainians are showing great courage, but one thing we heard is that they need more humanitarian relief and weapons to defend themselves and their country.”

The Biden administration has worked with allies to rally support for military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, but some of the requests from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his leadership have not been deemed to be in the best interests of U.S. security. Among those: the establishment of a no-fly zone that could lead NATO pilots into combat with Russia and an effort to transfer Polish MiG fighter jets to Ukraine that was going to require some kind of U.S. involvement.

The trip to Warsaw and potentially other destinations in Poland will be perhaps the most fraught since President George H.W. Bush’s travels in the summer of 1989, when he visited both Warsaw and the shipyards in Gdansk as the Soviet satellite states in Eastern Europe were moving toward freedom and democracy.

“I spoke in front of the Solidarity Workers monument to an animated throng which packed and overflowed the square. There were thousands lining the street going into town, and estimates of up to 250,000 in the square. It was an emotional moment, with grown men and women crying,” Bush wrote in a 1998 book. “At the end of the day I had the heady sense that I was witnessing history being made on the spot, as the leaders from the regime and Solidarity came together.”

Washington, D.C.

6:10 P.M. EDT



THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. My name is Joe Biden, and I come from Delaware which has more corporations incorporated than all of the rest of the country combined. (Laughter.)

And I know the Business Roundtable because in the days when I first ran for office — (clears throat) — excuse me — in 1972, for the United States Senate, the DuPont company was the eighth-largest corporation in America. As they say in Delaware, they were the good old days. But all kidding aside, thank you for having me. You’re a hell of an organization. I appreciate it.

And I want to thank you, Josh. We’ve known each other a long, long time. And, you know, I’ve hosted CEO roundtables, you know, in the White House, including with many of you over the years. And we’ve worked together on the American Rescue Plan, on COVID, on infrastructure, supply chains, innovation, on climate and clean energy, reducing costs and a whole lot more.

And our strategy has worked, I believe, and I think it’s still working. 6.7 million jobs last year –- the most ever created in one year; more than 7 million now. 678,000 created just last month, in one month. Unemployment down to 3.8 percent. Our economy grew at 5.7 percent last year, and the strongest in nearly 40 years.

And we reduced the deficit, we reduced the deficit — I want to say it again: We reduced the deficit by $360 billion last year, notwithstanding all that I hear on some channels when I turn them on. And we’re on track to reduce it by over $1 trillion this year.

And that groundwork has positioned our economy to deal with — with the global problem of inflation, which is real — a lot of people are being hurt by it.

And it’s underscored that America is a great place to invest.

Intel is investing $20 million — billion in a semiconductor campus in Ohio. I think — Mary, I think GM is investing about $7 billion in new plant and equipment. And, Ford, I think you’re doing $11 billion.

The point is: These are — these are hi- — these are history-making investments to build electric vehicles here at home.

We’ve seen record electric vehicle sales, along with records in solar, wind, and battery storage as well.

In sector after sector, we’re making it in America again. And that’s what my overwhelming objective is: to make it in America.

With the Infrastructure Law, we’re going to keep — we’re going to keep building millions of good-paying jobs, and they’re real jobs.

And to build on progress, the Senate and House need to work on the Innovation Bill and send it to my desk. It’s important for our economy and, I would argue, for our national security as well.

And we’re also leading on the global stage because of you all. I’m pleased to see American companies stepping up and doing their part. And what you’re doing in terms of donating to Ukraine and winding down your operations without anybody requesting it. I want to make that clear: You’re on your own on winding down operations in Russia. Not all, but many have. Not only you, but around the world.

And for the first time — on that subject, let me say this — for the first time that Putin began amassing troops along the Ukrainian border, I called for an emergency meeting of NATO in Europe to make the case that we had to be united.

The one thing I’m confident, knowing Putin fairly well — as well as, I guess, another leader could know one another — is that he was counting on being able to split NATO. He never thought NATO would stay resolved — stay totally, thoroughly united.

And I can assure you: NATO has never been stronger or more united in its entire history than it is today, in large part because of Vladimir Putin.

And — but, you know, in response to his aggression, there has been — we presented a united front throughout NATO and in the Pacific.

The Quad is — with the possible exception of India being somewhat shaky on some of this. But Japan has been extremely strong, so has Australia, in terms of dealing with Putin’s aggression. We presented a united front throughout NATO and the Pacific.

And you did a hell of a lot to help us impose sanctions and incur costs — real costs on the Russian economy. And we’re seeing now that it mattered. It was really important what you all did. Not every one of you, but — I’m not suggesting you all had to — but those of you who did step up, it made a big — made a big difference. And I’m personally, as President, grateful for that.

But because our response — because our response is working, because the Ukrainians are fighting so valiantly and using the equipment we’ve given them — and the United States alone has committed over $2 billion to NATO. The idea that they don’t have enough sophisticated equipment is just simply not accurate. And I’m not going to take the time to go into all of the detail here, but the point is: They have every — every equipment — every piece of equipment that makes rational sense, based on our military and NATO’s military, for them to be able to do what they’re doing. And they’re wreaking havoc on the — on the Russian military, whether it’s their tanks or their helicopters or their aircraft.

And, if you notice, they’ve just launched a — their hypersonic missile, because it’s the only thing that they can get through with absolute certainty. It’s — as you all know, it’s a consequential weapon. And — but — with the same warhead on it as a — as any other launched missile. It doesn’t make that much difference, except it’s almost impossible to stop it. There’s a reason they’re using it.

And now Putin’s back is against the wall. He wasn’t anticipating the extent or the strength of our unity. And the more his back is against the wall, the greater the severity of the tactics he may employ.

We’ve seen it before. He’s run a lot of false-flag operations. Whenever he starts talking about something he thinks NATO, Ukraine, or the United States is about to do, it means he’s getting ready to do it. Not a joke.

You may recall — I said this to a few of you this morning that I was able to declassify a whole range of operations that they were about to engage in without sacrificing sources and methods. And it was able to give everybody clear notice what was about to come. And it convinced a lot of our friends around the world that we know what they’re about to do.

And so, his back is against the wall. And he’s — now he’s talking about new false flags he’s setting up, including he’s asserting that, we, in America, have biological as well as chemical weapons in Europe — simply not true. I guarantee you.

They’re also suggesting that Ukraine has biological and chemical weapons in Ukraine. That’s a clear sign he is considering using both of those. He’s already used chemical weapons in the past, and we should be careful of what about — of what’s about to come. He knows there’ll be severe consequences because of the united NATO front, but the point is: It’s real.

And what I want to mention very much — very quickly with you all is: One of the tools he’s most likely to use, in my view, in our view, is cyber — cyberattacks. They have a very sophisticated cyber capability.

I’ve had, as they say in southern Delaware, where they — where they are very religious: We’ve had an “altar call,” he and I, on this issue. We’ve had a long conversation about, if he uses it, what would be the consequence.

But the point is that he has a capability; he hasn’t used it yet. And — but it’s part of his playbook. And I’ve warned about the potential for Russian conduct to maliciously — malicious cyber activity in response to the cost we’d impose, with our Allies and partners, on the world.

But, look, today my administration has issued renewed warnings that, based on evolving intelligence, Russia may be planning a cyberattack against us.

And as I’ve said, the magnitude of Russia’s cyber capacity is fairly consequential, and it’s coming.

The federal government is doing its part to get ready. But under U.S. law, as you all remember, the private sector, all of you, largely decides the protections that we will or will not take in order to protect your sources.

But let me be absolutely clear about something: It’s not just in your interests that are at stake with their potential use of cybersecurity, it is in — the national interest is at stake.

And I would respectfully suggest it’s a patriotic obligation for you to invest as much as you can in making sure — and we will urge — we’ll help in any way that you have built up your technological capacity to deal with cyber capa- — with cyberattacks: first, to protect your own companies; second, that provides critical — as providers of critical services that Americans rely on, from power to clean water; and finally, your role you can play in helping secure every American and every American’s privacy.

For example, banks can turn on cybersecurity by default for every customer so America’s financial data is safe. And we’re prepared to help you, as I said, with any tools and expertise we possess if you’re ready to do that. But it’s your decision as to the steps you’ll take and your responsibility to take them, not ours.

Now we need to do what’s necessary to support Ukraine, but we also need to step up for the families here at home.

In 2019, your organizations realized — or, excuse me, released a statement with a signature of almost everyone in this room. And it says, quote, “America deserves an economy that allows each person to succeed through hard work and creativity, and to lead a life of meaning and dignity.” And it expressed a commitment from you to invest in your workforce and support local communities. It wasn’t a do-gooder statement; it was a capitalist statement. We’re all capitalists in this room. And you did the right thing, in my view, in the assertion of that statement.

This was your view about how to run strong, profitable companies over the long term. And this commitment of consequence and pear- — for — prepare for the free world is vital that you reaffirm that commitment, in my humble opinion.

We can’t afford to prioritize shareholders at the expense of your stakeholders, the environment, your workers, your customers, your communities where they live and work. And you’re not doing that, but I think the inclination — would be inclined to do that on some occasions.

Instead, now’s the time to invest in your people. You can hire and retain the best workforce — best-trained workforce in the entire world, which you’ve been doing.

To invest in innovation so you can — we can deliver better and more affordable products and services from — to more Americans.

To innovate with and for diversity, as you said in your statement, as you — as you committed to earlier this year.

Cultivating tools of artificial intelligence and advanced [to advance] dignity and opportunity for all Americans is what you’ve been doing, many of you, and it really matters.

And to invest in America itself in manufacturing; created over 450,000 manufacturing jobs because of you all, and it really matters. It hadn’t happened in a long time.

As one of my colleagues from the Midwest said: We’re not going to talk about the Rust Belt anymore; we’re going to talk about new, expanded manufacturing capacity in the Middle — in the Middle Atlantics — excuse me, in the Midwest.

And to invest in America itself — in manufacturing, climate resilience, clean energy — so America can win the competition in the 21st century.

And it won’t hurt your bottom lines or the economy. It helps continue us — it’ll help us grow while lowering costs and lowering the deficit.

So, I want to thank you again for — there’s much more to say, but I’ve already probably taken too much time — of your time right now.

But I’m happy — I’m told I’m — we’re going to take some questions, Mary. Is that right? Well, I’m happy to start taking questions.

But thank you for all you’ve been doing.

I think — you know, my mother had an expression: “Out of everything terrible, something good will come if you look hard enough for it.”

I think this presents us with some significant opportunities to make some real changes. You know, we are at an inflection point, I believe, in the world economy — not just the world economy, in the world. It occurs every three or four generations.

As one of — as one of the top military people said to me in a secure meeting the other day, 60 — 60 million people died between 1900 and 1946. And since then, we’ve established a liberal world order, and that hadn’t happened in a long while. A lot of people dying, but nowhere near the chaos.

And now is a time when things are shifting. We’re going to — there’s going to be a new world order out there, and we’ve got to lead it. And we’ve got to unite the rest of the free world in doing it.

So, anyway, I’m going to hush up. Mary, fire away.

Biden will head to Warsaw for a bilateral meeting with President Andrzej Duda scheduled for Saturday. Biden will discuss how the U.S., along with its allies and partners, is responding to “the humanitarian and human rights crisis that Russia’s unjustified and unprovoked war on Ukraine has created,” Psaki said.

Biden has no plans to visit Ukraine, according to White House officials.

While in Poland earlier this month, Secretary of State Antony Blinken quickly went into neighbouring Ukraine to show sympathy with that country's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba.

Poland has been one of the most outspoken in its request for fellow NATO members to consider increasing their involvement in order to reduce the bloodshed.

Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine largely has united the U.S. and NATO and European allies, as well as allies in Asia and elsewhere. The United States and European governments see Moscow’s military aggression as a threat to their security and strategic interests.

Biden and NATO have said repeatedly that while the U.S. and NATO will provide weapons and other defensive support to non-NATO member Ukraine, they are determined to avoid any escalation on behalf of Kyiv that risks a broader war with Russia.

The Pentagon on March 9 rejected a Polish proposal for providing Ukraine with MiG fighter jets via a NATO air base, saying allied efforts against the Russian invasion should focus on more useful weaponry and that the MiG transfer with a U.S. and NATO connection would run a “high risk” of escalating the war.

WASHINGTON (AP) — With Europe facing its most precarious future since World War II, President Joe Biden will huddle with key allies in Brussels and Warsaw this week as the leaders try to prevent Russia’s war on Ukraine from spiraling into an even greater catastrophe.

Biden embarked Wednesday on a four-day trip that will test his ability to navigate the continent’s worst crisis since WWII ended in 1945. There are fears that Russia could use chemical or nuclear weapons as its invasion becomes bogged down in the face of logistical problems and fierce Ukrainian resistance.

“I think it’s a real threat,” Biden said of the possibility of Russia deploying chemical weapons. He spoke during a brief exchange with reporters at the White House before departing for Brussels.

Humanitarian challenges are growing as well. Millions of refugees have fled the fighting, mostly by crossing the border into Poland, and the war has jeopardized Ukraine’s wheat and barley harvests, raising the possibility of rising hunger in impoverished areas around the globe.

Jake Sullivan, Biden’s national security adviser, said the president would coordinate with allies on military assistance for Ukraine and new sanctions on Russia.

One new sanctions option that Biden is looking at is to target hundreds of members of the Russian State Duma, the lower house of parliament, according to a U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the move ahead of any announcement. The official added that a final decision hasn’t been made and that the new sanctions would be rolled out in coordination with Western allies.

Sullivan added that Biden is working on long-term efforts to boost defenses in Eastern Europe, where more countries fear Russian aggression. The president is also aiming to reduce the continent’s reliance on Russian energy.

“This war will not end easily or rapidly,” Sullivan told reporters at a White House briefing on Tuesday. “For the past few months, the West has been united. The president is traveling to Europe to make sure we stay united.”

Sullivan said Vladimir Putin’s references to nuclear weapons at the beginning of the conflict are “something that we do have to be concerned about,” adding that Biden would be talking with allies about “potential responses” if the Russian leader takes that step.

Sullivan’s description of Biden’s trip was another sign that the crisis is entering a new and uncertain phase.

After the initial invasion failed to topple Ukraine’s government, the war has become a grinding endeavor for Putin, who is relying on airstrikes and artillery that are devastating civilian communities. Negotiations between Ukraine and Russia have not produced a cease-fire or a path to ending the conflict, and the U.S. continues to rush weapons like anti-tank missiles to Ukrainian forces.

The war’s ripple effects are also spreading. Biden warned that Russia could be planning cyberattacks that would affect U.S. companies, and he spoke to Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday to warn him against backing Russia with military or financial assistance. Meanwhile, a top State Department official visited India this week shortly after that country decided topurchase more Russian oil.

“This is one of those decisive moments for an American leader that defines their legacy internationally,” said Timothy Naftali, a presidential historian at New York University.

Biden departed for Europe as public health officials took note of a global uptick in COVID-19 cases. Confirmed cases of the virus had been falling steadily worldwide since January but rose again last week, due to the more infectious omicron variant and the suspension of COVID protocols in numerous countries in Europe, North America and elsewhere, the World Health Organization reported on Tuesday.

Biden’s press secretary, Jen Psaki, announced on Tuesday that she would not travel with Biden to Europeafter testing positive for the virus for the second time in five months. Biden was last tested on Tuesday, according to the White House. Psaki said she had two “socially distanced meetings” with Biden on Monday and that he is not considered a “close contact” under Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines.

Biden’s first stop is Brussels, where he’ll attend back-to-back-to-back meetings.

NATO is holding a hastily arranged emergency summit, where Biden is expected to reiterate his support for Article 5 of the alliance’s charter, which commits all members to collective defense if any are attacked.

“I think the meeting of all heads of state and government in NATO will provide us with yet another platform to demonstrate our unity, our support to Ukraine, but also our readiness to protect and defend all NATO allies,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday. “And by sending that message, we are preventing an escalation of the conflict to a full-fledged war between NATO and Russia.”

Biden will also participate in meetings of the European Union and the Group of Seven, which includes the world’s richest democracies.

He’ll then travel to Warsaw on Friday to meet Polish officials to discuss the enormous humanitarian strain caused by the Ukrainian refugee crisis. Biden is scheduled to meet with Polish President Andrzej Duda on Saturday.

Duda, whose country suffered a brutal Nazi occupation during World War II, compared Russian actions in Ukraine to Adolf Hitler’s infamous SS forces. Visiting Bulgaria on Tuesday, Duda said Putin’s army “is behaving in exactly the same way.” He said he hoped that those responsible for attacks on civilians would be brought before international courts.

Polish leaders have pressed for a Western peacekeeping mission to intervene in Ukraine, a step that the U.S. and other Western allies worry could lead to a broadening of the war. The Polish leadership also wants an increased military presence along NATO’s eastern flank.

Sullivan said Biden’s trip to Poland is an important opportunity to “meet with a frontline and very vulnerable ally.” Poland is also host to a growing number of U.S. troops, and Sullivan suggested Biden may visit them as well.

Last week, at NATO’s Brussels headquarters, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and his counterparts weighed what defenses to set up on the organization’s eastern flank, from Estonia in the north through Latvia, Lithuania and Poland down to Bulgaria and Romania on the Black Sea.

The aim is to deter Putin from ordering an invasion of any of the 30 allies, not just for the duration of the war in Ukraine but into the future.

Putin has demanded that NATO withdraw its forces on its eastern flank and stop expanding.

Biden’s visit to Poland follows on Vice President Kamala Harris’ visit to Warsaw and Bucharest earlier this month. While Harris was in Poland, Duda called on the Biden administration to expedite visa procedures for Ukrainians who have family living in the United States so that they could resettle in the U.S. at least temporarily.
