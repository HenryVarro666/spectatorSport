2,95dddd82-3ffb-4874-9c85-6568d220916d,[],,"The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on Friday, March 4, called on Russia to immediately stop the war in Ukraine and withdraw all forces immediately. Addressing a press briefing, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg asserted that Russian President Vladimir Putin always intended to invade the peaceful country of Ukraine led by Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He added that now Putin would have to ""pay a heavy price"" for the same.

""Today, we have addressed the immediate crisis in Ukraine. We will continue to do everything to protect the country from Russia. We are part of this conflict and we have a responsibility to not let this escalate. That will be even more devastating. Though the world leaders agreed that the relations with the Putin-led country have changed, NATO is not seeking a war with Russia. We stand for diplomatic talks,"" Jens Stoltenberg said.

'We will be supporting the countries under threat of Russia': NATO chief

During the press briefing, Jens Stoltenberg underlined that NATO has been providing support to Georgia and its partners, and said, ""We have helped them in capacity building. We have common exercises and though we didn't make any final decision, we will be adding more activities in support of these countries because of the potential attacks by Russia.""

Speaking of Russia capturing Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia NPP, the NATO chief said, ""The reckless actions around the nuclear powerplant highlights the danger of this war. This makes it even more important for President Putin to end this war. He has totally underestimated the strength of the Ukrainians, as they have been successful in pushing back Russian armed forces.""

""UK, Canada, Turkey, etc have provided military aids and have trained ample number of people and we are stepping up with the support of more supplies,"" he said, making it clear once again that NATO is not a party to the conflict as it will 'lead to more catastrophe'.

The immediate response of NATO

As part of the immediate response from NATO, Jens Stoltenberg announced that 200 ships have been deployed on high alert while thousands of troops are being sent from all allies. ""We are increasing our presence further. We have defence ministers meeting on 16th March and based on that meeting we will take decisions.""

The press briefing of Jens Stoltenberg was held after NATO gathered for a meeting to discuss Russia’s 'brutal and unprovoked attack' on Ukraine.",https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/russia-ukraine-crisis/nato-calls-on-russia-to-immediately-stop-the-war-in-ukraine-or-pay-a-heavy-price-articleshow.html

'We are not part of this conflict': NATO rejects plea for Ukraine no-fly zone after nuclear plant attack Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said sending NATO planes to down Russian ones would lead to a European war Photo by PHILIPPE LOPEZ / AFP via Getty Images

Article content BRUSSELS — NATO allies rejected Ukraine’s demand for no-fly zones on Friday, saying they were increasing support but that stepping in directly would lead to a broader, even more brutal European war so far limited to Russia’s assault on its neighbor.

Try refreshing your browser, or 'We are not part of this conflict': NATO rejects plea for Ukraine no-fly zone after nuclear plant attack Back to video Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy appealed again to the West to enforce a no-fly zone over his country after the Russian assault and capture Friday of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Support for Ukraine so far has come mainly in the form of far-reaching sanctions on Russia, with EU members on Friday saying more financial punishment was yet to come. NATO members have sent weapons to Ukraine, but stopped short of military action. “We are not part of this conflict,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told a news conference. “We have a responsibility as NATO allies to prevent this war from escalating beyond Ukraine because that would be even more dangerous, more devastating and would cause even more human suffering.”

Article content In a video message earlier on Friday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said NATO foreign ministers should not allow Putin to “turn Ukraine into Syria,” in reference to the devastating Russia-backed campaign against rebel cities in that country. “Act now before it’s too late,” he said in the message posted on Twitter. Stoltenberg said NATO understood Ukraine’s desperation, calling Russia’s war in Ukraine “horrific” and warning the worst was yet to come, with Russia rolling out more heavy arms. But he said a no-fly zone could only be enforced by sending NATO planes to shoot down Russian ones, adding that the risk of escalation would be too big. Russia and NATO-members United States, Britain and France are all nuclear powers.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the alliance would defend “every inch” of NATO territory from attack. “Ours is a defensive alliance. We seek no conflict. But if conflict comes to us, we are ready,” Blinken said. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Article content Thousands of people are believed to have been killed or wounded and more than 1 million refugees have fled Ukraine since Feb. 24, when Russia’s President Vladimir Putin ordered the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two. Russian invasion forces seized Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant on Friday in heavy fighting in southeastern Ukraine, triggering global alarm. A fire in a training building was extinguished and officials said the facility was now safe. MORE EU SANCTIONS Instead of a military presence in Ukraine, EU countries – most of them also NATO members – said they were eyeing more economic sanctions to add to coordinated restrictions that have already targeted Russia’s financial system and elites.

Article content “We will consider everything,” the bloc’s top diplomat Josep Borrell said, when asked about the possible suspension of the EU’s gas imports from Russia, which think-tank Eurointelligence said amount to $700 million daily even during the war. “This is Putin’s war, and Putin has to stop this war,” Borrell said. It was not immediately clear, however, when the EU would agree on measures given some countries’ heavy reliance on Russian energy supplies.

The 27-nation bloc is examining curbs on Russia’s influence and access to finance at the International Monetary Fund following its invasion of Ukraine, six officials told Reuters. Ireland’s Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said no new sanctions would be announced on Friday but that a fourth round could affect more Russian banks’ access to the SWIFT international transfer system, bar Russian ships from European ports and cut imports like steel, timber, aluminum or coal.

Article content German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the bloc should close any loopholes that could allow Russia to circumvent sanctions.

Putin launched his “special military operation” to get rid of what he said was Ukraine’s fascist government and demilitarize the country. Zelenskiy says Moscow is trying to prevent a liberal democracy flourishing on Russia’s border. “The picture looks very bleak and very dark in terms of Russia’s intentions … and so I think there is huge concern, and there is no point in sugar-coating it,” Coveney said.

The Russian defence ministry said in a statement carried by the RIA Novosti and Tass agencies it has agreed on evacuation routes with Ukrainian forces to allow civilians to leave the strategic port of Mariupol in the south-east and the eastern town of Volnovakha.

The vaguely worded statement did not make clear how long the routes would remain open.

Mariupol had become the scene of growing misery amid days of shelling that knocked out power and most phone service, and raised the prospect of food and water shortages for hundreds of thousands of people in freezing weather. Pharmacies are out of medicine, Doctors Without Borders said.

A top official there said the ceasefire there was to last until 4pm (2pm GMT) and an evacuation was beginning at 11am (9am GMT).

Pavlo Kirilenko, head of the Donetsk military-civil administration that includes Mariupol, said the humanitarian corridor would extend from the city to Zaporizhzhia, about 140 miles away.

Mariupol deputy mayor Serhiy Orlov later told the BBC that the Russians “continue to use hard artillery and rockets to bomb Mariupol. That’s why people are very scared, but anyway they go to three specific points from which we will go to evacuate them by municipal buses”.

The head of Ukraine’s security council, Oleksiy Danilov, had called on Russia to create humanitarian corridors to allow children, women and the elderly to escape the fighting, calling such corridors “question number 1”.

Diplomatic efforts continued as US secretary of state Antony Blinken arrived in Poland to meet with the prime minister and foreign minister, a day after attending a Nato meeting in Brussels in which the alliance pledged to step up support for eastern flank members.

Mr Blinken was due to visit a border post to meet refugees later in the day.

As Russian forces batter strategic locations, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has lashed out at Nato for refusing to impose a no-fly zone over his country, warning that “all the people who die from this day forward will also die because of you”.

Nato says a no-fly zone could provoke widespread war in Europe with nuclear-armed Russia.

But as the United States and other Nato members send weapons for Kyiv and more than one million refugees spill through the continent, the conflict is already drawing in countries far beyond Ukraine’s borders.

Russia continues to crack down on independent media reporting on the war, also blocking Facebook and Twitter, and more outlets say they are pausing their work inside the country.

And in a warning of a hunger crisis yet to come, the UN World Food Programme says millions of people inside Ukraine, a major global wheat supplier, will need food aid “immediately”.

Ukraine’s leader is set to brief US senators on Saturday on a video conference call as US congress considers a request for 10 billion dollars (£7.5 billion) in emergency funding for humanitarian aid and security needs.

In a bitter and emotional speech late on Friday, Mr Zelensky criticized Nato over the lack of a no-fly zone, saying it will fully untie Russia’s hands as it escalates its air attack.

“The alliance has given the green light to the bombing of Ukrainian cities and villages,” he said, warning that “the history of Europe will remember this forever”.

Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg had earlier ruled out the possibility of a no-fly zone, saying Nato planes would have to shoot down Russian aircraft.

In a separate video message to anti-war protesters in several European cities, Mr Zelensky continued to appeal for help. “If we fall, you will fall,” he said.

The UN Security Council will hold an open meeting Monday on the worsening humanitarian situation.

The UN estimates that 12 million people in Ukraine and four million fleeing to neighbouring countries in the coming months will need humanitarian aid.

While the vast Russian armoured column threatening Ukraine’s capital remained stalled outside Kyiv, Mr Putin’s military has launched hundreds of missiles and artillery attacks on cities and other sites across the country.

Russian forces did not make significant progress on Friday in their offensive to sever Ukraine’s access to the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, which would deal a severe blow to its economy.

There were also no changes in the north and the east, where the Russian offensive has stalled, meeting fierce Ukrainian resistance.

Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovich said battles involving airstrikes and artillery continued north-west of Kyiv, and the north-eastern cities of Kharkiv and Okhtyrka came under heavy fire.

He said Ukrainian forces were still holding the northern city of Chernihiv and the southern city of Mykolaiv.

Ukrainian artillery also defended Ukraine’s biggest port city, Odesa, from repeated attempts by Russian ships, he said.

More than 840 children have been wounded in the war, and 28 have been killed, according to Ukraine’s government.

A total of 331 civilians had been confirmed killed but the true number is probably much higher, the UN human rights office said.

Kyiv’s central train station is still crowded with people desperate to flee the capital.
