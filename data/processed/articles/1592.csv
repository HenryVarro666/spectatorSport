Large crowds gathered in the southern port of Melitopol on Saturday to protest the alleged abduction of the city’s mayor, Ivan Fedorov, by Russian troops, an act that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described as “a crime against democracy.” Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight Kirill Timoshenko, the deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential office, posted a video to his Telegram account of what he said was a group of Russian soldiers taking Fedorov away on Friday through a town square, with what appears to be a hood over his head. Footage captured by closed-circuit television spread on social media Friday. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister, corroborated Timoshenko’s claim, saying Fedorov refused to cooperate with the Russian forces occupying the city and was taken away by 10 soldiers.

“During the abduction, they put a plastic bag over his head,” Gerashchenko told Interfax Ukraine. “The enemy detained him in the city crisis center, where he dealt with the life support of the Ukrainian city.”

Russia has accused Fedorov of “terrorist activities,” according to the Associated Press. The prosecutor’s office of the Luhansk People’s Republic, a Moscow-backed rebel region in eastern Ukraine, has claimed without presenting evidence that Fedorov was financing the nationalist militia Right Sector to “commit terrorist crimes against Donbas civilians.”

Zelensky confirmed that Russian forces had captured Fedorov and demanded that Russia “release him from captivity immediately.”

“The detention of the mayor of Melitopol is a crime against democracy,” he said at a news conference Saturday in Kyiv, adding that Russia should be ashamed of its actions.

The Ukrainian president said the alleged abduction of Fedorov, which he called “simple terrorism,” is the latest of a number of actions against mayors across the country who do not cooperate with the Russian forces occupying their cities and towns. Melitopol, with a population of about 150,000, has been under Russian control for two weeks. Despite the Russian occupation of the city, Fedorov, who is ethnic Russian, had encouraged recent demonstrations in Melitopol against Russia.

“They are not ashamed of that video,” Zelensky said of the Russians allegedly abducting Fedorov, asserting that the invading forces were “moving to a new stage of terror.”

Zelensky said he raised the fate of Fedorov in calls to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron, urging the leaders to “get in touch” with Russian President Vladimir Putin “to free the mayor.”

The mayor’s alleged abduction prompted roughly 2,000 people on Saturday to protest outside the city hall building occupied by Russian forces, Zelensky said. Bundled-up against the cold, protesters in Melitopol chanted for Fedorov’s release.

“Bring back the mayor! Bring back the mayor!” they chanted. “Freedom to the mayor! Freedom to the mayor!”

The demonstration took place against a backdrop of an intensifying Russian assault on Ukraine. Russian troops advanced Saturday into the eastern outskirts of Mariupol, a strategic port on Ukraine’s southern coast, and several cities across the country, from Kyiv, the capital, to Mykolaiv, another key city on the Black Sea, continued to face withering bombardments. Ukrainian officials are accusing Russia of striking a hospital in Mykolaiv and a mosque in Mariupol.

Meanwhile, the humanitarian disaster is mounting, with nearly 2.6 million Ukrainians fleeing the country since the start of the invasion, according to the United Nations. After local officials in Poland, to which 1.5 million refugees from Ukraine have fled, warned that they were struggling to cope with the arrivals, Germany said Saturday that other countries must “step up” to help with the massive influx of Ukrainian refugees.

Zelensky said Saturday that any peace negotiations with Russia and Putin can begin only with a cease-fire agreement. Speaking to reporters in Kyiv, Zelensky said that he is open to negotiations with Putin and that he has discussed the possibility of negotiations being held in Jerusalem with Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett as facilitator. But Zelensky emphasized that real negotiations for peace could not begin until the two sides agree to a cease-fire.

“Our diplomats are working, and they have talked over some items of a possible agenda between us and the Russian Federation,” Zelensky told reporters. “I want this to materialize and the process of ending the war, the process of peace, 100 percent should begin with cease-fire.”

About 1,300 Ukrainian troops have been killed by Russian forces since the start of the invasion last month, Zelensky said. The Ukrainian president added that between 500 and 600 Russian troops surrendered Friday. The Washington Post has not verified either of these figures.

Melitopol, a city where Russian is commonly spoken, is about 145 miles northeast of the Crimean Peninsula, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. While the city came under assault at the start of the invasion and was quickly taken over, Fedorov had remained defiant, saying, “We are not cooperating with the Russians in any way.”

As residents took to the streets of Melitopol last weekend to wave the blue and gold colors of Ukraine, Fedorov encouraged the demonstrations, even amid the Russian occupation.

“Together we will overcome anything!” he wrote in a Facebook post that has since been made private.

Now, Ukrainian officials are trying to find where he is being held. Ukrainian diplomat Olexander Scherba wrote Saturday on Twitter that Fedorov was still alive.

“They torture him to force [him] to collaborate,” Scherba said of the Russians.

Even as Russian forces aimed to shut down Saturday’s protest, Zelensky reiterated to reporters that he was “grateful to every Melitopol resident for this resistance” by demonstrating in response to the alleged abduction of Fedorov. He also suggested to Putin that the war is unpopular among Russians.

“Do you hear it, Moscow?” he asked. “If 2,000 people are protesting against the occupation in Melitopol, how many people should be in Moscow against the war?”

Ukrainian authorities have accused Russian forces of abducting the mayor of Melitopol, a city in southeastern Ukraine that has fallen under Russian control.

Anton Heraschenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior ministry, said 10 soldiers entered the premises of Melitopol’s crisis centre on Thursday, put a bag over Mayor Ivan Fedorov’s head and took him to an unknown location.

Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the president’s office in Kyiv, shared footage of what he said was Fedorov’s abduction.

The video showed masked men leading another man out of a building.

Al Jazeera could not independently verify the footage.

There was no immediate comment from Moscow on Fedorov’s fate.

In a video message late on Friday, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the abduction, calling Fedorov a “mayor who bravely defends Ukraine and the members of his community”.

“This is obviously a sign of weakness of the invaders,” he said. “They have moved to a new stage of terror in which they are trying to physically eliminate representatives of legitimate local Ukrainian authorities.”

The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry also denounced the abduction in a statement, saying the incident amounted to a war crime as international law prohibits the taking of civilian hostages during war.

The ministry said Russian forces were “cynically accusing the mayor of terrorism”.

“We call on the international community to respond immediately to the abduction of Ivan Federov and other civilians, and to increase pressure on Russia to end its barbaric war against the Ukrainian people.”

Russian forces entered Melitopol on the second day of their invasion, on February 25, according to the Ukrayinska Pravda news website.

Following the Russian offensive, Fedorov led several rallies against the invasion, according to the news outlet. That included a rally on March 2 that was attended by thousands of people.

On March 5, Ukrayinska Pravda reported Fedorov saying that the situation in the city was getting “difficult” due to food and medicine shortages.

He also said Melitopol authorities had asked Russian forces to open a humanitarian corridor to let the city’s residents leave, but said the request was refused.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/12/ukraine-accuses-russian-forces-of-abducting-melitopol-mayor
