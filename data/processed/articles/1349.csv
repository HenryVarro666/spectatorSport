Location: Russia

Russia remains at Level Four – Do not travel to Russia due to the unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces in Ukraine, the potential for harassment against U.S. citizens by Russian government security officials, the embassy’s limited ability to assist U.S. citizens in Russia, COVID-19 and related entry restrictions, terrorism, limited flights into and out of Russia, and the arbitrary enforcement of local law. U.S. citizens should consider departing Russia immediately via commercial options still available.

Current flight availability from Russia is extremely limited, especially to European destinations. Travelers may also experience difficulty securing airline tickets to depart Russia due to disruptions in the Russian financial system.

Further, an increasing number of airlines are cancelling flights into and out of Russia, and numerous countries have closed their airspace to Russian airlines. In addition, air space around southern Russia is restricted and a number of airports in the area have closed.

The U.S. government’s ability to provide routine or emergency services to U.S. citizens in Russia is severely limited, particularly in areas far from the U.S. Embassy in Moscow due to Russian government limitations on U.S. staffing and the suspension of services at U.S. consulates.

Those seeking to depart Russia should consider taking some of the following steps to facilitate their travel. Explore commercial air routing through non-European destinations. Flights remain available, for example, through Middle East transit points on major airlines including Qatar Airways, Gulf Air, Emirates, and Etihad.

Travelers should also explore flights out of Russia on smaller carriers to a third country and then look to book onward flights to the United States through a separate reservation originating in the third country.

Family/Friends outside of Russia may be able to assist in securing an airline ticket for the traveler in Russia and provide the flight/ticket information electronically.

Private global travel agencies may be able to assist in securing onward travel through commercial airlines. Some global travel agencies include: In the United States: CWTSATO Vacations In Europe: Carlson Wagon Lit Europe Vacations American Express Global Expedia Group Booking Holding BCD Travel Flight Centre Travel Leaders Group Direct Travel



Note: This is just a sample of global travel agencies. Inclusion on this list does not necessarily represent an endorsement by the U.S. Department of State.

Departure by land or ferry from St. Petersburg via Finland remains an option, especially for U.S. citizens in that region of Russia. In order to travel by train to Finland, the traveler must hold either a Russian or Finnish passport. Commercial airline routings, capacity, and availability are changing rapidly in response to events and travelers seeking to depart should regularly check airline websites for the latest information.

Use of Credit Cards: As a result of sanctions imposed on Russian banks in response to the unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian forces in Ukraine, some credit and debit cards may be declined, and/or merchants may be unable to process credit card transactions. Travelers may consider using alternative credit cards, cash, or other forms of payment. It is unclear at this point what the impact will be on the use of various credit cards, or how long credit and debit cards will continue to be accepted. U.S. citizen should take this into account when making their plans.

Additional Actions:

Read the Department’s country information page and travel advisory for Russia.

Familiarize yourself with information on what the U.S. government can and cannot do to assist you in a crisis overseas.

Have a contingency plan in place that does not rely on U.S. government assistance. Review the Traveler’s Checklist.

Monitor local media for breaking events and adjust your contingency plans based on the new information.

Ensure travel documents are valid and easily accessible.

The Russian passport is considered the 48th in the ranking in terms of travel freedom according to the Henley Passport Index, as Russian citizens have visa-free or visa on arrival access to over 120 countries and territories.

Before planning a trip to a foreign country, citizens of Russia should check the visa requirements for Russia passport holders as well as verify that their passport has a minimum validity of 6 months and have one or two blank pages.

Visa requirements for Russian passport holders differ depending on the country of destination the traveler plans to visit, the purpose of the trip, and the duration of the intended stay.

It may be necessary to obtain an embassy visa, an electronic travel visa authorization, or a visa on arrival to travel to a foreign country from South Africa. However, there are dependent and autonomous territories for which a visa may not be required, but a special permit may be necessary.

Most territories which are visa-exempt for citizens of the Russian Federation permit travelers from Russia to visit for a short period of time from 14 days up to 6 months without having to obtain an electronic or embassy visa.

If the purpose of the visit is other than tourism, business or transit, or for longer periods of stay, it is normally necessary to obtain a visa to travel to the destination.

However, other visa-free countries for Russian citizens may require the visitor to get an electronic travel authorization online before arriving in the territory.",https://www.onlinevisa.com/visa-requirements/russian/

U.S. citizens residing or travelling in Russia should depart Russia immediately.

U.S. citizens should note that U.S. credit and debit cards no longer work in Russia, and options to electronically transfer funds from the United States are extremely limited as a result of sanctions imposed on Russian banks. There are reports of cash shortages within Russia.

Limited commercial flight options and overland routes by car and bus are still open and available. If you wish to depart Russia, you should make arrangements on your own as soon as possible. The U.S. Embassy has severe limitations on its ability to assist U.S. citizens, and conditions, including transportation options, may suddenly become even more limited. U.S. citizens who are able to depart Russia for another country and are in need of emergency assistance upon arrival may contact a U.S. embassy or consulate in that country.

Due to Russia’s further invasion of Ukraine, an increasing number of airlines are cancelling flights into and out of Russia, and numerous countries have closed their airspace to Russian airlines. In addition, airspace around southern Russia is restricted, and a number of airports in the area have closed. U.S. citizens located in, or considering travel to, the districts of the Russian Federation immediately bordering Ukraine should be aware that the situation along the border is dangerous and unpredictable. Given the ongoing armed conflict, U.S. citizens are strongly advised against traveling by land from Russia to Ukraine. In addition, there is the potential throughout Russia of harassment of foreigners, including through regulations targeted specifically against foreigners.

The U.S. government’s ability to provide routine or emergency services to U.S. citizens in Russia is severely limited, particularly in areas far from the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, due to Russian government limitations on travel, the number of U.S. staff, and the ongoing suspension of operations, including consular services, at U.S. consulates.

On February 28, the Department of State authorized the voluntary departure of eligible family members and non-emergency personnel from U.S. Embassy Moscow.

Do Not Travel to:

The North Caucasus, including Chechnya and Mount Elbrus, due to terrorism, kidnapping, and risk of civil unrest .

and . Crimea due to Russia’s occupation of the Ukrainian territory and abuses by its occupying authorities.

Country Summary: U.S. citizens, including former and current U.S. government and military personnel and private citizens engaged in business, who are visiting or residing in Russia have been interrogated without cause and threatened by Russian officials, and may become victims of harassment, mistreatment, and extortion. All U.S. government personnel should carefully consider their need to travel to Russia.

Russian security services have arrested U.S. citizens on spurious charges, singled out U.S. citizens in Russia for detention and/or harassment, denied them fair and transparent treatment, and have convicted them in secret trials and/or without presenting credible evidence. Russian officials may unreasonably delay U.S. consular assistance to detained U.S. citizens. Russian authorities arbitrarily enforce local laws against U.S. citizen religious workers and open questionable criminal investigations against U.S. citizens engaged in religious activity. Russian security services are increasing the arbitrary enforcement of local laws to target foreign and international organizations they consider “undesirable,” and U.S. citizens should avoid travel to Russia to perform work for or volunteer with non-governmental organizations. Russian authorities may not notify the U.S. Embassy of the detention of a U.S. citizen, and consular access to detainees may be denied or severely delayed.

Russia enforces special restrictions on dual U.S.-Russian nationals and may refuse to acknowledge dual nationals’ U.S. citizenship, including denying access to U.S. consular assistance and preventing their departure from Russia.

The rights to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression are not guaranteed in Russia, and U.S. citizens should avoid all political or social protests.

Terrorist groups, transnational and local terrorist organizations, and individuals inspired by extremist ideology continue plotting possible attacks in Russia. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, local government facilities, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, parks, major sporting and cultural events, educational institutions, airports, and other public areas.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) prohibiting U.S. aviation operations into, out of, within, or over those areas of the Moscow Flight Information Region (FIR), the Samara FIR (UWWW) and the Rostov-na-Donu (URRV) FIR within 160NM of the boundaries of the Dnipro (UKDV) Flight Information Regions. For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices.

Read the Department of State’s COVID-19 page before you plan any international travel.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a Level 4 Travel Health Notice for Russia due to COVID-19, indicating a very high level of COVID-19 in the country.

There are restrictions in place affecting U.S. citizen entry into Russia. Your risk of contracting COVID-19 and developing severe symptoms may be lower if you are fully vaccinated with an FDA authorized vaccine. Before planning any international travel, please review the CDC’s specific recommendations for fully vaccinated and unvaccinated travelers.

If you decide to travel to Russia:

North Caucasus (including Chechnya and Mount Elbrus) – Do Not Travel

Terrorist attacks and risk of civil unrest continue throughout the North Caucasus region, including in Chechnya, North Ossetia, Ingushetia, Dagestan, Stavropol, Karachayevo-Cherkessiya, and Kabardino-Balkariya. Local gangs have kidnapped U.S. citizens and other foreigners for ransom. There have been credible reports of arrest, torture, and extrajudicial killing of LGBTI persons in Chechnya allegedly conducted by Chechen regional authorities.

Do not attempt to climb Mount Elbrus, as travelers must pass close to volatile and insecure areas of the North Caucasus region. The U.S. government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens traveling in the North Caucasus region, including Mount Elbrus, as U.S. government employees are prohibited from traveling to the region.

Crimea – Do Not Travel

The international community, including the United States and Ukraine, does not recognize Russia’s purported annexation of Crimea. There is extensive Russian Federation military presence in Crimea. Russia staged its further invasion of Ukraine, in part, from occupied Crimea, and Russia is likely to take further military actions in Crimea as part of its occupation of this part of Ukraine. There are continuing abuses against foreigners and the local population by the occupation authorities in Crimea, particularly against those who are seen as challenging their authority on the peninsula.

For Zakharenko, an expert on Russian travel, these travel updates are now changing by the minute since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.

“It’s very dynamic,” he told SFGATE. “I had a client who was visiting family in Russia and her flight out of Moscow got canceled. I had to put her on another carrier [direct to New York] and when that plane was backing up on the tarmac, they announced that they closed the airspace over Sweden. Her plane took off and she successfully got home but it came down to the wire.”

In his State of the Union address last Tuesday, President Joe Biden announced that he was ordering a ban on Russian planes entering U.S. airspace, joining a consortium of countries in their effort to penalize Russia for the invasion.

As of Friday, 33 nations, including all 27 E.U. countries as well as Albania, Canada, Norway, Switzerland, the U.K. and now the U.S., have imposed the ban. The U.S. State Department issued a travel advisory Saturday telling citizens not to travel to Russia and advising those in Russia to leave “immediately.”

However, Americans are not barred from entering Russia. Natasha Vinogradov, with the passport and visa commercial expediting firm Russian Agency, said that as of now, there are no restrictions for travel to Russia for American citizens. A travel ban, triggered by COVID-19, was lifted in July 2021 and the country has remained accessible.

“Honestly, I don’t see any changes as of now,” she told SFGATE. “People are continuing to apply for Russian visas. Most of them are relatives of Russian citizens.”

Two major airlines offer direct flights from U.S. cities to Moscow. Aeroflot, a Russian national airline and the largest in the country, flies out regularly from Los Angeles, Washington, New York and Miami.

On March 5, Aeroflot announced that it was temporarily suspending all international flights beginning on Tuesday, March 8. In their statement, the company said that this was ""due to new additional circumstances impeding the operation of flights."" There is one exception to the ban and the airline is expected to continue offering flights to Minsk, the capital of Belarus.

Doug Yakel, spokesperson for SFO, said the airport doesn’t have any flights to and from Russia but added that the “United SFO-Delhi flight overflies Russia, so they’ve canceled that flight for the coming days due to the airspace restrictions.”

The warning was ""due to the unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine by Russian military forces"" as well as the potential for harassment of U.S. citizens by Russian authorities, the travel advisory said, repeating calls for Americans traveling or living in Russia to leave ""immediately.""

It comes days after a U.S. diplomat was able to visit detained basketball star Brittney Griner, who has been held in Russian custody for more than a month.

Griner, a two-time Olympic gold medalist and WNBA champion, was detained at a Moscow airport on February 17 on charges of carrying vape cartridges that contained cannabis oil in her luggage.

After being apprehended, Griner was immediately placed in a detention center, and last week a Russian court extended her arrest until May 19. She faces up to 10 years in prison.

The arrest came as relations between Moscow and the West hit rock bottom over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The Biden administration has led the Western response to the invasion, leveling unprecedented sanctions against Moscow and funneling weapons and aid to Kyiv.

The State Department warning pointed out that, ""U.S. citizens should note that U.S. credit and debit cards no longer work in Russia, and options to electronically transfer funds from the United States are extremely limited as a result of sanctions imposed on Russian banks.

WASHINGTON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - The United States shuttered its embassy in Minsk and allowed non-emergency employees and family members to leave its embassy in Moscow on Monday as Russia pushed on with its invasion of Ukraine for a fifth day.

U.S. citizens in Belarus should also depart immediately, the State Department said in a separate travel advisory. Belarus is a strong Russian ally and has been a launch pad for the invading Russian troops.

The United States had already relocated its Ukraine embassy operations from the capital Kyiv to the western city of Lviv two weeks ago as Russian forces amassed at Ukraine's borders.

The latest evacuations come after Russian President Vladimir Putin put Russia's nuclear deterrent on high alert on Sunday in the face of a barrage of Western reprisals for his war on Ukraine, which said it had repelled Russian ground forces attacking its biggest cities.

In a press briefing on Monday, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said these were not retaliatory measures. ""We deem these measures necessary because of the safety and security issues resulting from Russia's unprovoked attack on Ukraine,"" he said.

On Sunday, the U.S. State Department said American citizens should consider leaving Russia immediately on commercial flights, citing an increasing number of airlines canceling flights and countries closing their airspace to Russia.

Russia, which calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation,"" on Monday barred airlines from 36 countries from using Russian airspace. read more

U.S. officials on Monday warned Belarus will also face consequences for its role in aiding Russia with the attack. The EU also warned it would impose new sanctions on Belarus this week.

Officials in Washington in recent weeks have urged Americans not to travel to Russia, and warned that the U.S. government could not help in any evacuation of Americans from there.

It is located close to the Crimea peninsula, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, and from which it launched one of several invasion forces.

Elsewhere in the country, Russian are said to be troops closing in around Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, a city of almost 3 million. The mayor expressed doubt that civilians could be evacuated.

Ukrainian defenders have been putting up stiff resistance that appeared to slow Russia's advance.

Kyiv was eerily quiet on Sunday morning after explosions lit up the morning sky and authorities reported blasts at one airport. A main boulevard was practically deserted as a strict curfew kept people off the streets. Authorities warned that anyone venturing out without a pass would be considered a Russian saboteur.

Terrified residents hunkered down in homes, underground garages and subway stations in anticipation of a full-scale Russian assault. Food and medicine were running low, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said.

Authorities have been handing out weapons to anyone willing to defend the city. Ukraine is also releasing prisoners with military experience who want to fight, and training people to make firebombs.

'Right now, the most important question is to defend our country,' Klitschko said.

In the southern port city of Mariupol, where Ukrainians were trying to fend off attack, a medical team at a city hospital desperately tried to revive a 6-year-old girl in unicorn pajamas who was mortally wounded in Russian shelling.

Nearly 560 miles away, Faina Bystritska was under threat in the city of Chernihiv.

'I wish I had never lived to see this,' said Bystritska, an 87-year-old Jewish survivor of World War II. She said sirens blare almost constantly in the city, about 90 miles from Kyiv.

Chernihiv residents have been told not to switch on any lights 'so we don´t draw their attention,' said Bystritska, who has been living in a hallway, away from any windows, so she could better protect herself.

As Russian troops draw closer to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv´s mayor is both filled with pride over his citizens´ spirit and anxious about how long they can hold out.

In an interview with The Associated Press on Sunday, after a grueling night of Russian attacks on the outskirts of the city, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said there were no plans to evacuate civilians if Russian troops managed to take Kyiv.

'We can´t do that, because all ways are blocked,' he said. 'Right now we are encircled.'

When Russian troops invaded Ukraine on Thursday, the city of 2.8 million people initially reacted with concern but also a measure of self-possession. However, nerves started fraying when grocery stores began closing and the city´s famously deep subway system turned its stations into bomb shelters.

The mayor confirmed to the AP that nine civilians in Kyiv had been killed so far, including one child.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10556599/Live-updates-Musks-Starlink-internet-active-Ukraine.html
