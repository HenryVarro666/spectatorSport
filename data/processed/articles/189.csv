As Russia trends closer toward pariah status in many countries worldwide, it appears that it can still count on the support of a small group of countries in the West — Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela — and perhaps the burgeoning backing of another central American country.

The latest proof of such support came at Wednesday’s emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly.

Cuba, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Bolivia joined several dozen other countries in abstaining during a vote to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and to demand Moscow withdraw its troops “immediately, completely and unconditionally.”

While Venezuela could not formally vote at the session because it has not paid its dues to the UN for several years, it almost assuredly would have voted against the resolution or abstained if given the chance.

Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro spoke by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this week and has said multiple times that Putin has his “total support.” After the phone call, Maduro tweeted an old photo of himself and Putin shaking hands, and has blamed the conflict on “destabilizing actions of NATO.”

While the countries did not vote against the resolution, the abstention votes were notable. It meant each country chose not to declare illegal — and immoral — an invasion that the vast majority of the rest of the world agrees is a flagrant violation of international norms and laws.

Cuba and Nicaragua are long-time allies of Russias, with the bond between Cuba and Russia going back decades. Cuba’s government has blamed the current conflict on the United States and NATO’s “increasingly offensive military doctrine that threatens peace.”

Meanwhile, Nicaragua was one of the first countries in the world to formally recognize the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine — two pro-Russian areas that Russia formally recognized shortly before it invaded Ukraine.

El Salvador’s abstention was telling, as well, mirroring the silence from the country’s leadership about the conflict since it began.

The country’s president, Nayib Bukele, was extremely vocal in the days leading up to Russia’s invasion, mocking US assertions that an invasion was imminent.

“The boy who cried wolf,” Bukele tweeted on Feb. 18, responding to US President Joe Biden, who said he believed Russia would invade in the next several days.

Since Russia has invaded, however, Bukele has remained silent on the matter.

Meanwhile, Latin America’s heavyweights, including Mexico and Brazil, have drawn fire from critics who have accused the two countries of giving Russia a free pass.

Although both countries’ UN delegations voted in favor to condemn Russian invasion and for a military withdrawal, Mexican President López Obrador and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro have stopped short of criticizing Putin or imposing any sanctions.

“We’re not going to take any kind of economic reprisal because we want to have good relations with all the governments in the world,” said López Obrador. “We do not consider that [the war] concerns us, and we think that the best thing is to promote dialogue to achieve peace.”

Bolsonaro, who visited Moscow a few weeks ago, has said that his country was, “not going to take sides.”

“We are going to continue to be neutral and help however possible to find a solution,” said the president currently up for reelection later this year.",https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-02-22/h_1418c6e0078e2fa51d27412f27294b2a

KHARKIV, Ukraine, March 2 (Reuters) - On a residential street in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, debris was strewn all around, blood stained the ground and the bodies of people carried from destroyed homes lay covered in blankets.

Some survivors of the barrage by Russian forces sat silently where they could, staring at the carnage. Others helped rescue workers to search the rubble for anyone alive or dead, according to a Reuters witness.

The scenes in Ukraine's second-largest city this week were a reminder of the ferocity of the war in some parts of Ukraine.

While the outskirts of the capital Kyiv to the west have come under shell and missile attack, the fate of Kharkiv, which is geographically and culturally close to Russia, has so far been worse.

According to officials on Wednesday, in the last 24 hours at least 21 people have been killed and 112 wounded in the strategic eastern Ukrainian city, which lies just a few kilometres (miles) from the Russian border on major routes leading north to south and east to west.

Later in the day they said four more had died and nine were wounded as air and rocket strikes continued. Although under siege, Kharkiv has not yet fallen to Russian forces.

At the badly damaged apartment blocks, disbelief mixed with anger.

""They bombed the residential building, hit it with rockets. Many civilians died. I have videos of at least four dead people laying on the ground,"" said Vitaly Rybas, a local resident.

""A dead person is laying next to us. (Russian Foreign Minister Sergei) Lavrov and (Russian President Vladimir) Putin are ... bandits. They should be brought to justice.""

Pools of blood stained roads and pavements as workmen sifted through the wreckage. Firemen and volunteers carried out two bodies wrapped in blankets from the charred stairwells of an apartment block. People peered into craters left by bombs.

""The Russians are shelling us,"" said Svetlana, who did not give her surname. ""We are all scared. Why us? We are ordinary folk.""

'ATROCITY' AGAINST CIVILIANS

Fierce fighting outside Kharkiv has helped hold up the Russian advance, according to Ukrainian officials, who shared footage on the day the invasion began that they said showed destroyed or disabled Russian military vehicles and the body of a Russian soldier.

Reuters could not verify the images independently.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Tuesday that the attacks on Kharkiv amounted to state terrorism, and described the capital Kyiv and Kharkiv as Russia's main targets.

Many Western governments have reacted with dismay to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and they hope that tough economic sanctions against Moscow will deter it from pressing ahead with what it calls a ""special operation"" to remove foes in Kyiv.

Events this week in Kharkiv, home to around 1.5 million people, have been singled out for special criticism. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Tuesday the scenes were reminiscent of Serbian shelling of Sarajevo in the 1990s.

""It has that feel to me of an atrocity committed deliberately against a civilian centre,"" he told a news conference in Estonia.

On Wednesday, long queues formed outside supermarkets and pharmacies as residents of Kharkiv emerged from homes and underground shelters to stock up on supplies.

""Everybody here is outraged,"" said Maria Zakharova. ""Our houses were bombed ... Us and our children ... We cannot even buy bread, can you see that?""

The day before, Russian forces struck at the heart of the historic city - the early capital of Ukraine after it was subsumed into the Soviet Union following World War One - hitting the regional administration building in central Freedom Square.

The blast gutted the imposing, Soviet-era structure and killed several people. In nearby streets, cars had crumpled under the weight of falling masonry. Outside a damaged shop, a Ukrainian and Russian flag fluttered side by side.

Its pilots and air defenses have prevented Russian fighter jets from conquering the skies. And a band of savvy Ukrainian cyberwarriors are so far beating Moscow in an information war, inspiring support at home and abroad.

To the surprise of many military analysts, Ukrainian troops are mounting a stiffer-than-expected resistance to Russian forces up and down battle lines across a country the size of Texas, fighting with a resourcefulness and creativity that U.S. analysts said could trip up Russian troops for weeks or months to come.

The Ukrainians are also exploiting a bungled beginning to Russia’s all-out assault. Armed with shoulder-fired anti-tank weapons, they have attacked a mileslong Russian armored convoy bearing down on Kyiv, the capital, helping stall an advance plagued by fuel and food shortages, and stretching a march that was expected to take a handful of days into possibly weeks.

To be sure, Russia’s invasion is only a week old. The strategic southern city of Kherson fell on Wednesday; the Kremlin’s army has intensified its bombardment of Kyiv and other cities; and, despite a flow of fresh arms pouring in from the West, Ukrainian leaders say they desperately need more weapons to destroy Russian tanks and down Russian warplanes.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/03/us/politics/russia-ukraine-military.html

Numerous explosions and attacks have been reported from across the country with escalating military actions. Videos have been surfacing from various places showing live attacks and huge sounds of explosions. On the eighth day of the Russian invasion, Ukrainians have claimed that Russian troops are failing in almost all areas in which they are advancing and have resorted to tactics of night shelling on residential areas of large cities.

As per the latest video accessed by Republic Media Network, a school can be seen destroyed by the Russian troops in Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv. Strategic bombarding is being done by the Russian military, especially in the largest cities by targeting administrative buildings, schools, TV towers, despite Moscow claiming that ""no attack is being done on civilians."" Even on the eighth day of the invasion, Ukraine continues to show resistance.

Additionally, several videos from the location show multiple explosions from different angles in Kharkiv as Russian troops advance towards other major cities. Many eyewitnesses have also taken to social media handles to share videos of the explosions and blasts from the country's second-largest city.

Russia ready for talks with Ukraine, Kyiv delaying it: Russian foreign minister

Furthermore, Russian Foreign Affairs Minister Sergey Lavrov, on Thursday, March 3, claimed that Russia is ready for talks with Ukraine, but Kyiv is delaying it. The Russian diplomat added that Russia is ready to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine and the whole of Europe as well during these talks.

""Again, the Ukrainian team found some pretext to postpone these negotiations. Surely they are receiving instructions from Washington, there is no doubt about it. This country is absolutely not independent,"" Sputnik quoted Lavrov saying.

On the eighth day with Russian forces ramping up attacks in Ukraine, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksyy has claimed that over 9,000 Russian troops were killed so far. However, the Russian Defence Ministry said that 498 of its servicemen have been killed and 1,597 injured so far amid the ongoing war.",https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ukraine-russia-war-russian-shelling-destroys-school-in-ukraines-kharkiv-articleshow.html

The Ukrainian military says immediate clashes have erupted after Russian paratroopers landed in Ukraine’s second largest city of Kharkiv on the seventh day of Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbour.

“Russian airborne troops landed in Kharkiv … and attacked a local hospital,” the army said on Wednesday, in a statement on the Telegram messaging app.

“There is an ongoing fight between the invaders and the Ukrainians.”

According to Anton Gerashchenko, adviser to the Ukrainian interior minister, a fire broke out on Wednesday in the barracks of a flight school in the city following an air raid.

“Practically there are no areas left in Kharkiv where an artillery shell has not yet hit,” he said in a statement posted on Telegram.

The city’s governor, Oleg Synegubov, also said on Telegram that seven people were killed in an attack on a government building and that 24 people were wounded.

The reports could be independently confirmed. Russia says it is only targeting Ukraine’s military infrastructure, air defence and air forces with high-precision weapons.

Kharkiv, a largely Russian-speaking city near the Russian border, has a population of about 1.4 million.

It has been a target for Russian forces since President Vladimir Putin launched an invasion of Ukraine on February 24.

On Monday, Ukraine’s defence ministry said dozens of residents including children were killed when a Russian strategic bomber fired 16 guided missiles towards a residential area in the city.

The following day, at least 10 people including a 21-year-old Indian medical student were killed by Russian shells.

The United Nations says at least 136 civilians – including 13 children – have been killed in the invasion, but that the real number of people is likely much higher.

“Nobody will forgive. Nobody will forget,” Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Tuesday after the attacks in Kharkiv and the deadly bombing of a TV tower in the capital, Kyiv.

In Kherson on the Black Sea, where officials had on Tuesday reported Russian checkpoints encircling the city, Russian forces took control of the railway station and the port overnight, Mayor Igor Kolykhaiev was quoted as saying by local media.

In Mariupol, a port on the Sea of Azov, more than 100 people were injured on Tuesday in Russian fire, the mayor of the city, Vadym Boychenko was quoted as saying by Ukrainian media.

In Borodyanka, 50km (31 miles) from Kyiv, Russian air attacks destroyed two residential buildings on Tuesday, according to Emine Dzhaparova, Ukraine’s deputy minister of foreign affairs, who shared a video of the grey buildings partially in ruins, with apartments in flames.

During the day on Tuesday, Ukrainian intelligence noted “significant activity” of aircraft in the border area, and convoys of vehicles carrying food and ammunition were observed there, the statement said.

In view of these movements, Belarus “could probably support the Russian invaders in the Russian-Ukrainian war in the future”, warned the ministry.

“Missile attacks against military and civilian targets” in Ukraine have been “systematically” launched from Belarusian territory since the start of the Russian invasion on February 24, the ministry added.

""According to official reports, the Russians even throw cadets of military schools into battle. In particular, such information comes from the Serpukhov military school, where second year cadets were thrown into the war in Ukraine. This means that the entire powerful Russian army can no longer cope with Ukraine, the Ukrainian people and the Armed Forces. This means a disaster in terms of military command, because the cadets of the schools are not touched until the very last moment,"" Arestoych said at a briefing at the President's Office on Wednesday afternoon.

He added that Russia's attempts to attract the Belarusian army can also be attributed here.

""But so far there is no official data that the Belarusian army is taking part in hostilities against Ukraine.

Kharkiv region head Oleg Synegubov said on Tuesday Russian missile attacks had hit the centre of the city, including residential areas and administration buildings.

Kharkiv, a largely Russian-speaking city near the Russian border, has a population of around 1.4 million. It has been a target for Russian forces since President Vladimir Putin launched an invasion of Ukraine last Thursday.

Over 350 civilian casualties have been reported so far, including at least 14 children. More than 1,600 people have also been injured, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.

Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have fled the fighting as a massive Russian military convoy north of Kyiv advances on the city. West of Kyiv, in the city of Zhytomyr, four people, including a child, were killed on Tuesday by a Russian cruise missile, a Ukrainian official said on Wednesday as per news agency Reuters.

Already shunned by the West over its week-long invasion of Ukraine, Russia has shown no sign of stopping an assault that has included strikes on Kyiv and rocket attacks in the second city of Kharkiv.
