1,89628f7c-06ee-4dbb-a43a-303fca8a04e5,[],,"The content optimism of the previous day has been partially justified at the negotiating table in Istanbul. Hosted by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the talks between the Russian and Ukrainian delegations produced a timid rapprochement, defined by the two initial positions adopted by the parties: Moscow's reduction of military activities in Ukraine and Kiev's definitive renunciation of NATO membership. A starting point conditioned by Vladimir Putin's incessant aggression.

The three-hour meeting served as a thermometer to measure the temperature of the negotiating teams, prone to dialogue after five weeks of invasion. The full-scale Russian offensive has failed miserably, with only one oblast capital, Kherson, under control and even losing positions in recent days. Ukrainian forces have repelled the advance with force, still encapsulated in several enclaves in the country. But the aggression has provoked an unprecedented humanitarian crisis, leaving behind almost four million displaced people, in addition to thousands of unquantified fatalities.

Erdoğan called at the outset for ""concrete results"" in what was the first high-level meeting in three weeks, and the most successful to date. In all this time, the negotiating teams had not seen each other face-to-face, but had seen each other on screen. Videoconference talks have been commonplace, but have been shrouded in the utmost secrecy by the parties. And they promise to continue in the coming days.

Scheduled to end on Wednesday, the negotiations finally ended on Tuesday with a considerable distance between the two delegations. Peace in Ukraine does not seem close, but this was the first contact that at least raised expectations. Present at the talks, the Russian Minister of Culture, Vladimir Medinsky, who is of Ukrainian origin, assessed the meeting as a ""constructive"" step in the search for a compromise. President Zelensky's chief advisor, Mykhailo Podolyak, also described the meeting as ""constructive"".

Two significant developments have emerged from Tuesday's meeting that give cause for optimism. Russia assures that it will ""drastically reduce"" its military activity in the northern city of Chernobyl, close to the border with Belarus, and in the capital, Kiev, which is heavily besieged but still under the control of Ukrainian forces. This was announced by Russian Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin, the 'number two' of the recently reappeared Sergey Shoigu, who was also present at the negotiations.

Ukraine, for its part, definitively renounces NATO membership, as well as the right to host military bases and armaments belonging to the Atlantic Alliance, thus acquiring a neutral status. These conditions were accepted in exchange for a series of defensive guarantees. The Kiev government would henceforth be able to count on military assistance from a small group of countries in the event of a new Russian attack, including Turkey, Israel, Poland and Canada. There would be no veto in such a scenario for hypothetical EU membership.

The central issue in the negotiations now becomes the territorial status of the Crimean peninsula, annexed by Russia in 2014, and the Donbass, which is partially occupied by separatist militias backed by Russian troops. The recent U-turn by the Russian defence ministry, which said it had completed 'the first phase' of the offensive and would focus its military action on the Lugansk and Donetsk oblasts, puts the spotlight on the situation in both regions, which will be the subject of new demands from the Kremlin.

But there is no room for hope as long as hostilities on the ground have not ceased. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has questioned Moscow's concessions. With this move, Russia may be buying time to regroup its forces and supply troops deployed in the eastern part of the country, who are hampered by logistical problems. Although early reports have echoed a timid withdrawal of forces to the periphery of some cities by the Russian army, the attacks continue.

Plumes of smoke and debris remain the norm in artillery-ravaged Ukraine. The devastating siege of Mariupol is about to take effect, allowing Russian forces to cut off the exit to the Sea of Azov, establishing a corridor between the Crimean peninsula and the Donbass, encapsulating Ukrainian troops. A scenario that would strengthen its position at the negotiating table.

It is important not to lose focus. According to Amnesty International, the Russian army is alleged to have committed war crimes in Ukraine by applying scorched-earth military tactics. A common Kremlin strategy, previously used in Chechnya and Syria. Agnes Callamard, the organisation's secretary general, said that Amnesty International has documented ""an escalation of violations of human rights and humanitarian law, including indiscriminate or deliberate attacks against civilians"".

Putin and Zelenski, face to face?

The negotiating teams see a summit between Vladimir Putin and Volodymir Zelensky as possible. ""The results of today's meeting are sufficient for a meeting at the leaders' level,"" declared a member of the Ukrainian delegation at the end of the negotiations in Istanbul. David Arakhamia was not the only one to make such a statement; the Kremlin's negotiating staff also expressed this view a day after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that a meeting would be ""counterproductive"" without advanced agreements on the table.

But Washington remains Moscow's preferred interlocutor. ""Sooner or later we will have to talk to the United States,"" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Relations between the White House and the Kremlin are not broken, despite the coarse words of President Joe Biden, who called Putin a ""butcher"" and said he could not be in power for another minute. These statements were later qualified by members of his administration.

French President Emmanuel Macron advocated a different approach to Vladimir Putin in order not to encourage escalation. The French leader, who is up for re-election in two weeks in a decisive context for Europe in which he wants to assume political leadership of the continent, will hold a new telephone conversation with the Russian president on Tuesday afternoon to discuss the humanitarian situation.

ISTANBUL — The first signs of significant progress in peace talks between Russia and Ukraine emerged on Tuesday, but there was no hint of an imminent end to the suffering, with Russia appearing determined to capture more territory in eastern Ukraine and officials predicting that weeks of further negotiation were needed.

After three hours of talks in Istanbul, Ukrainian officials said their country was ready to declare itself permanently neutral — forsaking the prospect of joining NATO, a key Russian demand — and discuss Russian territorial claims in exchange for “security guarantees” from a group of other nations. An aide to Ukraine’s president called the Russian delegation “constructive,” while Russia said it would “drastically” scale back its military activity around Kyiv to “increase mutual trust.”

Russia’s statement that it will de-escalate the fighting around Kyiv — even as it keeps pounding other parts of Ukraine — may be little more than putting a positive gloss on its military being stymied in its attempts to seize or encircle the capital. In recent days, Ukrainian counteroffensives around the city have forced back Russian forces in some of the fiercest street battles of the war, though they remain within striking distance of Kyiv.

Now, Russian officials said, the goal will be to take more territory in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, where Russia has installed two separatist statelets that President Vladimir V. Putin recognized last month as independent, but that no other nation has formally acknowledged.

Western officials and security analysts cautioned against taking at face value Russia’s statements about its aims in Kyiv or elsewhere.

President Biden said he would not draw any conclusions about Russia’s intentions “until I see what their actions are.” Speaking after a White House meeting with the prime minister of Singapore, Mr. Biden added, “We’ll see if they follow through with what they are suggesting.”

“In the meantime,” Mr. Biden said, “we’re going to continue to keep strong the sanctions and will continue to provide the Ukrainian military with the capacity to defend themselves.”

Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, on a diplomatic trip to Morocco, told reporters, “There is what Russia says and there’s what Russia does,” adding, “and what Russia is doing is the continued brutalization of Ukraine and its people.”

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has worked hard to present Mr. Putin with a negotiated way to end the war, accompanied by Ukrainian concessions that would not go so far as to make his country a Russian satellite.

The offer to declare a permanent neutral status, Ukrainian officials in Istanbul said, means it would neither join the NATO alliance nor host foreign troops — a scenario that Mr. Putin used as one of the justifications for his invasion.

Ukrainian officials envision an arrangement in which a diverse group of countries — potentially including the United States, Germany, Turkey and China — would commit, if Ukraine were attacked, to providing it with military assistance and to imposing a no-fly zone if necessary. It was not clear that any of those countries had signed on to such guarantees.

“This is probably the best outcome that could’ve been hoped for today,” said Samuel Charap, who studies Russian foreign policy at the RAND Corporation. “The Ukrainians have at least come up with something concrete to address the core Russian demand for Ukraine’s neutrality.”

Ukraine also signaled readiness to consider concessions related to the parts of its territory already occupied by Russia. It proposed a 15-year negotiating process for Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula seized by Russia in 2014, and said it was ready to rule out trying to retake it by force. Questions surrounding the eastern Donbas region, Ukrainian officials said, could be discussed at a possible meeting between Mr. Putin and Mr. Zelensky.

Russia, for its part, said it was prepared to accelerate planning for such a summit meeting — something that Mr. Zelensky had long sought and that Moscow had resisted, casting Ukraine’s government as a mere puppet of Washington. But now, the Kremlin appears to be increasingly prepared to deal with Mr. Zelensky — in part because Ukraine’s resistance on the battlefield is leaving it no other choice.

Vladimir Medinsky, the head of Russia’s delegation, said that he viewed Ukraine’s proposals as “a constructive step in the search for a compromise.”

“If the treaty is worked out quickly and the required compromise is found, the possibility of making peace will be much closer,” Mr. Medinsky said.

Ukraine and Russia would need at least two more weeks for talks with Russia and potential guarantor countries, Oleksandr Chalyi, a member of the Ukrainian delegation, told reporters after Tuesday’s session. Turkey said it was prepared to host a meeting of the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers to flesh out Tuesday’s talks, followed by a possible meeting between the two presidents.

“You have shouldered a historic responsibility,” President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, who hosted Tuesday’s talks at a 19th-century Ottoman palace on the banks of the Bosporus, told the Russian and Ukrainian delegates. “All the world is expecting good news from you.”

Turkey has emerged as a pivotal intermediary in the talks, one of the few countries to maintain close ties to both Russia and Ukraine after the invasion. Though it is a NATO member, Turkey has refused to put in place sanctions against Russia, even as it offers military support to Ukraine. To underscore the latter, a member of the Ukrainian delegation, Mykhailo Podolyak, posted on Twitter on Tuesday a selfie with Haluk Bayraktar, a close associate of Mr. Erdogan and the head of a Turkish company that makes armed drones used by Ukraine.

But despite the positive signals, myriad diplomatic pitfalls remained. For example, Ukraine said that the international security guarantees would not apply to the disputed Donbas, but it is not clear how that area would be defined; the separatists claim far more territory than they controlled before the war.

“The Russian delegation is constructive,” Mr. Podolyak, who is an aide to Mr. Zelensky, said. “This doesn’t mean that the negotiations are easy. They are difficult.”

There was also no reprieve on the ground in Ukraine. On Tuesday morning, a Russian cruise missile strike destroyed part of the main regional government office building in the southern city of Mikolaiv, killing at least nine people and injuring at least 28, Ukrainian officials said.

It was one of many attacks since the Feb. 24 invasion that appeared aimed at disabling government operations; the regional administrator, Vitaly Kim, said his own office was destroyed, but he was not in the building at the time. The Russian advance along the Black Sea coast west of Crimea stalled outside Mikolaiv, in an area that has seen intense combat.

Another Russian missile struck an oil depot on Monday night in the Rivne region in northwestern Ukraine, the second to be destroyed there, according to the regional administrator.

“The scale of the challenges has not diminished,” Mr. Zelensky said in a statement. “The Russian army still has significant potential to continue attacks against our state. They still have a lot of equipment and enough people completely deprived of rights whom they can send to the cauldron of war. Therefore, we stay alert and do not reduce our defense efforts.”

The U.S. and British governments confirmed Ukrainian gains in towns around Kyiv — notably Irpin, scene of some of the fiercest street fighting — but advised skepticism about claims that Russia’s stance had changed.

“Has there been some movement by some Russian units away from Kyiv in the last day or so? Yeah, we think so, small numbers,” said John F. Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman. But, he added, “We believe that this is a repositioning, not a real withdrawal, and that we should be prepared to watch for a major offensive against other areas in Ukraine.”

The British Defense Ministry warned that “Russia still poses a significant threat to the city through their strike capability.”

Russia has signaled that it was narrowing its war aims to focus on taking more territory in the Donbas. Sergei K. Shoigu, the Russian defense minister, on Tuesday offered a possible justification for winding down the war effort elsewhere in the country by declaring, in televised remarks in Moscow, that Russia’s initial mission was accomplished.

“In general, the main goals of the first stage of the special operation have been completed,” Mr. Shoigu said. “The combat potential of the Ukrainian Armed Forces has been significantly reduced, which makes it possible to focus the main attention and main efforts on achieving the main goal — the liberation of Donbas.”

Russian forces have taken control of a land bridge along Ukraine’s southeastern coast linking Crimea to the Donbas. The lone holdout in that strip is the center of the devastated port city of Mariupol, where, the Institute for the Study of War reported on Tuesday, the Russians are still gaining ground, slowly tightening the noose around the fighters and civilians who remain.

Thousand of civilians have been killed in Mariupol, according to local officials — a claim that cannot be independently verified — and much of the city has been flattened. It remains under “continuous heavy shelling” by Russian forces, the British Defense Ministry said on Tuesday.

In the nearby port of Berdyansk, captured by the Russians, an evacuation convoy took 34 buses full of civilians out of the city, headed into territory held by Ukraine. In anther occupied city in the region, Melitopol, the mayor said the schools chief had been detained after she and local teachers refused orders by the occupying forces to change what was taught and to teach in Russian, not Ukrainian.

The war has cost Ukraine $564.9 billion in damage and lost economic activity — roughly three times its prewar gross domestic product — Yulia Svyrydenko, the economy minister, said in a Facebook post on Monday.

There are as yet no reliable estimates of civilian casualties, and some four million people have fled the country, along with about six million who are internally displaced, according to the United Nations.

The latest round of Russia-Ukraine talks, held in Istanbul on Tuesday, have seen a ""progress,"" as the Russian delegation said Russia has decided to reduce military activities near Kiev and that they have received Ukraine's proposal to become ""neutral,"" though observers said the most difficult part of the talks is the sovereignty issue and the two sides are still far off from a ceasefire.After the three-hour meeting in Turkey, Russia said it has decided to drastically cut back its military activity near Kiev in order for peace talks to progress. According to TASS, top Russian negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said the talks were ""constructive.""Ukrainian negotiators told reporters that Kiev would agree to a neutral status if a security guarantee system is put in place, and they said Israel, Poland, Canada and Turkey could be among Ukraine's security guarantors, according to Deutsche Welle. It is unclear whether the negotiations will continue the next day.The Associated Press quoted Ukraine's military as saying it had noted Russian troops' withdrawals around Kiev and Chernihiv.Turkey said Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers were expected to meet in the next phase to set a mutual understanding and set the stage for a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.Medinsky said after the talks that Russia suggested a meeting between Putin and Zelensky could be arranged concurrently with the initialing of a bilateral treaty by the two countries' foreign ministers, according to TASS.Yang Jin, an associate research fellow at the Institute of Russian, Eastern European, and Central Asian Studies under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that the words of Ukrainian and Russian negotiators, as well as the latest remarks from officials and diplomats on both sides, demonstrated both parties have a strong will and urgency to resort to a political solution.Russia has now concentrated its troops in the Donbass region and Yang predicted that in the next phase, Russia will seek to solve the conflict mainly through political channels with a military method as a supplement.Ukraine, after suffering enormous losses, also understood pledges NATO and the US made were unreliable and their assistance was far from enough to enable Ukraine to confront Russia, Yang said.In a Sunday interview, President Zelensky said Ukraine was carefully considering ""neutrality"" as long as third parties can provide security guarantees for Ukraine, stressing ""sovereignty and territories are priorities"" in the talks.The latest progress of the Russia-Ukraine talks has surprised some observers to some extent, but Chinese analysts also said a final ceasefire is too ambitious a goal to achieve, and they remain cautious since the matter about sovereignty is the most difficult part.Cui Heng, an assistant research fellow from the Center for Russian Studies of East China Normal University, told the Global Times on Tuesday that ""Since Zelensky's remark of neutrality and non-nuclear status for Ukraine is based on sovereignty and territorial integrity, that would mean Russia's withdrawal from the Donbass region, including Lugansk and Donetsk, which Russia had recognized as independent states.""A compromise about the sovereignty matter on either side is unlikely in the near future, Cui said, citing the US and the EU's new round of sanctions on Russia.During US President Joe Biden's Europe visit, the two sides agreed on a deal on liquefied natural gas (LNG) amid a new round of sanctions mainly on Russian energy, despite the hefty bills for the EU.Financial Times, citing four individuals briefed on the discussions, said the draft ceasefire document did not include three of Russia's initial core demands - ""denazification,"" ""demilitarization,"" and legal protection for the Russian language in Ukraine.A significant progress can only be made when there is an arrangement for the status of Lugansk and Donetsk that both sides can accept, Cui said.Yang said there is a lot of work to be done on how the neutrality of Ukraine will be realized, which country will be the third-party guarantor, and what kind of mechanism will be established to ensure Ukrainian security.",https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202203/1257144.shtml
4,89628f7c-06ee-4dbb-a43a-303fca8a04e5,['Analysis Tim Lister'],2022-03-29 00:00:00,"(CNN) When the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers met in Turkey just 19 days ago, the atmosphere was toxic -- and neither side got far beyond restating existing positions.

Today, at a meeting in Istanbul between Russian and Ukrainian teams, the atmospherics were a great deal more positive and the outlines, however faint, of an overall settlement to this horrendously destructive war began to come into focus.

They included the future of Crimea and the Donbas region, Ukraine's neutral status, protected by security guarantees, a notable pull-back of Russian forces currently north of Kyiv and even the prospect of a meeting between Presidents Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky.

The Ukrainian side accepted kicking into the long grass the status of Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014.

Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelensky, said of the future of Crimea, whose annexation has never been accepted by either Ukraine or other Western countries: ""It was agreed in bilateral format to take a pause for 15 years and conduct bilateral talks on the status of these territories.

""Separately we discussed that during the 15 years while the bilateral talks take place there will be no military hostilities,"" he told reporters.

This would take one of the most contentious issues off the table for now.

Both sides seemed to be in a constructive mood. Podolyak said the Russian negotiators have ""taken the treaty that outlines ways to end the war and will work out their counter proposals.""

Russian news agency TASS quoted the head of the Russian delegation, Vladimir Medinsky, as saying that the talks were constructive. And he said that ""Russia is taking two steps towards Ukraine for de-escalation.""

The most immediate of those is the Russian declaration that hostilities against Chernihiv and in the direction of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, would be drastically reduced. Chernihiv, in northern Ukraine, has been surrounded by Russian forces and has suffered devastating destruction over the past three weeks.

As significantly, Medinsky said that the Ukrainian proposals were now sufficiently formulated for them to ""be presented to the President. And our appropriate response will be given.""

""Provided that the agreement is worked on quickly and a compromise is found, the opportunity to conclude peace will become closer,"" Medinsky said -- the most upbeat assessment from a Russian official since the first round of talks at the end of February.

Russian officials have previously played down any involvement in the process of Putin, saying that more needed to be negotiated before the Russian leader personally sits down for direct talks.

Now, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti -- citing the Russian delegation -- spoke of the possibility of a meeting between Putin and Zelensky simultaneously with the initialing of the peace treaty by the foreign ministers of both countries.

Turkish Foreign Minister, Mevlüt Cavusoglu, who brokered the talks, sketched out a possible roadmap, with the ""top priority of achieving a ceasefire as soon as possible to pave the way for a permanent political solution.""

Those ""trickier"" issues would be bumped up to the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers to ""make final adjustments to the common approach."" And then a meeting between Putin and Zelensky would be on the agenda, he said in remarks to reporters after the talks.

An outline emerges

For Ukraine, security guarantees have always been a critical part of any settlement to the conflict. Gradually, President Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials have walked away from Ukraine's past insistence that it has the right -- even the obligation -- to apply for NATO membership, as is enshrined in the Ukrainian constitution.

Now a very different formulation is emerging.

One member of the Ukrainian team, Davyd Arakhamia, said after the meeting to Ukrainian TV: ""We insist that this be an international treaty, signing all the guarantors of security, which will be ratified.""

That treaty would have to be ratified by parliaments in the guarantor countries, according to Ukrainian officials, who are evidently building as much insurance into the mechanism as possible. The Ukrainians also want the guarantors to include the permanent members of the UN Security Council -- Russia included.

The guarantees would be very specific, Arakhamia said. In the event of aggression or a military operation directed at Ukraine, ""consultations should take place within three days.""

""After that, the guarantor countries are obliged to help us. And military aid, and the armed forces, and weapons, and the closed sky — everything that we need so much now, and we cannot get it.""

The Ukrainians are now looking at what might be called protected -- and permanent -- neutrality.

Another member of the Ukrainian delegation, Oleksandr Chalyi, put it this way: ""Doing everything possible to restore Ukraine's security is a key requirement. If we manage to consolidate these key provisions, which is the most fundamental requirement for us, Ukraine will in fact be in a position to fix its current status as a non-aligned and non-nuclear state in the form of permanent neutrality.""

Significantly, Chalyi went on : ""[We] will not deploy foreign military bases or military contingents on our territory, and we will not enter into military-political alliances. Military training in our country will be conducted with the consent of our guarantor countries.""

That is and always has been at the heart of Putin's demands, expressed in long speeches before he announced the start of what Putin called a ""special military operation.""

Swapping NATO for the European Union

It's becoming clearer that in return for forswearing the ambition of NATO membership, Ukraine expects a fast track to membership of the European Union -- which it wants to be assisted by the guarantor countries.

It's likely that the prospect of EU membership -- which is hugely popular among Ukrainians -- would help get an overall deal approved in the national referendum that the Ukrainian government has promised to approve neutrality with security guarantees.

There is still a long way to go of course. Principles have been set out, but the detail, the sequencing and the language may be a minefield. Podolyak said: ""Undoubtedly, this treaty on security guarantees may only be signed after a ceasefire and the complete withdrawal of Russian troops to their positions on February 23, 2022.""

While the Russians have agreed to reduce the operations of their forces north of Kyiv, that still leaves plenty of fighting underway: In the east, the northeast and the south.

Even before he left the negotiating venue, Medinsky warned that the ""gradual de-escalation"" in the direction of Kyiv and Chernihiv ""does not mean a ceasefire. But he said: ""We understand that there are people in Kyiv who need to make decisions, so we do not want to expose this city to additional risk."" And so the clock is ticking.

If the talks stutter or fail, Russian forces redeploying from the north of Kyiv could reinforce those trying to make headway in the east and south.

Indeed, just this weekend Ukraine's military intelligence chief warned that Putin could be looking to carve Ukraine in two -- like North and South Korea.

""There is reason to believe that he is considering a 'Korean' scenario for Ukraine. That is, [Russian forces] will try to impose a dividing line between the unoccupied and occupied regions of our country. In fact, it is an attempt to create North and South Korea in Ukraine,"" Kyrylo Budanov said Sunday.

Not only is there a lot of negotiating to be done -- in the absence of a comprehensive ceasefire. There's not much trust on the Ukrainian side of the Kremlin's intentions. And as they never tire of saying, ultimately what happens is down to one man and one man only: Vladimir Putin.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/29/europe/ukraine-russia-istanbul-talks-analysis-tuesday-intl-cmd/index.html

The mediating Turkish government and the press welcomed the meeting and its first results with optimism in terms of a sooner than later peaceful solution to the conflict.

Erdoğan: Negotiation process “increased hopes for peace”

Turkish President Erdoğan opened the meeting, taking place in the historic Dolmabahçe Palace, with the following words:

“I hope the talks will lead to auspicious results for both countries, the region and the entire humanity. The negotiation process, you conduct in line with the directives of your leaders, has increased hopes for peace and excited the whole world. In this spirit, we wholeheartedly support the talks.”

President Erdoğan continued:

“We believe a fair peace will have no losers. A prolonged conflict is not in anyone’s interest. Ensuring a ceasefire and peace as soon as possible would benefit all parties. We think we have entered a period when concrete results should be achieved at the talks. Given the current progress, you as members of delegations have undertaken a historic responsibility.

We stand ready for all kinds of contributions that will facilitate your work.”

Turkish Foreign Minister: consent and understanding “in some issues”

The Turkish government was present at the opening and closing of the meeting and held contacts to both sides. But Ankara did not directly take part in the talks. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, commented after the meeting:

“There is a consent and shared understanding in some of the issues. Today’s meeting brought the most meaningful progress since the start of the negotiations. For the process ahead, it is foreseen that foreign ministers of the two countries come together and give the joint understanding its last shape. Following that, a meeting between presidents of the two countries is on the agenda.”

Ukraine’s President: “positive signs”

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday that the latest round of peace talks with Russia in Istanbul, Turkey could be called “positive,” but “the enemy is still on our territory.”

“The signals we hear from the negotiating platform can be called positive,” Zelenskyy said on his Telegram account.

The Chairman of the Ukrainian delegation, Presidential Spokesperson Mihaylo Podolyak said talks were ongoing for a humanitarian cease-fire and added further meetings would be held online. Podolyak said the talks had reached a sufficient level for a bilateral presidential meeting and evaluated the approach of the Russian delegation as “constructive”.

Russian delegation: “constructive” talks

The Chairman of the Russian delegation, Vladimir Medinsky also described the talks as “constructive” and said his delegation had received a clearly outlined position on what Kiev sought to achieve. The written proposal, which includes Ukraine’s pledge to remain a neutral nation and that it will not try to obtain any weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons, will be relayed to Putin, he said.

Russia to ‘drastically’ cut military activity near Ukrainian capital

Coinciding with Medinsky’s statement to the press, the Russian defense ministry announced it was drastically reducing its military operations in some parts of Ukraine, including near the capital, Kiev. The ministry cited “the talks moving into the practical dimension,” as the reason for the change.

Accordingly, a cautious optimist tone prevailed in the Turkish press reporting on the meeting.

The pro-government newspaper Yeni Şafak titled “First decision for a cease-fire: Peace is now closer”. The newspaper said the talks had “opened the path to peace”.

It’s columnist Mehmet Acer, known for very close ties to the government, described Turkey’s past mediation efforts in length and concluded “It seems that an appropriate basis for a limited cease-fire has been found.”

The daily Hürriyet, Turkey’s leading newspaper in circulation, titled: “Good news from Istanbul to the world: Winds of peace in the Bosporus”.

The newspaper’s columnist Sedat Ergin argues the meeting has “indicated that from now on, the path of negotiation will prevail in the crisis”. A serious bargaining has already started practically according to Ergin.

One clear result is for Ergin that “the chapter of NATO membership is definitely closed for Ukraine”. The columnist also adds that Turkey’s position to reject sanctions against Russia and to keep equidistance to both sides of the conflict, insisting on good relations to both has “paved the way to Kremlin’s approval of negotiations in Istanbul and (…) will raise Turkey’s international diplomatic profile” in the times ahead. But, warns Ergin concluding, “we are at the very beginning of a process of resolution and problematic phases still lay ahead of us.”

“US will provoke to hinder peace”

“The greatest danger for peace is the US”, writes Abdulkadir Selvi, another columnist of the same newspaper. He writes:

“We are both very close to and very far away from peace. We are close, because Ukraine and Russia have seen there is not winner to this war. The only winner has been the United States. The losers are Russia and Ukraine. And the price is paid by Russian women and children.”

Selvi continues:

“It will not be easy to establish peace. And rest assured that the United States will pursue all kinds of provocations to hinder peace. Because that country benefits from the war. Therefore, we have a difficult road ahead.”

Sabah is another high-selling newspaper, and its chief columnist Mehmet Barlas is said to have a direct line of contact to President Erdoğan. In his article of March 30 titled “No way without Turkey”, Barlas first of all concedes a Russian success:

Turkey made “great progress” to follow own policies independent from the US

“The new Cold War has carried Russia to the forefront. (…) This operation has turned the Black Sea into a Russian sea. Those who thought Putin was acting without plan, should take a look at the Russian markets. The numbers in Russia are improving in all terms. And we know that, without Russian oil and gas, Europe, beginning with Germany, will have a hard stand surviving.”

Barlas then proposes that “Turkey should focus on its own agenda”. He writes: We are determined to use the gas reserves we have discovered in the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. And we will safeguard our energy security by cooperating with our allies, such as Azerbaijan and Iran. Turkey is wihin NATO a country that is sidelined. We have seen this again and again. The incident of Cyprus is just one of the occasions that confronted us with this fact. But the Republic of Turkey has made a great progress to become a country that follows its own interests independently from the United States. And our position in the last crisis has reconfirmed this.”

Becoming a guarantor state a “mine field”

Barlas concludes that Turkey is “not only the Middle East’s but also Europe’s indispensible actor”.

The oppositional Cumhuriyet newspaper delivered a warning front page. The newspaper referred to Ukraine’s proposal of guarantor states as “mine field”. Citing retired ambassador Ümit Pamir, the newspaper headlined that Turkey becoming a guarantor of Ukraine’s security in a similar way as NATO’s article 5 may force the country into war if a Russian operation occurs in future”.

Other oppositional newspapers such as Karar or Birgün did not carry the Ukrainian-Russian on their headlines.

In contrast to Western media, which doubted the possibility of an agreement, the Turkish media and especially the pro-government newspapers reported with great optimism that the Ukrainian – Russian meeting in Istanbul was a successful step towards peace.",https://uwidata.com/24254-mines-in-the-black-sea-optimism-at-the-bosporus/

EU energy and climate security strategy to counter the Russian aggression in Europe

According to this policy brief, the Russian invasion in Ukraine and the resulting energy and geopolitical crisis have clearly demonstrated that accommodating Russia is no longer defensible. The most effective way to stop the Kremlin’s aggression is for Europe to ban oil and gas imports from Russia that could cripple the Russian economy in 8 to 11 months. This would need to be accompanied by emergency measures to protect vulnerable consumers and alleviate Europe’s critical vulnerabilities before the next heating season.
