The president is set to travel to Brussels for a NATO summit on March 24 ""to discuss ongoing deterrence and defense efforts in response to Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified attack on Ukraine, as well as to reaffirm our ironclad commitment to our NATO allies,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday.

Biden also plans to join a scheduled European Council summit to discuss efforts to impose economic costs on Russia, provide humanitarian support to Ukraine and address other challenges related to the conflict, Psaki said.

“His goal is to meet in person, face-to-face with his European counterparts and talk about where we are at this point in the conflict in the invasion of Ukraine by Russia,” Psaki said. “We’ve been incredibly aligned to date — that doesn’t happen by accident. The president is a big believer in face-to-face diplomacy, so it’s an opportunity to do exactly that.”

Psaki said the White House is still finalizing the details of the trip and declined to say whether Biden could also travel to Poland or meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy while in Europe.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Tuesday that the alliance would convene a meeting of leaders to be held March 24 at NATO headquarters in Brussels.

""We will address #Russia’s invasion of #Ukraine, our strong support for Ukraine, and further strengthening NATO’s deterrence & defence. At this critical time, North America & Europe must continue to stand together,"" Stoltenberg said in a tweet.

NBC News was the first to report Monday that the White House was considering the possibility of Biden traveling to Europe.

Ms Psaki said Mr Biden will use the trip to discuss Nato’s “ongoing deterrence and defence efforts in response to Russia's unprovoked and unjustified attack on Ukraine,” and to “reaffirm” America’s “ironclad commitment” to the alliance.

“His goal is to meet in person face to face with his European counterparts and talk about where we are at this point in the conflict in the invasion of Ukraine by Russia,” Ms Psaki said. “We've been incredibly aligned to date – that doesn't happen by accident. The president is a big believer in face-to-face diplomacy, so it's an opportunity to do exactly that.”

Ms Psaki added that a face-to-face meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is “an option” for the trip, but said the details of Mr Biden’s itinerary were still being worked out.

She also announced that the president will join a previously scheduled European Council summit, at which he plans to discuss “shared concerns” about the invasion, including US and European efforts to “impose economic costs on Russia” and provide humanitarian support to the millions of Ukrainian refugees displaced by the invasion.

The announcement of Mr Biden’s upcoming travel comes just one day before Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky is set to address members of the US House of Representatives and Senate.

Asked whether Mr Zelensky is expected to ask for the US to support transfer of Soviet-made MiG-29 fighter jets to his Air Force, Ms Psaki would only say that Mr Biden held a “nearly hour-long” call with the Ukrainian leader on Friday and stressed that US officials are in contact with him and his advisers “every day”.

Ms Psaki also touted the latest round of sanctions imposed in response to the invasion against Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko, his wife, and 11 other Russian defence officials.

Ms Psaki said the US and European efforts have so far imposed “unprecedented costs” on Russia by reversing three decades of progress made since the fall of the Soviet Union in less than a month.

“Our actions have hit hard at the things President Putin cares about the most — degrading his military access to cutting edge technology and ability to project power and influence,” she said.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/biden-belgium-us-nato-russia-b2036462.html
3,ec9997ca-ecd5-497f-bb52-747a689e58b4,['Melissa Quinn'],,"Washington — President Biden will travel to Europe next week to meet with allies to discuss the West's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and their joint efforts to impose steep costs on Moscow over its attack, White House press secretary Jen Psaki confirmed Tuesday.

Psaki said during the White House press briefing the president will participate in an extraordinary NATO summit at its headquarters in Brussels on March 24 with leaders from the alliance's 30 member countries ""to discuss ongoing deterrence and defense efforts in response to Russia's unprovoked and unjustified attack on Ukraine as well as to reaffirm our ironclad commit to our NATO allies.""

Mr. Biden will also join a European Council summit, set for March 24 and March 25, ""to discuss our shared concerns about Ukraine, including transatlantic efforts to impose economic costs on Russia, provide humanitarian support to those affected by the violence and address other challenges related to the conflict,"" Psaki continued.

""His goal is to meet in person, face-to-face with his European counterparts and talk about and assess where we are at this point in the conflict, in the invasion of Ukraine by Russia,"" she said. ""We've been incredibly aligned to date. That doesn't happen by accident. The president is a big believer in face-to-face diplomacy, so it's an opportunity to do exactly that.""

In response to the White House's confirmation of Mr. Biden's upcoming trip to Europe, Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said in a tweet that ""transatlantic unity and coordination remain crucial for ramping up pressure on the Kremlin to stop the unjustified war.""

The trip will be Mr. Biden's first to Europe since Russia began its attack on Ukraine more than two weeks ago and follows Vice President Kamala Harris' visit to Poland and Romania last week.

In the wake of Russia's invasion, the Biden administration has worked in concert with European allies to impose sweeping economic sanctions on key Russian financial institutions, officials and oligarchs to cut Moscow off from the global economy. The U.S. and the West have also provided more than $1 billion in military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine to help the country defend itself from Russia.

Last week, Congress passed a government funding bill that also provides $13.6 billion in aid to Ukraine, which Mr. Biden signed into law Tuesday afternoon. The president said the U.S. is ""moving urgently to further augment the support to the brave people of Ukraine as they defend their country."" The humanitarian assistance passed by Congress will better position the U.S. to meet the needs of the Ukrainian people, he said.

""With billions more included in this bill for new humanitarian assistance, we're going to be able to quickly ramp up our response, and help alleviate the suffering that Putin's war is causing the Ukrainian people in the region,"" he added.

Russian President Vladimir Putin continues a brutal assault on Ukraine, and leaders of Poland, Czech Republic and Slovenia traveled Tuesday to Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, on a European Union mission to show support for the embattled nation.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden will go to NATO headquarters March 24 to discuss “ongoing deterrence and defense efforts in response to Russia's unprovoked and unjustified attack on Ukraine and reaffirm our ironclad commitment to our NATO allies.”

She said Biden will also join a scheduled European Council summit to discuss trans-Atlantic efforts to impose economic costs on Russia and provide humanitarian support to those affected by the violence in Ukraine.

Other details of Biden's trip were unclear. Psaki would not say whether Biden will visit Poland, where the majority of Ukrainian refugees have fled.

“We’re still working through the final details of the trip and what it may look like,” said Psaki, who did not rule out the possibility of Biden meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. “Nothing on the table at this point in time, but the real focus right now is to meet with NATO partners in Brussels.""

Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to Poland and Romania last week, where she held bilateral meetings with leaders from both countries and reaffirmed the United States’ commitment to defend members of NATO. The vice president went to NATO's eastern flank in a show of unity among members of the alliance. In February, Harris attended the Munich Security Conference.

Zelenskyy is set to virtually address the U.S. House and Senate on Wednesday morning after speaking to Canada's parliament on Tuesday.

Addressing representatives of the U.K.-led Joint Expeditionary Force, Zelenskyy said Ukraine has heard for years about ""the allegedly open doors” of NATO, but he acknowledged his country will not be able to join. Putin has called for a guarantee that Ukraine would never join NATO among terms for an end to the war.

Zelenskyy has repeatedly called for NATO to set up a ""no-fly"" zone above Ukraine to stop the Russian aerial assault that has decimated cities since the invasion began Feb. 24. He said Tuesday that Europe could “help yourself by helping us” with more military aid.

The White House opposes a no-fly zone over Ukraine, a position Psaki reiterated Tuesday, saying the president believes that would be ""escalatory"" and ""could prompt a war with Russia.""

Since taking office, Biden has committed $1.2 billion in security assistance for Ukraine, according to the White House, including $550 million over the past two weeks. Biden signed a $1.5 trillion omnibus bill Tuesday that includes $13.6 billion in emergency military and humanitarian aid for Ukraine.

“Putin’s aggression against Ukraine has united people all across America, united our two parties in Congress and united the freedom-loving world,” Biden said before signing the funding bill. “It’s an act with urgency and resolve that we're doing right now.”

The announcement came on the same day Russia announced sanctions on Biden and other top U.S. officials, in a move aimed at restricting travel to Russia. The move is in response to sanctions that prevent Russian officials from entering the U.S.

“It won’t surprise any of you that none of us are planning tourist trips to Russia,” Psaki told reporters. “None of us have bank accounts that we won’t be able to access, so we will forge ahead.”

Ukraine officials said over the weekend that Ukraine has lost 1,300 soldiers.

Russia's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

""As a result of these losses, it is likely Russia is struggling to conduct offensive operations in the face of sustained Ukrainian resistance,"" the ministry said. ""Continued personnel losses will also make it difficult for Russia to secure occupied territory.""

Russia is transferring troops to Ukraine from as far away as its Pacific Fleet and is recruiting more mercenaries as it tries to replace lost personnel, according to an assessment from the U.K. Defence Ministry .

Ukrainian soldier Yaroslav prays on March 15 over the coffin of his father, also a Ukrainian soldier, who was killed fighting on the outskirts of Kyiv.

Moscow is redeploying troops from as far away as Armenia, its Eastern Military District, and the Russian Pacific Fleet, the ministry said.

The Pacific Fleet is based in Vladivostok, Russia. By air, Vladivostok is more than 4,400 miles (7,100 km) from Kyiv.

The U.K. Defence Ministry said Russia is seeking mercenaries from Syria and ""private military companies,"" the term used to describe Russia-based firms that hire out armed fighters.

Moscow will likely use those mercenaries to hold seized Ukrainian territory so it can shift more of its regular troops to fight Ukrainian forces and ""renew stalled offensive operations,"" the U.K. ministry said.

Russian corporate fighters have been accused of committing human rights abuses in Syria, Libya and the Central African Republic while working on behalf of Moscow.

Such mercenary services already operated in eastern Ukraine prior to Russia's current invasion, according to the U.S. government.

In 2017, the U.S. Treasury placed sanctions on the biggest Russian mercenary company, PMC Wagner, and its founder, Dmitriy Utkin, for ""actions or policies that threaten the peace, security, stability, sovereignty, or territorial integrity of Ukraine.""

The Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies said last year that Moscow provided security and military services through private mercenary companies to the government of the Central African Republic in exchange for the right to extract gold, uranium and diamonds.
