The latest: The weeks-long resistance in besieged Mariupol appeared to be cracking as Russian forces moved closer to capturing the seaside port city in southeastern Ukraine, with a Russian-imposed deadline for Ukrainian forces in the city to surrender passing early Sunday local time. Meanwhile, officials in the capital Kyiv and the western city of Lviv reported explosions Saturday. Moscow has withdrawn its forces from those regions to focus on eastern Ukraine, but airstrikes have continued.

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Why it matters: The talks in Turkey marked the highest-level negotiations between the Russian and Ukrainian government since the invasion began, but ended in disappointment. Russia again falsely accused Ukraine of being the aggressor and said the attack will continue until Kyiv agrees to its list of demands.

State of play: Kuleba said his top priority during the 1.5-hour talks was establishing a humanitarian corridor for Mariupol, a port city in southern Ukraine where Russian forces destroyed a maternity ward and children's hospital on Wednesday as part of a brutal, week-long siege.

Kuleba said Lavrov was ""not in a position to commit"" to a humanitarian corridor, suggesting the Russian foreign minister was not empowered to make any decision without consulting Moscow.

""Russia is not in a position at this point to establish a ceasefire. They seek a surrender from Ukraine. This is not what they're going to get. Ukraine is strong, Ukraine is fighting,"" Kuleba said.

""Ukraine made Russia's initial plans fail. We are seeking a diplomatic solution to this war. But we will not surrender.""

The big picture: Putin has failed in his strategic objectives of swiftly capturing Kyiv and forcing the Ukrainian government to capitulate. As frustrations build, Russian forces have increasingly turned to attacking civilians with indiscriminate shelling.

Russia is demanding neutrality for Ukraine, recognition of Crimea as Russian, and recognition of the pro-Moscow separatist territories in eastern Ukraine as independent.

Zelensky has indicated that Ukraine would be open to discussing neutrality, but is opposed to any agreement that sacrifices the country's territorial integrity.

""Ukraine exists in a security vacuum. If a similar system of security guarantees, as envisaged by the NATO charter, would be granted to Ukraine by permanent members of the UN security council, including Russia, also Turkey, we are ready to discuss it,"" Kuleba said.

Between the lines: In a sign of the parallel universes in which the two sides are operating, Lavrov claimed at one point, ""We are not planning to attack other countries. We didn't attack Ukraine in the first place.""",https://www.axios.com/ukraine-russia-talks-foreign-ministers-4ed62248-7f29-4976-b037-8f4a3ce69415.html

Russia indicated it will continue attacks until its goals are met, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said after the meeting lasting about 90 minutes with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Turkey on Thursday. “The broad narrative he conveyed to me is that they will continue their aggression until Ukraine meets their demands, and the least of these demands is surrender,” Kuleba said.

Russia is open to serious talks between the two presidents “but those contacts must have added value,” Lavrov told reporters after the meeting. He reiterated that Russia is seeking the demilitarization of Ukraine.

Hosted by Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu in the Mediterranean resort city of Antalya, this was the most senior in-person meeting between Ukraine and Russia since the Russian invasion began Feb. 24. It followed two weeks of war in which Russia’s plans for achieving a rapid military victory have hit increasing difficulties as Ukraine mounts a determined defense, backed by flows of weapons from the U.S. and its allies.

That’s prompted Russian President Vladimir Putin to adopt increasingly brutal tactics, with his forces shelling Ukrainian cities to try to break resistance.

At the same time. the intensity of the international response in sanctioning Russia’s economy appears to have caught the Kremlin by surprise, with the ruble sinking to record lows, dozens of foreign businesses pulling out of the country and markets pricing in a growing risk of a sovereign default.

Kuleba had set out Ukraine’s three key demands before the meeting with Lavrov — a cease-fire, an improvement of the humanitarian situation in besieged cities, and the withdrawal of Russian forces from the country.

Russia didn’t plan to discuss a cease-fire at Thursday’s talks because the main negotiations are the ones that have taken place in Belarus, said Lavrov, who gave no commitments on humanitarian corridors for Ukrainian cities. He insisted Russia hadn’t invaded Ukraine but is carrying out what the Kremlin calls a “special military operation” there.

“We want a Ukraine that’s friendly and demilitarized, a Ukraine in which there isn’t a risk of the creation of another Nazi state, a Ukraine where there won’t be a ban on the Russian language, on Russian culture,” Lavrov said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said he’s willing to consider some compromises on Russia’s demand that his country abandons ambitions to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and adopt a neutral position.

Zelenskiy’s also said that “only after the direct talks between the two presidents can we end this war,” and that there’s been no direct contact between him and Putin.

Ukraine is insisting on security guarantees from neighbors and allies such as the U.S., the U.K. and Germany, and won’t cede a “single inch” of its territory to Russia, Ihor Zhovkva, Zelenskiy’s deputy chief of staff, said in a Bloomberg Television interview Wednesday from Kyiv.

While Ukraine wants a diplomatic solution, “our first and foremost pre-condition for having such kind of negotiations is immediate cease-fire and withdrawal of Russian troops,” Zhovkva said.

When he ordered the invasion, Putin set out goals for the “demilitarization” and “denazification” of Ukraine that included ousting Zelenskiy’s government and replacing it with one friendly to Moscow.

With its forces still failing to gain control of Kyiv and most key Ukrainian cities, despite vastly superior firepower, Russia has modified its stance even as Putin has insisted all of his goals will still be accomplished. It’s demanded Ukraine acknowledge Russian sovereignty over Crimea, which Putin annexed in 2014, and accept Moscow’s recognition of two separatist regions in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donbas.

Three earlier rounds of lower-level talks in Belarus between Russian and Ukrainian officials yielded few results beyond attempts to establish some humanitarian corridors for civilians caught in the fighting.

With more than 2 million Ukrainians fleeing into neighboring countries for safety and millions more displaced, the invasion has already triggered a humanitarian catastrophe on a scale unseen in Europe since World War II.

Kuleba says wanted humanitarian corridor in Mariupol

Meeting in Turkey was first high level talks between them

ANTALYA, Turkey, March 10 (Reuters) - Talks between Russia and Ukraine's foreign ministers on Thursday made no apparent progress towards a ceasefire in the two-week-old conflict or on a humanitarian corridor from the southern Ukrainian port of Mariupol.

Ukraine's Dmytro Kuleba said after the talks that he had sought a 24-hour ceasefire across the whole combat zone as well as the opening of a Mariupol corridor, but that his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov did not commit to either.

Lavrov said he reminded Kuleba that Moscow had presented proposals to Kyiv, and that Russia wanted to see what he called a friendly, demilitarised Ukraine.

The meeting, in the southern Turkish resort of Antalya was the highest-level contact between the two sides since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. It lasted just under an hour and a half.

Both Kuleba and Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, who hosted the talks, said it was not an easy meeting.

""I made a simple proposal to Minister Lavrov: I can call my Ukrainian ministers, authorities, president now and give you 100% assurances on security guarantees for humanitarian corridors,"" Kuleba told a news conference.

""I asked him 'Can you do the same?' and he did not respond.""

At a separate news conference Lavrov said there had been no discussion of a ceasefire, and that the talks in Turkey could not be an alternative to the ""real, main diplomatic track"", referring to lower-level meetings in Belarus, an ally of Moscow.

""I am not surprised that Mr Kuleba said that it was not possible to agree about a ceasefire. Here, no one was intending to agree a ceasefire,"" he said.

HOSPITAL BOMBING

Responding to Kyiv's condemnation of Wednesday's bombing of a maternity hospital in Mariupol, Lavrov said the building was no longer used as a hospital and had been occupied by Ukrainian forces, though the Kremlin separately said the incident was being investigated.

""Three days ago at the U.N. Security Council meeting our delegation presented facts that this maternity hospital had long been seized by the Azov battalion and other radicals,"" he said.

Russia's invasion has uprooted more than 2 million people in what the United Nations calls the fastest-developing humanitarian crisis in Europe since World War Two. read more

Moscow has said that all of its demands - including that Kyiv takes a neutral position and drops aspirations of joining the NATO alliance - must be met to end its assault.

Moscow calls its incursion a ""special military operation"" to disarm Ukraine and dislodge leaders it calls ""neo-Nazis."" Kyiv and its Western allies dismiss that as baseless pretext for an unprovoked war against a democratic country of 44 million people.

Lavrov said he did not believe the conflict would spiral into a nuclear war but he cautioned the United States and Europe that Moscow never again wanted to be reliant on the West.

""We will do everything to ensure that we never again depend on the West in those areas of our life which have a significant meaning for our people,"" he said.

Turkey, which hosted Thursday's meeting, shares a maritime border with Russia and Ukraine in the Black Sea and has good ties with both. It has called Russia's invasion unacceptable and appealed for a ceasefire but has opposed sanctions on Moscow.

Russia is no closer to backing down from its war in Ukraine following a meeting between the two countries’ foreign ministers in Turkey on Thursday.

After only a few hours, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba emerged from talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to offer a gloomy assessment.

The “broad narrative” that Lavrov had conveyed, Kuleba said at a press conference, was that Russia “will continue [its] repression until Ukraine meets their demands.”

And those demands are untenable for Ukraine: full demilitarization, full surrender — essentially full subjugation to Russia.

Lavrov didn’t deny Kuleba’s account in his own press conference.

“We were never going to be agreeing to a ceasefire,” he said. “Ukraine knows what we want.”

Thursday’s meeting was the highest-level get-together between Russia and Ukraine since Moscow launched its all-out offensive two weeks ago. But, like previous dialogues between lower-level delegations, the discussion produced no discernible progress.

Kuleba said most of the time was dedicated to “pressing humanitarian issues on the ground” — a vital concern for Ukrainians trying to flee numerous cities surrounded by Russian troops.

Russia has repeatedly vowed that it would allow local residents to escape via humanitarian corridors, only to continue its shelling during the agreed ceasefire times, according to local authorities and numerous media reports.

The besieged city of Mariupol has received particular attention in recent days after local authorities called off such evacuation attempts due to ongoing attacks. Then earlier this week, Russian forces bombed a maternity hospital in Mariupol, injuring scores of people and killing three, including one child, according to Ukrainian authorities. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the attack “proof of a genocide.”

When pressed about the maternity hospital attack, Lavrov initially claimed there were no women and children there, and then appeared to contradict himself to say Ukrainian forces were using those at the hospital as human shields. Many videos and photos have emerged of women injured in the attack on the hospital.

Kuleba said he hoped Lavrov would listen to Ukrainian demands to “help arrange safe passage for them from the besieged cities, first and foremost, from Mariupol, as well as to allow the provision of humanitarian aid.”

The lack of results from the meeting is no surprise. Russia has essentially been demanding full capitulation from Ukraine since the start of the war and has not wavered since. In public, Russian President Vladimir Putin has reiterated the unequivocal stance several times, including while his own team was meeting with a Ukrainian delegation.

Meanwhile, Russian forces have continued to intensify their bombings of numerous Ukrainian cities. Still, Moscow’s troops have remained stalled for days on the outskirts of Kyiv, the capital, as well as outside several other key urban centers.",https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-ukraine-lavrov-kuleba-high-level-talks-ukrain/

With Russia’s war in Ukraine now in its third week, US and European officials have little optimism that the diplomatic channels can deliver a way out of the conflict at this point.

Talks between Ukraine’s and Russia’s diplomats this week yielded no discernible progress. Supposedly safe evacuation routes out of the country have repeatedly been contested. The civilian death toll continues to rise, and by the end of the week both sides were trading accusations over the use of chemical weapons.

While Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday there had been “certain positive advances” in negotiations with Ukraine, US and European officials and diplomats who spoke to CNN all expressed deep skepticism about the state of talks. None felt Putin’s actions to date have suggested the Russian leader is ready to find a diplomatic off-ramp to end the war.

The US and its allies have enacted crippling sanctions on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine, and US President Joe Biden has kept in touch with European leaders as well as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. But US officials have privately acknowledged they don’t believe any of these sanctions are going to change Putin’s thinking, and many don’t believe Russia’s losses in Ukraine will either.

The Biden administration is resisting putting its weight behind any single player involved in early efforts to broker a solution to end the Ukraine crisis. US officials say they have yet to see any tangible progress in any channel and continue to view Ukraine and Russia as the only essential players in driving a solution.

“A variety of different countries can try to shape things as they would like, but at the end of the day, this will likely boil down to what President Zelensky is willing to accept and what President Putin is willing to accept,” said a senior State Department official.

Some administration officials believe that efforts by Turkey and Israel could prove more effective than the French and German attempts because they have relations with both countries, but warn that it is too soon tell. Other officials are resistant to offer early judgment.

“There can be other parties that facilitate that or mediate, and there’s obviously been a number of efforts underway already. But at the end of the day, this is likely to be a conflict that lasts for a while longer — and ultimately it will be a negotiation,” the official added.

Hunting for successful channels

Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett traveled to Moscow a week ago to meet with Putin, and he spoke to both Putin and Zelensky earlier this week. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was briefed on Bennett’s trip to Moscow by Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid in Riga, Latvia, according to a US official familiar with the matter. The US coordinated with Israel ahead of the visit as well.

Ukrainian officials, however, have raised concerns to US lawmakers in recent days about Bennett’s proposition, two US officials told CNN. Some lawmakers have even called the Israelis to raise their concerns about Bennett forcing Putin’s proposal on the Ukrainians, the sources said.

On Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz held a three-way call with Putin, where the European leaders demanded an “immediate ceasefire” in Ukraine, according to an Elysée Palace readout of the call.

The Biden administration is in touch with all of the countries that have been talking with Putin and Zelensky in recent weeks and has no plans to engage directly with Putin anytime soon, officials said. They also think that the talks happening right now are not making any real progress yet, with a major focus being on the humanitarian side amid fears the war could continue for weeks, if not months.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met in Turkey on Thursday, but those talks ended without an agreement reached on humanitarian corridors or a ceasefire.

Asked about Putin’s comments claiming progress in the talks Friday, Kuleba told Bloomberg News, “There was zero progress in talks, so it’s hard for me to understand what kind of progress President Putin is referring to.”

‘It’s Vladimir Putin himself’

Estonian Ambassador to the US Kristjan Prikk told CNN on Friday it was “Orwellian” that Lavrov “in one sentence says that Russia has not invaded Ukraine and yet the demands that he presents are about the surrender of Ukraine.”

“There is very little point of spending the diplomatic capital, I’d say, on efforts that from the other side are designed to be a failure,” he said.

Asked if there was any leader he believed could talk Putin down from the war, Prikk said: “It’s Vladimir Putin himself — it is up to him to actually acknowledge that he is committing, he is doing something that is incredibly bad for his own people and his own country, just as well as it’s tragic and awful to Ukrainian people and country.”

US intelligence leaders told congressional committees this week that Putin had miscalculated when he launched his invasion. CIA Director William Burns said Putin had made a number of assumptions, including that Ukraine was weak, his military was capable of a quick and decisive victory, European countries would be risk-averse and Russia had “sanctions-proofed” its economy.

“He’s been proven wrong on every count,” Burns said.

But the intelligence community also assessed that Putin was unlikely to be deterred by Russia’s setbacks and instead may escalate. “We assess Putin feels aggrieved the West does not give him proper deference and perceives this as a war he cannot afford to lose,” Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said.

The US would support a conversation between Zelensky and Putin but remains skeptical that it could result in progress on a diplomatic solution right now, officials said.

“We would support our Ukrainian partners in the diplomatic overtures, the diplomatic initiatives that they wish to take part in. That does not mean that we would have necessarily high hopes at the moment,” State Department spokesperson Ned Price said Thursday when asked about the potential meeting.

‘The pretense of diplomacy’

The US would “need to see the Russian Federation show up with a different disposition” if that meeting were to be effective, given Russia’s previous engagements have not been marked by a real desire to bring the conflict to an end, Price explained.

Russia’s approach to its diplomacy with Ukraine to date “strikes us as something much more akin to what we’ve talked about before, and that is the pretense of diplomacy,” Price said.

On Friday, Putin met Belarus’ leader, Alexander Lukashenko, in Moscow, where the Russian President claimed that the sweeping Western sanctions offered “a time of opportunity to move towards strengthening technological and economic sovereignty.”

The Biden administration is also holding firm on not opening the door to any potential agreement that would result in Ukraine capitulating.

“Our position is that we will support a negotiated resolution that respects Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders. Full stop,” the State Department official said. “We’re applying this pressure in the hopes that eventually there will be a negotiated resolution, but it does not appear that Putin wants one right now.”

Meanwhile, the US will forge ahead with “all forms of future reconstruction assistance that we can muster to help Ukraine survive as a sovereign nation,” the official said.

The support the US continues giving Ukraine is also viewed as a factor that could — over time — force Russia to come to the table in a more serious way.

“The pressure it’s encountering on the battlefield, the economic dire straits that it’s in back at home,” Price said of Russia. “It is certainly our hope that those forces will combine and it will push the Russian Federation to the negotiating table in a way that actually involves good faith.”

Russian Diplomat Says Moscow Won't Attack More Countries but Bizarrely Lies That 'We Didn't Attack Ukraine'

The top diplomats for Russia and Ukraine met in Antalya, Turkey, on Thursday for the latest round of talks between the countries but failed to pause the fighting from Russia's invasion that has killed or wounded more than 1,200 civilians and spurred a refugee crisis in Europe.

Despite it being the highest-level meeting so far since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, both sides implied that an agreement was never going to be reached in Turkey, where Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov made a false claim that his country ""didn't attack Ukraine,"" according to The New York Times.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.

Lavrov ""came to talk but not to decide,"" his counterpart, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, told Turkish television.

""They will continue their aggression until Ukraine meets their demands, and the least of these demands is surrender,"" Kuleba told reporters after the talks.

Russia continues to ""seek surrender from Ukraine, but this is not what they are going to get,"" Kuleba said, according to NBC News.

Lavrov said his country's demands were made clear in previous negotiations in Belarus.

""It is there that all practical issues are discussed, it is there that it was explained in the most detailed way what needs to be done in order to end this crisis,"" he said, according to CNN. ""This includes demilitarization and 'de-Nazification' and ensuring the neutral status of Ukraine.""

Lavrov was referring in part to a widely rejected claim by the Russian government that Ukraine has somehow been overtaken by Nazis. The country's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is Jewish.

""Ukraine is strong. Ukraine is fighting. Ukraine made Russian initial plans fail,"" Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign minister, also said of the latest talks. ""We are ready to seek balanced diplomatic solutions to put an end to this war, but we will not surrender.""

There was hope that Russian President Vladimir Putin's frustration with the state of the invasion, which has met tougher-than-expected resistance in Ukraine, and a slight shift in his apparent goals could ""crack the door open to a permanent cease-fire,"" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Wednesday before his foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, presided over the meeting.

But in mentioning ""demilitarization and 'de-Nazification,' "" Lavrov signaled a return to Russia's apparent aim of regime change in Ukraine.

Answering questions from members of the media, Lavrov said reports of Russian actions in Ukraine were ""fakes,"" even as a horrific scene unfolded Wednesday when injured pregnant women evacuated a severely damaged children's hospital and maternity ward in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol.

Asked if other countries could be threatened by Russia, Lavrov said, ""We do not plan to attack other countries. We didn't attack Ukraine, either.""

Cavusoglu reportedly called Thursday's meeting ""extremely civilized,"" and said no one raised their voices. ""No miracles should be expected in just one meeting,"" the Turkish diplomat added. ""This political-level meeting is an important beginning.""

Russia's attack on Ukraine continues after their forces launched a large-scale invasion late last month — the first major land conflict in Europe in decades.

Details of the fighting change by the day, but more than a thousand civilians have already been reported dead or wounded, including children. More than 2 million Ukrainians have also fled, the United Nations says.

""You don't know where to go, where to run, who you have to call. This is just panic,"" Liliya Marynchak, a 45-year-old teacher in Ivano-Frankivsk, Ukraine, told PEOPLE of the moment her city was bombed — one of numerous accounts of bombardment by the Russians.

The invasion, ordered by Putin, has drawn condemnation around the world and increasingly severe economic sanctions against Russia.

With NATO forces massing in the region around Ukraine, various countries have also pledged aid or military support to the resistance. Ukraine President Zelenskyy urged his country to fight back.

Putin insists Ukraine has historic ties to Russia and he is acting in the best security interests of his country. Zelenskyy vowed not to bend.

""Nobody is going to break us, we're strong, we're Ukrainians,"" he told the European Union in a speech in the early days of the fighting, adding, ""Life will win over death. And light will win over darkness.""",https://people.com/politics/top-russian-diplomat-says-moscow-wont-attack-other-countries/
