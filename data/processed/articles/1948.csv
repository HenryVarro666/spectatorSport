On Monday, the mayor of Mariupol said that evacuation corridors had come largely under the control of Russian forces, after weeks of bombardment left the city in pieces, killed an unknown number of civilians and forced hundreds of thousands of residents from their homes.

Boichenko called for a complete evacuation of the remaining population of Mariupol, which was home to more than 400,000 people before Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on February 24.

""According to our estimates, about 160,000 people are in the besieged city of Mariupol today, where it is impossible to live because there is no water, no electricity, no heat, no connection,"" he said. ""And it's really scary.""

Officials say many residents trapped without supplies

Mayor says remaining residents must be evacuated

LVIV, Ukraine, March 28 (Reuters) - Nearly 5,000 people, including about 210 children, have been killed in the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol since Russian forces laid siege to it, a spokesperson for the mayor said on Monday.

It was not immediately clear how Mayor Vadym Boichenko had calculated the toll from a month of Russian bombardment that has devastated the city and trapped tens of thousands of residents without power and with few supplies.

Boichenko's office said 90% of Mariupol's buildings had been damaged and 40% destroyed, including hospitals, schools, kindergartens and factories.

About 140,000 people had fled the city on the Sea of Azov before the Russian siege began and 150,000 have exited since then, leaving 170,000 still there, according to its figures, which Reuters could not immediately verify.

Boichenko, who is no longer in Mariupol, said on national television earlier on Monday that about 160,000 civilians were still trapped in the city.

""People are beyond the line of humanitarian catastrophe,"" he said. ""We need to completely evacuate Mariupol.""

Ukraine said it was impossible to create any safe corridors on Monday, citing intelligence reports about possible Russian ""provocations"" along the routes.

Russia, which invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, denies targeting civilians and blames Ukraine for repeated failures to agree on safe corridors for trapped residents.

""The Russian Federation is playing with us. We are in the hands of the invaders,"" Boichenko said.

The two sides are set to resume peace talks on Tuesday in Turkey. read more

STRATEGIC PRIZE

Mariupol is widely seen as a strategic prize as its capture could enable Russia to create a land bridge between Crimea, annexed by Moscow in 2014, and two separatist enclaves in eastern Ukraine.

People who have fled Mariupol have been describing how tough it was living for weeks under almost constant bombardment.

""There is no food for the children, especially the infants. They delivered babies in basements because women had nowhere to go to give birth, all the maternity hospitals were destroyed,"" a grocery worker from Mariupol who gave her name only as Nataliia told Reuters after reaching nearby Zaporizhzhia.

""I also found out today that my son's classmate's parents were torn apart right in the yard before his eyes.""

She said trapped residents had spent time looking for snow which they could melt to have water to wash their hands.

Valeriia, a 20-year-old student from Mariupol, said electricity, internet access, water and heating had been cut off on March 2. Soon afterwards, heavy fighting broke out nearby and part of his home was destroyed.

""Constant shooting, shelling. We were sitting in the corridor, we did not sleep or eat properly for several days. Because as soon as you get out of there, the shootings start, and you run back,"" she said.

She and her sister were given a ride out of the city by other residents who fled in a private car. They left their parents behind.

Sergiy, a metallurgy plant worker, recalled Grad rockets slamming into buildings and people being killed.

""There was a man walking by, this Grad, as cynical as it sounds, tore him to pieces, a corpse. I saw corpses lying around the city, you could see that a mine had exploded and shrapnel was hitting people,"" he said.

Mayor Vadym Boichenko said the situation is so dire in Mariupol, where about 160,000 civilians are trapped without heat or power, that the port city must be completely evacuated.

Boichenko said 26 buses were waiting to evacuate civilians - who have faced constant bombardment from Russian forces for days - but Vladimir Putin's men had not agreed to give them safe passage.

The 160,000 civilians trapped in the city are encircled by Russian forces, with ever-dwindling supplies of food, water and medicine.

Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Russian troops are 'turning the city into dust', describing the situation in Mariupol as 'catastrophic' with people fighting to survive.

Mayor Boichenko said: 'The situation in the city remains difficult. People are beyond the line of humanitarian catastrophe. We need to completely evacuate Mariupol.'

Speaking about Russian troops not agreeing to allow the civilians safe passage from Mariupol, the mayor said: The Russian Federation is playing with us.

'We are in the hands of the invaders.'

Russia said last week it had evacuated several hundred thousand people from the war zone, but Ukraine said up to 15,000 civilians were forcibly deported from the Left Bank area of Mariupol to Russia.

Mariupol is widely seen as a strategic prize for the Russian invaders to create a bridge between Crimea, annexed by Moscow in 2014, and two separatist enclaves in eastern Ukraine.

Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs tweeted: 'While Mariupol besieged and bombed, people fight to survive. The humanitarian situation in the city is catastrophic.

'Russian Armed Forces is turning the city into dust.'

Ukraine announced no plans to try to create safe corridors anywhere in the country on Monday, making clear it feared Russian attacks.

'Our intelligence has reported possible 'provocations' by the occupiers on the humanitarian corridor routes. So, for reasons of public safety, we are not opening any humanitarian corridors today,' said Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk.

France, Greece and Turkey are hoping to launch a mass evacuation of civilians within days, according to French President Emmanuel Macron, who has sought an agreement from Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.

Fighting continues around Mariupol on Monday as Russian forces try to capture the port on the Sea of Azov, which connects to the Black sea.

FBut Russian troops have made no significant progress in the past 24 hours in Ukraine amid continuing supply problems and aggressive resistance from Ukrainian fighters, UK defence officials said.

Poor morale and a lack of momentum have compounded the problems facing Russian forces, Britain's Ministry of Defense said in its latest intelligence briefing.

Earlier, the ministry said Russia was maintaining a blockade of Ukraine's Black Sea coast, cutting off maritime trade with the country. The Russian navy is also launching 'sporadic' missile strikes against targets in Ukraine, the ministry said.

Meanwhile, Russia and Ukraine will restart face-to-face peace negotiations on Monday, amid the warnings that the situation in Mariupol was 'catastrophic'.

President Volodymyr Zelensky hailed the resumption of over-the-table talks, saying they must bring peace 'without delay' and signalling a willingness to compromise on the most sensitive topics.

The two sides have not met in person in weeks, but will hold three days of talks in Istanbul from Monday, according to David Arakhamia, a Ukrainian negotiator, lawmaker and Zelensky ally.

Several rounds of talks have already failed to end the war sparked by the Russian invasion, which is now in its second month.

About 20,000 people have been killed, according to Zelensky, 10 million have fled their homes and despite Russian military setbacks, several cities are still coming under withering bombardment.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10659301/Mariupol-turned-dust-Russian-forces-verge-humanitarian-catastrophe.html

The city has been the target of Russian attacks since the early days of the war. After troops besieged the city, hundreds of thousands of residents were trapped in the city without basic necessities such as food, power, and water.

“According to our estimates, about 160,000 people are in the besieged city of Mariupol today where it is impossible to live because there is no water, no electricity, no heat, no connection,” the mayor stated.

Russian attacks on Mariupol have destroyed 90% of residential buildings in the city

Ukrainian authorities estimate that Russian attacks have left 90% of residential buildings in Mariupol damaged or destroyed.

Additionally, seven hospitals have been damaged or destroyed. This amounts to the destruction of 90% of the hospital beds.

Before Russian troops invaded the city, Mariupol was home to over 400,000 people. According to Ukrainian figures, hundreds of thousands of people have fled the city, and around 30,000 have been deported to Russia.

Boychenko called for the entire city, which has nearly been reduced to rubble, to be evacuated on Monday. However, he claims that the Russian troops are preventing civilians from leaving the city.

“We need a complete evacuation from Mariupol…Our most important mission today is to save every life…there are 26 buses that have to go to Mariupol to evacuate, but unfortunately, they haven’t received permission to move,” he stressed.

Mariupol’s mayor called the situation in the city a “humanitarian catastrophe.”

Boychenko noted that Russian troops have not yet gained control of the city: “Today the city of Mariupol remains a Ukrainian city…Our military is doing everything to keep it that way in the future.”

He also argued that Russia’s attacks on the city amount to “genocide.”

“The task was to wipe the city off the face of the earth along with its inhabitants…This is genocide, there is no other way to call what is happening,” he said.

According to official figures from the Ukrainian authorities, around 2,100 civilians in Mariupol have been killed by Russian attacks, but Boychenko believes the real number is much higher and estimates it is actually around 5,000 people.

Ukraine prepared for talks with Russia

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sunday that he is prepared to discuss the adoption of a status of neutrality as part of a peace deal with Russia.

As the next round of face-to-face negotiations between Ukraine and Russia take place this week in Turkey, Zelensky has told independent Russian journalists that important points are “security guarantees and neutrality, non-nuclear status of our state” that he is “ready to go for ….”

But he added that the proposal would have to go to a referendum and be guaranteed by third parties.

Zelensky said Ukraine refused to discuss certain other Russian demands, such as the demilitarization of the country.",https://greekreporter.com/2022/03/28/mariupol-russia-ukraine-mayor/

Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko said the entire city requires evacuation, Ukrainskaya Pravda reported. The city has been besieged by Russian forces since March 1st.

""Those people who remained in the city – our respected, heroic Mariupol residents – are beyond a humanitarian catastrophe,” Boychenko stated on television.

Mariupol had a pre-war population of more than 430,000, of which an estimated 160,000 remain in the city.

“About 160,000 people, according to our estimates, are in the besieged Mariupol, in which it is impossible to live today, because there is nothing at all: no water, no light, no heat, no connection,” the Mayor explained.

Over the last week, 26,477 of the city’s residents were evacuated to Zaporozhye

“Our main mission today is to do what we have to do,” Boychenko continued. “We need a complete evacuation of Mariupol. The President of Ukraine is working on this, he spoke about it yesterday. We must save every life that still beats in the heart of Mariupol. The President of France, the President of Turkey, are working on this today. We live in the hope that we will succeed.”

Boychenko decried Russia’s “cynical game”, in which the Russian military agrees to allow humanitarian corridors but reneges on the agreement and sometimes shells the corridors.

""They wanted to destroy us as a nation. What is happening in Mariupol and Chernihiv is genocide,"" Boychenko said.
