A number of employees of the Russian Permanent Mission in the EU were declared by EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell as persona non-grata.

""Today I decided to designate persona non grata a number of officials of the permanent mission of the Russian Federation to the European Union for engaging in activities contrary to their diplomatic status,"" Borrell stated at a news briefing.

He added that the head of the Russian mission was invited to the European External Action Service for the purpose of familiarizing himself with the decision.

Slovak authorities said on March 15 that they had decided to expel three Russian diplomats following information from intelligence services.

Bratislava also said that it had charged two citizens with ""spying"" for Russia after they allegedly passed on highly sensitive intelligence to Moscow concerning NATO and Ukraine.

These decisions mark the latest of Russian diplomats' expulsions from Western countries following similar moves made in several countries earlier this month.
