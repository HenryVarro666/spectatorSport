Most of the symptoms have passed but the brain fog lingers. Combine that with the mist surrounding Mariupol yesterday and you had a correspondent very slow on the uptake.

There was silence in the van as we crept along the main road west and the unmistakable shape of a main battle tank revealed itself through the gloom.

The last Ukrainian checkpoint on the edge of Mariupol was only five miles behind us, so this had to be Ukrainian armour.

Cameraman Sean Swan has always been the sharp one. “They’re Russians,” he said, with certainty.

“There’s a white Z on one of the tanks,” confirmed our brilliant producer Natalie Wright.

Sean then proceeded to secretly film an entire report from the back seat of the van.

We had left Mariupol because broadcasting from the city had become virtually impossible for us. No electricity, internet, running water, or fuel.

We had been there for three weeks and all of us had come to admire its citizens. Their friendliness, composure and defiance was something to behold.

Mariupol has a large Greek community and Athens had tried to get assurances that a convoy led by their Consul would be granted safe passage out.

There were about 30 vehicles carrying a ragtag of diplomats, Greek citizens and foreign journalists.

The Consul’s first big challenge of the day was to talk us through the column of Russian tanks. He was calm and consummate, and would be a reassuring leader throughout this day.

Initially the soldiers appeared relaxed, but suddenly something spooked them.

The turret of the lead tank turned our way. We were literally looking down the barrel. Then soldiers knelt and aimed their rifles at our convoy. My brain wasn’t quite so foggy any more.

Luckily things calmed down and the Russian soldiers approached our vehicle.

They were greeted with big smiles and cheery hellos. Sean and I got out and opened the boot. One of the Russians pointed at four cases which we dutifully put on the tarmac and opened.

They rummaged a bit and then nodded. We were free to proceed.

The Russian column stretched a long way down the road. Dozens of tanks, armoured personnel carriers and lorries were parked either side. There were hundreds of soldiers. One gestured that he needed cigarettes. But we weren’t stopping for anyone.

The next hurdle was to find a passable road that would take us back into Ukrainian held territory.

First we went west. It was a good road, but suddenly part of it was missing. A bridge had been destroyed. Turn around.

Down a minor road. The crack of rifle fire. Turn around.

We were burning up valuable diesel and getting nowhere. The spectre of having to return to battered Mariupol was looming larger.

At the fourth time of asking we found a viable way out. First we tip-toed. The convoy stopped frequently to wait for stragglers and to assess the danger posed by the sound of battle further ahead.

Then we began to speed up. We passed burning houses, swerved to avoid the detritus of battle, got through a second Russian convoy and reached the point of no return. The sun would soon set. Time to floor it.

With half an hour until curfew we reached the relative safety of somewhere I can’t spell.

The hotel has electricity, running water and wi-fi.

When the sirens sounded, concerned staff ran to our rooms insisting we go downstairs to take cover in the basement.

We thanked them and refused point blank. We had work to do, we told them.

They implored once more.

“We’ve just come from Mariupol,” I reasoned.

That gave them pause. Then their nods meant fair enough, you need to tell the world.",https://www.itv.com/news/2022-03-03/the-moment-a-russian-tank-aims-at-itv-news-car-in-last-convoy-out-of-mariupol

MUKACHEVO, Ukraine — Russia has sent nearly all its assembled combat power into Ukraine and on Thursday unleashed some of the most intense fighting since the invasion began, with local officials pleading for help as ground troops seized or encircled strategically important southern cities. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow’s mission was “going according to plan and in full compliance with the timetable,” despite widespread agreement among Western military analysts that the invasion had been slowed by unexpectedly fierce Ukrainian resistance.

Amid an ongoing exodus of people across the country, Ukraine and Russia said they had agreed to temporary local cease-fires to create “humanitarian corridors” so civilians can be evacuated and food and medicine can be delivered. But the cease-fires would not apply everywhere, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said — and logistical details remained unclear.

Kherson, among the first Ukrainian cities to be encroached upon by Russian forces, was running out of medicines and is facing disaster within days if a humanitarian corridor isn’t established, according to the secretary of the city council, Galina Luhova. “People are in a panic, people are tense, people are frightened just to the core of their souls,” she said.

Reports from other cities in Ukraine’s south told a story of increasing desperation as communications and transport routes were cut off and supplies dwindled. The mayor of Mariupol said a Russian siege and hours of shelling that battered rail links and bridges had cut off water, power and food supplies. The mayor of Odessa, a major port on the Black Sea, said the population was preparing to mount a defense amid unverified reports that a large fleet of Russian warships was heading toward the waters off the coast.

“Who are you saving us from?” Mayor Gennady Trukhanov said in a video posted online, using an expletive as he addressed Russian leaders who have said the purpose of the invasion is to save ethnic Russians and Russian-language communities in Ukraine.

“Our job today is to act so that every meter of our Odessa land is under control of us, Odessians,” Trukhanov told reporters, according to a separate video posted to his Facebook page.

Ukrainian officials said early Friday that Russian shelling had caused a fire to break out at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine — Europe’s largest. A government official told the Associated Press that elevated levels of radiation had been detected, but the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog, later said the blaze had not affected “essential” equipment and that Ukraine’s regulator reported no change in surrounding radiation levels. The agency said on Twitter that it was “in contact with Ukrainian authorities” about the situation at the plant, which provides about a quarter of Ukraine’s power generation.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an emotional video posted to his Telegram channel on Thursday that 16,000 foreigners had volunteered to fight for Ukraine against the Russian invasion in what he referred to as an “international legion.”

This week, Ukraine temporarily lifted visa requirements for foreign volunteers who wished to enter the country and join the fight against Russian forces. In Washington, two men arrested with firearms near the Ukrainian Embassy told police they had driven from Indiana to volunteer for battle, law enforcement officials said.

A senior U.S. defense official told reporters that 90 percent of the combat power Russia had assembled outside Ukraine was now within the country — up from 80 percent on Tuesday. More than 150,000 troops, along with tanks, aircraft, personnel carriers and missile launchers had been massed on the border in recent weeks under the pretext of training exercises.

The capital city, Kyiv, and Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv — as well as the northern city of Chernihiv — have come under fierce air, missile and artillery attack but remain in Ukrainian hands, according to local officials and assessments from Britain, which defense analysts say has substantial intelligence capabilities in the region.

A large explosion lit up the night sky in Kyiv in the early hours of Thursday, local time, according to video footage verified by The Washington Post. The blast, which was captured by a camera in the city’s southeastern neighborhoods, apparently took place in a region far west of the city center.

The Pentagon said Russia had fired nearly 500 missiles of all sizes since last week, including in population centers. A majority were launched from inside Ukraine, often with mobile launchers, but about 160 have come from inside Russia and 70 from Belarus, a U.S. defense official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the Pentagon’s current assessments. Another 10 were launched from the Black Sea.

“They’ve showed a willingness to hit civilian infrastructure on purpose,” the official said, adding that the strikes also appeared to deliberately target government and media operations.

The official said the Pentagon could not verify reports of the use of cluster munitions, which often fail to explode initially but can detonate if disturbed on the ground, extending their harm to civilians long after the missile delivering them is fired. Amnesty International said it has assembled evidence that cluster munitions were fired indiscriminately in Kharkiv, killing and injuring civilians.

In a sign of how the conflict has heightened regional tensions, the U.S. and Russian militaries have established a special line to communicate with one another, two U.S. defense officials said Thursday. President Biden has promised no U.S. troops will be deployed to Ukraine, and the line is intended to ensure there are no miscalculations or accidents between Russians and U.S. troops located in bordering countries, said the defense officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.

Such lines have been used in the past, including in Syria, to keep open communication, avoid collisions among aircraft and prevent incidents that could spiral into greater conflict. The opening of the communication line was first reported by NBC News.

The White House announced new sanctions Thursday on dozens of Russian oligarchs and elites, the latest effort to cripple the Russian economy in retaliation for the invasion. The sanctioned individuals include Putin’s press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, as well as 19 oligarchs and 47 associates and family members. Biden said the sanctions effort has had “a profound impact already.”

Also on Thursday, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced it will offer temporary protected status to approximately 75,000 Ukrainians who were in the United States by Tuesday, allowing them to live and work in the country for eight months without fear of deportation.

The European Union is offering temporary protections to Ukrainians fleeing the Russia invasion; the exodus already exceeds a million people.

Britain’s Ministry of Defense said Thursday morning that the massive Russian military convoy that has been poised north of the Ukrainian capital remains more than 18 miles away from Kyiv’s center. The 40-mile line of armored vehicles, tanks and towed artillery had drawn within 20 miles of the city center on Monday, satellite images captured by U.S. firm Maxar Technologies showed. But since then, it has made little progress, the British said, with delays stemming in part from “Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestions.”

A Western intelligence official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive assessments, said the slowdown may also be strategic. “It could also be that they’re waiting to mask the proper numbers and types of forces around the city itself. This is the logistics train that will support them, so maybe it’s more of a pause, so that the siege can be laid properly, more so than it is a gross reflection of some mismanagement,” the official said.

“There’s plenty of mismanagement,” the official added. “But I think we shouldn’t over or underestimate many things at this point.”

Putin and French President Emmanuel Macron held a call on Thursday that did not deliver any major diplomatic breakthroughs and left Macron convinced that “the worst is yet to come,” according to a senior French official. In the terse exchange initiated by Moscow, Macron “called on Vladimir Putin not to lie to himself,” the official said.

The Kremlin’s state-controlled news service cited Putin as having told Macron that Russia’s mission in Ukraine “will be fulfilled in any case.”

The latest casualty estimates provided by the Russian government were from Wednesday, when officials said 498 service members have died in the Ukraine war and 1,597 have been wounded. Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said 572 service members have been captured.

There was no way to verify the toll, and the Western intelligence official said that “it’s fair to say that’s almost certainly a very large undercount.”

Kherson, a city of roughly 290,000 people, is inundated with Russian equipment and soldiers, but Moscow’s forces have yet to take control of the city, said Luhova, the city council secretary. Large portions of the city have been cut off from water and electricity, and residents have begun running out of food, she said.

According to eyewitness accounts, Kherson was one of the first cities to fall to Moscow’s forces, though Ukraine’s Defense Ministry has not confirmed its capture.

Officials in Mariupol said Thursday that the southern coastal city was still under Ukrainian control but was completely surrounded by Russian troops.

“They impede the supply of food, create a blockade for us,” Mayor Vadym Boychenko said in a Telegram post from the city council. He said people could not leave the city because of the damage to trains and bridges but that his team was trying to secure a safe corridor to bring in supplies or help evacuate residents.

The Pentagon has pointed to Russian operations in southern Ukraine as their most successful, in part because of logistical support Russia has established in Crimea, a former Ukrainian territory Russia occupied and annexed in 2014.

During an attack early Friday on the southeastern city of Enerhodar, home to Europe’s largest nuclear power complex, a fire broke out in one of the six reactors. Hours later, authorities reported that the blaze had been extinguished, radiation levels remained normal and the complex was in the hands of Russian forces — whom Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had beseeched to stop targeting the plant, for fear of a nuclear nightmare.

“Only urgent action by Europe can stop the Russian troops,” Zelensky said in an emotional video speech. “Do not allow the death of Europe from a catastrophe at a nuclear power station.”

Ukraine’s nuclear regulator said the agency’s staff was inspecting the compartment of Reactor No. 1 at the Zaporizhzhia plant for damage. The agency said on Facebook it was important that the plant maintain the capacity to cool nuclear fuel in order to avoid a disastrous meltdown.

International nuclear authorities expressed concern but not panic even as the fire triggered phone calls between Zelensky and President Biden and other world leaders.

As Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine shuddered into a second week, the full extent of a European refugee crisis on a scale not seen since World War II was coming into focus. An estimated 1 million Ukrainians — half of them children — have sought refuge outside the country, the United Nations and humanitarian organizations report.

The total number of those displaced internally and externally could swell to a staggering 10 million, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.

Despite a tentative agreement Thursday by Ukrainian and Russian negotiators to set up safe corridors in some locales to allow humanitarian aid in and civilians out, the ferocity of the fighting has been escalating daily.

Russian forces unleashed a fresh barrage of artillery fire, rockets and air attacks Thursday on Mariupol, a strategic city of about 430,000 people in southeastern Ukraine, on the Sea of Azov near the Russian border, news reports said. Hundreds were feared dead in attacks that crumbled buildings and left civilians cowering in terror.

“We cannot count the number of victims there, but we believe at least hundreds of people are dead,” Mariupol’s deputy mayor, Serhiy Orlov, told the BBC. “We cannot go in to retrieve the bodies. My father lives there. I cannot reach him. I don’t know if he is alive or dead.”

The start of the onslaught against Mariupol coincided with Russia’s capture Wednesday of Kherson, at the mouth of the Dnieper near the Black Sea, which became the first major city to fall and indicated Russia’s intensifying attacks on civilians.

Invading troops have begun moving west from Kherson toward Mykolaiv, another major Black Sea port and shipbuilding center, and amphibious landing vessels were reported to be heading toward the historic seaside city of Odessa.

A spokesman for the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which supplies about a quarter of the country’s power, told Ukrainian television that firefighters could not reach the complex because Russian troops were shooting at them.

He said that the fire was in a reactor that is under renovation and not operating, but that it contains nuclear fuel.

Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, tweeted: “If it blows up, it will be 10 times larger than Chornobyl! Russians must IMMEDIATELY cease the fire, allow firefighters, establish a security zone!”

The International Atomic Energy Agency said on Twitter that Ukrainian regulators had reported normal radiation levels around the plant.

The U.S. Department of Energy activated its nuclear incident response team as a precaution.

The Russian advances in the south came as Russian and Ukrainian representatives agreed on a mechanism for establishing humanitarian corridors, which would be coupled with temporary local cease-fires.

But few are holding out hope that the negotiations will be able to halt the biggest ground war in Europe in more than 75 years. Putin demands that Ukraine demilitarize and declare neutrality, and more broadly, the Russian leader has made clear his wish to reestablish Russia’s sphere of influence across the former Eastern Bloc, rearranging Europe’s entire security architecture.

Some of those who have been in direct contact with Putin paint a dire picture of the Russian leader’s possible intentions in Ukraine.

After a 90-minute phone call Thursday between French President Emmanuel Macron and Putin, a senior French official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity offered a bleak assessment: “Without making a prediction, we should expect the worst is yet to come.”

Western allies continued to try to force Putin from his course with new punitive steps. The White House said Thursday that the U.S. would impose sanctions reaching into Putin’s inner circle, targeting eight members of Russia’s elite, including Putin’s official spokesman. The Biden administration will also place visa restrictions on 19 oligarchs and their family members.

Although Ukrainians have put up staunch resistance over eight days of fighting, reports on the ground were grim. Russian troops have now surrounded Mariupol on all sides and could capture the port at any time, Ukrainian officials acknowledged.

“Our internal forces are very brave, but we are surrounded by the Russian army,” Orlov, the deputy mayor, told CNN. In Washington, a senior Defense official told reporters that the Pentagon believes that 90% of the forces that Putin assembled for the invasion are now in Ukraine.

The capture of Mariupol would bridge the gap between territories held by Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine and Russian soldiers in the southern peninsula of Crimea, which Moscow annexed by force in 2014.

Along with the seizure of other coastal cities, it would give Russia control over the rest of southern Ukraine, cutting off the country’s access to key shipping routes in the Black Sea and devastating Ukraine economically.

The desperate conditions in Mariupol and elsewhere paint a dire picture for Ukraine of an overwhelmingly powerful military foe willing to launch more attacks on civilian targets, including schools and hospitals. A prosecutor for the International Criminal Court says senior Russian leaders are being investigated for war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide.

Cities such as Kyiv and Kharkiv have come under devastating fire as the Russian military attempts to regain the initiative after its initial assault failed to achieve a rapid victory. The Ukrainian State Emergency Service has said more than 2,000 civilians have been killed in the invasion.

Kyiv was hit by two massive explosions that lighted up the sky Wednesday evening and before dawn Thursday. One of the blasts damaged the central train station, a key transit point for thousands fleeing the capital, but packed trains were still running on Thursday, ferrying people away from danger.

But while the capital remains under heavy threat, a 40-mile-long column of Russian armored vehicles on Kyiv’s northern outskirts “is still stuck there,” U.S. and British defense officials said Thursday, amid intelligence that the convoy was experiencing fuel and supply shortages, together with sporadic attacks by Ukrainian regular and irregular forces.

Putin insisted that Russian forces were not targeting civilians. “Precision weapons are used to destroy exclusively military infrastructure,” he said, describing any reports otherwise as “elements of an anti-Russian disinformation campaign.”

The Ukrainian president continued to voice defiance.

“One week ago, at 4 a.m., Russia invaded our independent Ukraine, our land,” Zelensky said Thursday in the latest video address aimed at buoying his people and showing them he remains in place and in charge. “The first hours and days ... were extremely difficult, but we were united and therefore strong, and therefore we withstood.”

Western governments, meanwhile, sought to bolster front-line states on Russia’s western flank.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken was visiting Moldova, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia “to underscore our solidarity and determination to hold the Russian and Belarusian governments accountable for their brutal war against Ukraine,” he said in a departure statement Thursday.

British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace, also visiting vulnerable Baltic states, did not mince words about what might lie ahead.

“What we’ve seen in Ukraine is beyond … anybody’s idea of what might happen,” Wallace said at a news conference in Estonia. “Not only has Russia illegally invaded Ukraine, it is now unleashing violence on civilian areas, bombardments and inflicting casualties on potentially thousands of civilians.”

But Wallace said most major population centers remain under the Ukrainian flag.

“They still have not taken control of a number of the big cities,” he said of Russian troops. “They might have entered them; in some cases, they’ve been repelled. But taking control of large cities is a completely different step, and they have not succeeded.”

In the face of international condemnation, including a U.N. General Assembly resolution Wednesday demanding a halt to Moscow’s aggression, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov insisted Thursday that the U.S. and its NATO allies were responsible for provoking the war.

“They are listening to us, but they are not hearing us, and they’re trying to force upon us their own understanding of how Europe should live,” Lavrov said, comparing the U.S. to Napoleon and Hitler in its “goal to subjugate Europe.”

Russia is paying an increasing economic price for its war. The country’s central bank said the main stock exchange would remain closed for the fourth consecutive day Thursday, a move made to prevent a collapse of the Moscow Exchange.

Mariupol has been a key fighting ground as Moscow looks to overturn its 2014 loss when the Russia-backed separatists had failed to capture the city in the Donetsk oblast (region). We explain why Mariupol holds the key to the Russian offensive.

Why is Mariupol significant to Moscow?

Geographically, Mariupol forms a land bridge between Crimea–which Russia annexed in 2014–and Dobass, the separatist-held regions of Ukraine. As of now, the Sea of Azov falls between the Donetsk-Luhansk region and Crimea.

Just a 100-km away from the separatist-held regions, the rebel forces had tried to capture the city in 2014. However, Ukrainian forces reclaimed the region. Then president Petro Poroshenko had declared Mariupol the regional capital of the oblast after Donetsk fell to rebel forces.

In 2016, it also became a ‘city of solidarity’—as termed by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees—welcoming internally displaced people from the contested territories.

Maritime advantage, economic hit

Not just land, capturing Mariupol also gives Russia a maritime advantage. With the fall of Kherson, Russia has already expanded its control over the Black Sea coastline, most of which is dominated by Moscow after it seized Crimea.

Russian troops have also launched attacks on Mykolayiv and Odessa, cities along the Black Sea. However, Ukrainian troops have been able to resist its advances so far.

In the East, much of the coastline along the Sea of Azov is also under Russian territory, barring Mariupol, which is home to one of the largest ports of Ukraine. Melitopol and Berdyansk along Azov were taken over by Russian forces just days after the invasion began, The Guardian has reported.

If Mariupol falls, Russia will control the entire coastline along the Sea of Azov and much of the Black Sea, cutting off Ukraine’s maritime trade.

In 2014, it had lost a third of its Black Sea coastline, access to the Kerch Strait and five of its seaports.

After the annexation, the handling of cargo at Mariupol and Berdyansk fell almost 70 per cent and 50 per cent, respectively, The Financial Times has reported. This resulted in a loss of $400 million for the ports, which was made worse with the opening of the Kerch Strait bridge by Russia in 2018. The bridge can only provide way to smaller ships with a maximum height of 35-meters. And with increasing inspections by Russian authorities, Ukrainian ships are forced to wait nearly five hours to go through.

However, Mariupol continues to account for a fifth of Ukraine’s ferrous metal exports. Along with Berdyansk, it also makes up for 5 per cent of grain exports, according to Bloomberg. It is also home to two of the largest iron and steel plants in Europe — Azovstal and Ilyich. Azovstal has reportedly been damaged by Russian shelling.

Hence, Moscow’s control over Mariupol will be a significant hit to Ukraine’s maritime trade and metal production.

Novorossiya

In 2014, Russian President Vladimir Putin invoked ‘Novorossiya’ (New Russia) while talking to reporters. Novorossiya is a historical term for territories considered to be part of Russia under tsarist rule, which included large parts of southern and eastern Ukraine, such as Odessa, Kharkiv, Kherson, Donetsk and Luhansk.

“The region’s history as part of Russia created an obligation on Moscow to protect its present-day inhabitant,” Putin was quoted as saying by Reuters.

Effectively, controlling Mariupol will put Putin closer to the imagined Novorossiya.

A much-needed victory

Lastly, with the battlefield across northern Ukraine “largely static”, according to the latest update by British military intelligence, a win in Mariupol will be a major morale booster for Russian forces.

On Wednesday, the UK Ministry of Defence said, “Russian forces are attempting to envelop Ukrainian forces in the east of the country as they advance from the direction of Kharkiv in the north and Mariupol in the south.”

This came just a day after US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan called Russia’s invasion a ‘failure’. “Russia intended to accomplish three basic objectives in launching its unprovoked attack against Ukraine: first, to subjugate Ukraine; second, to enhance Russian power and prestige; and third, to divide and weaken the West. Russia has thus far manifestly failed to accomplish all three objectives. In fact, it has thus far achieved the opposite,” Sullivan said.

Moreover, Mariupol is also the headquarter of the Azov regiment, which in 2014 had warded off Russian troops. The Azov fighters, however, are known for harbouring neo-Nazi and far-right views. Incorporated into the National Guard in 2014, Azovs also have a political party—National Corps—and a paramilitary group, National Militia, that has been accused of extremist violence.

Putin called for the “military operation” in Ukraine on the pretext of fighting such neo-Nazi groups. A win over the regiment would arguably buttress his claim. However, the Azov fighters form just a small fraction of the Ukrainian defence.

More than six weeks after the Russian siege began, Ukrainian troops are continuing to fight the vastly superior Russian forces in ferocious battles amid the ruins of what once was a bustling city on the Sea of Azov coast.

The city’s mayor says that an estimated 120,000 people remain in the city, of Mariupol’s pre-war population of about 450,000.

The Ukrainians’ fight against all odds has scuttled Moscow’s designs, tying up significant Russian forces and delaying the start of a planned Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine’s industrial heartland, Donbas. The Kremlin hopes that an attack in the east could reverse the battlefield fortunes for Russia after a humiliating failure of its attempt to quickly storm the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv.

Mariupol has been a key objective for Russia since the start of its invasion on Feb. 24. Capturing the city would allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula that Russia annexed in 2014 and deprive Ukraine of a major port and prized industrial assets.

The giant Azovstal steel mill and other industrial plants have been heavily damaged by the ferocious Russian bombardment that has flattened much of Mariupol, indiscriminately hitting homes, hospitals and other public buildings and killing thousands.

The victims include about 300 people killed in last month’s Russian airstrike on the Mariupol Drama Theater that was being used as a shelter and had the word “CHILDREN” printed in Russian in huge white letters on the pavement outside to ward off aerial attack.

Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko told The Associated Press that at least 21,000 people were killed in Mariupol with bodies “carpeted through the streets.” He said that the Russians deployed mobile cremation equipment to Mariupol to methodically dispose of the victims’ bodies in order to hide the evidence of the massacre and prevent international organizations from documenting “the horror the Russian army is responsible for.”

The discovery of hundreds of bodies of civilians apparently executed by Russian forces in Kyiv’s suburbs after the Russian retreat from the area has fueled global outrage and accusations from Ukrainians and the West that Russia is committing war crimes in Ukraine.

Moscow has deployed fighters from Chechnya, known for their ferocity, to wage street battles in Mariupol. Chechnya’s Moscow-backed leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, has repeatedly boasted on his messaging app channel about defeating Ukrainians in Mariupol, but the fight has continued.

Boychenko said that several Ukrainian units are still fighting the Russians in Mariupol, including the 36th Marine Brigade, the Azov Regiment, some Interior Ministry troops and border guards.

The Azov Regiment, a seasoned volunteer force that is widely considered one of the country’s most capable units, is defending the mammoth Azovstal steel plant that covers an area of nearly 11 square kilometers (over 4.2 square miles). It has taken advantage of the plant’s sprawling network of concrete buildings and underground facilities to repel continuous Russian attacks.

The 36th Marine Brigade was maintaining defensive positions at the Azovmash and Zavod Ilyicha factories until it ran out of supplies and ammunition and made a desperate attempt to break through the Russian blockade earlier this week.

In a post on the brigade’s Facebook page, one of its officers described the unit’s heroic resistance, saying that “for more than a month, the marines have been fighting without replenishing amunition, food and water supplies.” “The wounded accounted for nearly a half of the brigade’s strength, but those who still had their limbs and were capable of walking reported back to duty,” the post said.

Boychenko said that some of the marines managed to join the Azov regiment, while others were captured by the Russians. He didn’t give any numbers.

The Russian military said Thursday that a total of 1,160 Ukrainian marines surrendered this week, a claim that couldn’t be independently verified.

As the Ukrainian troops continue to offer fierce resistance in Mariupol, fears have grown that the exasperated Russians could resort to chemical weapons to deal with the remaining pockets of resistance at the Azovstal plant and other areas of the city.

Eduard Basurin, a Russia-allied separatist official in eastern Ukraine, appeared to call for that Monday, telling Russian state TV that the Russia-backed forces should block all the exits out of the factory and then “use chemical troops to smoke them out of there.” He later said that no chemical weapons were used.

WATCH: What the Biden administration learned from past presidents about military aid in Ukraine

The Azov Regiment claimed Monday, without providing evidence, that a drone had dropped a poisonous substance on its positions but inflicted no serious injuries. A Ukrainian defense official said the attack possibly involved phosphorus munitions.

Ukrainian authorities have said that the Russians have blocked humanitarian convoys from reaching Mariupol, keeping it without food, water and power since the siege started. The Russian troops have turned back buses sent to evacuate residents, but about 150,000 have been able to flee the city in their own vehicles.

Boychenko said that at least 33,500, and, possibly, up to 50,000 Mariupol residents have been taken to “filtration camps” in the separatist-controlled east before being forcibly sent to distant, economically depressed areas in Russia.

Mariupol has seen communications cut since the start of the siege, and as the Russians moved to capture sections of the city they launched radio broadcasts to brainwash the population.

“They unleashed propaganda, telling people that Kyiv and other cities have been captured and they have been abandoned,” Boychenko said.

The continuing fighting in Mariupol has forced the Russian military to keep a significant number of troops in the city, delaying the start of the planned new offensive in eastern Ukraine.

“As long as the street fighting is going on, Russia can’t remove troops from Mariupol and deploy them to other areas, including Donbas,” Oleh Zhdanov, an independent military expert, told the AP.

“The Ukrainian troops in Mariupol are still fulfilling their main task by diverting the Russian forces from other areas. Mariupol remains a major symbol of the Ukrainian resistance.”",https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/mariupol-holds-out-against-russias-siege-a-symbol-of-ukrainian-resistance

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

7,8c40cd9c-ba45-41e8-abaa-e0a8726f64c0,['Liz Cookman'],2022-03-02 00:00:00,"Mariupol and Dnipro, Ukraine – On the morning we intend to leave Mariupol, it’s not yet clear if it’s possible to get out – there are reports the city has been surrounded by Russian forces and artillery attacks reverberate through the grey sky like thunder.

I had been in Mariupol for almost one month, but after Russia crossed the border on February 24, it was not so much a matter of if the port city in eastern Ukraine would be targeted in the advance, but when.

The city is key to President Vladimir Putin’s plans to establish a land corridor between Russia, breakaway territories in the Donbas region, and annexed Crimea. Cargo that passes through the port is key to Ukraine’s economy.

Mariupol’s eastern suburbs, 10km (six miles) from the front line with Russian-backed separatists, have already suffered years of violence, but during the last week, Russian troops have moved in from every direction and the area has been pounded incessantly with rockets and other projectiles.

Each day, the fighting on the outskirts of the city moves closer to the centre, the cracks and booms growing louder.

A school is destroyed. People watch from the window as burning orange flashes fly through the sky, wondering if their building is next.

The city has suffered casualties, although an exact figure is not clear.

At the city’s main hospital, I interview generous-hearted Ukrainians donating blood for the injured.

New military checkpoints spring up seemingly in moments, blocking roads with hastily felled trees, while a petrol station attendant advises my car full of journalists to leave and get far as far away as possible as it hurriedly shuts its doors, presumably expecting an imminent attack.

There is often no electricity, no heat and no internet. Friends I’ve never heard swear before start cursing.

This region speaks mostly Russian, many have relatives in Russia – the killings are a crime that is hard to compute.

Ukrainians now face a terrible choice: stay and face weeks, perhaps months, of deadly assault, or try to leave for the uncertainty of dangerous open roads and a life displaced.

But trains and buses out of Mariupol have stopped and for many, the window to escape safely may have already gone.

A translator, sick of nights in dusty bunkers, plans to come with us if we go but then can’t bring herself to leave her parents behind. They don’t have the paperwork they might need later, especially if they need to flee the country, and her father is of fighting age – it’s uncertain if he can travel.

On Friday, a soldier at the front sends me a message: “We barely got out alive yesterday. We have pulled back.”

“Welcome Russia!” a neighbour cried into the night sky as we debated whether to stay or go. What happens in a city surrounded by enemy troops if some residents want them there, but most do not? Stories of Russian saboteurs abound across the country, but are even more potent in a city that was once considered pro-Russian.

It was another uncertainty we did not want to risk.

As we drive out of the city on Sunday, I and a small group of two photographers, including Emre Caylak – also working for Al Jazeera, and a radio journalist, notice that a mural of the trident coat of arms of Ukraine has been crossed out with graffiti.

We are privileged in having the means to escape; we drive out from the northeast and are allowed to leave, even though there are rumours that Ukrainians who tried to were not. “Watch out for mines,” the checkpoint guard soldier tells us.

The landscape of flat, open agricultural fields feels both a comfort – we can see for hundreds of metres all around as – and a curse for its lack of shelter. The road is littered with burned-out cars, churned up mud from the tracks of tanks and all along soldiers are setting up new checkpoints.

As we pass cities, troops prepare to defend them, scrambling to dig new trenches. On the outskirts, villagers take down road signs to confuse Russian troops. Iron anti-tank barriers known as Czech hedgehogs are scattered everywhere.

To our south, Melitopol and Berdyansk have reportedly been occupied by Russian forces. We are heading for industrial hub Dnipro, approximately 300km (186 miles) from Mariupol on the western side of the Dneiper river that marks the start of eastern Ukraine.

So far the city has mercifully seen less violence than Kharkiv to its north, where attacks – allegedly with cluster bombs – have been called war crimes by Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

However, some military experts believe there is a plan to take cities to the north and south of Dnipro, before sweeping down to cut off the east up to the border with Russia.

Passing through the country, it is clear to us that nowhere is safe in this war, and everywhere is the front line.

As we skim the city of Tomak, we get a call to say it has likely been occupied. The stress of the situation has everyone paranoid – we stop for coffee and to take a picture and a woman demands we show our ID.

In Zaporizhzhia, we get petrol and there’s a news flash that the Russians are moving in on the city’s nuclear power station. Nowhere did we see more frantic attempts to fortify the city than here.

Arriving into Dnipro after hours of travelling and checkpoints, we can finally breathe again. It is a city of grand Soviet buildings and open streets, and while Mariupol felt suspicious and stifling, Dnipro has united in efforts to coordinate humanitarian aid to others.

We see people collecting food, water, clothing, and even making Molotov cocktails to throw at tanks.

Identities change before your eyes, as people acquire new labels that could define their future: volunteer, refugee, soldier, widow.

It’s only days since the start of this terrible war, but it feels like it has been months. Time has become lost in a stream of phone notifications, each one could bring news of more disaster, while every loud noise is a possible attack.

Days no longer have the same structure – instead of time for work and time for rest, they are divided by sirens and no sirens; before curfew and after.

Makeshift bomb shelters in places that long served as storage for broken furniture and knick-knacks are now a lifeline, with residents filing in to check long-ignored electricity cables and put in light bulbs, and to sweep away huge, draping cobwebs and years of accumulated dust.

By 9:30pm on our first night in Dnipro, the sirens sound for the sixth time and we head into our hotel’s shelter again.

Ceasefire call by Russia a ‘fiction’: Writer

A UK-based author says Russia’s announcement of the ceasefire in Mariupol was a “fiction”, adding Moscow was following a “script” similar to its actions in Syria.

“Russia has repeated a very familiar script to set these [ceasefires] up and entice people into leaving the city into evacuating through what was supposed to be a safe corridor, and then tried to shell them in order to bottleneck as many people as possible into an area that was going to come under attack,” Keir Giles of the Conflict Studies Research Centre in London told Al Jazeera from Northamptonshire.

“Fortunately, it appears that Ukrainian authorities – who already let’s not forget have been at war with Russia for eight years, and probably knew what was coming, held back from actually launching all of their civilian evacuees down this humanitarian corridor,” he added.

“So a lot of those higher-end Russian capabilities that we would expect, we haven’t actually seen used yet. It doesn’t, of course, mean that they won’t ever be used, and we are beginning to see some indications of Russians using greater tactical airpower,” he said.

“And of course, as is rightly getting a lot of attention, using possible thermobaric munitions and rocket artillery against civilian targets in Kharkiv and elsewhere.”

‘Putin won’t stop’: Ex-Russian deputy foreign minister

Andrei Fedorov, a former deputy foreign minister of Russia, told Al Jazeera Russian President Vladimir Putin’s objective is to surround Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, and then give President Volodomyr Zelenskyy an ultimatum.

“He declared a very clear goal that Ukraine, as it is today, should be changed,” Fedorov said from Moscow. “I’ve known him for many years, he will not stop. Most probably, in the next 5-6 days, the military operation will be extended to much more territory, including Odesa,” he predicted.

“The Russian army will surround Kyiv, and then there will be a kind of ultimatum for maybe 24 hours for Zelenskyy to resign, for the government to resign, to declare something like an interim government or something like this, because from military point of view, it’s very dangerous to start a military attack on Kyiv – it can bring a lot of damages,” Fedorov added.

“Also, let’s not forget that Kiev is playing a very important role in Russia’s history; in Russia it’s called the mother of all Russian cities.”

Stoicism is Kyiv’s new normal

Kyiv, Ukraine – “If you switch off the emotions, the scale of damages is minimal,” a woman who lives on the 15th floor of a new apartment building in central Kyiv, told Al Jazeera.

Over the past week, she saw the fires and plumes of smoke caused by Russian cruise missiles that hit the central railway station in Ukraine’s capital, as well as a television tower and a residential building.

Her own building towers over Kyiv and seems as vulnerable as a wheat stalk in a storm. Her family slept in their “bathroom shelter” for several days.

March 2, 4:30 pm EST

Russian forces resumed offensive operations in support of their envelopment of Kyiv on March 2 but made few territorial advances. Russian forces resumed offensive operations on both axes of advance toward Kyiv after largely pausing for 72 hours to reinforce and resupply their troops north and west of Kyiv. Russian operations to envelop Kyiv are Moscow’s main effort. Russian troops are also undertaking three supporting efforts, one to seize Kharkiv, one to take Mariupol and secure the “land bridge” connecting Rostov-on-Don to Crimea, and one to secure Kherson and set conditions for a drive west toward Mykolayiv and Odesa. The three supporting operations were active in the last 24 hours; Russian forces likely captured Kherson and began a bombardment of critical civilian infrastructure in Mariupol in a likely effort to force the city to surrender while making few territorial gains in Kharkiv.

The Russian attack on Kyiv likely consists of a main effort aimed at enveloping and ultimately encircling the city from the west and a supporting effort along the axes from Chernihiv and Sumy to encircle it from the east. The long Russian column of combat and logistics vehicles observed north of Kyiv in the last 48 hours is likely now supporting attacks directly into the city from positions Russian forces maintain in Kyiv’s northwestern outskirts. However, Russian forces are more likely to prioritize the envelopment/encirclement in the coming days, rather than a direct assault into the city.

Russian forces resumed frontal assaults on Kharkiv on March 2 and continued using area-attack weapons, dramatically increasing the damage to civilian infrastructure and civilian casualties. Russian ground forces appear to be conducting another frontal assault on Kharkiv from the northeast rather than enveloping the city and will likely face protracted Ukrainian resistance.

Russian forces in the south likely secured Kherson, began bombarding civilian infrastructure in Mariupol in a likely attempt to force the city to surrender without a direct assault, and appear to be holding their positions south of Zaporizhya. Russian forces will likely resume offensive operations towards Mikolayiv in the next 24 hours but do not appear to pose an imminent danger to Odesa. Russian forces likely seek to force Mariupol to capitulate by destroying critical civilian infrastructure and killing civilians to create a humanitarian catastrophe – an approach Russian forces have repeatedly taken in Syria.[1] A Russian drive north through or near Zaprozhya to cut off Ukrainian forces fighting along the line of contact appears very unlikely in the next 24-72 hours.

Russian forces are receiving needed supplies and reinforcements that may facilitate much more rapid and effective operations in the coming 24-72 hours. The Russian effort around Kyiv remains poorly organized, however, with elements of many different battalions combined into what seem to be ad hoc groupings rather than operating under standing regiment or brigade headquarters. The initial errors in the Russian force composition and organization in Belarus and western Russia that ISW has previously reported on, which contributed to Russian logistical and operational failures around Kyiv, will be difficult to remedy quickly and will likely continue to cause friction and reduce the effectiveness of Russian operations even as supply issues are addressed and reinforcements come into the fight.[2] It remains too early to evaluate the likely effective combat power the added Russian troops will bring.

Key Takeaways

Russian forces resumed offensive operations against Kyiv’s western outskirts on March 2 after pausing for resupply February 27-March 1 but failed to secure any additional territory.

Russian forces launched offensive operations in Zhytomyr Oblast, expanding their envelopment of Kyiv further west than ISW previously assessed—likely to outflank stronger-than-anticipated Ukrainian resistance and limited Ukrainian counterattacks in Kyiv’s outskirts.

Russian forces renewed advances towards northeastern Kyiv on March 2, reaching a line approximately 65km from the city center on that axis.

Russian forces assaulted central Kharkiv and continued to heavily bombard the city on March 2.

Russian forces fully encircled Mariupol as of March 2 and are conducting a deliberate campaign to destroy critical civilian infrastructure and residential areas in a likely attempt to force the city to surrender.

Russian forces continued to reduce pockets of Ukrainian resistance in Kherson on March 2 and will likely secure the city in the next 24 hours if they have not done so already.

Russian forces are engaged in four primary efforts at this time:

Main effort—Kyiv (comprised of three subordinate supporting efforts);

Supporting effort 1—Kharkiv;

Supporting effort 2—Mariupol; and

Supporting effort 3—Kherson and advances westward.

Main effort—Kyiv axis: Russian forces resumed offensive operations against Kyiv’s western outskirts on March 2 but failed to secure any additional territory.[3] Russian forces additionally launched offensive operations in Zhytomyr Oblast, expanding their envelopment of Kyiv deeper west than ISW previously assessed, likely to outflank stronger-than-anticipated Ukrainian resistance and limited Ukrainian counterattacks in Kyiv’s outskirts. Russian forces additionally successfully renewed advances toward Kyiv along the Chernihiv axis on March 2. Russian operations on the Kyiv axis consist of a main effort aimed at enveloping and ultimately encircling the city from the west and supporting efforts along the Chernihiv and Sumy axes to encircle it from the northeast and east.

Subordinate Main Effort along The West Bank of The Dnipro

Russian forces began establishing forward logistics camps in Borodyanka, Katyuzhanka, and Gavronshchyna to support this axis of advance on March 2, likely drawing from the convoys observed in northern Ukraine on February 28 and March 1. [4] ISW is unable to assess the overall combat power Russia may have additionally deployed at this time.

ISW is unable to assess the overall combat power Russia may have additionally deployed at this time. Russian forces steadily advanced into the northwest outskirts of Kyiv to a line extending through Horenychi, Hostomel, and Demidiv, approximately 30-40km from the city center. [5] Ukrainian forces repelled assaults on Demydiv and Irpin as of noon local time on March 2. [6] Kyiv’s regional administration reported that Ukrainian forces control all of Bucha as of 9:00 am local time on March 2, and social media depicted several destroyed Russian vehicles in the area following a failed assault. [7] Russian forces have not yet advanced south of Horenychi, roughly parallel east-west with central Kyiv. Russian forces continued to shell residential areas and inflict civilian casualties on March 2. [8] Russian forces will likely continue to assemble supplies to resume assaults on northern Kyiv in the next 24-48 hours.

Kyiv’s regional administration reported that Ukrainian forces control all of Bucha as of 9:00 am local time on March 2, and social media depicted several destroyed Russian vehicles in the area following a failed assault. Russian forces have not yet advanced south of Horenychi, roughly parallel east-west with central Kyiv. Russian forces continued to shell residential areas and inflict civilian casualties on March 2. Russian forces will likely continue to assemble supplies to resume assaults on northern Kyiv in the next 24-48 hours. Russian forces may be attempting a deeper envelopment of Kyiv from the west than ISW previously assessed, attacking into Zhytomyr Oblast. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that up to three Russian battalion tactical groups (BTGs) from the 5th Combined Arms Army are active at an unspecified location in Zhytomyr Oblast. Russia’s envelopment of Kyiv has previously only extended as far west as Makariv, approximately 60km west of Kyiv, which Ukraine’s 14th Mechanized Brigade recaptured on March 2. [9] Russia may assess it necessary to conduct a deeper envelopment further west of Kyiv to retain the ability to conduct operational maneuvers if Ukrainian forces retain the capability to conduct local counterattacks closer to Kyiv. An envelopment or encirclement so far from central Kyiv would require considerable Russian combat power to complete and to maintain against Ukrainian counterattacks. ISW is unable to assess whether Russia has concentrated enough combat power north of Kyiv to complete such an operation.

ISW is unable to assess whether Russia has concentrated enough combat power north of Kyiv to complete such an operation. The Ukrainian Air Force reportedly remains active over Kyiv. The Ukrainian General Staff claimed two Ukrainian Mig-29s shot down two Russian SU-35s over Kyiv the night of March 1. [10]

Russian efforts within and in the immediate vicinity of Kyiv have reportedly relied on saboteurs and reconnaissance elements, often out of uniform or wearing Ukrainian uniforms, rather than on attacks by regular combat forces. ISW cannot confirm any new developments in central Kyiv on March 2.

Subordinate Supporting Effort—Chernihiv Axis

Russian forces continued to shell Chernihiv but do not appear to have launched assaults on the bypassed city as of March 2. Chernihiv Mayor Vladyslav Atroshenko called on residents to prepare for possible urban warfare and organize round-the-clock patrols on March 2. [11] Russian forces continued to shell Chernihiv, including residential areas, on March 2. [12] Chernihiv is an important road junction on the Desna River, and Russian forces may intend to capture rather than bypass it to open up the arterial highway leading southwest toward Kyiv on the east bank of the Desna.

Chernihiv is an important road junction on the Desna River, and Russian forces may intend to capture rather than bypass it to open up the arterial highway leading southwest toward Kyiv on the east bank of the Desna. Russian forces renewed advances toward northeastern Kyiv on March 2, reaching a line approximately 65km from the city center. The Ukrainian General Staff reported halting up to 17 Russian BTGs in Kozelets, Bobrovytsia, and Makiiv—a front approximately 50km wide. [13] ISW previously incorrectly reported this movement as a likely effort to link up with Russian forces from the Sumy axis. ISW now assesses these forces are advancing directly southwest on Kyiv, not pivoting east from Russia’s existing axis of advance.

ISW previously incorrectly reported this movement as a likely effort to link up with Russian forces from the Sumy axis. ISW now assesses these forces are advancing directly southwest on Kyiv, not pivoting east from Russia’s existing axis of advance. Russia is likely deploying additional forces from Belarus to reinforce the Chernihiv axis. Belarusian social media users filmed a column of Russian light vehicles and trucks equipment marked “V,” likely Russian Naval Infantry from the Pacific Fleet, moving from Gomel, Belarus towards Chernihiv on March 2. [14]

ISW cannot confirm the presence of any Belarusian forces in operations on the Chernihiv axis. Ukrainian Territorial Defense authorities claimed on March 1 that Belarusian combat troops have entered Chernihiv district in support of the Russian offensive. [15]

Subordinate Supporting Effort—Sumy Axis (approximately 115 kilometers from Kyiv)

Ukrainian forces halted Russian advances from Sumy at Nova Basan and Kozelets as of noon local time on March 2. [16]

Russian forces continued operations to reduce pockets of Ukrainian resistance around Sumy on March 2. The Ukrainian General Staff reported Ukrainian forces continue to defend Sumy, Lebedyn, and Okhtyrka from Russian assaults as of 6:00 am local time on March 2. [17] Residents of Konotop, 120km northwest of Sumy, filmed a Russian delegation arriving in the city to demand its surrender. [18]

Supporting Effort #1—Kharkiv: Russian forces resumed assaults on central Kharkiv and continued to heavily bombard the city on March 2. Local Ukrainian authorities reported repelling a Russian assault on the Kharkiv Military Medical Center, near the city center, as of 6:00 pm local time on March 2.[19] Early reports of a Russian airborne landing in the city were likely incorrect. Russian forces continued to deliberately target civilian infrastructure in Kharkiv with MLRS systems, tube artillery, cluster munitions, and Kalibr cruise missiles on March 2, inflicting numerous civilian casualties.[20] The Russian air, artillery, and missile barrage may also be intended to generate panic and reduce the morale of Ukrainian defenders in Kharkiv and elsewhere. It is not likely to achieve that effect. It is too early to evaluate the likelihood that a renewed Russian ground offensive will succeed in taking the city.

Supporting Effort #2—Mariupol: Russian forces fully encircled Mariupol as of March 2 and are conducting a deliberate campaign to destroy critical civilian infrastructure and residential areas in a likely attempt to force the city to surrender. Deputy Mayor of Mariupol Serhiy Orlov informed the BBC that the city is ""near to a humanitarian catastrophe"" after 15 hours of Russian bombardment on March 2.[21] Orlov confirmed Russian forces have advanced to within several kilometers of the city on all sides and are particularly targeting critical civilian infrastructure. Russian forces have taken a similar approach of creating a humanitarian catastrophe by deliberately targeting civilian infrastructure throughout the Russian intervention in the Syrian Civil War. Russian forces claim to have completed the encirclement of Mariupol by land and sea on March 1, though the Ukrainian General Staff claimed Russian forces have failed to “block” Mariupol as of March 2.[22]

Ukrainian forces separately claimed to have launched two separate counterattacks in Donbas that ISW cannot confirm at this time. A Ukrainian Presidential representative stated on March 2 that Ukrainian forces plan to retake Horlivka in Donetsk Oblast, describing it as Ukraine’s first offensive operation “in a different direction” since the war began.[23] The Ukrainian 95th Airborne Brigade assaulted Horlivka on March 1 but has failed to secure it as of 7:00 pm local time on March 2. The Ukrainian 93rd Separate Mechanized Brigade separately claimed to have pushed Russian forces ”back to the Russian border” at an unspecified location on March 1, stating it would later provide pictures and details.[24] ISW cannot confirm this advance as of publication.

Supporting Effort #3—Kherson and West: Russian forces continued to reduce pockets of Ukrainian resistance in Kherson on March 2 and will likely secure the city in the next 24 hours if they have not done so already. A Ukrainian Ministry of Defense Spokesperson stated Ukrainian forces retain control of portions of Kherson city as of 11:00 am local time on March 2.[25] Multiple sources reported elements likely of the 7th Airborne Division and SPETSNAZ units throughout Kherson City on March 1, including a VDV assault on the city SBU building, and Ukrainian forces will likely lose control over the city within the next 24 hours.[26]

Ukrainian forces likely repelled Russian advances towards Mykolayiv on March 2. Ukrainian forces took Russian prisoners at several locations on the outskirts of Mykolayiv.[27] Russian forces will likely consolidate following the capture of Kherson before resuming advances west towards Mykolayiv and Odesa. Russian forces additionally launched limited attacks north toward Zaporizhya on March 2 but did not make territorial advances.[28] Russian forces are likely deprioritizing the axis of advance north from Crimea in favor of operations west towards Miykolayiv and east towards Mariupol.

The White House has asked lawmakers to approve $10 billion in lethal and humanitarian aid for Ukraine as part of a $32.5 billion emergency funding request sent to Capitol Hill as Russia continues its advance on Ukraine.

The request follows weeks of discussions between White House officials and lawmaker about the shape of any potential emergency request, which was expected to focus heavily on Covid-19 needs. But the escalating Russian invasion has dramatically increased the size of the request for Ukraine specifically.

Lawmakers are in the midst of negotiations over a long-term funding deal and face a March 11 deadline to reach an agreement.

The Ukraine funds are expected to be attached to any final deal, but the process remains fluid.

“This request identifies an immediate need for $10.0 billion in additional humanitarian, security, and economic assistance for Ukraine and Central European partners due to Russia’s unjustified and unprovoked invasion,” the formal request sent Wednesday from acting Office of Management and Budget director Shalanda Young to Congressional leadership says.

Young suggested the initial $10 billion request for Ukraine would address “immediate needs” and more funding could be needed.

“Given the rapidly evolving situation in Ukraine, I anticipate that additional needs may arise over time. This funding request is based on the Administration’s best information on resource requirements at this time, and we will remain in touch with the Congress in the coming weeks and months as we assess resource requirements beyond these immediate needs,” she said.

More on the funding request: The detailed request provides $4.8 billion to the Department of Defense, including $1.8 billion for support in the region as US military units support the US European Command and NATO Response Force, $1.3 billion for cybersecurity and other defense support, and $1.8 billion for replenishment of DOD stocks. It also calls for $5 billion for the Department of State and US Agency for International Development (USAID), including $2.8 billion in humanitarian assistance like food and other support, $500 million in military assistance through the Foreign Military Financing program, and $1.8 billion in economic assistance to help “support continuity of government and the resilience of the Ukrainian people, as well as emergent needs in the region.”

The request also provides $21 million for the Department of Commerce to bolster export controls, $30 million for the Department of Energy to provide “technical assistance for electric grid integration,” $59 million for the Department of Justice to support a newly-announced Task Force KleptoCapture to enforce sanctions on Russia and other funding for the Multinational Task Force, and $91 million for the Department of Treasury for sanctions support and IRS criminal investigations, among other expenditures.",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-03-22/h_ca28121f96a8c301d7a87577f3e6cb99
