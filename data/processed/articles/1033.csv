Russia lost 15,000 soldiers in war with Ukraine, says Nato

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Nato) estimates that as many as 15,000 Russian soldiers might have been killed in less than two months of fighting, or the equivalent of all of the Soviet soldiers killed in nine years in Afghanistan. Morale is reportedly incredibly low. In this situation, the conditions are ideal for the Russian military to implode.

Russian War Against Ukraine: Energy Dimension DiXi Group alert (status as of 12:00, April 4) Stop russian nuclear terrorism! Set A2/AD and no-fly zones over Ukraine’s nuclear facilities, impose sanctions on Rosatom! Introduce full embargo on russian oil and gas imports! #StopRussianAggression #StandWithUkraine Summary • The enemy continued to destroy oil depots and fuel storages with rocket attacks, trying to damage logistics and disrupt the sowing campaign. • Despite liberation of the Chornobyl NPP Exclusion Zone from the occupiers, Russia continues to commit acts of nuclear terrorism, keeping contol over the Zaporizhzhia NPP, the biggest plant in Europe. With intensification of shelling in the region, this poses a significant threat. • Over 860,000 consumers did not have electricity supply, and 334,000 consumers remained without gas supply. • According to Bloomberg, this year Russia can earn almost 321 billion USD from energy exports and end the year with a record current-account surplus of 240 billion USD if a full oil and gas embargo is not imposed - these sanction are what Ukraine’s government asks for. Attacks: Kyiv region According to the Kyiv Regional Military Administration, in the settlements of Bucha, Vyshhorod, and Brovary districts liberated from the aggressor, the defense forces are clearing and demining, and humanitarian aid is delivered. After the security controls, operators of public utilities will rebuild critical infrastructure. A special regional monitoring group is working to record the consequences of Russia's aggression and the destruction of civilian infrastructure, as more than 650 facilities have already been damaged. Despite the withdrawal of Russian troops from the Kyiv region, they continued to launch missile strikes on the liberated cities. E.g., on April 3, in the city of Vasylkiv, local headquarters building, training center and college were shelled, with people wounded. Kharkiv region During the day, the Russian troops inflicted 17 strikes on the cities of Kharkiv and Derhachi, reported the Kharkiv Regional Military Administration Head Oleh Syniehubov. As a result of the strikes of the Slobidskyi district, 7 people were killed and 34 - injured, including 3 children. On the morning of April 4, shelling of residential areas continued. The Russian troops fired upon an evacuation convoy heading to a destroyed hospital in the temporarily occupied city of Balakliya, some people were killed. In the Izyum district, active fighting with the occupiers continued. Sumy region The Sumy Region Military Administration Head Dmytro Zhyvytskyi reported that Russian troops began actively retreating from the Sumy region. Work is underway to restore the liberated settlements of the Sumy region. Chernihiv The Ukrainian army liberated the settlements of Kolychivka, Yahidne, and region Ivanivka in the Chernihiv region, where the interchanges on the key road to Chernihiv are located. Due to the destruction of critical infrastructure, there is no district heating in the city; electricity, water and gas supply are partially provided. According to the mayor of Chernihiv Vladyslav Atroshenko, the city is 70% destroyed. Work is underway to restore livelihoods, clear the remnants of the occupying forces and demine territories. Zaporizhzhia According to the Zaporizhzhia Region Military Administration, at night and in region the morning of April 4, the enemy carried out artillery shelling on the town of Komyshuvakha. In addition, as a result of shelling, 9 private houses in the village of Preobrazhenka and residential houses in the city of Orikhiv were damaged. In total, 75 settlements of the Berdyansk, Polohy and Vasylivka districts were completely destroyed or damaged. Due to damage of power lines, pylons and equipment, 27,600 consumers in 93 settlements of the region are without power supply. In the last two days, 17 lines of Zaporizhzhiaoblenergo (10 kV to 150 kV voltage) were damaged. Also, part of Ukrenergo's high-voltage lines remained damaged. In addition, about 4 km of gas distribution pipelines and 4 control points were damaged, with 62,100 consumers in 52 settlements not having gas supply. Mykolaiv According to the mayor of Mykolaiv Oleksandr Sienkevych, on April 3, the region enemy inflicted attacks on residential quarters, with 1 person killed and 11 people hospitalized with injuries. In addition, according to the Mykolaiv Regional Military Administration, the city of Ochakiv was shelled, with killed and wounded reported. On the morning of April 4, the occupiers again fired missiles on the city of Mykolaiv, details were to be established. Kherson region According to the Kherson Regional Military Administration, explosions and shelling are heard throughout the region, especially on the borders with Dnipropetrovsk and Mykolaiv regions. Since the first days of the war, there has been no electricity or water supply in 67 settlements (over 42,000 consumers); help is needed with food and medicine supplies. Ternopil region The Russian troops attacked Ternopil for the first time since the beginning of a full-scale invasion. On April 3, at about 22:20, the enemy conducted a missile attack on a fuel depot, which cannot be used anymore. The Russian Defense Ministry has published a report on the destruction of the fuel depot in Ternopil 2 hours before the rocket attack. In addition, they reported about strikes on fuel depots in the village of Kostiantynivka, Mykolaiv region (no confirmation) and the city of Slavuta, Rivne region (there is no such settlement in the Rivne region, apparently it was the city of Slavuta, Khmelnytskyi region). Odesa region On the morning of April 3, the Russian troops launched a missile strike on the city of Odesa, damaging a fuel depot and a refinery, reported the Odesa Regional Military Administration Head Maksym Marchenko. On the night of April 4, another attack was inflicted on the city: the missiles reportedly did not hit the target, but damaged non-residential buildings. Donetsk region In the last 24 hours, 7 settlements of the Donetsk region, including Mariupol, Avdiivka, Toretsk, Krasnohorivka, Maryinka, Heorhiivka, and Shumy, were fired with multiple launch rocket systems ""Grad"", tanks, artillery and small arms, as the National Police reported. The shelling damaged at least 27 residential facilities, including homes, a school, a kindergarten, with killed and injured civilians. Fierce fighting continued in Mariupol as the Russian troops try to capture the city. Another attempt to evacuate civilians will take place on April 4. The Donetsk Regional Military Administration Head Pavlo Kyrylenko called on all the local residents to leave the region due to the threat of military escalation. Luhansk The Russian enemy continued to launch missile and air strikes on residential region infrastructure aiming to establish control throughout the region, reported the Luhansk Regional Military Administration Head Serhii Haidai. As a result of the shelling of the cities of Severodonetsk, Rubizhne, Lysychansk, and Novodruzhesk, at least 13 facilities were damaged, including 6 private houses and 3 residential buildings, outbuildings, garages, and infrastructure facilities. Russian shell hit the surgical department of a hospital and a church in the city of Rubizhne. The cities of Rubizhne, Popasna, Severodonetsk, and partially the Hirske community and the city of Lysychansk remained completely without water supply. Nuclear and Radiation Safety: As of 09:00 on April 4, all operating NPPs of Ukraine are working stably. 7 of 15 power units are in operation (two units at the Zaporizhzhia and South Ukraine NPPs and three at the Rivne NPP), the other 8 have been put into reserve or stopped for scheduled maintenance. Radiation, fire and environmental conditions at the industrial sites of NPPs and adjacent areas are within standards. Chornobyl NPP Exclusion Zone The Chornobyl site and the territory of the Exclusion Zone are under the full control of Ukraine. The facility and its personnel work as usual. At the same time, Ukraine continues to prepare for the rotation of personnel, which has been operating continuously for the past two weeks. In particular, the issues of ensuring proper safety of personnel are being examined. Zaporizhzhia NPP The Zaporizhzhia NPP and the satellite city of Energodar have been under the control of Russian terrorists for 32 days. The station is serviced by Ukrainian personnel with regular rotation. However, technical solutions are forced to be agreed with the occupiers. At the same time, Energodar has a large number of Russian military and other security forces. The occupiers are increasing information pressure (propaganda) on the local residents and trying unsuccessfully to gain their support and ""interaction"". As of 08:00 on April 4, the radiation background in the Zaporizhzhia region remains relatively stable (10-15 μR/h) and does not pose threat to life and public health. However, regulatory oversight of nuclear and radiation safety directly at the ZNPP site is still not possible. The presence of Russian terrorists at nuclear facilities poses extremely high threats to nuclear and radiation safety on a global scale! Ukraine demands to recognize the actions of Russia and Rosatom as nuclear terrorism, which aims to intentionally violate the security of nuclear power plants, international law and basic human rights with the aim of genocide, ecocide and encroachment on the country's sovereignty. We call on international partners to increase pressure on the IAEA, whose actions may prevent acts of nuclear terrorism by Russia. At the same time, it is critical to minimize Russia's influence on IAEA policies and activities, in particular by removing all Russians from key positions in the Agency's Secretariat and restricting their access to information about Ukraine's nuclear power plants. We also emphasize the need to impose tough sanctions on the management, staff, products, international projects of Rosatom and, in general, the nuclear energy of the aggressor country! Electricity Sector: Power system operation Ukraine's energy system has been successfully operating in trial synchronous mode with the Continental Europe network (ENTSO-E). All types of power plants are in operation. According to DTEK, as of April 3, 1,254,000 tons of coal have been accumulated at the TPPs warehouses, which is quite enough for stable operation. The energy system fully satisfies the current demand for electricity, which has decreased significantly due to Russia's military aggression and seasonal warming. In addition, commercial exports of electricity continued to Poland (190 MW). Electricity market performance Organized segments of the wholesale market (DAM and IDM) operate on a regular basis, are in significant surplus, and their price situation remains relatively stable. As of April 4, the day-ahead market (DAM) price indicators have not changed: Base - 2,223.82 UAH/MWh, Peak - 2,646.25 UAH/MWh, Off-peak - 1,801.40 UAH/MWh, while the weighted average purchase price amounted to 2,353.59 UAH/MWh (+1.5% vs the previous trading day). At the same time, the Base price index on the DAM of Ukraine is approximately 3.2-3.4 times lower compared to the indexes in Hungary, Slovakia and Romania, and 23.5% lower than in Poland. For April 4, the total accepted volume of electricity trade at DAM amounted to 40,018 MWh (+34% vs the previous day). Moreover, the volume of sale bids (138,533 MWh) is almost 3.5 times higher than the volume of purchase bids. On April 3, the weighted average price of electricity on IDM also increased slightly to 2,630.19 UAH/MWh (+0.6% compared to the previous day). The volume of trade on IDM, as of April 3, amounted to 577.1 MWh (-37% vs the previous day). At the same time, the volume of sale bids (23383.8 MWh) exceeded the volume of purchase bids almost 41 times. Disruption and resumption of supply According to the Cabinet of Ministers, as of 20:00 on April 3, 1,170 settlements were disconnected from electricity, with a total of over 860,200 consumers. During the day, electricity supply was resumed to more than 46,000 consumers. Large-scale power supply disruptions and, consequently, active recovery works are taking place: • in the Donetsk region, according to the Cabinet of Ministers, electricity supply to 7,500 consumers was resumed; • in the Zaporizhzhia region, supplies to 2,000 consumers were resumed during the day; 27 settlements remained completely without electricity; • in the Kyiv region, according to the Cabinet of Ministers, supply was resumed to 30,500 consumers; • in the Zhytomyr region, electricity supply to 2 settlements was restored during the day; • in the Kherson region, the supply of Kakhovka, Chulakivka and 8 surrounding villages was restored; • in the Mykolaiv region, according to the Cabinet of Ministers, supply to 2,100 consumers was resumed; • in the Kharkiv region, according to the Cabinet of Ministers, electricity supply was restored to 2,500 consumers; • in the Sumy region, according to the Cabinet of Ministers, supplies to 2,500 consumers were resumed, and partially - to the city of Trostyanets; • there was no up-to-date information on power supply in the Chernihiv and Luhansk regions at the time of the review preparation. Gas Sector: Balance of flows in gas system of Ukraine (excluding transit), as of April 2, mcm Source: GTSOU As of April 2, the total gross gas supply to the Ukrainian market (exit from the system, without transit) amounted to 60.7 mcm, which corresponds to the previous day. The main sources (entry to the system, without transit) were domestic production (47.1 mcm) and withdrawals from storage facilities (13.6 mcm). Gas was not imported from the EU countries. Most of the flows released from the system were directed to gas distribution networks (46.9 mcm) and injection into storage (2.2 mcm). Direct industrial consumers received 2.5 mcm of natural gas. Disruption and resumption of supply The Donetsk, Luhansk, Kyiv, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv, and Kherson regions had the most challenging situation in gas supply. According to the Cabinet of Ministers, as of April 3, more than 334,000 consumers had no access to gas supply. In the Luhansk region, the local DSO announced the termination of gas supply to 1,539 consumers in Novodruzhesk and Maloryazantseve due to enemy shelling. On April 3, there was no information about new damage in the Donetsk region. However, repair works would be impossible in places of existing damage due to hostilities. In the Kherson region, as of April 3, 18,652 consumers did not have gas supply; most of them accounted for the villages Posad-Pokrovske, Pravdyne, Nova Zoria, Oleksandrivka, the city of Tavriysk, and 16 localities of the Beryslav district. Replenishment of LPG reserves for the households’ needs also remained a problem. According to the State Emergency Service of Ukraine, as of April 4, gas supply in the city of Chernihiv was provided partially. At the same time, the local DSO emphasized it did not plan additional disconnections. The lack of gas supply is due to infrastructure damage, which will be eliminated as soon as possible. In the Sumy region, according to the Regional Military Administration, gas supply to the liberated settlements, particularly the city of Trostyanets, is being actively restored. According to the Zaporizhzhia Regional Military Administration, as of April 3, 62,100 consumers in 52 settlements remained with no gas supply. 48 settlements of the Berdyansk and Melitopol districts have been completely disconnected from gas supply due to damage to the pipeline in the Donetsk region. About 4 km of gas distribution networks and 4 distribution points were damaged in the region, while supplies to 7,200 consumers have been restored since the beginning of the fighting. In the Mykolaiv region, the local DSO reported eliminating 3,000 damages to gas supply networks during the entire period of the Russian invasion. Operational information on gas supply in the Kharkiv and Kyiv regions was not available at the time of the review preparation. Countermeasures of Ukrainian Companies and Public Authorities: The Minister of Energy of Ukraine Herman Halushchenko appealed to friends and partners of Ukraine to impose full-scale and tough sanctions to stop Russia's financial flows supporting the war. According to Bloomberg estimates, this year Russia can earn almost 321 billion USD from energy exports and end the year with a record current-account surplus of 240 billion USD if a full oil and gas embargo is not imposed. According to the Minister of Infrastructure Oleksandr Kubrakov statement, in order to successfully implement the sowing campaign at the national level, various options for diversifying fuel imports are being considered, and negotiations are being held with the world's largest suppliers. In addition, Ukraine has received confirmation from the EU on the possibility of starting the process of liberalization of freight transit. The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine has published details on the redistribution of 73.33 billion UAH in the 2022 state budget expenditures for military needs (CoM resolution No.401 of April 1). The main reductions are from the expenditures under control of the Ministry of Social Policy (-32.15 billion UAH, including -3.837 billion UAH for housing benefits and subsidies), the Ministry of Education and Science (-14.8 billion UAH) and the Ministry of Veterans Affairs (-5 billion UAH). As a result of the redistribution, the Ministry of Energy will not be able to meet expenditures of 510.6 million UAH, including almost 103.25 million UAH for the measures on liquidating unpromising coal mines and 322.5 million UAH for the restructuring of the coal industry. To note, the government received the authority to redistribute budget funds under the martial law imposed in Ukraine. The Prozorro public procurement system has developed a new Prozorro+ platform that allows state and local governments, military administrations, humanitarian headquarters and the Armed Forces to quickly find suppliers, as well as sources of procurement funding (donors). The platform allows, in particular, the purchase of fuel, generators, laptops and more. After the contract is concluded, the suppliers have to provide the logistics on their own, until the integration with logistical companies would be provided by the functionality of the platform. To participate, donor organizations have to email Prozorro. Sources: The alerts are developed based on collected, verified, and analyzed information reports of over 100 official sources: ministries, state agencies, network operators, and energy companies. Information was collected only from official websites and official social media accounts.
