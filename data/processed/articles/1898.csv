RIGA, Latvia — Russia accused Ukraine on Friday of escalating their war by carrying out a helicopter attack against a fuel depot in the Russian city of Belgorod, in what appeared to be Ukraine’s first airstrike on Russian soil since the invasion began. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said President Vladimir Putin had been informed about the incident. He said it was “certainly” an escalation, adding, “This is not something that can be perceived as creating conditions comfortable for the continuation of negotiations.”

Ukrainian officials would not confirm or deny the attack, suggesting that it could be a Russian error or even linked to Russian helicopter pilots who had refused to fly into Ukraine. These officials suggested that Moscow should sort out what was happening on its own territory.

Despite this apparent trolling, many military and intelligence analysts said it had been a Ukrainian attack carried out by two Mi-24 helicopters that swept in low; fired rockets at the fuel depot, causing a massive explosion and igniting fuel tank fires; and then departed, still flying at a very low altitude. No casualties were reported.

If the attack is confirmed, it would mark an audacious and risky move by Ukraine, with its forces shifting from a largely defensive posture to a direct airstrike on Russia at a time when the Russian military appears weakened.

Videos of the attack taken from several angles swiftly surfaced on Russian social media, and local governor Vyacheslav Gladkov immediately blamed Ukraine for the strike.

Russian defense ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said the attack happened at about 5 a.m. He said the fuel depot, not far from the border with Ukraine, was a facility that provided fuel for civilian transportation and was not used for military vehicles involved in the war.

“Ukrainian helicopters delivered a missile strike upon a civilian oil storage terminal located on the outskirts of Belgorod,” he told a briefing. “A number of tanks were damaged and caught fire after being hit by missiles.” He added, “The oil terminal has no relation to the Russian armed forces.”

But the British Defense Ministry said in its daily intelligence briefing that the fires at the fuel depot, coupled with explosions earlier in the week at an ammunition depot near Belgorod, could affect the Russian war effort and “will likely add additional short-term strain to Russia’s already stretched logistics chains.” The ministry said that Russian forces encircling Ukraine’s second-largest city Kharkiv, about 40 miles from Belgorod, “may be particularly affected.”

The incident, which occurred as Russian troops are pulling back from several areas of Ukraine, is deeply embarrassing for Russian forces after their poor performance in the war. The Russian campaign was expected to take days but has dragged on, with huge losses of troops and material. Russian military officials have frequently asserted that Ukraine’s air force is almost destroyed.

While acknowledging an attack, Peskov asserted that Russia’s control over its own airspace was not in doubt. “Air superiority in the operation is an absolute fact, it really is. As for what happened, it is up to our law enforcement agencies, not us, to make assessments.”

Hard-line Russian state television anchor Vladimir Solovyov appeared furious about the attack. “Who is responsible for the air defense in the Belgorod direction?” he demanded on his Telegram channel. “Are the locations of the strike helicopters destroyed? When will the security zone for the Belgorod region be established?”

The attack came after Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Tuesday that Ukraine’s air force and air defense network had been “practically destroyed,” adding that “air superiority has been achieved.” He said Russia had accomplished its main goals, including degrading Ukraine’s military.

Rob Lee, of King’s College London’s war studies department, said the attack, most likely carried out by Ukraine, dealt Russia a propaganda blow.

“Shoigu said the war is going well. And days later they do this helicopter attack in Russia proper, this brazen, bold attack, and it’s embarrassing,” Lee said. “It helps break the propaganda being pushed in Russia.”

By striking across the border, Ukrainian forces would be putting the lie to Russian news coverage that says the campaign is going according to plan, Lee said. “But here’s very clear and undeniable proof that the war is not going to plan, that the Ukrainian military is not destroyed, and the Ukrainian air force can still do operations in Russia more than a month into the war.”

When Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba was asked about the allegations of Ukrainian involvement, he said he could not confirm or deny the claim because he did not have all the relevant military information.

Ukraine military spokesman Oleksandr Motuzyanyk said Ukraine did not bear responsibility for catastrophes and mistakes in Russia. He declined to confirm or deny Ukrainian involvement but said it was not the first time Russia had made such accusations.

Ukraine’s operation is defensive, “to resist Russia’s military aggression in the territory of Ukraine,” Motuzyanyk added.

After Russia invaded on Feb. 24, Ukrainian forces initially mounted a defense focused on Kyiv and other major cities, and in recent days have been retaking settlements near the capital and along the front lines.

Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych also insisted that Ukraine was focused on defending itself.

“Maybe someone smoked in the wrong place” and caused the Belgorod fire, he said. “Maybe it was an act by some soldiers who don’t want to fight in Ukraine. Everything that happens on Russian territory is the responsibility of the Russian leadership. All questions to them.”

Lee said this was probably not Ukraine’s first attack on Russian soil. Ukraine has probably fired Tochka-U missiles into Russian territory on several occasions during the war. He dismissed speculation that the helicopter attack may have been a Russian false flag, arguing that Moscow no longer needs to create a pretext for war.

After the Belgorod ammunition depot was rocked by explosions earlier this week, Russian media initially said the blasts appeared to have been caused by firing from the Ukrainian side, but officials later blamed the explosions on a fire on the premises. Lee said it may have been caused by a missile from Ukraine.

The latest incident risks undermining progress in talks between the two sides aimed at reaching a peace deal — now at a delicate stage — after Ukraine offered concessions to Russia on Tuesday in return for a military withdrawal.

Russian negotiators announced Tuesday that Moscow’s forces would de-escalate their combat operations near Kyiv and Chernihiv to “build trust,” focusing their fight on eastern Ukraine. The announcement caused outrage among prominent hard-line state television presenters and pundits, and on social media.

But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he did not trust Russia’s announcement of a de-escalation, telling Ukrainians in one of his regular addresses Thursday, “We don’t believe anyone, not a single beautiful phrase.” U.S. officials have also been skeptical of Moscow’s announcement, seeing it as a sign that Russia is probably taking time to regroup and reorganize its attack.

The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making “the most important decision of their life -- to fight.”

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.”

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the major developments on Russia's invasion, how Kyiv is fighting back, the plight of civilians, and Western reaction. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.

Zelenskiy noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.”

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

The defence ministry had said earlier on Thursday that the Soviet-era ship had been badly damaged by the fire, which Ukraine said was a result of its missile strike.

Putin tells Europe: You still need Russian gas but we’re turning east

President Vladimir Putin has said that Moscow would work to redirect its energy exports eastward as Europe tries to reduce its reliance on them, adding that European nations would not be able to ditch Russian gas immediately.

While the EU debates whether to slap sanctions on Russian gas and oil and member states seek supplies from elsewhere, the Kremlin has been forging closer ties with China, the world’s top energy consumer, and other Asian countries.

“The so-called partners from unfriendly countries concede themselves that they won’t be able to make do without Russian energy resources, including without natural gas, for example,” Putin told a televised government meeting.

“There is no rational replacement [for Russian gas] in Europe now.”

The British Ministry of Defence has said the Ukrainian towns of Kramatorsk and Kostiantynivka were likely targets of “indiscriminate attacks”, as Russian forces prepare to stage a new offensive in the east of the country.

“Urban centres have faced repeated indiscriminate attacks from Russia throughout the conflict,” the ministry said in its latest intelligence update, adding that the two towns were likely to face “similar levels of violence”.

Ukraine’s defence of the port city of Mariupol is “currently tying down significant numbers of Russian troops and equipment,” it said on Twitter, and an offensive in the east will “require significant force levels”.

Reports of ‘Ukrainian women feeling at risk from male sponsors’ in UK: UN refugee agency

The United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) has expressed concern over the potential exploitation of Ukrainian women in relation to a UK scheme that allows British residents to house Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion.

The agency said it was aware of an increasing number of reports of Ukrainian women feeling at risk from male sponsors, and that it believed women and mothers with children should be matched with couples or families rather than with single men.

“Matching done without the appropriate oversight may lead to increasing the risks women may face, in addition to the trauma of displacement, family separation and violence already experienced,” the UNHCR said in a statement.

The British government introduced the “Homes for Ukraine” scheme last month, allowing Britons to sponsor Ukrainians and provide them somewhere to live for a minimum of six months.

US to expand intelligence provision for Ukraine’s fight in the east

The US plans to step up the intelligence it provides Ukraine so its forces can target Russia’s military units in Donbas and Crimea, the Wall Street Journal reports.

The report notes Russia’s pullback of troops from capital cities to focus on an offensive on Donbas and other areas in eastern Ukraine “contributed to the [Biden] administration’s decision late last week to step up intelligence sharing”.

But it adds officials have stressed the US will “refrain from providing intelligence that would enable the Ukrainians to strike targets on Russian territory”.

Australia levels new sanctions on Russia, targeting 14 companies

Australia has imposed a new set of sanctions on 14 state-owned enterprises of “strategic and economic importance to Russia”, according to a statement from defence minister Marise Payne.

Included in the sanctions are defence-related transportation companies Kamaz and the United Shipbuilding Corporation. Sanctions also extend to Ruselectronics, “which is responsible for the production of around 80 per cent of all Russian electronics components” and Russian Railways, “one of the largest single contributors to Russia’s GDP”.

“By preventing dealings with these important sources of revenue for the Russian government, we are increasing the pressure on Russia and undercutting its ability to continue funding Putin’s war”, Payne’s statement says.

Negotiations are reportedly under way to exchange 169 service members of Ukraine’s National Guard who were taken prisoner at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. This was posted on the official Telegram channel of Ukraine’s Ministry of Internal Affairs, citing an announcement by minister Denys Monastyrsky.

Monastyrsky said some of the prisoners are in Belarus and some in Russia.

“We were at the place where they were kept. This is a dungeon without light, without the ability to communicate properly. And then they were taken out. Unfortunately, I can’t say what their fate is,” the minister said, adding the exchange would only be possible “after the end of the active phase of hostilities”.

US yet to commit to its own genocide probe of Russia

The US has stopped short of promising to launch its own inquiry to determine whether “genocide” was committed by Russia in Ukraine but said it will support international efforts to hold Russia accountable.

US State Department Spokesperson Ned Price declined to say whether Biden’s comments reflected the overall position of the US government but said the president “was speaking to the impression he had garnered from watching the horrific footage that we’ve all seen” from Ukraine.

“What we are doing is the most effective means of achieving that ultimate goal of accountability,” Price said.

Industrial control system malware discovered: US agencies

Multiple US government agencies have issued a joint alert warning of the discovery of malicious cyber tools created by unnamed advanced threat actors that they said were capable of gaining “full system access” to multiple industrial control systems.

The public alert from the Energy and Homeland Security Departments and the FBI and National Security Agency did not name the actors or offer details on the find. But their private-sector cybersecurity partners said the evidence suggests Russia is behind the tools, which were configured to initially target North American energy concerns.

One of the cybersecurity firms involved, Mandiant, said in a report that the tools’ functionality was “consistent with the malware used in Russia’s prior physical attacks”. It called them “exceptionally rare and dangerous”.

Russian gov’t will discuss giving subsidies to airlines, airports: Interfax

The Russian government will discuss giving subsidies to airlines and airports to help them cope with the economic damage caused by western sanctions, the Interfax news agency has said.

Airlines will be able to receive compensation for lost revenues stemming from forced flight cancellations, while the state will support 11 airports in central and southern Russia, Interfax said.

The sanctions have banned the supply of spare parts to Russian airlines, making maintenance more complicated.

French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz have avoided echoing Biden’s accusation that Russia is carrying out “genocide” against Ukrainians, warning that verbal escalations would not help end the war.

But Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he believed it was “absolutely right” to describe Russian actions in Ukraine as “genocide”.

“I think it’s absolutely right that more and more people be talking and using the word ‘genocide’ in terms of what Russia is doing, what Vladimir Putin has done,” Trudeau told reporters.

Ukraine war is causing a ‘three dimensional crisis’: UN Secretary-General

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said the war on Ukraine is “supercharging” food, energy and economic crises, which will affect the world’s most vulnerable people.

“The war is supercharging a three-dimensional crisis — food, energy and finance — that is pummeling some of the world’s most vulnerable people, countries and economies,” Guterres said in a speech.

“And all this comes at a time when developing countries are already struggling with a slate of challenges not of their making — the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change and a lack of access to adequate resources to finance the recovery in the context of persistent and growing inequalities.”

Biden announced the aid after a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to coordinate the delivery of the assistance.

“This new package of assistance will contain many of the highly effective weapons systems we have already provided and new capabilities tailored to the wider assault we expect Russia to launch in eastern Ukraine,” he said in a statement.

Located near the Russia-Ukraine border, Belgorod lies along the upper Donets River where it is crossed by the Moscow-Kharkiv (Ukraine) and Sumy–Donets Basin railways. Archaeological finds indicate the existence of a settlement on the site in the 10th century. First mentioned in 1237, it was founded in 1593 as a fortress, becoming the key stronghold in the elaborate Belgorod defensive line set up in 1635–58 to protect Russia’s southern frontier against Tatar attack. It maintained its military and administrative significance until the late 18th century.

A Russian official has alleged that two Ukrainian military helicopters flew across the border and bombed a fuel depot in the eastern city of Belgorod, in what would be, if confirmed, the first known air raid by Ukraine’s forces on Russian soil since Moscow invaded its neighbour in late February.

Video images of the purported attack posted online on Friday showed what looked like several missiles being fired from low altitude, followed by an explosion that sparked a huge fire. It was not possible to independently verify the images.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters the alleged strike in Belgorod, some 35 kilometres (22 miles) from the border with Ukraine, did not create comfortable conditions to continue peace talks.

Ukraine’s top security official denied that Ukraine carried out the alleged attack.

Speaking on national television on Friday, Security Council Secretary Oleksiy Danilov said: “For some reason they say that we did it, but according to our information this does not correspond to reality.”

Earlier, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said: “I can neither confirm nor reject the claim that Ukraine was involved in this simply because I do not possess all the military information.”

Regional Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram that the helicopters hit the storage facility after crossing into Russia at low altitude.

“There was a fire at the petrol depot because of an air strike carried out by two Ukrainian army helicopters, who entered Russian territory at a low altitude,” he wrote in the messaging app.

The resulting blaze injured two workers, Gladkov added, while some areas of the city were being evacuated.

However, Russian oil firm Rosneft, which owns the fuel depot, said in a separate statement that no one was hurt in the fire, though it gave no information on its cause.

“Previously there were some incidents where Ukrainian shells fell over some villages in Belgorod region, but Russia says this is the first time an oil facility has been targeted,” Al Jazeera’s Ranya Dridi, reporting from Belgorod, said.

“Fires are still blazing at the oil facility and the Russian ministry of emergency announced that the firefighting operations are still going on with around 200 firefighters using about 60 special units to fight the fires.”

Energy Minister Nikolai Shulginov said the incident would not affect the region’s fuel supplies or prices for consumers.

The governor of the neighbouring Kursk region, Roman Starovoit, said that region’s fuel supplies were sufficient to last several weeks and called on the population not to stockpile fuel.

The regional governor said two Ukrainian helicopters attacked the fuel facility in Belgorod, about 20 miles inside Russia, and video showed storage tanks in flames.

A U.S. official confirmed to CBS News senior national security correspondent David Martin that Ukrainian helicopters did carry out the strike, and anther one a couple days earlier against an ammunition depot in the same area. The official told Martin there was concern in Washington about how Russia might react to the strikes.

Ukrainian officials did not claim responsibility for the attack themselves, but as CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams reports, it was a significant move by Ukraine's forces.

Russian forces have continued attacking Ukrainian cities. They were accused of blocking food and medical supplies from getting into the besieged southern port city of Mariupol on Thursday, and of blocking refugees from getting out despite Moscow agreeing to open a humanitarian corridor.

Russia has pummeled Mariupol and other southern and eastern Ukrainian cities with artillery and airstrikes for more than a month, but attempts to push deeper into the country with ground forces hit a wall, and in some places, they've been pushed back.

Just west of Zaporizhzhia, CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams met some of the Ukrainian forces who stood in their way.

In the farming village of Mala Shesternia, as in most of Ukraine, the Russian soldiers were unwelcome invaders. The residents have fled, but Colonel Serhii Romashko told CBS News his men recaptured Mala Shesternia five days ago, killing some Russians and capturing others.

Their clothes and shoes are still there, even their cooking pots. Romashko said the Russians were used as cannon fodder — sent in with so little food that they looted from the locals.

One of the most notable Russian movements this week was confirmed on Thursday by Ukraine's national nuclear plant operator, Energoatom, which said the last of the Russian forces that had occupied the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant had pulled out.

Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Russian troops who dug trenches in the still-contaminated forest around Chernobyl had been exposed to radiation, but there was no immediate confirmation of reports that many were sickened.

The global nuclear watchdog agency, the IAEA, said Thursday that it was still assessing the situation at Chernobyl but it had ""not been able to confirm reports of Russian forces receiving high doses of radiation"" in the exclusion zone around the plant.

The Russian troops from Chernobyl were reportedly headed toward Ukraine's border with Belarus. U.S. and British officials said this week that, while the Putin regime said it would ""drastically reduce"" military operations around Kyiv and the northeast city of Chernihiv to facilitate ongoing peace talks, Russia was really expected to regroup its battered forces in Belarus and other places under its control to stage a new offensive in eastern Ukraine's Donbas regions.

As Williams reported, the Russians have war machines Ukraine can only dream of, but Ukraine's forces are destroying them, including two armored personnel carriers she saw on a single stretch of road near Mala Shesternia.

Colonel Romashko told her three Russians miraculously escaped from one of the destroyed vehicles, and they're now being treated in a Ukrainian hospital.



""We'll defeat them,"" he said. ""I feel victorious.""

Ukraine's resistance has also driven back the Russians from the town of Irpin, just north of Ukraine's capital Kyiv. But the cost is clear to see, with a row of body bags lined up along a city street this week — people slaughtered in what Vladimir Putin calls his ""special military operation.""

In Mala Shesternia, the Russians also left behind deadly weapons, including a field carpeted with anti-tank mines. An undetonated rocket propelled grenade sat in the front yard of a home.

Putin sent his soldiers in to capture a country that wants only to be free — and his war is killing both Ukrainians and Russians.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-war-news-chernobyl-belgorod-oil-depot-attack/

Russia's defence ministry said two Ukrainian helicopters struck the facility in Belgorod, some 35 km (22 miles) from the border with Ukraine, after entering Russia at extremely low altitude at around 5 a.m. Moscow time (0200 GMT).

The resulting blaze forced the evacuation of some people but late in the day Belgorod mayor Anton Ivanov said fire services were extinguishing the last remnants.

""There is no threat to human life and health. All residents can return to their homes,"" he said in an online post.

Ukraine's top security official rebuffed the Russian accusation - the first by Moscow of an air strike on Russian soil since Moscow launched its invasion on Feb. 24. Belgorod is one of Russia's main logistics hubs for the war.

""For some reason they say that we did it, but according to our information this does not correspond to reality,"" said Security Council Secretary Oleksiy Danilov.

Earlier, defence ministry spokesman Oleksandr Motuzyanyk said he would neither confirm nor deny a Ukrainian role.

""Ukraine is currently conducting a defensive operation against Russian aggression on the territory of Ukraine, and this does not mean that Ukraine is responsible for every catastrophe on Russia's territory,"" he said.

The White House had no comment on Kremlin allegations that Ukraine had bombed the depot, press secretary Jen Psaki said.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said President Vladimir Putin had been briefed about the incident. Peskov said the strike could jeopardise Moscow's peace negotiations with Kyiv.

Ukraine's Danilov retorted: ""He says it doesn't help talks, but does it help talks when they kill our children, our women - these outrages they commit on our land? These people are kind of sick.""

Security camera footage, from a location verified by Reuters, showed a flash of light from what appeared to be a missile fired from low altitude in the sky, followed by an explosion on the ground.

Regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said the resulting blaze injured two workers.

In an online post, Gladkov said a second blast damaged a power line near the village of Nikolskoye but that no one was hurt. Pictures he posted showed a crater in a field.

Russian oil firm Rosneft (ROSN.MM), which owns the fuel depot, said no one was hurt in the fire. Russia's defence ministry said the facility was exclusively for civilian use.

An ammunition depot near Belgorod caught fire on Wednesday, causing a series of blasts. At the time, Gladkov said authorities were waiting for the defence ministry to establish its cause.

Kyiv later denied the accusation, having initially refused to confirm or deny it.

“For some reason they say that we did it, but in fact this does not correspond with reality,” Oleksiy Danilov said on Ukrainian television on Friday.

Ukraine denied that it launched the attack, raising questions about whether Russian negligence may be to blame.

A Russian governor in the border region of Belgorod said that early on Friday two Ukrainian Mi-24 helicopters crossed the border at low altitude before firing rockets at an oil facility 25 miles from the border.

Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s national security council, denied responsibility for the attack. “For some reason, they say that we did it, but in fact this does not correspond with reality,” he said on Ukrainian television.

Earlier on Friday,the Ukrainian presidential aide Oleksiy Arestovych said: “We are holding defensive military operations on our own territory … Everything that happens on Russian territory is the responsibility of the Russian leadership. All questions to them.”

A number of prominent Ukrainian commentators have claimed that the attack could be a “false flag” meant to justify a Russian mobilisation or scuttle negotiations.

The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitri Peskov fuelled those rumours by saying the attack could hamper negotiations, although he stopped short of announcing any concrete response to the alleged attack.

“What has happened is certainly not something that can be perceived as creating conditions comfortable for the continuation of negotiations,” Peskov said.

Peskov later said that Russia would strengthen its western borders so that “it wouldn’t cross anyone’s mind to attack”, RIA news agency reported.

Video posted on social media on Friday appeared to show a helicopter strike using air-to-ground missiles, followed by a major fire at a facility said to be in Belgorod, with flames reaching dozens of metres into the air.

Reports showed that the facility continued to burn until midday on Friday. Dozens of firefighters were dispatched to battle the inferno.

Other videos showed the helicopters, the model of which is used by both Ukraine and Russia, flying in the region. None of these videos have been verified, however.

“The fire at the oil depot occurred as a result of an airstrike from two helicopters of the armed forces of Ukraine, which entered the territory of Russia at low altitude,” said the governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov. “There are no victims.”

Russia’s defence ministry said in a statement on Friday that the facility had been attacked but claimed it did not supply fuel to the military.

Russia has claimed cross-border shelling from Ukraine before, including an alleged attack on an air base in February and an incident last week that allegedly killed a military chaplain, but not an incursion of its airspace. The depot, run by Russian energy giant Rosneft, is about 21 miles from the Ukraine border.

There have been other incidents in Belgorod, which has served as a major hub for Russian military units involved in the invasion of Ukraine.

There was an explosion earlier on Thursday at the site of an arms depot there, raising speculation that saboteurs were targeting the city.

The Russian news agency Tass reported that four service personnel were injured because of that explosion.

The explosions in the Russian rear came after Russia announced it was winding down its offensive toward Kyiv after its troops met heavy resistance in the month-long war. Western officials have warned that Russia may be repositioning its troops for a larger attack on Ukraine’s east.

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in late night address on Thursday that Russia was consolidating and preparing “powerful strikes” in the country’s east and south. “This is part of their tactics,” he said.

“We know that they are moving away from the areas where we are beating them to focus on others that are very important… where it can be difficult for us,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/01/ukraine-accused-of-helicopter-attack-on-oil-depot-inside-russia
