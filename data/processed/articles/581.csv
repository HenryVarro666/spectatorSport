Summary China's leaders seen as ""unsettled"" by Ukraine events

U.S. assesses 2,000-4,000 Russian troops killed

Possible food and water shortages forecast in Kyiv

WASHINGTON, March 8 (Reuters) - Leaders of U.S. spy agencies said on Tuesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin may intensify the assault on Ukraine despite military setbacks and economic hardships resulting from international sanctions, setting up ""an ugly next few weeks.""

They estimated that 2,000 to 4,000 Russian troops had died and said Russia was feeling the effects of sanctions, but the situation could become much worse for Ukrainians, with food and water supplies in Kyiv possibly running out within two weeks.

""Our analysts assess that Putin is unlikely to be deterred by such setbacks and instead may escalate,"" Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told the annual House of Representatives Intelligence Committee hearing on worldwide threats, where she testified with other intelligence agency directors.

Haines said Putin's announcement that he was elevating his nuclear forces' readiness was ""extremely unusual"" since the 1960s, but that intelligence analysts had not observed changes in Russia's nuclear posture beyond what was detected during previous international crises.

""We also have not observed force-wide nuclear posture changes that go beyond what we've seen in prior moments of heightened tensions,"" Haines said.

William Burns, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, echoed Haines' assessment that Russia is unlikely to back down.

""I think Putin is angry and frustrated right now. He's likely to double down and try to grind down the Ukrainian military with no regard for civilian casualties,"" Burns said.

Burns said he and CIA analysts do not see how Putin can accomplish his goal of taking Kyiv and replacing President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's government with a pro-Moscow or puppet leadership.

""I fail to see how he can produce that kind of an end game and where that leads, I think, is for an ugly next few weeks in which he doubles down ... with scant regard for civilian casualties,"" Burns told the committee.

'DESPERATE' IN KYIV

Given reports that Russia is cutting off basic supplies to Kyiv, home to 2.8 million people, Lieutenant General Scott Berrier, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, said the situation in Ukraine's capital could worsen quickly.

""I don't have a specific number of days of supply that the population has. But with supplies being cut off, it will be somewhat desperate in, I would say, 10 days to two weeks,"" Berrier said.

Berrier said the United States did not have evidence that Russia had committed war crimes beyond what has appeared on social media. Berrier said that ""the bombing of schools and facilities that are not associated with the Ukrainian military certainly would indicate that he is stepping up right to the line if he hasn't done so already.""

Burns said China's leaders are ""unsettled"" by events surrounding the assault on Ukraine, despite refusing to condemn Russia or call the attack an invasion.

""They did not anticipate the significant difficulties the Russians were going to run into. I think they are unsettled by the reputational damage that can come by their close association with President Putin; second by the economic consequences at a moment when they are facing lower annual growth rates than they've experienced for more than three decades,"" Burns added.

""I think they're a little bit unsettled about the impact on the global economy. And third, I think they're a little bit unsettled by the way in which Vladimir Putin has driven Europeans and Americans much closer together,"" Burns said.

The United States has done ""intensive intelligence-sharing"" with Ukraine, Burns said.

Berrier said his ""low confidence"" assessment was that 2,000 to 4,000 Russian troops have been killed.

Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbor's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.

At the hearing, Democratic and Republican committee members praised the work done by the U.S. intelligence community ahead of the Russian invasion.

The Kremlin's advances on the ground appear to have largely stalled out in the face of Ukrainian resistance and major supply chain problems. Its forces have now shifted their focus to a brutal campaign of encircling and bombarding major cities. At the same time, the United States and other countries continue to levy new sanctions on Russia and work to isolate it politically on the international stage while pouring thousands of weapons into the country to support Ukraine's defense.

Before diving into the latest news below, readers can get up to speed on the present state of the conflict in Ukraine in our previous rolling coverage here.

The Latest

POSTED: 9:25 PM EST—

“For the first time, we don’t expect them to make any gains in the next few days,"" a NATO official told CNN earlier today, underscoring the degree to which Russia's advances on the ground have slowed. ""They are putting in everything they have and are still making very little progress.""

The U.S. military now assesses that the Kremlin has committed almost 100 percent of the forces it had arrayed around Ukraine in recent months and that it has lost around five percent of that combat capacity since the invasion began. Russian forces have now launched more than 670 ballistic and cruise missiles against Ukrainian targets, according to the Pentagon and appears to be stepping up those and other kinds of strikes.

Russian forces have still not achieved air superiority, a senior U.S. defense official said today.

Many Ukrainian cities are increasingly subject to Russian siege warfare tactics, including air, missile, and bombardments. This continues to create significant risks and hardships for civilian populations in these areas, as underscored by the U.K. government intelligence assessment below.

The video below, showing evacuations earlier from the city of Irpin, just outside Kyiv, rams home what civilians in Ukraine are increasingly facing. This reality is also highlighted by the picture in the Tweet below that showing the tail end of an artillery rocket lodged in a civilian vehicle inside a parking structure in Kharkiv to the east.

The U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) has assessed that there are between 10 days and two weeks worth of general supplies available to sustain the remaining populace of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv should it become completely cut off by Russian forces. Russia's military is still trying to make a push on Kyiv from three different directions and continues to send small units into the city itself to skirmish with forces there and ""disrupt normal life,"" according to a senior U.S. defense official.

The Russian military appears to be preparing for amphibious landings along Ukraine's Black Sea coastline. This could include long-expected operations targeting the port city of Odesa.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said tonight that ""the world doesn't believe in Russia's future"" and ""there will most certainly be a future"" for his country. This comes after he recently said that he is open, at least to some degree, to acquiescing to some of Russia's more maximalist demands, such as ceding control of the Crimean Peninsula and areas of the country's eastern Donbas region.

The United States and countries in Europe have begun to talk about Ukraine's eventual reconstruction following this conflict, even as military and humanitarian aid continue to flow to it now.

U.S. Army Gen. Paul Nakasone, who is currently Director of the National Security Agency (NSA) and head of U.S. Cyber Command (CYBERCOM), told lawmakers at a hearing earlier today that, at least so, Russian cyberattacks had been more limited than expected in the context of the conflict in Ukraine. He attributed this to hard work on the part of the Ukrainian government and others ""to prevent their actions.""

At the same hearing, FBI Director Christopher Wray warned that Russian cyberattacks remain one of the most realistic avenues for spillover from the conflict in Ukraine to directly impact the United States.

Avril Haines, the Director of National Intelligence, and William Burns, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), highlighted at that hearing how China has been unsettled by Russia's stumbling in its invasion of Ukraine and the international community's reaction to the conflict. They say that what Beijing has observed in this context could have an impact on its own calculus regarding the potential use of force against Taiwan.

New high-resolution satellite imagery has emerged online of an air base in Russia relatively close to the Ukrainian border that shows some interesting aircraft deployed there. The image, taken on March 3, shows that a substantial number of An-2 Colt biplanes, as well as specialized electronic warfare and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft, were there on that date. The presence of the An-2s, in particular, which was first observed back in February, remains curious, as you can read more about here.

Commercial satellite imagery provider Maxar has released new imagery of various locations in Ukraine showing the impacts of the conflict.

The video in the Tweet below shows a Ukrainian service member or a member of the country's volunteer Territorial Defense FOrces armed with a German-made Panzerfaust 3 shoulder-fired anti-armor weapon. This is one a number of shoulder-fired missile and rocket launchers that Ukrainian forces have received or expect to soon, as you can read more about here.

Ukrainian forces have made good use of these launchers, especially anti-tank guided missiles with firing modes that allow them to strike the tops of tanks and other armored vehicles, where the armor is typically thinnest, in their defense of the country. Visual evidence of their impact these weapons are having on Russian operations continues to grow, including the picture below showing the addition of sandbags on top of improvised cage-type armor on a Russian tank.

Imagery continues to emerge on social media showing Ukrainian citizens towing away abandoned Russian armored vehicles.

Russia's economy is buckling more and more under the weight of new international sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine. Ratings agency Fitch has warned that a default on the country's sovereign debt could be ""imminent.""

Barnes'],2022-03-08 00:00:00,"Given the problems the Russian military has faced, and the rising will of Ukraine to fight, intelligence officials predicted the war would intensify. William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director, is anticipating an “ugly next few weeks.”

“I think Putin is angry and frustrated right now,” Mr. Burns said. He is likely to “try to grind down the Ukrainian military with no regard for civilian casualties,” he added.

Lt. Gen. Scott D. Berrier, the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, said there was a limit to how long Kyiv could hold on as Russian forces encircled Ukraine and tightened the vise. “With supplies being cut off, it will become somewhat desperate in, I would say, 10 days to two weeks,” General Berrier said.

Other estimates are similar. Some allied governments believe Russia will finish encircling Kyiv in a week and, given the strength of Ukraine’s resistance, the city may be able to hold out for another month, a European diplomat said on Tuesday.

While the intelligence chiefs said Mr. Putin felt aggrieved, Mr. Burns said it would be incorrect to view his actions as crazy.

The Russian leader’s increasing isolation and insulation from conflicting views make him “extremely difficult to deal with,” Mr. Burns said. Without aides willing to push back, Mr. Putin entered the war misunderstanding the will of Ukraine to fight back and the West to take action.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/08/us/politics/us-intelligence-russia-ukraine.html

The release followed a rare trip by a high-level U.S. delegation to Venezuela over the weekend to meet with President Nicolás Maduro, part of a broader Biden administration agenda in autocratic countries that may be rethinking their ties with President Vladimir V. Putin in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The talks with Venezuela, which has enormous proven oil reserves, assumed new urgency after President Biden announced Tuesday that the United States would ban Russian oil and gas imports because of the invasion. That move is expected to further tighten the availability of crude oil on the global market, and could raise gas prices at a moment when inflation has climbed at its fastest pace in 40 years.

“This is a step that we’re taking to inflict further pain on Putin, but there will be costs as well here in the United States,” Mr. Biden said of the ban on Russian oil.

American officials said that the prisoner release was not part of a deal with Venezuela to restart oil sales to the United States, which were banned under the Trump administration. For weeks, American business people who have worked in Venezuela have had back-channel discussions about resuming America’s oil trade with Mr. Maduro’s government.

Venezuela could eventually help make up some of the shortfall caused by the ban on Russian oil. But industry experts warned that Venezuelan oil supplies would do little to tame American gas prices and inflation quickly. Increasing the country’s production may take time after the years of mismanagement and underinvestment that have decimated the country’s energy sector.

Prominent members of Congress have also come out against efforts to thaw relations with Mr. Maduro, whose government has been accused by the United Nations of systematic human rights violations.

“Nicolás Maduro is a cancer to our hemisphere and we should not breathe new life into his reign of torture and murder,” Senator Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat who leads the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Monday in a statement.

The released men are Gustavo Cárdenas, an executive at the American branch of Venezuela’s state oil company who was detained in 2017, and Jorge Alberto Fernández, Mr. Biden said in a statement.

“These men are fathers who lost precious time with their children and everyone they love, and their families have suffered every day of their absence,” he said, adding, “We also remember the names and the stories of every American who is being unjustly held against their will — in Venezuela, in Russia, in Afghanistan, Syria, China, Iran and elsewhere around the world.”

Mr. Fernández, a Cuban American, was a tourist who was accused of terrorism for bringing a drone into Venezuela in February 2021, according to his lawyer.

At least eight other U.S. nationals remain jailed in Caracas on charges ranging from embezzlement to terrorism.

The purpose of the American officials’ visit to Venezuela was to discuss “energy security” and the status of imprisoned Americans, the White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a news conference.

Mr. Maduro said he received the American delegation at the presidential palace and called the meeting “respectful, cordial, very diplomatic.” The talks, he said, would continue. He also said he would restart talks with the country’s opposition.

The Venezuelan government wants to resume oil sales to the United States to take advantage of high oil prices and to replace the revenues from trade channels it built through the Russian financial system that have been frozen by Western nations to punish Russian aggression against Ukraine, according to officials and oil businessmen in the country.

Selling directly to the United States would also allow Mr. Maduro to reap full profits from the highest oil prices in more than a decade, instead of selling the crude at deep discount to a network of middlemen used to bypass the U.S. ban, they said.

Before that ban, Venezuela exported most of its oil to the United States, whose Gulf refineries were built to process the country’s heavy crude.

In 2017, Venezuelan security forces arrested six executives from Citgo Petroleum, the American branch of the state oil company, after the Maduro government summoned them to meetings in Caracas. The State Department has said that all six detainees are U.S. nationals.

The executives were charged with financial crimes and jailed. Their former boss, Nelson Martínez, the head of the state oil company, was detained soon after them and died in custody a year later.

The executives’ families and their lawyers have said that the men, who have come to be known as the Citgo 6, are innocent and that they were lured to Caracas to be used by Mr. Maduro as pawns in his negotiations with the United States.

Venezuela’s treatment of the executives varied as U.S.-Venezuelan relations warmed and cooled. Sometimes the detainees were held in prison, other times in house arrest. Since last year, they have been held in a single cell in the Venezuela’s secret police’s underground prison, where the United Nations has documented irregularities and human rights abuses in the case of at least one of them.

Among the other Americans held in Venezuela is Matthew Heath, a Marine veteran who was detained in Venezuela’s northern state of Falcon in 2020. The Venezuelan government claims he was spying on critical infrastructure. Mr. Heath’s family and the U.S. government said that he was innocent and that he was detained because of his nationality.

Two other Americans still detained, former Special Forces members Airan Berry and Luke Denman, were arrested in 2020 after they tried to invade Venezuela by boat as part of a failed plot to overthrow Mr. Maduro.

The Trump administration cut off diplomatic relations with Venezuela in 2019, closing the United States Embassy in Caracas and imposing the ban on Venezuelan oil. A year later, the Justice Department indicted Mr. Maduro and more than a dozen other Venezuelan officials on drug trafficking charges, accusing them of facilitating cocaine shipments to the United States.

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Members on both sides of the aisle during a Foreign Relations Committee hearing this morning challenged the administration about why the US isn’t helping facilitate planes to Ukraine that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said are desperately needed. They warned that Congress may take further action on banning Russian energy imports that go beyond what was passed by the House of Representatives and is backed by President Joe Biden's administration.

“It’s not clear why we are standing in the way,” Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat from New Hampshire, told CNN about the US’s position that it would not be appropriate to send Poland planes so that Poland could transfer their planes to Ukraine.

Over the last several days, members have come to believe that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken share differing views on how to handle a potential transfer of aircraft to Poland that would facilitate Poland to transfer planes directly to Ukraine, a difference that has enraged some members on Capitol Hill who have come to see the administration itself as fracturing.

Sen. Jim Risch, the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, told CNN it was an “embarrassing” division.

“The first branch of government is almost unanimous on this. I don’t know who is against this up here, but it’s embarrassing for the second branch of government to be divided. This is a job for the President of the United States. He needs to step up. Knock heads together and get everybody in the same place,” Risch said. “We really need to do that. This is a matter of life and death.”

Risch said the Pentagon’s explanation that a plane transfer could be perceived as escalatory by the Russians is “nonsense.”

“We’re taking their yachts, we’re taking their vacation properties, we are giving the Ukrainians all the arms we can give them. It is foolish to say this is somehow going to aggravate them more. That’s nonsense,” he said.

GOP Sen. Rob Portman, who has been outspoken on this issue, told CNN that he believed that it was not the Biden administration’s place to be making decisions for Ukraine on what their military strategy should be and if they wanted planes, and the US needed to do everything in its power to help them.

“The administration just told us they think Ukraine needs other things more and would be more effective in the battlefield. In theory, that means that you have the United States government deciding what the military strategy should be for Ukraine,” Portman said. “Ukraine wants planes. They have made a decision.”

Some Democrats, however, argue that Congress should give the administration more room to make the decisions for how they want to approach this conflict without “micromanaging.”

“I generally trust the administration’s decision making,” Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, told CNN. “I think this is a time when we should get behind the administration rather than constantly second-guessing.”",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-10-22/h_ef24db7260635c73bf0efa621f2f4373

While noting analysts have ""low confidence"" in the assessment, DIA Director Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier told the House Intelligence Committee that, based on a mix of intelligence sources and open source information, his agency believes anywhere from 2,000 to 4,000 Russian troops have been killed so far.

By contrast, 2,461 U.S. troops died during the entire 20-year war in Afghanistan.

The high Russian casualty count underscores the setbacks Moscow has faced since Russian forces launched a massive invasion of Ukraine, reversals that U.S. intelligence officials testified Tuesday would lead to Russian President Vladimir Putin escalating the violence.

""I think Putin is angry and frustrated right now. He's likely to double down and try to grind down the Ukrainian military with no regard for civilian casualties,"" CIA Director William Burns said.

""He has no sustainable political endgame in the face of what is going to continue to be fierce resistance from Ukrainians,"" Burns added. ""Where that leads, I think, is for an ugly next few weeks in which he doubles down, as I said before, with scant regard for civilian casualties.""

The House Intelligence Committee hearing was scheduled as its annual ""Worldwide Threats"" panel, which typically covers a wide range of global hot spots, but questions Tuesday largely focused on the war in Ukraine that Russia launched late last month.

Russia, which has outlawed reporting that calls the war a war, has been hesitant to acknowledge deaths in the conflict, which it describes as a ""special military operation."" But its defense ministry said last week that 498 Russian soldiers had died and 1,597 had been injured.

Ukraine puts Russian casualties even higher than the U.S. estimate, with the Ukrainian Defence Ministry saying Tuesday morning that 12,000 Russian troops have been killed since the start of the war.

Despite initial U.S. assessments that Ukraine's capital could fall to Russia in a matter of days, Ukrainian forces have held onto Kyiv, and a Russian military convoy said to be 40 miles long remains stalled about 15 miles outside the city due to a mix of what American officials describe as Russian logistics failures and Ukrainian attacks.

If Russia were to successfully cut off food and other supplies to Kyiv, Berrier estimated the situation inside the city would ""become somewhat desperate ... in 10 days to two weeks.""

Russia's strategy for the invasion has so far mirrored what the U.S. intelligence community anticipated, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told the committee Tuesday. But Putin underestimated the strength of Ukraine's resistance and Russia's own ""serious military shortcomings,"" she continued.

Haines added that it's unclear whether Russia will continue to pursue a ""maximalist"" plan to capture all or most of Ukraine, but she echoed Burns' assessment that Putin is likely to escalate the violence.

Russia amassed nearly 200,000 troops along Ukraine's border ahead of the invasion, and a senior defense official told reporters Tuesday that 100% of those forces are now inside Ukraine. If Russia decides to pursue the maximalist approach, it would need to devote more forces to the war, Haines said at the hearing.

""We assess Putin feels aggrieved the West does not give him proper deference and perceives this as a war he cannot afford to lose,"" Haines said. ""But what he might be willing to accept as a victory may change over time, given the significant costs he is incurring.""

Ukrainians will not give up, even though there will be some kind of ceasefire and partition ahead. The invasion was no different than the ones in Georgia and Chechnya, with Putin still trying to reinstate some Russian pre-USSR imperial vision in reacquired territory. There will be domestic repercussions from this war. 4,000 Russian troops have now perished. 10,000 Russian antiwar protesters have been arrested.

Even Putin’s designated Russian puppet who had hoped that the victory would have been swift, is trying to convince Zelensky to surrender. Yanukovych is now in Minsk no differently than Trump in Mar-a-Lago, impatiently waiting to be ‘reinstated’. “A bilateral negotiation process with Ukraine could nullify Russia’s thesis that this conflict is internal to Ukraine and Russia’s claim of mediating role.” The 11 October open letter from Medvedev which more likely was from Putin, reveals the consistently dictatorial view of Ukraine’s sovereignty made complicated by not having Trump as POTUS.

⚡️Yanukovych addresses Zelensky, urges him to stop fighting. Ex-President Viktor Yanukovych, who lives in Russia since being ousted in 2014, asks Zelensky to “overcome his pride” and stop the war at any cost. Yanukovych’s letter to Zelensky was published by the Russian media.

Russian combat power remains intact, the problem is counter-battery fire and ECM as the Russians can hit anything in the nation’s air space, having used a state-of-the-art S-400 missile system for the first time in combat to down a Ukrainian plane.

With almost all the Russian forces that amassed on Ukraine's borders now within the country, the wave of Russian invaders continues to crash on the rocks of Ukrainian resistance, said a senior defense official speaking on background.

Overall, Russian progress in the north to take Kyiv is stalled, while President Vladimir Putin's forces in the south are making some progress, the official said.

""Near Kyiv, we still observe that Russian forces have not moved closer to the city center,"" the official said. ""The closest they've been able to get is the airport.""

Russian forces are trying to attack Kyiv from the east. ""We estimate that they're about 60 kilometers or so from the city,"" the official said. ""So they're still further away than the main advance coming down on the north.""

In the south, Mariupol is ""isolated"" but still fighting, and the official said it appears the Russians are looking to attack the port city of Odesa from the landward side. This could be joined by an amphibious attack as the Russians have 11 amphibious ships in the region.

The official said it does not appear that Putin is ordering in troops or capabilities from other parts of Russia for the invasion. He noted that the Russians have a lot of combat power in Ukraine. The Russian troops invading Ukraine are afflicted by poor morale, and logistics and sustainment problems. He said the Russians did not expect the ferocious defense by the Ukrainian military and Ukrainian civilians. Ten days into the invasion, the Russian forces appear to be behind their timetable for conquest.

Russian long-range artillery and missiles (they have now fired nearly 670 missiles into Ukraine) are regularly hitting civilian areas, the official said. The United Nations now estimates 1.4 million Ukrainians have fled the country with many thousands more internally displaced.

Poland said on Tuesday evening that it is willing to hand over its fleet of 28 MiG 29s to the US – which is in turn expected to pass them on to the Ukrainian air force. Poland is also expecting the US to supply it with more advanced F-16s to fill the gap.

If what is left of Ukraine’s air force were to sustain further losses it would soon reach the point where it is unable to defend itself from attack in the skies. A new fleet of aircraft would ensure the airspace above Ukraine remains contested at least for a time, and would make Russia think twice about airstrikes on Kyiv.

But the main problem faced by Ukraine’s armed forces at present, is Russia’s preponderance in artillery. Russia has been shelling cities such as Kharkiv and Mariupol for several days in an attempt to force their surrender.

Ukraine could try to use its planes to strike enemy convoys from the air, but that would be fraught with risk as Russia is thought to have brought air defence systems closer to the frontline in the past few days.

x Today's Ukraine thread begins w/ a story: A U.S. general assessed today that 2,000 to 4,000 Russian soldiers have died since the invasion of Ukraine began.



That came up a bit later during background briefing w/ a senior U.S. defense official.



Takeaways:https://t.co/g9HowbM1Cy — Dan Lamothe (@DanLamothe) March 8, 2022

The number is based on imperfect information, prompting Lt. Gen. Berrier, the director at DIA, to say he has ""low confidence"" in the number. Still, it's the best estimate the U.S. appears to have.

The senior U.S. defense official said Berrier did ""the best he could"" to answer.

In today's Pentagon briefing, many details sound reasonably stagnant. Bombardments continue. The convoy north of Kyiv is still stalled beginning at Hostomel airport. And the Russians continue to have a bit more success in southern Ukraine.

As of today, ""nearly 670"" missiles have been launched at Ukraine by Russia since the invasion began Feb. 26, the senior U.S. defense official said. That number has risen by a few dozen per day for a while now.

Notably: The senior defense official noted the advance of Russian forces northeast of Kyiv. They've been pushing west from the area around Sumy, as Russia seeks to encircle the capital. As of today, they are about 37 miles east of Kyiv, the official said.

No appreciable change in combat power Russia has put in the fight. They are still at ""nearly 100 percent"" of the combat forces they had arrayed at the border before the invasion began, senior U.S. defense official says. No sign they are bringing in reinforcements, he adds.

Russian combat power is still ""largely intact,"" senior defense official says. Ukraine's too.

Rough breakdown of Russia's 670-missile barrage so far:



- Almost half fired from Russia

- About 70 from Belarus

- Handful from Black Sea

- The rest from inside Ukraine

Senior defense official says airspace is still contested. But he notes that Russia can reach just about anywhere over Ukraine with surface-to-air missiles. That, of course, is important in any conversation about a no-fly zone being established.

Russia shelled a major gas pipeline in eastern Ukraine yesterday, the senior defense official said. As a result, many in eastern Ukraine are now without gas.

Russians are ""stuck"" outside Chernihiv without making progress there, senior U.S. defense official says.

In contrast, Mariupol is now isolated, the Pentagon assesses.

""Iterative discussions"" are ongoing with allies and partners are underway to supply Ukraine what it needs, senior defense official says. But no changes on the discussion about sending jets to Ukraine.

On humanitarian corridors, the senior defense official says that it is ""disingenuous"" to say anything heading toward Belarus or Russia counts. Hope is for more that are honored by Russia in the future.

In the hearing with Lt. Gen. Berrier, he forecast greater challenges for Kyiv this month, as Russia attempts to cut food and water supplies.

The situation, he said, ""will become somewhat desperate in 10 days to two weeks.""

The senior U.S. defense official said that when it comes to humanitarian corridors, ""the Russians have not proven to be reliable.""



""Whether the two sides are able to continue to work out these kinds of agreements, we can't know for sure,"" the official said.

x Also, Grozev cites a source who claims that Putin was “enraged” to learn that Russia fired particularly expensive missiles at Vinnytsia Airport. He’s a cheapskate even when invading a neighbor! — Kevin Rothrock (@KevinRothrock) March 9, 2022

As Mark Milley tells the story conveyed by his map, the Russian leader began a war that he will have great difficulty completing — and any attempt to expand it will summon a devastating response.

Maps are the most basic tools of military strategy. They allow commanders to chart a course through the fog of war; they organize the chaos of the battlefield. Milley huddling with his staff around his battle plan of the Ukraine theater conjures similar scenes through history, as generals from George Washington to Dwight D. Eisenhower leaned over maps to study the enemy’s formation and plot strategy.

Milley ordered aides to begin assembling the map in late October, when startling intelligence reports signaled that Russia was gathering an invasion army on Ukraine’s border. The Russian forces were no exercise; intercepted messages showed that Russia was actually planning an attack. Milley took the first versions of his map to the White House in late October, “to paint the picture for the NSC and the president,” one defense official said. The chairman would bring five or six copies of the map, Ukraine in green, and leave them with top officials. Biden quickly concluded that Russia’s assault planning was for real — and that America needed to lead an effort to stop it. Biden then did something unprecedented. He decided to share much of the top-secret intelligence with NATO allies — and then, increasingly, with the public through leaks to the press. On the eve of Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion, Biden ordered Milley and Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines to brief Congress on what the map showed — and then to give the same briefing, on “deep background,” to the Pentagon press corps. This was a declassified version of code-word intelligence, drawn from communications intercepts, surveillance satellites and spies on the ground. America’s best weapon against Putin, Biden decided, was the truth. The administration had found a way to weaponize intelligence. www.washingtonpost.com/...

x I'm in a background mtg now where military experts say #Putin may use chemical weapons in #Ukraine . They point to a widespread disinfo campaign claiming there are US-run labs all over Ukr, which will be cited as Putin claims the USA or Ukr released gases, not Russia. Scary. — Laurie Garrett (@Laurie_Garrett) March 8, 2022

x 🧵Just off the phone with an officer from Ukraine's military intelligence service (GUR). Someone I've known now for four years who's often rolled his eyes at official Ukrainian government pronouncements.



A few observations/comments: — Michael Weiss 🌻🇺🇸🇮🇪 (@michaeldweiss) March 8, 2022

I asked how his spirits were holding up. Answer: ""Now is not the time for crying; now is the time for laughing.""

He meant at Russia's military performance and its enormous losses in manpower and firepower in the field.

""They have lost far more than they expected. That is why they started peace negotiations on the second day of the war.""

""Yesterday, they lost 30 helicopters in the vicinity of Kherson where our marines destroyed them. The government announced this. Frankly speaking, it's true.""

""There was also some evidence for the loss of two aircraft in the airspace around Kyiv.""

""Our mood: Everything is OK. We are defending our soil, our Motherland. We have nothing to lose. They are conquerors. They are the fascists. And we will win. I have no doubt.""

I asked about all the Russian deserters abandoning their undamaged tanks, BTRs, air defense systems. Where did they go and where are they now?

""They fled into the woods. Sometimes they're marodyory [looters, marauders]. Even according to our interceptions we can determine many are robbing civilian houses and occupying them.""

""We also have evidence that even when the Russians occupy villages and towns they face resistance. In Kyiv they will meet extremely tough Territorial Defense.""

He also confirmed the majority of Ukraine's Air Force is still intact, on Day 12, including fixed wing and rotary aircraft. I asked how many operational Bayraktar TB2 drones Ukraine has in its arsenal. He laughed. ""OK, Michael, can I just say: 'It's enough.'"" // END
