LVIV, Ukraine – Ukraine's president warned his nation Sunday night that the coming week would be as crucial as any in the war.

""Russian troops will move to even larger operations in the east of our state,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly address.

He accused Russia of trying to evade responsibility for war crimes. ""The day will come when they will have to admit everything. Accept the truth,"" he said.

""When people lack the courage to admit their mistakes, apologize, adapt to reality and learn, they turn into monsters. And when the world ignores it, the monsters decide that it is the world that has to adapt to them. Ukraine will stop all this,"" Zelenskyy said.

""The day will come when they will have to admit everything. Accept the truth,"" he said.

He again called on Western countries, including Germany, to provide more assistance to Ukraine. During talks with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Zelenskyy said he discussed ""how to strengthen sanctions against Russia and how to force Russia to seek peace.""

""I am glad to note that the German position has recently changed in favor of Ukraine. I consider it absolutely logical,"" Zelenskyy said.

OTHER DEVELOPMENTS:

The president of the European Commission said the questionnaire she handed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during her visit to Kyiv represents a very important step forward.

Ursula von der Leyen said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union"" that Ukraine's response will enable her to decide whether to recommend the nation as a candidate to join the European Union.

The process normally takes years, but she has said Ukraine's application could take just weeks to consider. She said Ukrainians ""belong to our European family, without any question.""

""Yesterday, somebody told me: ""You know, when our soldiers are dying, I want them to know that their children will be free be and be part of the European Union,"" von der Leyen said. ""They are in an extraordinary situation, where we have to take unusual steps.""

""One thing is clear for me: After this war, when Ukraine will be rebuilt, when we support Ukraine in reconstructing this country, this will be accompanied by reforms. So, it is an extraordinary way to shape the country and to go down the path towards the European Union.""

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his government is providing investigative support to efforts to document war crimes in Ukraine, and he said Russian President Vladimir Putin is responsible.

It is clear that Putin is systematically targeting civilians, whether it's hospitals or train stations or maternity wards. This is one of the reasons why Canada was one of the first countries to call on the International Criminal Court to look into Putin's war crimes,"" Trudeau said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

Canadian investigators, Trudeau said, ""are building up the case for people to recognize that not only was this a terrible mistake to violate the sovereignty of another country and create massive global instability that's impacting energy and food prices around the world, but it is also a series of war crimes that Putin is deliberately committing that he needs to be held to account for.""

Asked if the crimes amount to genocide, Trudeau said it remains to be determined.

""The stories of what Russian soldiers are doing, not just the murder of civilians, but the systematic use of sexual violence and rape, to destabilize and have the greatest negative impact on Ukrainian people as possible is absolutely unforgivable and unacceptable,"" Trudeau said. ""And that's why the global community is going to and is responding so strongly.""

It's almost Easter in Ukraine, where faith, hope and charity are on display at a trio of churches on the far edges of the capital.

Sunday services were held in Bucha even as bodies were being removed from a mass grave in the churchyard. In Makarov, the faithful were moved to tears at the sight of crosses scattered in broken glass. And in Borodyanka, a church was untouched near where Russian attacks ripped open a high-rise. That's where donations are bringing help to elderly people who stayed while others fled Russian occupation.

Ukrainian authorities said weeks ago that at least 59 spiritual sites were damaged. On the day when Pope Francis called for an Easter truce in Ukraine to make way for a negotiated peace, church visitors invoked God in recalling their survival.

""Each person who was leaving, from any place, Makarov, Bucha, Hostomel or from Andriivka, the neighboring village which was destroyed to the ground; each one, even those who did not know the Lord's Prayer, he was speaking to God with his own words,"" said Alona Parkhomenko in Makarov, where the church exterior was speckled with bullet holes and the priest warned of falling glass.

WASHINGTON -- Russia's newly appointed battlefield commander in Ukraine made his reputation crushing resistance to Syrian President Bashar Assad during that country's devastating civil war.

Russian forces led by Gen. Alexander Dvornikov destroyed whole cities while dropping barrel bombs that targeted civilians. With Moscow supporting Assad, the war in Syria has killed more than 350,000 people.

Lt.-Col. Fares al-Bayoush, a Syrian army defector, said Sunday he expects a similar ""scorched-earth"" strategy under the commander in Ukraine. Speaking by telephone from Turkey, al-Bayoush said he believes the aim of naming Dvornikov as Ukraine war commander is to cause widespread destruction in many places at once.

""He has very good experience in this policy,"" al-Bayoush said. ""This commander is a war criminal.""

KYIV, Ukraine -- The mayor of Kyiv and his brother said the visit of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to their capital shows who Ukraine's real friends are at this critical time. But they understand if security concerns keep U.S. President Joe Biden from visiting for now.

Mayor Vitali Klitschko and his brother Wladimir have been professional boxers and now outspoken defenders of Ukraine. Interviewed Sunday on ABC News ""This Week with George Stephanopoulos,"" they said they expect Russia's military to return and target Kyiv again. And when they do, they said they can't defend Ukraine with their fists -- they need weapons.

Wladimir Klitschko also pleaded for the world to isolate Russia economically, saying ""every cent that Russia is getting, they're using for weapons to kill us.""

Vitali Klitschko said everyone was shocked when the Russians who pushed on Kyiv retreated after killing hundreds of civilians during their occupation. He called it genocide to kill women, children, old people and teenagers for no reason.

To defend Ukraine now, the mayor said, is to defend democracy and peace in Europe.

WILMINGTON, Del. -- The White House said U.S. President Joe Biden will press Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take a hard line against Russia's Ukraine invasion. Press Secretary Jen Psaki says the leaders plan a virtual meeting on Monday.

India's neutral stance in the war has raised concerns in Washington and earned praise from Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who lauded India this month for judging ""the situation in its entirety, not just in a one-sided way.""

India abstained when the UN General Assembly voted Thursday to suspend Russia from its seat on the 47-member Human Rights Council over allegations of war crimes. India continues to purchase Russian energy despite Western pressure to avoid buying Russian oil and gas. And the U.S. has considered sanctions on India for its recent purchase of advanced Russian air defense systems.

Psaki's statement says Biden will discuss how Russia's war against Ukraine is destabilizing the global food supply and commodity markets, and the need to strengthen the global economy while ""upholding a free, open, rules-based international order to bolster security, democracy, and prosperity.""

BERLIN -- Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said he will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Monday.

The Austria Press Agency reported that Nehammer told reporters in Vienna on Sunday that he plans to make the journey. It follows a trip on Saturday to Kyiv, where he met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

APA reported that Nehammer aims to encourage dialogue between Ukraine and Russia and also address ""war crimes"" in his meeting with Putin.

Austria is a member of the European Union and has backed the 27-nation bloc's sanctions against Russia, though it so far has opposed cutting off deliveries of Russian gas. The country is militarily neutral and is not a member of NATO.

Nehammer said he was taking the trip on his own initiative, and that he had consulted with the European Union's top officials. He said that he also informed Zelenskyy and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

BERLIN -- The UN nuclear watchdog said Ukraine said the staff at the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant has been rotated for the first time in three weeks after Russian troops left the area.

The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency has expressed concern about the well-being of the workers since the Russian military took control of the site of the 1986 nuclear disaster at the beginning of the war.

The agency said Ukraine informed it on Sunday that it has now rotated the staff, but the situation remains far from normal. They had to be transported to and from the site by water, with the Pripyat River being the only way for people living in the city of Slavutych to currently reach the plant.

The IAEA said Ukraine has informed it that analytical laboratories for radiation monitoring at the site were destroyed, with analytical instruments ""stolen, broken or otherwise disabled."" The automated transmission of radiation monitoring data has been disabled.

KYIV, Ukraine -- The governor of the region that includes Ukraine's fourth-largest city, Dnipro, says the airport was hit twice by missile attacks on Sunday. The Ukrainian military command said Russian forces also keep shelling Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, and have kept up their siege of Mariupol, the key southern port city that has been under attack for nearly six weeks.

The Russian Defence Ministry says it's air-launched missiles hit Ukraine's S-300 air defence missile systems in two locations, while sea-launched cruise missiles destroyed a Ukrainian unit's headquarters in the Dnipro region. Neither side's military claims could be independently verified.

The Pentagon said Russia has a clear advantage in armoured forces for its next phase in its war on Ukraine. Press secretary John Kirby said Friday that the Russians spread themselves too thin to take the capital, but now they're more focused on a smaller region, and still have the vast majority of their combat power. A major effort by Ukrainian defenses and more Western assistance will be needed to push them back.

WASHINGTON -- A senior U.S. official said Russia has appointed a new commander to oversee its war on Ukraine.

The official speaking on condition of anonymity said Russia has turned to one of its most experienced military officers, Gen. Alexander Dvornikov. U.S. officials say the 60-year-old general has a record of brutality against civilians in Syria and other theatres of war.

The White House national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told CNN on Sunday that ""this general will just be another author of crimes and brutality against Ukrainian civilians."" And he said ""no appointment of any general can erase the fact that Russia has already faced a strategic failure in Ukraine.""

The new battlefield leadership comes as Russia gears up for what is expected to be a large and more focused push to expand Russian control in the Donbas after failing to conquer the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. Sullivan reiterated support for the Ukrainian government, saying the United States is determined to do all it can to help Ukrainians resist this general and the forces he commands.

------

KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine's border guard agency says that about 2,200 Ukrainian men of fighting age have been detained so far while trying to leave the country in violation of martial law.

The agency said Sunday that some of them have used forged documents and others tried to bribe border guards to get out of the country.

It said some have been found dead while trying to cross the Carpathian mountains in adverse weather, without specifying the number.

Under martial law, Ukrainian men between 18 and 60 are barred from leaving the country so that they can be called up to fight.

WARSAW, Poland -- Sirens have sounded in some Polish cities to mark the anniversary of a 2010 plane crash that killed the country's president, despite protests that their sound would be unnecessarily traumatic for refugees from the war in Ukraine.

The sirens early Sunday were intended to add to the significance and the plaintive character of observances honouring the late president Lech Kaczynski, the first lady and 94 other prominent Poles killed 12 years ago in the crash of the presidential plane in Russia. Kaczynski was the twin of Jaroslaw Kaczynski -- the leader of the main governing Law and Justice party.

Provincial governors ignored calls not to use the sirens out of concern for refugees from neighbouring Ukraine, traumatized by air raid alarms. Authorities sent text messages to refugees' phones that the sirens would mean no danger.

------

KYIV, Ukraine -- The Ukrainian military says Russia has been beefing up its forces and trying to probe Ukrainian defences.

The Ukrainian military command said Sunday that the Russian troops have continued attempts to break Ukrainian defences near Izyum, southeast of Kharkiv. It reported that Russia was sending reinforcements to Izyum while continuing the shelling of Kharkiv.

The military added that the Russians also continued their attempts to take control of Mariupol, the Sea of Azov port that has been besieged by Russian forces for nearly 1.5 months.

After Russia's attempt to capture Kyiv and other big cities in northeastern Ukraine quickly failed, Ukrainian and western officials expect Moscow to launch a new offensive in eastern Ukraine, where Russia-backed separatists have fought Ukrainian forces for eight years.

------

KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he focused on the need to track down perpetrators of war crimes in a phone call with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

Zelenskyy said on Twitter that in Sunday's call ""we emphasized that all perpetrators of war crimes must be identified and punished.""

Ukraine has accused Russia of atrocities against civilians in Bucha and other places near Kyiv, where hundreds of slaughtered civilians, many with their hands bound and signs of torture, were found after Russian troops retreated.

Zelenskyy also said he and Scholz ""discussed anti-Russian sanctions, defence and financial support for Ukraine.""

------

VATICAN CITY -- Pope Francis has opened Holy Week with a call for an Easter truce in Ukraine to make room for a negotiated peace, highlighting the need for leaders to ""make some sacrifices for the good of the people.""

Celebrating Palm Sunday Mass before crowds in St. Peter's Square for the first time since the pandemic, Pope Francis called for ""weapons to be laid down to begin an Easter truce, not to reload weapons and resume fighting, no! A truce to reach peace through real negotiations.""

Francis did not refer directly to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but the reference was clear. He has repeatedly denounced the war and the suffering brought to innocent civilians.

HELSINKI -- Finland says that a shipment of art works from Russian museums has been returned to Russia after it was seized under European Union sanctions against Moscow.

Finland's customs service said late Saturday that the Foreign Ministry granted a special permit to return the consignment with a total insured value of around 42 million euros (US$46 million). It said that trucks carrying the art works from the Hermitage Museum and the Pavlovsk State Museum in St. Petersburg, among others, left Finnish territory on Saturday afternoon.

The shipment was seized at the Vaalimaa border crossing at the beginning of April. The works were en route to Russia after loan to museums in Europe and Japan. Experts say that art works loaned from Russia typically travel overland via Finland.

Russia has demanded the return of all works on loan to ""unfriendly"" nations that imposed sanctions following its invasion of Ukraine.

------

MOSCOW -- The Russian military says it has struck Ukrainian air defence batteries in the country's south and east.

Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Sunday that the military used air-launched missiles to hit Ukraine's S-300 air defence missile systems in Starobohdanivka in the southern Mykolaiv region and at an air base in Chuhuiv in the eastern Kharkiv region.

Konashenkov also said that sea-launched cruise missiles destroyed the headquarters of a Ukrainian military unit near Zvonetske in the Dnipro region.

The Russian military claims couldn't be independently verified.

KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk says more civilians are expected to leave Mariupol Sunday in their personal vehicles.

Evacuations are also planned from Berdyansk, Tokmak and Enerhodar in the south and Sieverierodonetsk, Lysychansk, Popasna and Rubizhne in the east.

Mariupol, a strategic port city on the Sea of Azov, has been besieged by Russian forces for nearly 1.5 months, cut from food, water and power supplies and pummeled by relentless bombardment that has killed at least 5,000, according to local officials.

Ukrainian authorities have urged civilians in the east to evacuate in the face of an imminent Russian offensive. They accused Russia of killing 52 people on Friday at the train station in the eastern city of Kramatorsk as they were preparing to evacuate.

------

GENEVA -- The UN refugee agency says the number of people who have left Ukraine since the beginning of the war has reached 4.5 million.

A regular update Sunday of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees' online portal on numbers of refugees fleeing Ukraine since Feb. 24 brought the total to some 4.5 million.

About 2.6 million of those fled at least initially to Poland and more than 686,000 to Romania. However, UNHCR notes that there are very few border controls within the European Union and it believes ""a large number of people"" have moved on from the first country they arrived in.

------

LONDON -- Britain's Ministry of Defence says that Russia's armed forces are seeking to respond to mounting losses by boosting troop numbers with personnel who had been discharged from military service since 2012.

In an intelligence update on Twitter, the ministry also said Sunday that the Russian military's efforts to ""generate more fighting power"" also include trying to recruit from Trans-Dniester, a breakaway region in Moldova that borders Ukraine.

Russia maintains some 1,500 troops in the region, which is not internationally recognized.

BORODIANKA, Ukraine -- Firefighters continued searching Saturday for survivors or the dead in the debris of destroyed buildings in a northern Ukrainian town that was occupied for weeks by Russian forces.

Residents of Borodianka expect to find dozens of victims under the rubble of the several buildings destroyed during fighting between Russian forces and Ukrainian troops. The town is about 75 kilometres (47 miles) northwest of the capital of Kyiv and had more than 12,000 residents.

Russian troops occupied Borodianka while advancing towards Kyiv in an attempt to encircle it. They retreated during the last days of March following fierce fighting. The town is without electricity, natural gas or other services.

A 77-year-old resident, Maria Vaselenko, said her daughter and son-in-law's bodies have been under rubble for 36 days because Russian soldiers would not allow residents to search for loved ones or their bodies. She said her two teenage grandchildren escaped to Poland but are now orphans.

""The Russians were shooting. And some people wanted to come and help, but they were shooting them,"" she told The Associated Press. ""They were putting explosives under dead people.""

------

MARIUPOL, Ukraine -- Shelling by Russian forces of Ukraine's key port of Mariupol on the Sea of Azov has collapsed several humanitarian corridors and made conditions seldom right for people to leave.

It was not clear Saturday how many people remained trapped in the city, which had a prewar population of 430,000. Ukrainian officials have put the number at about 100,000, but earlier this week, British defence officials said 160,000 people remained trapped in the city.

Ukrainian troops have refused to surrender the city, though much of it has been razed.

Resident Sergey Petrov said Saturday that recently two shells struck around him in quick succession, but neither exploded upon landing. He was in his garage at the time and said his mother later told him, ""I was born again.""

""A shell flew in and broke up into two parts but it did not explode, looks like it did not land on the detonator but on its side,"" he said.

He added that when another shell flew in and hit the garage, ""I am in shock. I don't understand what is happening. I have a hole in my garage billowing smoke. I run away and leave everything. I come back in several hours and find another shell lying there, also unexploded.""

Kramatorsk Station Missile Strike

A Russian missile strike at Kramatorsk railway station on Friday 8th April, 10:30am local time, appears to have killed many civilians, with the publicly announced death toll standing at 57 dead and 114 wounded.

Published casualty figures for earlier Russian missile strikes are widely believed to be underestimates, such as the attack against Yavoriv ‘Ukraine-NATO Partnership For Peace’ Military Base on 13th March (where international volunteers were receiving rudimentary training).

Kramatorsk is an important node in the infrastructure network connecting embattled Ukrainian forces in East Donbas to the rest of the country.

East Donbas, or, ‘The Leaky Cauldron’

From an early stage in the Russian invasion, Russia state-affiliated media has taken to identifying the East Donbas sector of the conflict as ‘the Cauldron’. Primarily this term emerged as part of the attempt to craft a positive narrative around Russia’s failure to secure large territorial gains in the war.

Reading the combat fronts was the wrong way to view Russia’s strategy, pundits declared. Russia’s aims were actually to destroy the Ukrainian Army, and one of the main areas this would be achieved was East Donbas.

The idea was that East Donbas was an area with a significant concentration of Ukrainian troops, and would be liable to being cut off from resupply. East Donbas is a strategic ‘salient’, or ‘bulge’, where the Russians should theoretically be able to bring more firepower to bear against the defenders and prosecute a successful attack over the long term. Having partially surrounded this ‘cauldron’, the Russians can ‘turn up the heat’.

The failure to properly disconnect the defenders in East Donbas from the rest of Ukraine has meant that if East Donbas is a cauldron, it has so far proved something of a leaky cauldron. Advances southward from Izyum appear to have been decisively stalled, with similar performance along the southern front of this sector. If Russia is to make progress in this war, they will need to achieve a major success in East Donbas over the coming weeks.

Explosions in Donetsk, probably due to Ukrainian shelling, took out an electrical substation on Bakhmetieva street. Russian shelling continues in the vicinity of Maryinka, East Donbas, as Vuhledar, Krasnohorivka, and Avdiivka are hit.

A Russian military convoy was recorded in Novozybkov, north of Ukraine, allegedly recycling to Donbas.

Satellite imagery near Kharkiv from April 8th showed a Russian military convoy moving south through Velykyi Burluk, en route to East Donbas.

A Russian ammunition warehouse near Luhansk was allegedly destroyed by Ukrainian bombardment. Another ammunition warehouse south of Velyka Novosilka was destroyed on Saturday 9th, 18:45 local time, according to drone footage.

On April 9th, 32 Su-35 ‘Flanker’ fighter jets were identified at Voronezh Malshevo airbase, 200km from the Ukrainian border.

A ‘high’ security threat has been declared in the Russian city of Kursk, in anticipation of Ukrainian military or sabotage operations.

Kherson-Mykolaiv Standoff

The combat front between Mykolaiv and Kherson has remained stable for many days, with both sides appearing to trade artillery fire across the 30 mile distance between the two cities.

The situation north of this region appears to be more fluid, with Ukrainian operations aiming to clear villages south of Kryviy Rih, while reports of Russian shelling and bombardment continue.

Mariupol Siege Ongoing

The siege of Mariupol continues. A fair amount of footage continues to emerge from Azov defenders, though there is a possibility that some of this material is from previous skirmishes (and released in small amounts in order to convey an impression of continued successes in the beleaguered city).

Russia has released footage claiming to show the destruction of a Ukrainian armoured vehicle by a Russian-made combat drone.

A recent claim by the Ukrainian Army that ‘around 40’ Russian vehicles were destroyed during a strike on a warehouse near Volnovakha, has been verified, with 35 vehicles destroyed.

It is possible that the vehicles were stored in such a dense concentration in order to hide them from aerial and satellite reconnaissance, decreasing the probability of a fatal airstrike — however, that same concentration resulted in a large toll of vehicles when the hidden unit was discovered and hit.

Missile Strikes and Air Defences

The Russian Ministry of Defence claims to have destroyed S-300 surface to air missile (SAM) systems at Chuhuiv airbase (near Kharkiv) and Starobohdanovka (near Mykolaiv), while also claiming the destruction of a National Guard base at Zvonetske south of Dnipro.

The mayor of Dnipro states that the ‘total destruction’ of Dnipro airport following repeated missile strikes. Fragments of a high-precision Russian missile were recovered near Huliaypole, north of Polohy, east of Zaporizhzhia.

On Friday 8th April, Slovakia transferred its S-300PMU SAM systems to Ukraine, according to local footage.

Kharkiv Bombardment Continues

Dozens of incidents of Russian shelling continue around Kharkiv on a daily basis, ranging from MLRS Grad and Smerch rockets, artillery, and ‘tanks’. According to the head of the regional administration, 66 such incidents took place within a 24 hour period.

Kiev

Footage has emerged showing previous combat operations around Kiev, which were abandoned by the Russians on 30th March.

Following the Russian withdrawal from Kiev and North Ukraine, thousands of foreign journalists have descended upon the capital to gather footage and make reports. One photo shows 6 journalists photographing a cat, while a hundred others swarm a column of burnt-out, rusting Russian vehicles (we do not publish these photos here since the copyrights to such media are owned by AP, AFP, Reuters, and other journalistic footage cartels, whose business activities revolve around reselling this footage in packets to wealthy mainstream news outlets).

1,222 Kiev residents were killed by the Russian Army during the five-week occupation of outlying districts, according to the Ukrainian Attorney General.

According to the World Bank, the economy of Ukraine is set to contract by 45.1% this year, with Russia’s contracting 11.2%. Over 10% of Ukraine’s pre-war population has already left the country as refugees, with the majority in Poland.

Kherson Misinformation

It has been claimed that during a protest against Russian occupation on 10th April (day 46), Russian troops opened fire to disperse protesters. However, the footage appears to be a badly edited version of a clip that emerged on 5th March, and was widely circulated in international media.",https://www.lotuseaters.com/ukraine-conflict-day-44-to-46

US lawmaker Liz Cheney has said that European countries need to “understand that they’re funding that genocidal campaign” by continuing to buy oil and gas from Russia.

Cheney told CNN’s “State of the Union” programme that missile strike on the Kramatorsk Ukrainian train station this week “clearly is genocide”.

At least 52 people died on Friday, including children, and dozens were injured, after Russian forces carried out a missile strike on the railway station as civilians were trying to flee the fighting.

Cheney said:

I understand the economic consequences to countries in Western Europe if they were to impose a kind of oil and gas embargo that the US has imposed against Russian oil and gas – but they need to do it.

Cheney, a Wyoming Republican, added “they need to understand that every single time, every single day that they are continuing to import Russian oil and gas, they’re funding Putin’s genocide in Ukraine.”

The government is facing fresh calls to reveal the identities of eight sanctioned Russian oligarchs who were allowed to buy “golden visas” to live in the UK.

Stephen Kinnock, the shadow minister for immigration, is demanding that the home secretary, Priti Patel , name the eight Russians on the sanctions list and publish a long-withheld report on the now scrapped visa purchase programme.

The government closed the “tier 1 investor visa” scheme in February as diplomatic relations with Russia came under severe strain. A week later, Russia invaded Ukraine, prompting the US, EU and UK to impose sanctions on many of Russia’s richest people to try to put pressure on Putin’s regime.

Russian President Vladimir Putin appoints new war commander

Russian President Vladimir Putin has appointed a new general to direct the war in Ukraine as his military shifts plans after a failure to take Kyiv, according to a US official and a European official.

Army Gen. Alexander Dvornikov , commander of Russia’s Southern Military District, has been named theatre commander of Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine, according to senior sources.

White House national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said “no appointment of any general can erase the fact that Russia has already faced a strategic failure in Ukraine.” Sullivan described the general as having a record of brutality against civilians in Syria and said “we can expect more of the same.”



Speaking to CNN’s “State of the Union, he said:



This general will just be another author of crimes and brutality against Ukrainian civilians. And the United States, as I said before, is determined to do all that we can to support Ukrainians as they resist him and they resist the forces that he commands.

Dvornikov gained prominence while leading the Russian group of forces in Syria, where Moscow has waged a military campaign since 2015 to shore up President Bashar Assad’s regime during a devastating civil war.



Dvornikov, started his career as a platoon commander in 1982. He fought during the second war in Chechnya and took several top positions before being placed in charge of the Russian troops in Syria in 2015.

In 2016, Putin awarded Dvornikov the Hero of Russia medal, one of the country’s highest awards. Dvornikov has served as the commander of the Southern Military District since 2016, reported the Association Press.

A European official told CNN that the appointment “speaks to a Russian acknowledgement that it is going extremely badly and they need to do something differently.”



“They do things in the same old way,” the official added.

CNN reports:

Dvornikov, 60, was the first commander of Russia’s military operations in Syria, after Putin sent troops there in September 2015 to back the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. During Dvornikov’s command in Syria from September 2015 to June 2016, Russian aircraft backed the Assad regime and its allies as they laid siege to rebel-held eastern Aleppo, bombarding densely populated neighborhoods and causing major civilian casualties. The city fell to Syrian government forces in December 2016. Russian forces have used a similarly heavy-handed approach in parts of Ukraine, striking residential buildings in major cities and demolishing much of the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol.

Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has said the decision by Germany and France not to allow Ukraine to join NATO in 2008 was a “strategic mistake”.

In a Sunday morning interview on NBC’s Meet the Press, Kuleba said:

The strategic mistake that was made in 2008 by Germany and France who rejected the efforts of the United States and other allies to bring Ukraine in, is something that we are paying for. It’s not Germany or France that are paying the cost for this mistake, it’s Ukraine. If we were a member of NATO, this war wouldn’t take place.

He added:

Ukraine won the battle for Kyiv. Now another battle is coming.

The airport in the east-central Ukrainian city of Dnipro had been destroyed in a Russian strike, the head of the Dnipropetrovsk regional military administration, Valentyn Reznichenko said on Sunday.

And one more attack on the airport in Dnipro. There is nothing left of it already. The airport and the infrastructure nearby have been destroyed. But rockets keep flying.

Reznichenko said information about casualties was being clarified.

The airport has been hit by Russian forces before - Reznichenko said on March 15 that a Russian missile strike had taken out the runway and damaged a terminal building.

Lesia Vasylenko, a Ukrainian MP, said on Twitter:

Russia artillery attack on Dnipro airport leaves no infrastructure and destroys everything around the airport. Such a shame, as the airport was completely renovated just last year. All the investments and all the efforts completely wrecked

Yurii Sobolevskyi, deputy head of the Kherson Regional Council, said locals held a “peaceful rally” Sunday in the Russian-occupied city of Kherson that was dispersed by Russian forces.

Posting on Facebook he said:

Today in Kherson a peaceful rally took place in front of the Yubileiny concert hall to commemorate the victims of Russian aggression,” he said on Facebook. “As expected, the occupiers dispersed it.

He said locals were participating in rallies at “great risk,” facing down intimidation and the threat of disappearance.

The Guardian was not immediately able to verify the rally or its turnout.

Also on Sunday the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on Sunday said Russians in the town of Nova Kakhovka in Kherson region had used local printing houses to prepare brochures, booklets and posters in preparation for an apparent referendum on the establishment of a so-called “Kherson People’s Republic”.

CNN reported:

Separatists in eastern Ukraine held referendums in 2014 on the formation of “people’s republics,” in voting that was dismissed by Ukraine and Western countries as a sham. Serhii Khlan, a member of the Kherson regional council, said Russian sympathizers holding Russian tricolor flags had tried to organize a rally in the city of Nova Kakhovka, posting a photo on Facebook that he said showed a very small turnout compared with a pro-Ukrainian rally. “This is all you need to know about the probability of a Kherson People’s Republic in the Kherson region,” he said. “This will not happen, because this is Ukraine!”

Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, who led the prosecution of the former Serbian president Slobodan Milošević at the international criminal tribunal, has called for Russia to be kicked off the UN security council – or be stripped of veto powers.

Speaking on Times Radio, he said:

A very important step that should be taken is to kick Russia off the security council, or withdraw its veto, or in some other way stop it from having the power to stop itself being tried. That power, just think about this, is the equivalent of Hitler being given the veto power in 1944 to say who would be tried at Nuremberg in 1946.”

He added: “Saying that the present system is a bit broken or incomplete doesn’t mean to say we should not put all our effort into ensuring that it is improved ...

“Another way is to ensure that after this conflict ends that identified Russian potential defendants are handed over by Russia.”

The international community may be more willing to take the step now, he said, because the Russian invasion of Ukraine has shaken the world by bringing it to the brink of nuclear disaster and forcing it to look at the shortcomings of the current system.

Ukraine is accusing Russian forces who occupied the former Chernobyl nuclear power plant of stealing deadly radioactive substances from research laboratories.

In an update posted on Facebook , the State Agency for Managing the Exclusion Zone claimed that Russian soldiers had entered the storage area of the Ecocentre research base and taken 133 toxic materials.

“Even a small part of this activity is deadly if handled unprofessionally,” the agency said.



It added that the location of the stolen substances is “currently unknown”.

“The degree of preservation and safety of calibration sources and sample radioactive solutions is impossible to be established, and the condition of the damaged will be determined after the appropriate inventory and measurements are carried out.”

The statement has not been independently verified.

It follows comments made by German Gulashchenko, Ukraine’s energy minister, on Friday after he visited the exclusion zone. He said that Russian troops had exposed themselves to “shocking” levels of nuclear radiation.

“They dug bare soil contaminated with radiation, collected radioactive sand in bags for fortification, breathed this dust,” Gulashchenko said via Facebook.

He predicted that some of the soldiers may only have a year to live due to the exposure.

Ukrainian presidential adviser: meeting between Zelenskiy and Putin can only happen after Donbas battle

In televised remarks the Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak has said Volodymyr Zelenskiy would likely meet with Vladimir Putin only after an expected major battle for the eastern Donbas region.

Ukraine is ready for big battles. Ukraine must win them, particularly in Donbas. And after that, Ukraine will get a more powerful negotiating position, from which it can dictate certain conditions. After that, the presidents will meet. That may take two or three weeks.

Moscow has turned its gaze on the Donbas , where a major offensive is thought to be imminent.

One corridor will operate in the Donetsk region from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia, by private vehicle only.

Three other corridors have been established to the Zaporizhzhia region from Berdiansk, Tokmak and Energodar, running by both bus and private transport.



No corridor from the southern city of Melitopol

In the Luhansk region, five corridors will be operational. They will all run to Bakhmut from: Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske and Rubizhne.

Russia claims missile strikes in Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv and Kharkiv regions

The Russian ministry of defence said on Sunday that its forces had carried out missile strikes in Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv and Kharkiv regions.

Defense ministry spokesman Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov said in a statement:

During the night in the village of Zvonetske - Dnipropetrovsk region - high-precision sea-based missiles destroyed the headquarters and base of the Dnipro nationalist battalion, where reinforcements from foreign mercenaries arrived the other day. High-precision air-launched missiles in the area of the settlement of Stara Bohdanivka, Mykolaiv region and at the Chuhuiv military airfield [in Kharkiv region] destroyed launchers of Ukrainian S-300 anti-aircraft missile systems identified by reconnaissance.

The Guardian could not immediately verify those claims. The Russian military has repeatedly claimed it is targeting “foreign mercenaries” and “nationalist” formations in Ukraine and denies targeting civilian infrastructure, despite evidence to the contrary.

Earlier on Sunday Valentyn Reznichenko, head of the Dnipropetrovsk regional military administration in east-central Ukraine, said there had been a series of strikes around the region over the past 24 hours.

He said:

There were sirens almost every hour and, unfortunately, there are incoming shells in different areas.

He added that a Russian strike on the regional capital of Dnipro had destroyed infrastructure, leaving one person injured, with rescuers working for hours to extinguish a fire.

Reznichenko said a rocket hit an industrial facility in the Pavlohrad district, to the east of Dnipro, destroying the premises and causing a fire while a farming building was burned down in the Dnipo district. No casualties were reported in either incident, he said.

11.38am BST

UK policing minister Kit Malthouse has said Britain could impose sanctions on Russian troops and generals suspected of committing war crimes in Ukraine.

Speaking on Sky News’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme Malthouse said that it was important that evidence of atrocities was gathered as “assiduously as possible” as the conflict continues.

While that is ongoing we can take action domestically around sanctions we are able to put on individuals, including combatants, leading generals and others involved in it, to signal our recognition of their part in this dreadful, dreadful assault upon a free democratic country.

Malthouse called Boris Johnson’s walkabout with Volodymyr Zelensky through the streets of Kyiv during a surprise visit on Saturday “quite a remarkable moment”.



Answering criticism (including by shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper this morning - see this post at 11.12 ) Malthouse said progress admitting Ukrainian refugees to the UK had been disappointing but was now “motoring” .

He said:



I know that people are disappointed with the progress of the visa regime. The Home Secretary has been out this week expressing her frustration and regret that it hasn’t been quicker.

Veneditktova told Sky News:

This morning we have 1,222 dead people in the Kyiv region only. Of course, what we saw on the ground in all regions of Ukraine is war crimes, crimes against humanity, and we do everything to fix it.

Referring to the missile attack on a railway station in the Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk which killed more than 50 people, Veneditktova said:

Absolutely, it’s a war crime. It was a Russian missile which killed more 50 people. These people just wanted to save their lives. They wanted to be evacuated with kids. It was women, it was children, and they just wanted to save their lives.

Yvette Cooper, the UK’s shadow home secretary , was also on the BBC One’s Sunday Morning show this morning, as well as Sky.

She described delays in Ukrainian refugees getting UK visas as “a total nightmare” and said Labour would only apply security checks to those coming into the UK.

Cooper told the BBC it was “totally shameful” that only 1,200 people have arrived under the Homes for Ukraine scheme despite 200,000 people offering to give a refugee a home.

She told Sky that there should be an emergency Visa, which would “essentially” be a emergency visa with security checks.

That’s what we need to do. You don’t need a lot of this additional fees or requirements, for example, to come on the homes for Ukraine scheme, Ukrainian families are supposed to prove their residence as to where they were living before the first of January. So people are uploading utility bills or other kinds of details that then has to be checked by caseworkers that then adds to delays. The point about security checks is ministers and officials have themselves admitted you can do them on the spot. You can do them within a matter of hours, so there’s absolutely no excuse for these weeks of delays.

Pascal Hundt told Sky News:

The security conditions were not good, the security guarantees we got were were not good either, so at around 20 kilometres from Mariupol we had to go back.

The Red Cross gathered refugees on the way and private cars joined the convoy under the organisation’s flag, with more than 1,000 people finally reaching Zaporizhzhia.

Hundt said:

Many more of such operations will need to take place in the coming days, in the coming weeks. It’s urgent and we really are in contact with the Russian authorities with the Ukrainian authorities to ensure that safe passage is being provided to these people so that they can move freely and safely to a much safer place.

Hundt also said that following the deadly missile attack on a railway station at Kramatorsk, had worsened the situation with more people using private cars rather than trains to escape the Russian advance.

Addressing the “free people of a brave country”, Zelenskiy said:

That is why it is not just the moral duty of all democracies, all the forces of Europe, to support Ukraine’s desire for peace. This is, in fact, a strategy of defence for every civilized state.

In his video address, Zelenskiy thanked the leaders of Britain and Austria for their visits to Kyiv on Saturday and pledges of further support, AP reports.

He also thanked the European Commission president and Canada’s prime minister for a global fundraising event that brought in more than 10 billion euros ($11 billion) for the millions of Ukrainians who have fled their homes.

Zelenskiy repeated his call for a complete embargo on Russian oil and gas, which he called the sources of Russia’s “self-confidence and impunity.”

He said:

Freedom does not have time to wait. When tyranny begins its aggression against everything that keeps the peace in Europe, action must be taken immediately.

In an interview with the Associated Press’ inside his heavily guarded presidential office complex, Zelenskiy said he was committed to negotiating a diplomatic end to the war even though Russia has “tortured” Ukraine.

He also acknowledged that peace likely will not come quickly. Talks so far have not included Russian President Vladimir Putin or other top officials.

He said:

We have to fight, but fight for life. You can’t fight for dust when there is nothing and no people. That’s why it is important to stop this war.

Zelenskiy noted the increased support but expressed frustration when asked if weapons and equipment Ukraine has received from the West is sufficient to shift the war’s outcome.

He said:

Not yet. Of course it’s not enough.

Zelenskiy: Europe is Putin's target

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy gave his late-night address on Saturday.

In it he says Russia’s aggression is not, and has never been, limited to Ukraine, and the whole of Europe is a target.

Zelenskiy again urged the west to impose a total embargo on Russian energy products and to supply Ukraine with more weapons.

Russia’s use of force was “a catastrophe that will inevitably hit everyone”, he added.

With Russian forces gathering in the east of the country, Zelenskiy said Ukraine was ready for a tough battle.

He added:

This will be a hard battle, we believe in this fight and our victory. We are ready to simultaneously fight and look for diplomatic ways to put an end to this war.

Ukrainian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak said Zelenskiy and Vladimir Putin would not meet until after Russia was defeated in the east.

Johnson's Kyiv visit 'timely and very important', says Zelenskiy adviser

One of Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s adviser s has called Boris Johnson’s visit to the Ukrainian capital Kyiv “very timely and very important”.

Speaking on BBC One’s Sunday Morning Ihor Zhovkva , a senior diplomatic adviser to Zelenskiy, said that the UK prime minister “did not come empty handed”, with the pair discussing various types of support the UK could offer, including anti-ship missiles and financial support.

Zhovkva said the anti-ship missiles would help defend cities like Odesa under attack by Russian warships.

The message from Zhovkva was clear. Ukraine needed “weapons, weapons and more weapons”, he said.

A UK crossbench peer offering her home to a fleeing Ukrainian family has said the UK’s visa scheme is “unwelcoming” and adding to refugees’ trauma.

Lady Finlay is offering space in her Cardiff home to a mother and two children, but has been waiting for three weeks for their visas to be cleared through the Homes for Ukraine scheme, PA reports.

Her husband, Professor Andrew Finlay, spent eight hours filling out forms for their visa applications on 18 March, the day the scheme launched, she said.

The father of the family, who were already known to her and her husband, is a doctor and has remained in Kyiv, she said. The couple has also submitted an application for him in the event he also leaves Ukraine due to injury or other reasons.

Finlay added:

He’s decided to stay to serve his country and he’s basically entrusted his wife and two children to us. We’ve said we will do whatever is needed for however long to support them, and we know that it might be years.

Each of the family’s four applications had to be made separately. And despite repeated efforts in person at a visa information centre and over the phone, the only official response has been four separate emails on Thursday to say each applicant is “in the system” to be processed.

She said:

The silence is awful... nobody can help me find out what’s happened to these people’s applications. I think there is a failure of recognition that this uncertainty is adding to the trauma that these people have already experienced. These aren’t just pieces of paper, these are people... and these are people who have lost everything. We need to provide an environment where they know that they are welcome and they are safe - how can they feel welcome? The message from the system is that the country is not welcoming them.

Finlay described the preparations she and her husband have taken to make their home welcoming to the family - including clearing space in their kitchen, installing a radio which can be tuned into Ukrainian radio and washing soft toys for the younger child.

Finlay said the Home Office was “not functioning as it should”.

This feels as if it’s totally reactive, as if nobody had looked carefully at the visa application processes over recent years and said: ‘in the event of a major conflict in the world, where all of a sudden, we have to deal with a mass migration of people, how are we going to do it?’

A government spokesperson said:

We continue to process visas for the Homes for Ukraine scheme as quickly as possible, but accept progress has not been quick enough. The Home Office has made changes to visa processing - the application form has been streamlined, Ukrainian passport holders can now apply online and do their biometrics checks once in the UK, and greater resource has gone into the system.

PA has a moving story of the reception two men who drove two ambulances full of medical supplies into Ukraine.

Charles Blackmore , a British executive who founded commercial intelligence specialists Audere International in 2015, drove one of the two vehicles from the UK to Lutsk via Warsaw, arriving in the Ukrainian city on Friday evening.

Blackmore was moved to do something more personal after speaking to his American friend Herb Holtz, whose grandfather left Ukraine in 1905.

Speaking from Warsaw’s Chopin Airport on his way back to the UK, he told the PA news agency that the pair had been given an “incredible reception” by the while Ukrainians welcomed them with speeches, and patriotic songs.

He said:

When you drive through checkpoints, when you drive through cities in curfew, when 70% of the city of Lutsk - which is 200,000 people - have left the city, you’re going into a ghost town. And when you see what is happening, to be able to bring the aid to the people was a very important journey.

Audere, which provides intelligence to parties wishing to make overseas investments, has already been active in the effort in Ukraine since the start of Russia’s invasion, helping with evacuations and conducting five resupply operations.





Blackmore said:

We had been involved in evacuating people out of Afghanistan last August. We did not expect some seven months later to be involved in a second evacuation, this time in Europe. But when it happened we decided that we did actually want, and we had the right operating template, to be able to contribute to the humanitarian aid, to the evacuation and to providing support for the Ukrainian people.



The company has delivered two tonnes of food and 300 litres of liquids, as well as essential items like first aid and clothes, and extensive medical supplies.





Blackmore said he was moved to do something more personal after speaking to his American friend Holtz.



He said, ‘I want to do something meaningful. ‘My grandfather was Ukrainian, he left in 1905. I want to do something more than write a check’. So I said, ‘Let’s buy a couple of ambulances, one each, and let’s both first take them down, take them into Ukraine, and see the end result’.

The ambulances were sourced were sourced via a charity in the UK and filled with two tonnes of medical supplies.

And although they were delivered to Lutsk, in western Ukraine, Blackmore said he had been assured the vehicles and supplies would be going “right to the front line” including Bucha.

Blackmore said the Ukrainians “really appreciate” the help and support coming from the UK.



He said:





What impressed us most was the cheerfulness and the resolve of the Ukrainian people. And it’s very important that we stand even closer behind them and give them the more support and we’re going to look to do that ourselves.

Nine humanitarian corridors to help people escape fighting in the east

Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk has said that Kyiv has agreed the use of nine humanitarian corridors to help people to escape heavy fighting in the east of the country, including in private cars from Mariupol.

In a statement on her Telegram channel on Sunday Vereshchuk said:

All the routes for the humanitarian corridors in the Luhansk region will work as long as there is a ceasefire by the occupying Russian troops.

A total of 4,553 people were evacuated from Ukrainian cities through humanitarian corridors on Saturday, fewer than the 6,665 who escaped on Friday, Vereshchuk said on Saturday.

The “constant arrival of wounded [Russian] soldiers” is putting strain on medical staff and overwhelming medical supplies, the Ukraine defence report added.



In the absence of a stable supply of spare parts and units, Russian troops are forced to “work around the clock” to restore and repair equipment, officials claimed.

In the Luhansk region, the measures of Russian-occupation administrations on forced mobilisation of the population in temporarily occupied territories are being strengthened.



According to the report, in the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, Ukrainian soldiers thwarted eight Russian attacks, destroyed four tanks, eight units of armoured vehicles and 13 air targets including three aircraft, one helicopter, five UAVs and four winged missiles.

In response to mounting losses, the Russian armed forces is seeking to bolster troop numbers with personnel discharged from military service since 2012 , according to the latest British intelligence report.



Efforts to generate more fighting power also include trying to recruit from the unrecognised Transnistria region of Moldova, the report added.

An earlier report said Russia’s withdrawal from northern Ukrainian has left evidence of “disproportionate targeting” of civilians, mass graves, the use of hostages as human shields.

Russia’s departure from northern Ukraine leaves evidence of the disproportionate targeting of non-combatants including the presence of mass graves, the fatal use of hostages as human shields , and mining of civilian infrastructure. Russian forces continue to use IEDs to inflict casualties, lower morale, and restrict Ukrainian freedom of movement. Russian forces also continue to attack infrastructure targets with a high risk of collateral harm to civilians, including a nitrate acid tank at Rubizhne.”

An earlier report claimed Russian forces continue to use improvised explosive devices (IEDs) to inflict casualties, lower morale, and restrict Ukrainian freedom of movement.

Ukraine is ready for a tough battle in east, Zelenskiy says

Ukraine is ready for a tough battle with Russian forces amassing in the east of the country, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Saturday.

In case you missed his earlier news conference, the president warned that while the threat to the capital had receded, it was rising in the east.



This will be a hard battle, we believe in this fight and our victory. We are ready to simultaneously fight and look for diplomatic ways to put an end to this war.”

Ukranian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak said Zelenskiy and Russian president Vladimir Putin would not meet until after the country defeated Russia in the east, which would bolster its negotiating position.



We are paying a very high price. But Russia must get rid of its imperial illusions,” he said, according to the Interfax Ukraine news agency.

Air-raid sirens sounded in cities across eastern Ukraine, which has become the focus of Russian military action after the withdrawal from around Kyiv.

Ukrainian officials have urged civilians in the east to flee.

A recently discovered grave with dozens of Ukrainian civilians has been found in Buzova , a liberated village near the capital Kyiv, local officials said.

Taras Didych, head of the Dmytrivka community that includes Buzova and several other nearby villages, told Ukrainian television that the bodies were found in a ditch near a petrol station. The number of those who died is yet to be confirmed.

“Now, we are returning to life, but during the occupation we had our ‘hotspots’, many civilians died,” Didych said.

The Guardian is not able to immediately verify the reports.

Many towns and villages surrounding the capital, including Makariv, Bucha, Irpin and Dmytrivka, sustained heavy casualties during the first month of war.

As the towns revert back to Ukrainian control, discoveries of mass graves and civilian casualties have triggered a wave of international condemnation, in particular over deaths in the town of Bucha, northwest of the capital.

UK pledges to send more arms

Boris Johnson has pledged a major new infusion of British arms and financial aid to help counter the expected deadly new phase in Russia’s military offensive during a surprise trip to Kyiv on Saturday.

After meeting with Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy , the Johnson said:

Ukraine has defied the odds and pushed back Russian forces from the gates of Kyiv, achieving the greatest feat of arms of the 21st century. It is because of president Zelenskiy’s resolute leadership and the invincible heroism and courage of the Ukrainian people that Putin’s monstrous aims are being thwarted. I made clear today that the United Kingdom stands unwaveringly with them in this ongoing fight, and we are in it for the long run. We are stepping up our own military and economic support and convening a global alliance to bring this tragedy to an end, and ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation.”

No 10 said Britain would send 120 armoured vehicles and new anti-ship missile systems to Ukraine. The missiles can do serious damage to Russian warships and could be used to tackle the Russian navy siege of Black Sea ports. The UK pledged £100m in military assistance last week, including another 800 anti-tank missiles, more anti-aircraft weapons, “suicide drones”, which hover over the battlefield before attacking a target, and helmets, body armour and night-vision goggles.

Without oil embargo, Russia has 'sense of impunity', Zelenskiy says

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy delivered another signature national address , noting that his country “does not have time to wait” while pushing for an oil embargo on Russia .

Ukraine does not have time to wait. Freedom does not have time to wait. When tyranny launches aggression against everything that keeps peace in Europe, action must be taken immediately. It is necessary to act in a principled fashion. And the oil embargo should be the first step. At the level of all democracies, the whole civilised world. Then Russia will feel it. Then it will be an argument for them - to seek peace, to stop pointless violence.”

The Ukrainian president urged for “more painful restrictions” on Russia’s cash flow, primarily upon oil and gas.

First of all this applies to the oil business. The democratic world can definitely give up Russian oil and make it toxic to all other states. Oil is one of the two sources of Russian self-confidence, their sense of impunity.”

Zelenskiy also pushed for gas sanctions, saying over time this “will also be shut down”.

“It’s just inevitable. Not only for safety, but also for environmental reasons,” he added.
