China’s foreign minister has told his Spanish counterpart his country does not want to be impacted by Western economic sanctions imposed on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine last month, according to state media.

“China is not a party to the crisis, still less wants to be affected by the sanctions,” Wang Yi said, according to a readout of a phone call with Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares that was published on Tuesday.

He added that China rejects sanctions in principle and “has the right to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests”, calling the nearly three-week conflict in Ukraine “the product of the accumulation and intensification of European security contradictions over the years”.

For his part, Albares wrote on Twitter: “I have talked to my counterpart from China, Wang Yi about the consequences of the war in Ukraine and the means to end it.”

The discussion came as pressure grows on China to withdraw support from an increasingly isolated Russia, which has been hit by a series of tough sanctions imposed by the United States and Western allies.

The readout of the call did not mention recent reports citing US officials that Russia had asked China for military and economic help after the start of the war on February 24. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman had previously dismissed the reports as “malicious” US disinformation.





Separately, the ministry gave little detail on what Yang Jiechi, director of China’s central foreign affairs commission, had discussed with US President Joe Biden’s National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan during a marathon meeting on Monday in Italy’s capital, Rome.

The two had “frank, in-depth and constructive” talks, including on strained relations between Beijing and Washington over Taiwan, it said. Yang was cited as saying the US government was not sticking to its commitment to refrain from supporting Taiwan’s independence.

He also demanded Washington acknowledge how sensitive the Taiwan issue is and not go further down a “very dangerous road”.

China regards the self-governing democratic island republic as part of the People’s Republic and has threatened to take it back by force if it formally declares independence. The US is committed to Taiwan’s defence capability and supplies it with arms.

The White House, meanwhile, said Sullivan made clear during the “intense” seven-hour meeting that the Biden administration has deep concerns about China’s alignment with Russia at this time.

Before the talks in Rome, Sullivan had warned China to avoid helping Russia evade punishment from sanctions that have hammered the Russian economy. “We will not allow that to go forward,” he said.

Russia has denied it needs China’s help.

“No, Russia has its own potential to continue the operation, which, as we have said, is unfolding in accordance with the plan and will be completed on time and in full,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/15/china-does-not-want-to-be-impacted-by-russia-sanctions-fm

China's foreign minister, Wang Yi, says Beijing wants to avoid being impacted by U.S. sanctions over Russia's war with Ukraine. ""China is not a party to the crisis, nor does it want the sanctions to affect China,"" Wang said Monday during a call with Spanish counterpart Jose Manuel Albares to discuss the crisis in Ukraine. ""China has the right to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests."" His comments are seen as one of Beijing's most explicit statements yet on the unprecedented barrage of international sanctions imposed against Russia's corporate and financial system. The measures came in response to the Kremlin's full-scale offensive into Ukraine, which began Feb. 24.

The White House has warned China not to provide Russia with an economic lifeline as the Kremlin steps up its onslaught on Ukraine. The U.S. says it fears China, a key strategic ally of Moscow, may seek to cushion the impact of measures designed to destroy Russia's economy if the war continues. There are concerns among market participants that Chinese companies could soon become embroiled in financial penalties after reports that Moscow had asked Beijing for assistance to support its Ukraine invasion. China has denied these reports, while Russia has said it did not request military aid from Beijing. Since Russia's attack on Ukraine, Beijing has refused to call it an invasion and said China would maintain normal trade with both countries. China has not joined the U.S., EU and other countries' sanctions on Russia. China has said, however, that it is ""deeply"" worried about the crisis in Ukraine.

'Intense' talks

Officials from the U.S. and China met on Monday to discuss a range of bilateral issues, including Russia's war with Ukraine. The talks, which were held in Rome, spanned seven hours and were described as ""intense"" by one senior administration official. The U.S. has warned of consequences for any country that provides Russia with support amid the Kremlin's conflict with Ukraine.

""We are watching very closely to the extent to which the PRC [People's Republic of China] or any country in the world provides support material, economic, financial, rhetorical otherwise, to this war of choice that President [Vladimir] Putin is waging against the government of Ukraine, against the state of Ukraine and against the people of Ukraine,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price said at a news briefing Monday. ""We have been very clear both privately with Beijing and publicly with Beijing that there would be consequences for any such support,"" Price said.",https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/15/ukraine-crisis-china-wants-to-avoid-us-sanctions-over-russias-war.html

WASHINGTON — Two days after national security advisor Jake Sullivan warned his Chinese counterpart of serious consequences if Beijing helps Russia wage its war against Ukraine, what exactly they might be remains shrouded in secrecy. ""We're going to have this conversation directly with China and Chinese leadership, not through the media,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Tuesday. Psaki said that Sullivan was ""very direct about the consequences"" during his Monday meeting in Rome with China's top foreign policy official, Yang Jiechi. ""But in terms of any potential impacts or consequences, we'll lead those through private diplomatic channels at this point,"" Psaki said. As Russia's invasion of Ukraine approaches its fourth week, concerns over how Western allies will react if China or Chinese companies try to assist Moscow in evading sanctions imposed by the U.S., U.K., Europe and Japan have added a new level of uncertainty to global markets already reeling from the collapse of the Russian economy. That uncertainty is compounded by the fresh memory of what happened the last time the White House issued vague warnings about consequences, during the lead-up to Russia's invasion. On Feb. 20, four days before Russian troops marched into Ukraine, Psaki issued a statement saying the U.S. was ""ready to impose swift and severe consequences"" if Russian carried out its apparent plans.

At the time, few analysts believed the United States and Europe could actually reach consensus on the most severe sanctions under consideration — like freezing Russia's central bank reserves. But they did, catching both Moscow and Wall Street off guard. When it comes to China, no one wants to make the same mistake again. Moscow has reportedly asked Beijing for military and economic assistance to wage its war against Ukraine, although both governments publicly deny it. But China has little interest in becoming embroiled in the economic battle between Moscow and the rest of the developed world. ""China is not a party to the crisis, nor does it want the sanctions to affect China,"" foreign minister Wang Yi said during a phone call Monday with Spain's foreign minister, Jose Manuel Albares. Still, Wang insisted that ""China has the right to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,"" according to an official notice of the call from Beijing.",https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/16/russia-sees-china-as-lifeline-against-sanctions-but-us-threatens-consequences-if-beijing-helps.html

Beijing: China does not want to be impacted by Western economic sanctions on Russia, state media reported Tuesday, as pressure grows on Beijing to withdraw support from an isolated Moscow.

Beijing has refused to condemn its close ally Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, while blaming the United States and NATO's ""eastward expansion"" for worsening tensions.

Moscow and Beijing have grown closer in recent times, in what Washington sees as an increasingly hostile alliance of the authoritarian nuclear powers.

""China is not a party to the crisis, still less wants to be affected by the sanctions,"" Wang Yi said, according to a readout of a phone call with his Spanish counterpart Jose Manuel Albares published on Tuesday.

China has ""always opposed using sanctions to solve problems, let alone unilateral sanctions that has no basis in international law, which will... harm people's livelihood in all countries"", Wang said according to the readout.

Almost three weeks after Russian troops marched into Ukraine, Moscow's forces have bombarded and besieged several towns and cities.

Fighting has killed thousands and destroyed infrastructure, as well as causing millions to flee the country.

Wang's comments were published after a seven-hour meeting between high-ranking US and Chinese officials in Rome, at which Washington said the US had expressed concern about ""alignment"" between Russia and China.

US media has reported that Russia has asked China for military and economic assistance, as its troops struggle to make ground and its economy faces devastation from Western sanctions.

The New York Times, citing unnamed US officials, said there was no indication whether China had responded.

But Beijing has so far sent mixed signals on Russia's bloody invasion and US officials say the jury is still out on how China will act.

Asked about articles saying Moscow had asked Beijing for help, a foreign ministry spokesman accused the US of ""spreading disinformation"" against China.

Deep concerns

In the Rome meeting on Monday with US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, China's senior diplomat Yang Jiechi reiterated the country's stance that Beijing is ""committed to promoting peace talks"", the official Xinhua news agency reported Tuesday.

China called on all parties to exercise ""maximum restraint"" and ""protect civilians"" in the Ukraine crisis at the meeting.

The international community should support such talks to achieve substantive results as soon as possible, Yang said.

Although Beijing does not back Western sanctions, the White House is pressuring the world's second-largest economy to refrain from rescuing Russia from potential default or sending weaponry.

""We've communicated very clearly to Beijing that we won't stand by,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price said.

""We will not allow any country to compensate Russia for its losses.""
