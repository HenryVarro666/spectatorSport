Hacking, bombings‚Ä¶ If the causes can be multiple, the consequences are the same. International observers and the country‚Äôs population fear a widespread blackout.

As Russian tanks enter Ukrainian territory, internet shutdowns are increasing, especially in the country‚Äôs second largest city, Kharkiv. Coincidentally or not, during this same period, Russian cyberattacks disrupted many bank and government sites. Some international experts fear a widespread blackout, a possibility that would make Russia‚Äôs job that much easier.

Denial of service (DDoS) attacks on the Ukrainian internet network have multiplied in recent weeks. However, these DDoS attacks do not seem to be the cause of the Internet incidents of recent days. The most important took place on Thursday, February 24. Much of the network around Kharkiv, Ukraine‚Äôs second largest city, was left partly without a connection.

Network dropout for several hours

The information provided by NetBlocks, an organization in charge of Internet observation, shows a significant drop in data from Triolan, one of the main operators in the country, of around 25% on the night of Wednesday, February 23. If at first, observers thought that the bombardments around the region could have damaged telecommunications installations, it now appears that the operator was the victim of a hack.

‚ö†Ô∏è Update: #Ukraine‚Äòs second-largest city #Kharkiv continues to take the brunt of network and telecoms disruptions, leaving many users cut off amid scenes of destruction as Russia targets the region. Kyiv is currently less impacted by outages. üì∞ Report: https://t.co/S0qJQ7CJD3pic.twitter.com/FxgN1bHV3m ‚Äî NetBlocks (@netblocks) February 24, 2022

On its website, Triolan said to have been the target of several hacks of ‚Äúkey nodes‚Äù of his network. ‚ÄúA number of routers in our network have been disabled without remote recovery possible, with a total of 57 nodes in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Dnipro, Poltava, Odessa, Rivne and Zaporizhia‚Äú, details the Internet service provider, which also mentions damaged physical equipment.

This Friday, the operator claims to be trying to repair its network, but many problems remain. The supplier‚Äôs DNS servers, which are used to link a domain name (such as www.lesnumeriques.com) to an IP address, are experiencing incidents. Triolan therefore advises Ukrainian users to configure them themselves with the DNS of Google (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.8.4) or Cloudflare (1.1.1.1).

Cutting the Internet, an attack like any other

Is Russia behind the hacking of network nodes? At present, no information has corroborated or invalidated such a possibility. However, in conflicts of this magnitude, shutting down, slowing down or censoring the internet is often beneficial to one of the parties involved.

Felicia Anthonio, from digital rights organization Access Now, details at The Verge, the direct consequences of internet shutdowns in conflict situations. ‚ÄúInternet infrastructure becomes a target in order to control the flow of information and gain or maintain power during conflict, we have seen this in the destruction of Yemen‚Äôs telecom infrastructure after airstrikes by the ‚ÄòSaudi Arabia‚Äú, she explains to our colleagues.

Although Russia is not directly behind the outages of recent days, Vladimir Putin‚Äôs country has demonstrated time and time again that it has the ability to severely affect the global Internet. As revealed by New York Times in 2015, Russia was taking a keen interest in undersea internet cables. At the time, the Russian fleet sailed very regularly near them, and were then able to spy on them and even cut them off. Based on this observation, there is no doubt that in seven years, Russia has improved.",https://www.arover.net/2022/02/25/ukraine-mysterious-internet-cuts-for-several-days/

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine posted a video on Twitter, telling the public not to believe false reports.

He was alive. Kyiv had not fallen. Any reports of Ukraine laying down its arms was a lie, Mr. Zelensky said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm here,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe are not putting down any arms. We will protect our country, because our weapons are our truth. The truth is that this is our land, our country, our children, and we will protect them all.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat is it. That‚Äôs what I wanted to tell you. Glory to Ukraine.‚Äù

His comments, released before 9 a.m., came as fighting intensified in Kyiv. What until three days ago had been a thriving European metropolis has been transformed into a battle zone. Russian troops pressed in from all directions.

There was intense street fighting, and bursts of gunfire and explosions could be heard across the city, including its heart, Maidan square, where in 2014 Ukrainian protests led to the toppling of a pro-Moscow government.

The Russian military has a decisive edge in cyberwarfare, tanks, heavy weaponry, missiles, fighter planes and warships. In sheer numbers, its military dwarfs that of Ukraine.

Russia has established attack lines into three cities ‚Äî Kyiv in the north, Kharkiv in the northeast and Kherson in the south ‚Äî and Ukrainian troops are fighting to hold all three. The Pentagon reported late Friday that the Russians did not appear to be in control of a single major population center. Significantly, a senior U.S. defense official said, Ukrainian command and control remains intact.

The Ukrainian government reported that hundreds of Russian soldiers had been killed in the war, along with scores of their own soldiers, while the Russian defense ministry issued a statement on Saturday morning that made no mention of any casualties or anything about the fight for Kyiv.

The Russian invasion started with targeted airstrikes before dawn on Thursday, but on the third day of the war, bloody battles were often being waged in close quarters. Ukrainska Pravda, a Ukrainian news site, citing witnesses, reported combat 400 yards from Maidan Square in central Kyiv.

All Ukrainian men of fighting are being drafted into service, and tens of thousands are signing up. Ukrainians were asked to make Molotov cocktails. And there were tearful scenes at airports in western Ukraine as wives kissed their husbands goodbye before they headed to front.

The nation has rallied around its president, Mr. Zelensky, a former comedian.

To him and other officials, the objective of the Russian invasion of a neighboring country that possessed no military threat is to topple the government.

Mr. Zelensky has said that he is ‚Äútarget no. 1.‚Äù

As battles were waged around the city on Saturday morning, there were reports of clashes near the city‚Äôs train station and along a central thoroughfare, Bohdan Khmelnitsky Street, leading from Victory Square toward the city center, according to the witness accounts. Along that street, closer to the city center, bursts of gunfire could be heard through the night.

‚ÄúWe are stopping the horde, so far as we can,‚Äù the secretary of the Ukrainian Security and Defense Council, Oleksy Danilov, said around 7 a.m. ‚ÄúThe situation is under control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and citizens of Kyiv.‚Äù

In dozens of interviews in the tense hours before the invasion and in the days after, Ukrainians struggled to understand how a country at peace so suddenly found itself at war. For many Ukrainians, the answer was found in Russia‚Äôs president, Vladimir V. Putin.

This is Mr. Putin‚Äôs war. But what frightened people perhaps as much as the threat of missiles and bombs was that they did not know what he wanted.

The fear was evident in the drive from Kyiv to a small village outside the city. Military convoys had replaced families going on vacation or visiting friends. Where once Kyiv was known as a city where the music played a touch too loud in its cafes, the incessant wail of air raid sirens drowned out all joy.

The fear was evident in the faces of the people seeking safety in Western Ukraine, after they emerged from 20-hour train rides in packed carriages that were kept pitch-black to avoid being targeting by Russian rockets.

From Lviv in the west to Odessa in the south and Kharkiv and nearly all points in between, people huddled in air raid shelters and lined up and bank machines and stocked up on essentials.

While the Russians, for the moment, were not in control of any city, it was only the first phase of a conflict that could stretch into weeks or longer.",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/02/25/world/russia-ukraine-war

Russian, Ukrainian forces clash in streets of Kyiv

Russian and Ukrainian forces clashed in Kyiv on Saturday as authorities urged citizens to help defend the city. Heavy, frequent artillery fire and intense gunfire, apparently some distance from the city centre, could be heard, a witness in Kyiv said. The Ukrainian military said Russian troops attacked an army base on a main avenue but the assault was repelled. Gunfire was heard after dawn near government buildings in the city centre, a witness said. The air force command reported heavy fighting near an air base at Vasylkiv southwest of the capital, which it said was under attack from Russian paratroopers. It also said one of its fighters had shot down a Russian transport plane, but those claims remain unverified.

Ukrainian officials said Russian forces fired cruise missiles from the Black Sea at the cities of Sumy, Poltava and Mariupol and there was heavy fighting near the southern city of Mariupol.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, speaking in a video message from outside his Kyiv office, was defiant.

‚ÄúWe will not put down weapons, we will defend our state,‚Äù Zelenskiy said.

China‚Äôs embassy in Ukraine reverses advice for citizens to identify themselves amid backlash

Days after encouraging people to put Chinese flags on their cars if they were travelling, China‚Äôs embassy in Ukraine is now warning citizens in the country not to ‚Äúdisplay identifying signs.‚Äù

The advice comes amid unconfirmed reports on social media of a backlash against Chinese in Ukraine after Beijing publicly backed Russia‚Äôs invasion of the country.

On Friday night, Beijing‚Äôs representative abstained from a vote condemning Moscow‚Äôs actions at the United Nations Security Council. Earlier in the day, President Xi Jinping had a phone call with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in which he urged negotiation with Kyiv but also acknowledged Russia‚Äôs ‚Äúlegitimate security concerns.‚Äù

‚ÄùThe Chinese embassy in Ukraine would like to remind our compatriots that during the current security situation, we should attach great importance to friendly relations with the Ukrainian people, avoid disputes on specific issues and strive to resolve issues through friendly means,‚Äù the embassy said Friday night in a post on WeChat.

‚ÄùMinimize security risks by staying away from military installations, military personnel and gunmen. Do not take pictures of people in the crossfire, or without their consent.

‚ÄùSome 6,000 Chinese citizens live in Ukraine, according to the embassy, which earlier said there were charter flights available for those trying to leave the country.

Ukraine says two commercial ships hit by Russian missiles near Odesa port

Ukraine said Russian warships shelled a Moldovan-flagged chemical tanker and a Panamanian-flagged cargo ship due to load grain near Odesa port in the Black Sea.

Ukraine‚Äôs infrastructure ministry said that the Moldovan-flagged vessel, the Millennial Spirit, was carrying 600 tonnes of diesel at the time of the attack from a Russian military ship.

Earlier on Friday Moldova‚Äôs naval agency said the crew of the Millennial Spirit was Russian and that two of them had been seriously injured.

According to the Ukrainian ministry, the cargo ship Namura Queen was also hit by Russian missiles on Friday.

At a Ukrainian Saturday school in Oakville, Ont., students typically learn about their culture, participate in dance lessons and study the language.

This weekend, however, classes at Oakville Ridna Shkola will have a more sombre tone: The younger children will write letters to soldiers and high-school students will listen to a guest speaker‚Äôs lecture about misinformation and how to find reliable sources of news about Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine.

‚ÄúWe want them to have an understanding of what the real facts are, what is really happening. And the most important thing is to distinguish between the true information and fake information,‚Äù said Oksana Levytska, principal at the school.

Oakville Ridna Shkola is one of many institutions across the country that are providing spaces for young people to share how they feel during an uncertain time. Educators are balancing the possibility of spreading fear among students with the benefits of helping them understand the events unfolding in Ukraine.

Canadians rushed to provide war-torn Ukraine with material aid, selling donuts to raise money, offering furniture to future refugees, and trying to purchase military equipment for veterans on the front lines.

After a day of protest, attention turned to the difficult task of giving a beleaguered nation the help its government was seeking, in ways large and small. The Ukrainian military took the dramatic step of asking international supporters for cash donations, while Canada‚Äôs federal government offered to match individual contributions to the Canadian Red Cross.

Two more groups, the Ukrainian Canadian Congress and the Canada-Ukraine Foundation, teamed up at the end of January to launch a fundraising drive called the Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal. The pair has collected $2.4-million of its $5-million goal, according to the tally on CUF‚Äôs website.

Canadian tech firms with Ukraine offices struggling to get employees out of country as Russian forces advance

Canadian technology firms with offices and employees in Ukraine are trying to help staff flee the country, but efforts to get them access to Canada have so far largely gone nowhere.

Chief executives at several tech companies said the Canadian government has not provided work visas or approved refugee applications for their Ukrainian staff.

Sean Fraser, Canada‚Äôs Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, said his department has already approved more than 1,800 Ukrainian immigration applications on a ‚Äúpriority basis,‚Äù and is expediting applications from Ukrainians who are trying to escape the conflict.

But Anna Sainsbury, chief executive officer of Vancouver cybersecurity firm GeoComply Solutions Inc., said her experience has been far from what the immigration minister described. Her company has been attempting to get federal officials to create streamlined or priority immigration applications for Ukrainian employees since early February, but has not heard back from Ottawa.

Trudeau calls for Russia to be cut out of crucial SWIFT pay system in new wave of sanctions over Ukraine invasion

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is calling for Russia to be cut out of the SWIFT system for international banking payments.

Trudeau, U.S. President Joe Biden and the European Union all imposed sanctions directly on Mr. Putin and his foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, freezing any assets they own in these three jurisdictions.

The Canadian Prime Minister went a step further and openly pushed for a ban on Russian banks using SWIFT, the service that allows for cross-border financial transactions, including paying for traded goods. It is particularly crucial for Russia to collect the fossil fuel royalty payments that fund its government.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced Canada‚Äôs new sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin personally, as well as foreign minister Sergeƒ≠ Lavrov, as the Russian invasion of Ukraine continues. Trudeau also announced Canada‚Äôs support of removing Russia from the international banking system SWIFT, and said personal donations from Canadians to Ukraine relief efforts would be matched by Ottawa up to $10-million. The Globe and Mail

‚ÄúWe have made it clear that all options are on the table when it comes to imposing steep costs on Russia‚Äôs unjustified and unprovoked invasion,‚Äù Mr. Trudeau said. ‚ÄúExcluding Russian banks from SWIFT would make it even more difficult for President Putin to finance his brutalities.‚Äù

Mr. Trudeau‚Äôs announcement now makes him the most vocal proponent of the measure among G7 leaders. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has also favoured ejecting Russia from SWIFT, while the EU, led by Germany, has been most opposed.

Russia vetoes UN resolution to end Ukraine invasion

Russia vetoed a UN Security Council resolution telling Moscow to stop attacking Ukraine and withdraw all troops immediately.

The veto was expected, but the United States and its supporters argued that the effort would highlight Moscow‚Äôs international isolation.

The 11-1 vote ‚Äì with China, India and the United Arab Emirates abstaining ‚Äì showed significant but not total opposition to Russia‚Äôs invasion of its smaller, militarily weaker neighbour.

The resolution‚Äôs failure paves the way for backers to call for a swift vote on a similar measure in the 193-member UN General Assembly, where there are no vetoes. There was no immediate timetable for a potential Assembly vote.

Unlike Security Council resolutions, General Assembly resolutions aren‚Äôt legally binding, but they can function as statements of world opinion. In an Assembly meeting Wednesday as Moscow‚Äôs invasion loomed, dozens of countries condemned Russia or expressed solidarity with Ukraine. Russia and ally Syria defended Moscow‚Äôs moves.

U.S. stocks ended up sharply for a second day on Friday, with the Dow registering its biggest daily percentage gain since November 2020 as the market rebounded from the sharp selloff leading up to Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine.

Oil prices fell below $100 a barrel, easing some concerns about higher energy costs.

Investors also are assessing news that Russian President Vladimir Putin told his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in a call that Russia was willing to hold high-level talks with Ukraine, according to China‚Äôs Foreign Ministry.

Opinion: How Nord Stream 2 became a geopolitical blunder for both Russia and Germany

No pipeline in decades has carried as much geopolitical risk as the Nord Stream 2, the megaproject that was supposed to bring Russia and Germany closer together economically, stuff Western Europe with cheap fuel and accelerate the demise of dirty coal power plants.

Those risks, apparent from Day 1 in 2015, when NS2 was announced, finally overwhelmed the pipeline this week. NS2 is effectively, although not officially, dead; it now has zero chance of obtaining an operating licence from Berlin in the next few years, if ever. The war in Ukraine finally tipped it over the edge, an example of savage politics overwhelming serious commerce.

A painted map of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia to Germany is shown at the natural gas receiving station in the Lubmin industrial estate in Lubmin, Germany, on Nov 16, 2021.Stefan Sauer/The Associated Press

Many countries, not just Ukraine, opposed the pipeline. They argued it would make Germany and a few other countries slaves to Russian gas, opening the door to blackmail and intensifying Europe‚Äôs fossil fuel reliance when it should be devoting its might and creativity to renewable energy.

The U.S. slapped sanctions on NS2, but they were too narrow and ultimately proved entirely ineffective. One of the targets was pipe-laying ships in the Baltic. The Russians solved that problem by finding ships that were not subject to the sanctions.

In the end, Russia lost an enormous pipeline that could have earned Gazprom fortunes for decades and made Europe even more reliant on imported gas. Germany‚Äôs endorsement of NS2 until Mr. Scholz banished it, showed the country had woefully misjudged the pipeline‚Äôs geopolitical risks, making it look naive and feckless. There were no winners in this saga, just lessons.

Auto makers idle production following Russia‚Äôs invasion, other firms also scramble

Several companies, including auto makers Volkswagen and Renault and tire maker Nokian Tyres, on Friday outlined plans to shut or shift manufacturing operations following Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine.

The United States announced sweeping export restrictions against Russia on Thursday, hammering its access to global exports of goods ranging from commercial electronics and computers to semiconductors and aircraft parts. That could lead companies to alter manufacturing plans or seek alternative supply lines.

The invasion was a factor in consulting firms J.D. Power and LMC Automotive slashing their 2022 global new-car sales outlook by 400,000 vehicles to 85.8 million units. The auto industry had already been dealing with a tight supply of vehicles due to the global semiconductor shortage.

Opinion: A travel ban on Russians could avert further conflict in Ukraine

As I write this in the Dominican Republic, thousands of Russian tourists are sunning themselves on local beaches, drinking tequila in the bars and partying to beat the band. Simultaneously, there are Russian rockets raining down on Kyiv, civilians dying in droves and a despot in the Kremlin with access to nuclear weapons, threatening any country that dares intervene while remaining oblivious to diplomatic entreaties and indifferent to all the announced international sanctions.

If history is a guide, Vladimir Putin will see a bump in his domestic popularity if the invasion of Ukraine succeeds, and most Russians will shrug if the economy eventually shrinks again.

Nevertheless, domestic opposition to the invasion remains one of the best hopes for taming Mr. Putin‚Äôs aggression. And while Russians have bravely taken to the streets in cities across the country, with hundreds already detained for doing so, more people there need to understand that their government‚Äôs terrible actions have painful consequences for them, and for how they are seen around the world. On this, the typical slate of economic sanctions do not appear to be doing the job.

There is, however, another set of sanctions that would bite, and could quickly help turn popular opinion against Mr. Putin: An indefinite ban of travellers from Russia by democratic nations.

The images showed one large helicopter deployment near the Belarusian town of Chojniki, which had over 90 helicopters parked on a road with the deployment extending for more than five miles. Images also showed a large deployment of ground forces with several hundred vehicles in convoy position in several fields.

The images released by Maxar Technologies, which has been tracking the buildup of Russian forces for weeks, could not be independently verified by Reuters.

Russia booted from Eurovision Song Contest over invasion of Ukraine

The European Broadcasting Union says that Russia will not be allowed an entry in this year‚Äôs Eurovision Song Contest.

The union said in a statement Friday that given the unprecedented crisis in Ukraine, the inclusion of a Russian entry would bring the competition into ‚Äúdisrepute.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe EBU is an apolitical member organization of broadcasters committed to upholding the values of public service,‚Äù the union said on Twitter. ‚ÄúWe remain dedicated to protecting the values of a cultural competition which promotes international exchange and understanding, brings audiences together, celebrates diversity through music and unites Europe on one stage.‚Äù

This year‚Äôs finale is being held in Turin, Italy, on May 14.

Russia has not yet announced an entrant for the splashy contest.

Ukraine will be represented by Kalush Orchestra, which organizers describe as a ‚Äúhip-hop band with a fondness for folk.‚Äù

Battle for Kyiv rages as residents urged to fight

The battle for this city of three million people began in earnest on Friday, as Russian troops and armoured vehicles entered parts of Ukraine‚Äôs capital, which started handing out weapons to citizens planning to resist.

The Defence Ministry said Russian reconnaissance units were in the northern Obolon neighbourhood of the city, close to Kyiv‚Äôs historic Podil district, a place of caf√©s and cobblestoned streets that is now a frontline. ‚ÄúWe ask citizens to inform about the movement of equipment!‚Äù the official statement said. ‚ÄúMake Molotov cocktails, neutralize the occupier!‚Äù

Russia‚Äôs authoritarian President Vladimir Putin called on the Ukrainian army to overthrow the elected government of President Volodymyr Zelensky. ‚ÄúTake power in your own hands. It seems like it will be easier for us to agree with you than this gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis,‚Äù Mr. Putin said, referring to Mr. Zelensky, who is Jewish.

The Ukrainian government said they had destroyed three bridges on the northern approach to the capital to slow the Russian advance. A few hours later, as fighting moved closer to the centre of the city, the Interior Ministry announced it had distributed some 18,000 assault rifles to residents.

Friday‚Äôs fighting followed a night of fierce bombing in and around Kyiv. In the eastern Pozniaky district of the city, a 10-storey apartment block had its windows blown out and fa√ßade badly damaged when a Russian cruise missile slammed into the ground directly in front of the residential building, leaving a two-metre-deep crater while narrowly missing a kindergarten. Three people were injured.

Amnesty International said on Friday that Russia‚Äôs war against Ukraine ‚Äúhas been marked by indiscriminate attacks on civilian areas and strikes on protected objects such as hospitals,‚Äù and that at least six civilians had been confirmed as killed in the first day of attacks. Agn√®s Callamard, the group‚Äôs secretary-general, said some of the attacks on civilian areas ‚Äúmay be war crimes.‚Äù

Moscow cracks down on protesters as Russian troops invade Ukraine

Police on Thursday detained more than 1,600 Russians who protested against Russia‚Äôs multi-pronged military operation in Ukraine, while authorities threatened to block media reports that contain what Moscow described as ‚Äúfalse information.‚Äù

In acts of cautious, but unusual dissent, Russian pop stars, journalists, a television comedian and a footballer opposed the war online after President Vladimir Putin launched an invasion of Ukraine in the early hours of Thursday.

By 2 p.m. ET, police had detained 1,667 people at rallies in 53 cities, the OVD-Info rights monitor said ‚Äì easily the biggest tally since last year‚Äôs crushing of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny‚Äôs network ushered in an ice age in activism.

Protesters defied a warning issued on Thursday by the Investigative Committee, a kind of Russian answer to the FBI, that explicitly threatened criminal action and even jail time for people calling for or taking part in protests.

‚ÄúI was detained on my way out of the house,‚Äù Marina Litvinovich, a Moscow-based activist, wrote on Telegram after she called on Russians in a Facebook post on Thursday morning to protest later that evening.

Europeans rush to Polish-Ukrainian border to pick up family or lend a helping hand

From left to right; Jan Mihalicek, Marek Mahdal, and Martin Ladman drove from Prague to the border with Ukraine to offer refugees a free ride to the Czech capital as well as help with shelter and food, on Feb. 25, 2022.Anna Liminowicz /The Globe and Mail

As Marek Mahdal watched news reports of Russian air strikes pounding Ukraine, he didn‚Äôt feel he could sit at home in Prague and do nothing.

So he and two friends jumped in their cars Thursday night and drove 770-kilometres to the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing near Przemysl in eastern Poland. They arrived at around noon on Friday and stood on a sidewalk outside the pedestrian gate holding a sign written in Ukrainian that offered free rides to Prague and help finding shelter, food and work.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unthinkable what‚Äôs happening and I would be really quite happy if someone showed up with this offer,‚Äù said Mr. Mahdal, a 22-year old student. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got the time and, most importantly, we‚Äôve got the means.‚Äù

The trio were part of an informal network of families, friends and do-gooders that have descended on the Polish border crossing to fetch loved ones, offer shelter or just spoon out free soup.

China blames U.S., NATO for provoking Putin, but Beijing wary of support for invasion

Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine this week shocked the world, even after months of sabre-rattling by Moscow, but China in particular seems to have been wrong-footed by the unprovoked attack.

As Russian missiles began striking Ukrainian positions early Thursday morning, China‚Äôs representative to the United Nations was in the middle of telling the Security Council that ‚Äúthe door to a peaceful solution to the Ukraine issue is not fully shut, nor should it be shut.‚Äù

After Beijing backed Russia‚Äôs calls for an end to NATO‚Äôs eastward expansion following a summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping in early February, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said this week that ‚Äúthe sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all countries should be respected and safeguarded ‚Ä¶ and that applies equally to Ukraine.‚Äù

Since the invasion began, Beijing has swung behind Russia, blaming Washington and NATO for provoking Mr. Putin‚Äôs invasion and reiterating Russian justifications for the war.

Swiss freeze bank accounts of Russians on EU sanctions list

Switzerland told banks on Friday to freeze the assets of people and entities on a European Union sanctions blacklist that the neutral country has adopted to ensure it is not used to circumvent measures against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.

The instruction from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) ratchets up the pressure Bern is exerting in solidarity with the West while still trying to keep the door open to a potential role as a mediator.

‚ÄúFinancial intermediaries are requested to block the corresponding assets immediately and to report such business relationships to (government agency) SECO in accordance with the provisions of the ordinance,‚Äù FINMA said on its website.

The government had earlier amended its ordinance to include 363 individuals and four companies the EU put on its sanctions list this week to punish Moscow.

FINMA did not specify how much money would be frozen. Russians held nearly 10.4 billion Swiss francs ($11.21 billion) in Switzerland in 2020, Swiss National Bank data show.

Russia accuses Ukraine of going silent on possible talks

The Kremlin said on Friday it had offered to hold talks with Ukraine in the Belarusian capital Minsk after Ukraine said it was willing to discuss declaring itself a neutral country, but said Ukraine had instead proposed Warsaw as a venue.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Ukrainians had then taken what he described as a quite a long timeout and that there was now a ‚Äúpause‚Äù in contacts.

During that pause, he said Ukrainian nationalists had deployed missile systems in residential areas in big cities.

He did not provide evidence to back the assertion, but said it was a very dangerous development.

Russia sanctions to add to higher energy, grain prices amid Ukraine war: IMF chief

International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Friday that international financial sanctions against Russia will add to the economic impacts of the war in Ukraine, which are primarily being transmitted through higher energy and grain prices, adding to inflation.

Georgieva, speaking at a Georgetown Law School event on Black History Month, also said that greater financial market uncertainty caused by the conflict may cause capital ‚Äúoutflows from emerging markets, when we need exactly the opposite ‚Äì more financing going there.‚Äù

She also said that heightened regional tensions may impact economic activity in countries and regions surrounding Ukraine, such as Moldova and the Caucasus.

‚ÄúWe have already seen actions taken in terms of sanctions that would add to the economic impact of this crisis, and will primarily transmit through energy prices, as well as grain, adding to what has been a growing concern of inflation and how it can be countered,‚Äù she said.

Russia is among the world‚Äôs biggest oil exporters and also is a major grain exporter, along with Ukraine, whose Black Sea ports have been closed to shipping.

Insurance costs of shipping through Black Sea soar after Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine

Insurers have raised the cost of providing cover for merchant ships through the Black Sea, adding to soaring rates to transport goods through the region for vessels still willing to sail after Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine.

Ship owners pay annual war-risk insurance cover as well as an additional ‚Äúbreach‚Äù premium when entering high-risk areas. These separate premiums are calculated according to the value of the ship, or hull, for a seven-day period.

Ship insurers have quoted the additional premium rate for seven days at anywhere between 1 per cent to 2 per cent and up to 5 per cent of insurance costs, from an estimated 0.025 per cent on Monday before Russia‚Äôs invasion began, according to indicative rates from marine insurance sources.

This would mean additional costs of hundreds of thousands of dollars for a ship voyage depending on the destination.

‚ÄúGiven the Russian offensive from land, sea and air, it would not be surprising if some insurers will be reluctant (to provide cover),‚Äù one insurance source said.

A Moldovan-flagged chemical tanker was hit by a missile on Friday near Ukraine‚Äôs port of Odesa, seriously wounding two crew.

On Thursday, a Turkish-owned ship was hit by a bomb off Odesa with no casualties and the ship sailed safely into Romanian waters.

Turkey says it cannot stop returning Russian warships from accessing Black Sea

Turkey cannot stop Russian warships accessing the Black Sea via its straits, as Ukraine has requested, due to a clause in an international pact that allows vessels to return to their home base, the Turkish foreign minister said on Friday.

Ukraine has appealed to Turkey to block Russian warships from passing through the Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits which lead to the Black Sea, after Moscow on Thursday launched a full-blown assault on Ukraine from land, air and sea.

Russian forces landed at Ukraine‚Äôs Black and Azov Sea ports as part of the invasion.

Under the 1936 Montreux Convention, Turkey has control over the straits and can limit the passage of warships during wartime or if threatened, but the request has put the NATO member in a difficult position as it tries to manage its Western commitments and close ties with Russia.

Canadian dollar gains as investors weigh targeted Russia sanctions

The Canadian dollar strengthened against the greenback on Friday as preliminary domestic data showed wholesale trade rising in January and currency traders walked back some of the large moves seen the day before in reaction to Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine.

The safe-haven U.S. dollar fell against a basket of major currencies, and stocks globally rose as investors welcomed co-ordinated Western sanctions on Russia that targeted its banks but not did not block it from a global payments system and left its energy sector largely untouched.

The price of oil, one of Canada‚Äôs major exports, gave back some recent gains, with U.S. crude oil futures falling 1.1 per cent to $91.76 a barrel.

Investors doubt that the start of war in Ukraine will stop the Bank of Canada from hiking interest rates next week for the first time since October 2018. Money markets expect the central bank to lift its policy rate by 25 basis points to 0.50 per cent at its policy announcement next Wednesday and six times in total this year to fight inflation.

The Canadian dollar gained 0.3 per cent to 1.2775 per greenback, or 78.28 U.S. cents, after trading in a range of 1.2754 to 1.2820.

On Thursday, the currency touched its weakest intraday level in more than two months at 1.2877. It was on track to decline 0.2 per cent for the week.

Pope Francis makes personal appeal in remarkable Russia embassy trip

Pope Francis visited the Russian Embassy on Friday to personally ‚Äúexpress his concern about the war,‚Äù the Vatican said, in an extraordinary, hands-on papal gesture that has no recent precedent.

Usually, popes receive ambassadors and heads of state in the Vatican, and diplomatic protocol would have called for the Vatican foreign minister to summon the ambassador. For Francis, the Vatican head of state, the decision to leave the walled city state and travel a short distance to the Russian embassy to the Holy See was a sign of his anger at Moscow‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine and his willingness to appeal personally for an end to it.

Vatican officials said they knew of no such previous papal initiative.

Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni confirmed the visit, and the Vatican said Francis travelled to and from the embassy in a small white car.

‚ÄúThe Holy See press office confirms that the pope went to the Russian Embassy to the Holy See on Via della Conciliazione, clearly to express his concern about the war. He was there for just over a half-hour,‚Äù Bruni said.

Francis has called for dialogue to end the conflict and has urged the faithful to set next Wednesday as a day of fasting and prayer for peace in Ukraine. But he has refrained from publicly calling out Russia, presumably for fear of antagonizing the Russian Orthodox Church.

The CERT said blamed a group code-named ‚ÄúUNC1151‚Ä≥ for the hacking, identifying its members as Minsk-based officers of Belarusian military.

Ukraine has been buffeted by digital intrusions and denial of service actions both in the run-up to and during the Russian invasion which began earlier this week. Belarus has offered its territory as a launch pad for Russian forces, allowing Moscow‚Äôs forces to rapidly push toward Kyiv.

Two ships struck by Russian missiles in the Black Sea

Before Russian attacks on Thursday, Ukrainian government officials and shipping companies had kept ports open, preserving the movement of ships across the Black Sea despite a huge exclusion zone imposed by Russia, which said it was conducting exercises in the area.

On Friday, however, two ships were struck - a development with potentially significant implications for Black Sea shipping that is economically and logistically critical to Ukraine.

Namura Queen, a Panamanian-flagged bulk carrier carrying grain, was hit, injuring one and igniting a fire.

Britain‚Äôs spy chief claims intelligence scoop on Putin‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine

Spies in the United States and Britain scored an intelligence scoop by uncovering Russian President Vladimir Putin‚Äôs decision to order the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two, Britain‚Äôs foreign spy chief said.

For months, U.S. and British ministers and Western security sources had warned that Russia could invade Ukraine. They stepped up warnings that an invasion was imminent in the weeks and days ahead of Putin‚Äôs declaration.

Ahead of the Russian invasion, Moscow repeatedly dismissed those claims as anti-Russian hysteria or disinformation designed to tempt Putin into a war.

Fuel, cash and medical supplies are running low in parts of Ukraine after Russia‚Äôs invasion, which could drive up to 5 million people to flee abroad, UN aid agencies said on Friday.

At least 100,000 people are uprooted in Ukraine after fleeing their homes since Russia launched its assault on Thursday, while several thousand have already crossed into neighbouring countries including Moldova, Romania and Poland, UN refugee agency spokesperson Shabia Mantoo said.

‚ÄúWe are looking at ranges of 1-3 million into Poland for example ‚Ä¶ A scenario of 1 to 5 mln including all surrounding countries,‚Äù Afshan Khan, UNICEF‚Äôs regional director for Europe and Central Asia, told a UN briefing in Geneva.

UEFA moves Champions League final from St. Petersburg to Paris in wake of Ukraine invasion

UEFA has moved this year‚Äôs Champions League final from St. Petersburg to Paris in the wake of Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine, European soccer‚Äôs governing body said in a statement on Friday.

UEFA also said the home games of Ukrainian and Russian club and national teams competing in UEFA competitions would be played at neutral venues ‚Äúuntil further notice.‚Äù

The governing body thanked French President Emmanuel Macron for his ‚Äúpersonal support and commitment‚Äù in taking on the final.

It added that it would ‚Äúfully support multi-stakeholder efforts to ensure the provision of rescue for football players and their families in Ukraine who face dire human suffering, destruction and displacement.‚Äù

Ukraine urges allies to stand by promises of unprecedented sanctions against Russia

The West is under mounting pressure to take stronger measures against Russia over the invasion of Ukraine, after the world‚Äôs wealthy democracies failed to kick Moscow out of the SWIFT system of international payments and omitted other tough actions from sanctions packages announced this week.

The Ukrainian government, along with legislators in the United States and Europe, called on leaders to make good on preinvasion promises of unprecedented economic pain for Russian President Vladimir Putin if he attacked Ukraine.

The U.S., the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada and several other countries on Thursday announced sanctions on Russian banks, oligarchs and technology exports. EU foreign ministers told reporters in Brussels on Friday that they would also freeze European assets belonging to Mr. Putin and his foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov.

But the measures did not personally sanction Mr. Putin, block Russian exports of oil and natural gas or prohibit Western companies from doing business with Russia. They also allowed Russia to remain part of SWIFT, which banks depend on for performing cross-border transactions and Moscow uses to collect the fossil fuel royalty payments that fund its government.

Early Friday, Ukraine‚Äôs government, besieged by Russian forces attacking Kyiv, called on Europe to do more.

Opinion: The West needs to support the Ukrainians - for their sake and ours

In the early fog of a war that is just beginning, I see four things the West needs to do. We need to secure the defence of every inch of NATO territory, especially at its eastern frontiers with Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, against all possible forms of attack, including cyber and hybrid ones.

We have to offer all the support that we can to the Ukrainians, short of breaching the threshold that would bring the West into a direct hot war with Russia. Those Ukrainians who choose to stay and to resist will be fighting, by military but also civilian means, to defend the freedom of their country, as they have every possible right in law and conscience to do, and as we would do for our own countries.

But there are still things we can do. Not only can we continue to supply weapons, communications and other equipment to those who are entirely legitimately resisting armed force with armed force. As important in the medium term, we can help those who will be using the well-tried techniques of civil resistance against a Russian occupation and any attempt to impose a puppet government. We must also stand ready to assist the many Ukrainians who will flee westward.

Russia ready to send delegation to Minsk for talks with Ukraine, says Kremlin spokesperson

Russia is ready to send a delegation to the Belarusian capital Minsk for talks with Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday, a day after Moscow launched a massive invasion of its southern neighbour.

Peskov told Russian news agencies Russia was willing to send a delegation including foreign and defence ministry officials.

Ukraine has said it is willing to discuss declaring itself a neutral county. Peskov said demilitarization would need to be an essential part of that.

Merkel condemns Russian invasion as legacy comes under scrutiny

Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine marked a ‚Äúdeep rupture in Europe‚Äôs history following the end of the Cold War‚Äù even as her own legacy comes under fresh scrutiny in light of the assault.

Merkel, who led Germany for 16 years until last December and was long seen as the West‚Äôs key interlocutor with Russian President Vladimir Putin, said she was following the unfolding events with ‚Äúgreat worry and sympathy.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere is no justification for this blatant breach of international law, and I wholeheartedly condemn it,‚Äù said Merkel, who grew up in the former communist East Germany and speaks fluent Russian.

Germany has joined its European Union partners and other Western countries in agreeing sweeping economic sanctions on Russia. But until this week it had been less inclined than the United States or Britain to accept that an attack on Ukraine was imminent and had backed a heavier focus on dialogue with Moscow.

People in Kyiv were told to make Molotov cocktail petrol bombs on Friday as they hid in makeshift shelters and basements, awaiting a Russian assault on the Ukrainian capital.

‚ÄúMake Molotov cocktails, neutralize the occupier!‚Äù the Defence Ministry said, while local authorities told people in the northwestern Obolon area of the city to stay off the streets because ‚Äúactive hostilities‚Äù were approaching.

Zelensky and Putin both say they are willing to negotiate as war rages in Ukraine

Russian troops have entered Kyiv from the north, Ukraine‚Äôs Defence Ministry said in a statement that called on residents to prepare to fight, even as the presidents of both Russia and Ukraine said they were willing to negotiate.

As Russian forces pushed toward his office in the centre of Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

‚ÄúI want to appeal once again to the President of the Russian Federation. Fighting is taking place all over Ukraine. Let‚Äôs sit down at the negotiating table to stop the deaths of people,‚Äù Mr. Zelensky said in a video address from inside the Presidential Administration building in the capital.

Separately, Mr. Putin reportedly told Chinese President Xi Jinping that he was willing to hold high-level talks with Ukraine.

‚ÄúThe United States and NATO have long ignored Russia‚Äôs reasonable security concerns, repeatedly reneged on their commitments, and continued to advance military deployment eastward, challenging Russia‚Äôs strategic bottom line,‚Äù Mr. Putin told Xi, according to China‚Äôs state-run CCTV. ‚ÄúRussia is willing to conduct high-level negotiations with Ukraine.‚Äù

NATO leaders meet to reassure allies near Russia, Ukraine

U.S. President Joe Biden and his NATO counterparts will seek Friday to reassure member countries on the alliance‚Äôs eastern flank that their security is guaranteed as Russia‚Äôs large-scale invasion of Ukraine closes in on the capital Kyiv.

With Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appealing for help, NATO members ranging from Russia‚Äôs neighbour Estonia in the north down around the west of conflict-hit Ukraine to Bulgaria on the Black Sea coast triggered urgent consultations about their security. Only Hungary refrained.

The leaders, meeting via video conference, plan to take stock of NATO‚Äôs own military buildup. The world‚Äôs biggest security organization previously had around 5,000 troops stationed in the Baltic countries ‚Äì Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania ‚Äì and Poland, but has significantly beefed up its defenses over the last three months.

‚ÄúMake no mistake, we will defend every ally against any attack on every inch of NATO territory,‚Äù NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, who will chair the summit, told reporters Thursday. ‚ÄúAn attack on one ally will trigger a response from the whole alliance.‚Äù

The leaders are likely to consider Friday whether to activate the NATO Response Force, which can number up to 40,000 troops. A quickly deployable land brigade that is part of the NRF ‚Äì made up of 5,000 troops and run by France alongside Germany, Poland, Portugal and Spain ‚Äì is already on heightened alert.

The crisis is being watched closely in Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory and which has faced increased military pressure from Beijing over the last two years.

‚ÄúWe very harshly condemn such an act of invasion and will join democratic countries to jointly impose sanctions,‚Äù Premier Su Tseng-chang told reporters in Taipei without giving details.

Final moments of Ukrainian border guards‚Äô fierce stand on Snake Island against Russian war ship become rallying cry

A defiant last stand by a small group of Ukrainian border guards defending a Black Sea outpost has become a new rallying cry for a country under attack by Russian forces ‚Äì and those in Russia who oppose the war.

Thirteen people were stationed on Snake, or Zminiy Island, a low-lying piece of land 35 kilometres from the Ukraine coast that has long delineated the country‚Äôs southwestern border.

On Thursday, as Russian forces invaded Ukraine from numerous directions, a warship approached the island, just 0.17 square kilometres in size, and ordered the men to stand down.

‚ÄúI suggest you surrender your weapons and capitulate. Otherwise, I will open fire,‚Äù a male voice says, in audio posted to the Internet that has now been viewed millions of times. ‚ÄúDo you copy?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is it,‚Äù one Ukrainian border guard says. ‚ÄúShould I tell him to go fuck himself?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust in case,‚Äù another man says.

The first man then responds to the warship: ‚ÄúRussian warship, go fuck yourself.‚Äù

Moments later, the Russian forces attacked, killing all 13 men.

Their defiance earned praise from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who named the 13 men and said they had ‚Äúdied heroically.‚Äù Each man will be honoured as a ‚Äúhero of Ukraine,‚Äù he said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says he is Russia‚Äôs ‚Äònumber one target‚Äô

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky vowed on Friday to stay put in the capital Kyiv as Russian troops launched an all-out invasion of Ukraine from several fronts.

‚Äú(The) enemy has marked me down as the number one target. ‚ÄúMy family is the number two target. They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state.‚Äù

As Russian forces pushed toward his office in the centre of Kyiv, Zelensky also called for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

‚ÄúI want to appeal once again to the president of the Russian Federation. Fighting is taking place all over Ukraine. Let‚Äôs sit down at the negotiating table to stop the deaths of people,‚Äù Mr. Zelensky said in a video address from inside the Presidential Administration building in the capital.

An estimated 100,000 people fled as explosions and gunfire rocked major cities. Mr. Zelensky said over 130 military personnel and civilians had been killed in the fighting.

Russia‚Äôs target appears to be capturing Kyiv and toppling the government, according to U.S and Ukrainian officials.

Opinion: Vladimir Putin‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine is a bigger gamble than he imagines

It happened exactly as American intelligence officials said it would; the only unknown was the timing. On Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin filled in that final detail when he launched an invasion of Ukraine by land, air and sea.

Ukrainians who just wanted to live their lives in peace awoke to shells, missiles and air attacks, striking at military bases and airports across the country, and around the capital of Kyiv. Russian troops streamed across multiple borders. The Ukrainian military fought back as best it could. Traffic jams of refugees streamed west.

This unprovoked attack, justified by nothing more than invented grievances, takes the world back to a darker, lawless age. ‚ÄúPresident Putin has reintroduced war to the European continent,‚Äù the leaders of the G7, which includes Canada, said on Thursday.

Mr. Putin‚Äôs assault on decency is so outrageous that strongly worded condemnations from the G7, and co-ordinated Canadian, U.S. and European sanctions ‚Äì on Russia, its banks, its government officials and the oligarchs that benefit from Mr. Putin‚Äôs tyranny ‚Äì feel inadequate.

Russian troops push in to Kyiv

Russian troops have entered Kyiv from the north, Ukraine‚Äôs Defence Ministry said in a statement that called on residents to prepare to fight.

The Defence Ministry said Russian reconnaissance units were now in the Obolon neighbourhood, close to Kyiv‚Äôs historic Podil district. ‚ÄúWe ask citizens to inform about the movement of equipment!‚Äù the statement said. ‚ÄúMake Molotov cocktails, neutralize the occupier!‚Äù

The Ukrainian government said they had destroyed three bridges on the northern approach to the capital to slow the Russian advance.

A few hours later, as fighting moved closer to the centre of the city, the Interior Ministry announced it had distributed some 18,000 assault rifles to residents.

Overnight, there were loud explosions audible in the city. The site of one blast that was visited by The Globe on Friday appeared to have been caused by a projectile that landed metres from an apartment block in the city‚Äôs Darnitsky region, blowing windows and part of the outer wall off the 10-storey building. The Ukrainian military said it was a Russian cruise missile that had been shot down by the city‚Äôs air defences. Residents said many ambulances had arrived, but they were unsure how many people had been killed or injured.

Ukraine‚Äôs Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Kyiv had come under a missile attack.

Airline industry shifts attention to Russia risks after Ukraine closure

Alaska‚Äôs Anchorage Airport said airlines have started making inquiries about capacity in case routes over Russia are impacted due to the Ukraine crisis, in a sign of the conflict‚Äôs growing fallout for the global aviation industry.

The airport was a popular refuelling hub for long-haul flights during the Cold War, when Western airlines were unable to access Russian airspace on routes from Europe to Asia.

Japan Airlines cancelled its Thursday evening flight to Moscow, citing potential safety risks, while Britain closed its airspace to Russian airlines, including Aeroflot, as the conflict‚Äôs impact on the industry widened beyond Ukraine to Russia.

Airspace in Ukraine, Moldova, parts of Belarus and in southern Russia near the Ukraine border was closed, giving airlines a narrower range of routing options.

Emirates said it had made minor routing changes to Stockholm, Moscow, St. Petersburg and some U.S. flights that were hit by the airspace closings, leading to slightly longer flight times.

OPSGROUP, an aviation industry co-operative that shares information on flight risks, said any aircraft travelling through Russian airspace should have contingency plans in place for closed airspace due to risks or sanctions.

Several explosions heard in Kyiv early Friday as Russian forces pressed on with assault

Explosions were heard in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv early Friday local time as Russian forces pressed on with a full-scale invasion in the first full day of fighting and could eventually rewrite the global post-Cold War security order.

After using air strikes on cities and military bases, Russian military units moved swiftly to take on Ukraine‚Äôs seat of government and its largest city in what U.S. officials suspect is a brazen attempt by Russian President Vladimir Putin to dismantle the government and replace it with his own regime.

Ukrainian leaders pleaded for help as civilians piled into trains and cars to flee, and hotels in Kyiv were being evacuated amid early indications of an assault.

One senior U.S. defense official described the attack so far as the first salvo in a multi-phase invasion aimed at seizing key population centers and ‚Äúdecapitating‚Äù Ukraine‚Äôs government.

Opinion: Are allies willing to bear the high cost of making Putin pay?

‚ÄúWe cannot allow this to be the end of the post-World-War-Two rules-based order,‚Äù Chrystia Freeland told reporters on Thursday. ‚ÄúIt could be.‚Äù

Canada‚Äôs Deputy Prime Minister often talks about the rules-based order, and it can sound academic, but in this case it was an appropriately ominous warning.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has, at any rate, shattered norms that the world counted on to deter catastrophe, using great-power military might to invade a democracy.

Ukrainians now face bombs and bloody war, but Ms. Freeland‚Äôs point was that the threat is not only to Ukraine, but a challenge to the order that has protected democracies from domination by stronger powers. For a long time, autocrats didn‚Äôt dare do this, and if nothing is done now, someone ‚Äì not necessarily just Mr. Putin ‚Äì will do it again.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau insisted, more than once, that Mr. Putin can‚Äôt be allowed to benefit from invasion ‚Äì and it should be obvious that Canada has every interest in uniting with other democracies to make Mr. Putin pay.

The threat of sanctions didn‚Äôt deter Mr. Putin from invasion, but Mr. Biden argued that the effects of the measures ‚Äì especially over time ‚Äì will so weaken Russia‚Äôs economy that Mr. Putin will face a difficult choice.

The embassy said for two decades Moscow had expressed concern over enlargement of NATO, a development it called ‚Äúa clear threat to our security.‚Äù The embassy said Russia had proposed solutions premised on principles including ‚Äúnot strengthening security at the expense of others.‚Äù It said this included efforts to incentivize Ukraine to ‚Äújoin this dialogue.‚Äù

The embassy said however Russia‚Äôs efforts were ‚Äúput on the back burner or haughtily ridiculed.‚Äù

It concluded by saying ‚Äúthe road to peace remains open‚Äù and that Russia remains receptive to ‚Äúmeaningful dialogue‚Äù on a new security arrangement in ‚ÄúEurope and the Euro-Atlantic.‚Äù

Afghan refugees stuck in Ukraine with no exit in sight

Afghan refugees who fled to Ukraine after the Taliban takeover of their home country are terrified that they have once again found themselves in a war zone, with no obvious exit.

‚ÄúEverything is finished,‚Äù said Jawed Haqmal, who worked as a translator for the Canadian military in Afghanistan and has been living in a Kyiv hotel with his family since the end of August. ‚ÄúJust like a war zone, everyone is running to the shelters, streets are full of the army. Just like war, the same as what was going on in front of the airport of Kabul on the last day. The same thing is going on here.‚Äù

Haqmal‚Äôs family of 12 arrived in Ukraine after being evacuated from Afghanistan by Ukrainian special forces, a mission that was carried out following a request from The Globe and Mail to the office of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Their stay in Ukraine was supposed to be a temporary stop on their way to Canada. The family, and others, are now trapped in Ukraine due to a bureaucratic delay.

Aidan Strickland, a spokesperson for Immigration Minister Sean Fraser, said IRCC ‚Äúhas been made aware of complex cases of Afghan citizens who are seeking resettlement to Canada, but are currently in Ukraine.‚Äù

Ukrainian-Canadian community rallies as Russian forces attack Ukraine

Canada has the largest Ukrainian population in the world, outside Russia and Ukraine. About 1.4 million Canadians are of Ukrainian ancestry, not counting significant additional populations of non-ethnic Ukrainians, among them Mennonites, Jews, Poles, Romanians and Swedes.

At the Ukrainian Cultural and Education Centre in Winnipeg, Yulia Zmerzla had a sleepless night watching the news in both Ukrainian and Russian. She came to Canada eight years ago and still has many friends and family in Ukraine, including her parents. ‚ÄúI spoke to my parents today, and they told me that life will never be the same again after today,‚Äù she said, through tears.

On Thursday, demonstrations were popping up in Montreal, Toronto, Edmonton and Vancouver to denounce Russia‚Äôs attack on Ukraine, and fundraisers were being set up to raise money both for humanitarian aid and military supplies for the country.

Jurij R. Klufas, president of the Ukrainian National Federation of Canada, said he, too, was having trouble reconciling the reality of what was happening in Ukraine, something he said seemed more like a relic of a primitive past, ‚Äúwhen everybody used to resolve issues with war.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very troubling to see at this time, in modern society, having somebody push in a military way their colonial convictions from the last two centuries,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind of almost crazy, surreal, to be seeing this kind of thing happening in today‚Äôs modern society, and in Europe.‚Äù

Taiwan to join countries sanctioning Russia

Taiwan Premier Su Tseng-chang said the island will join ‚Äúdemocratic countries‚Äù to put sanctions on Russia over the invasion of Ukraine, although he did not give details.

The crisis is being watched closely in Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory and has faced increased military pressure by Beijing over the last two years.

‚ÄùWe very harshly condemn such an act of invasion and will join democratic countries to jointly impose sanctions,‚Äù Su told reporters in Taipei without giving details. Taiwan Economy Minister Wang Mei-hua told reporters the island will ‚Äúharshly scrutinize‚Äù exports to Russia and ‚Äúco-ordinate‚Äù with unspecified allies for further actions.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky vowed on Friday to stay in Kyiv as his troops battled Russian invaders who are advancing toward the capital in the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two.

U.S. and Ukrainian officials say Russia aims to capture Kyiv and topple the government.

‚Äú(The) enemy has marked me down as the number one target,‚Äù Zelensky warned in a video message. ‚ÄúMy family is the number two target. They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state.‚Äù

The United Nations announced it is immediately allocating $20 million to scale up UN humanitarian operations in Ukraine.

Secretary-general Antonio Guterres made the announcement saying the UN and its humanitarian partners ‚Äúare committed to staying and delivering, to support people in Ukraine in their time of need ‚Ä¶ regardless of who or where they are.‚Äù

‚ÄúWith deaths rising, we are seeing images of fear, anguish and terror in every corner of Ukraine,‚Äù the UN chief said. ‚ÄúPeople ‚Äì everyday innocent people ‚Äì always pay the highest price.‚Äù

UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths said the $20 million from the UN‚Äôs Central Emergency Response Fund will support emergency operations along the contact line in eastern Donetsk and Luhansk and in other areas of the country, and will ‚Äúhelp with health care, shelter, food, and water and sanitation to the most vulnerable people affected by the conflict.‚Äù

Watch: History professor from Kyiv on Ukraine‚Äôs response to Russia invasion

They came in a steady stream, looking weary and confused as they made their way through the train station in Przemysl, a small Polish city about 10 kilometres from the border with Ukraine. Some had come from Kyiv, others from Lviv, in western Ukraine, and still more from farther east.

Olgah Martynyuk, a history professor at Kyiv‚Äôs Polytechnic Institute, made a mad rush for the train after hearing bombs drop around the capital Thursday morning. ‚ÄúI woke up from blasts in the morning and I packed up,‚Äù Prof. Martynyuk said as she sat in Przemysl‚Äôs train station after a 14-hour journey. She was happy to be safe but felt unsettled about leaving her country. ‚ÄúI still feel enormous guilt,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWhat did we do wrong that all of this is happening?‚Äù

Poland has been bracing for months for the possibility of as many as one million refugees from Ukraine in the wake of a Russian invasion. Preparations have been slow to roll out, and on Thursday officials in Przemysl, the Polish city closest to the border, still appeared to be scrambling to come up with some kind of support structure.

On Thursday night the train station was expecting as many as 2,000 refugees to arrive on two trains from Kyiv early Friday morning. But just two local officials were on hand to help. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid that we will lose control,‚Äù one said.

L'acc√®s √† Internet subit des coupures dans de nombreuses r√©gions d'Ukraine depuis plusieurs jours. Piratages, bombardements... Si les causes peuvent √™tre multiples, les cons√©quences sont les m√™mes. Les observateurs internationaux et la population du pays craignent un blackout g√©n√©ralis√©.

A mesure que les chars russes p√©n√®trent sur le territoire ukrainien, les coupures d'Internet se multiplient, notamment dans la deuxi√®me plus grande ville du pays, Kharkiv. Co√Øncidence ou non, sur cette m√™me p√©riode, les cyberattaques de la Russie ont perturb√© de nombreux sites de banques ou d'administrations. Certains experts internationaux craignent un blackout g√©n√©ralis√©, une possibilit√© qui faciliterait d'autant plus la t√¢che √† la Russie.

Les attaques par d√©ni de service (DDoS) sur le r√©seau internet ukrainien se sont multipli√©es ces derni√®res semaines. Toutefois, ces attaques DDoS ne semblent pourtant pas √† l'origine des incidents internet de ces derniers jours. Le plus important a eu lieu jeudi 24 f√©vrier. Une grande partie du r√©seau des alentours de Kharkiv, la deuxi√®me plus grande ville d'Ukraine, s'est retrouv√©e en partie sans connexion.

D√©crochage du r√©seau pendant plusieurs heures

Les informations fournies par NetBlocks, un organisme en charge de l'observation d'Internet, montrent un important d√©crochage des donn√©es de Triolan, un des principaux op√©rateurs du pays, de l'ordre de 25 % dans la nuit du mercredi 23 f√©vrier. Si dans un premier temps, les observateurs ont pens√© que les bombardements aux alentours de la r√©gion avaient pu endommager des installations de t√©l√©communication, il appara√Æt aujourd'hui que l'op√©rateur a √©t√© victime d'un piratage.

Sur son site internet, Triolan dit avoir √©t√© la cible de plusieurs piratages de ""n≈ìuds cl√©s"" de son r√©seau. ""Un certain nombre de routeurs de notre r√©seau ont √©t√© d√©sactiv√©s sans r√©cup√©ration possible √† distance, avec un total de 57 n≈ìuds √† Kiev, Kharkiv, Dnipro, Poltava, Odessa, Rivne et Zaporijia"", d√©taille le fournisseur d'acc√®s √† Internet, qui √©voque √©galement des √©quipements physiques endommag√©s.

Ce vendredi, l'op√©rateur affirme √™tre en train de tenter de r√©parer son r√©seau, mais de nombreux probl√®mes subsistent. Les serveurs DNS du fournisseur, qui servent √† relier un nom de domaine (comme www.lesnumeriques.com) √† une adresse IP, connaissent des incidents. Triolan conseille donc aux utilisateurs ukrainiens de configurer eux-m√™mes ces derniers avec les DNS de Google (8.8.8.8 et 8.8.8.4) ou Cloudflare (1.1.1.1).

Couper Internet, une attaque comme une autre

La Russie est-elle derri√®re le piratage des n≈ìuds du r√©seau ? A l'heure actuelle, aucune information n'a corrobor√© ou infirm√© une telle possibilit√©. Quoi qu‚Äôil en soit, dans les conflits de cette ampleur, couper, ralentir ou censurer internet est souvent b√©n√©fique √† l‚Äôune des parties en pr√©sence.

Felicia Anthonio, de l'organisation de d√©fense des droits num√©riques Access Now, d√©taille √† The Verge, les cons√©quences directes des coupures internet dans les situations de conflit. ""L'infrastructure internet devient une cible afin de contr√¥ler le flux d'informations et d'obtenir ou de maintenir le pouvoir pendant un conflit, nous l'avons constat√© √† travers la destruction de l'infrastructure t√©l√©com du Y√©men apr√®s des frappes a√©riennes de l'Arabie saoudite"", d√©taille-t-elle √† nos confr√®res.

M√™me si la Russie n'est pas directement derri√®re les pannes de ces derniers jours, le pays de Vladimir Poutine a d√©montr√© √† de nombreuses reprises qu'il √©tait en capacit√© d'affecter s√©v√®rement l'Internet mondial. Comme le r√©v√©lait le New York Times en 2015, la Russie s'int√©ressait de pr√®s aux c√¢bles sous-marins internet. A l'√©poque, la flotte russe naviguait tr√®s r√©guli√®rement √† proximit√© de ces derniers, et √©taient alors en capacit√© de les espionner et m√™me de les couper. Partant de ce constat, on ne doute pas qu'en sept ans, la Russie se soit perfectionn√©e.",https://www.lesnumeriques.com/vie-du-net/ukraine-de-mysterieuses-coupures-internet-depuis-plusieurs-jours-n177461.html
