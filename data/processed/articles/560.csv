On February 24, Russia invaded Ukraine and seized the defunct Chernobyl plant, site of a 1986 disaster that killed hundreds and spread radioactive contamination west across Europe.

International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi ""indicated that remote data transmission from safeguards monitoring systems installed at the Chornobyl NPP had been lost"", the agency said in a statement.

""The Agency is looking into the status of safeguards monitoring systems in other locations in Ukraine and will provide further information soon,"" it said.

The IAEA uses the term ""safeguards"" to describe technical measures it applies to nuclear material and activities, with the objective of deterring the spread of nuclear weapons through early detection of the misuse of such material.

More than 200 technical staff and guards remain trapped at the site, working 13 days straight since the Russian takeover.

The situation for the staff ""was worsening"" at the site, the IAEA said, citing the Ukrainian nuclear regulator.

The defunct plant sits inside an exclusion zone that houses decommissioned reactors as well as radioactive waste facilities.

More than 2,000 staff still work at the plant as it requires constant management to prevent another nuclear disaster.

The UN agency called on Russia to allow workers to rotate because rest and regular shifts were crucial to the site's safety.

""I'm deeply concerned about the difficult and stressful situation facing staff at the Chornobyl nuclear power plant and the potential risks this entails for nuclear safety,"" said Grossi.

""I call on the forces in effective control of the site to urgently facilitate the safe rotation of personnel there.""

With remote data transmission cut off and the Ukrainian regulator only able to contact the plant by email, Grossi reiterated his offer to travel to the site or elsewhere to secure ""the commitment to the safety and security"" of Ukraine's power plants from all parties.

Russia also attacked and seized Europe's largest atomic power plant, Zaporizhzhia, last week, drawing accusations of ""nuclear terror"" from Kyiv.

Zaporizhzhia alone has six reactors of a more modern, safer design than the one that melted down at Chernobyl.

The IAEA said two of those were still operating, the plant's personnel were working in shifts and radiation levels remained stable.

2,13933b4f-92d2-4983-8e91-30d63952ec6c,[],,"Ukraine told the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) today that it was becoming increasingly urgent and important for the safe management of the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) to rotate some 210 technical personnel and guards who have been working there since Russian forces took control of the site almost two weeks ago, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said.

In contrast to the current situation for staff at Ukraine’s operating nuclear power plants who are rotating regularly, the same shift has been on duty at the Chornobyl NPP since the day before the Russian military entered the site of the 1986 accident on 24 February, in effect living there for the past 13 days, the regulator said.

The Ukrainian regulator added that the staff had access to food and water, and medicine to a limited extent. However, the situation for the staff was worsening. It asked the IAEA to lead the international support needed to prepare a plan for replacing the current personnel and for providing the facility with an effective rotation system.

Director General Grossi has repeatedly stressed that staff operating nuclear facilities must be able to rest and work in regular shifts, stating this is crucial for overall nuclear safety. Their capacity to make decisions free of undue pressure is among the seven indispensable pillars of nuclear safety and security he outlined at a meeting of the IAEA’s Board of Governors on 2 March, convened to address the safety, security and safeguards implications of the situation in Ukraine.

“I’m deeply concerned about the difficult and stressful situation facing staff at the Chornobyl nuclear power plant and the potential risks this entails for nuclear safety. I call on the forces in effective control of the site to urgently facilitate the safe rotation of personnel there,” he said today.

The handling of nuclear material at the Chornobyl NPP has been put on hold for the time being, the regulator added. The site, located in an Exclusion Zone, includes decommissioned reactors as well as radioactive waste facilities. The regulatory authority said it could only communicate with the plant via e-mail.

To help protect the country’s nuclear facilities, the Director General has expressed his readiness to travel to the Chornobyl NPP, or elsewhere, to secure the commitment to the safety and security of all Ukraine’s nuclear facilities from the parties of the conflict.

The Director General also indicated that remote data transmission from safeguards monitoring systems installed at the Chornobyl NPP had been lost. The Agency is looking into the status of safeguards monitoring systems in other locations in Ukraine and will provide further information soon.

Regarding the status of Ukraine’s operational nuclear power plants, the regulator said eight of the country’s 15 reactors were operating, including two at the Zaporizhzhya NPP controlled since last week by Russian forces, and that the plants’ personnel were working in shifts. Radiation levels at the sites were normal, it said.",https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/pressreleases/update-15-iaea-director-general-statement-on-situation-in-ukraine

4,13933b4f-92d2-4983-8e91-30d63952ec6c,['Alejandro De La Garza'],,"Before Russian troops crossed the border into Ukraine last month, Olena Pareniuk and Kateryna Shavanova worked at Chernobyl studying microorganisms in the exclusion zone and those living in the radioactive lava inside the site’s collapsed No. 4 reactor. Both are currently in Ukraine (Shavanova is in Kyiv while Pareniuk is near Chernivtsi). Writing together, they corresponded with TIME earlier this week about the dangers that Russian military activity poses to Chernobyl and the country’s nuclear infrastructure, and the possible consequences of an accident. This conversation has been condensed and edited for length and clarity.

What are the current risks at the Chernobyl site?

The vital need is to rotate the staff of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. The staff, who are still at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, came in on February 23. The enemy has not allowed any opportunity to change the staff, who are psychologically and physically exhausted due to the lack of rotation and the constant pressure caused by armed people. This can lead to loss of control over the safety of the facility and the inability to respond to internal and external initial events such as fire, which in turn can lead to severe radiation effects.

In addition, the connection with the automated control system and the accurate data on the radiation status of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant has been lost. From 11:22 on March 9, 2022, there has been no electricity supply at the Chernobyl plant. According to plant’s management, an additional supply of diesel fuel for diesel power plants has been delivered to the site, providing emergency power supply for spent nuclear fuel storage facilities, as well as the New Safe Confinement facility. On Monday Ukrainian staff managed to restore electricity supply, but on Tuesday there were interruptions again. The main risk of the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone is not radiation, but Russian troops.

What is the worst case scenario at Chernobyl?

In case of a complete power outage, there is a risk of disabling the safety of important systems and equipment, in particular: ventilation, heat dissipation, technological, and radiation control systems. The possibility of remote control over nuclear and radiation safety indicators at storage facilities, the New Safe Confinement facility, and other facilities will be lost. Operators will be unable to control the level and temperature of water in spent nuclear fuel storage pools.

There are long-lived radionuclides in the spent nuclear fuel storage, which in case of an accident can get into the Kakhovka Reservoir, and further along the Dnipro river into the Black Sea. A huge area would be contaminated by radiation for thousands of years. If there is an accident with one power unit or one container for spent fuel, depending on the direction of wind the radioactive cloud will affect Russia, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, and other border countries.

What are the risks to Ukraine’s other nuclear reactors?

Zaporizhzhya power plant and the city of Energodar are still under the control of Russian military units. There haven’t been changes to the condition of power units: two units are working, two power units are under repair (№ 1 and № 6), the rest are stopped. There are seven nuclear sites at Zaporizhzhya: six nuclear power units and a spent nuclear fuel storage facility are equivalent to about 20 Chernobyls! This is a huge amount of nuclear material, which is now out of [Ukraine’s] control, [and] even of the International Atomic Energy Association. This is a danger not only for Ukraine, but to nearby countries. Other Ukrainian nuclear power plants are under Ukraine’s control, but the country is at war and the situation is changing very quickly.

What is the likelihood of a major nuclear incident due to the fighting?

Right now, Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhya are under direct threat. Russian troops continue to grossly violate the requirements of radiation safety and security, which worsens the radiation situation and contributes to the spread of radioactive contamination outside the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. Destruction of the Chernobyl confinement structure in case of the explosion is highly probable and may lead to the release of highly radioactive dust into the environment.

At Zaporizhzhya, the threat depends on the direction of the wind at the time of the possible accident. During the recent fighting, the wind blew to the southeast, towards Crimea, Melitopol, Rostov, Turkey, the Black Sea. And the Black Sea connects with the Mediterranean, and therefore, radioactive contamination in case of an accident will spread throughout the basin and harm many more countries.

The problem is that the accident at the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant [ZNPP], if it happens, may be quite different from what happened at Chernobyl. The construction of reactors at ZNPP is much safer than at Chernobyl, but the Chernobyl accident was addressed by the entire Soviet Union. Now, in the conditions of hostilities, the elimination of the accident will be complicated, and Ukraine simply does not have the resources to do it. We will not even discuss the risks of disrupting the integrity of the Zaporizhzhya reactors—because these are six power units, and each of them can do as much damage as Chernobyl, polluting the air of the entire Northern Hemisphere.

It is impossible to predict in any way how events will move forward. Russians are crazy, violating all international agreements. No one with common sense will enter the territory of a nuclear plant with artillery weapons. For us, as experts who helped overcome the consequences of the Fukushima accident, such behavior does not even fit into our understanding of the world. For us, it’s as if the river flowed up in the sky by itself or the sky turned orange. Anything can happen [with] those who have a diseased brain. This nuclear material can fall into anyone’s hands and anything can be done with it.

US LOOKS TO KEEP UKRAINIAN 'BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH FACILITIES' FROM RUSSIAN CONTROL

The Chernobyl facility was the site of a 1986 accident that released radioactive material into the environment. As a result, it sits in an ""Exclusion Zone"" in which workers rotate in and out to avoid prolonged exposure to radiation.

The Russian military has taken control of two of Ukraine's four nuclear power plants: Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station, which was seized and shelled by Russian forces on March 3.

The IAEA's statement said eight of the country’s 15 reactors at the four plants were operating, and radiation levels at the sites were normal, according to Ukraine's nuclear regulator.

Recently, Russia leveled multiple accusations of nuclear malfeasance directed at Ukraine. On Sunday, Russia accused Ukraine of attempting to build a ""plutonium-based dirty bomb nuclear weapon"" at Chernobyl and, separately, of plotting to blow up a nuclear reactor in Kharkiv and blame it on Russia.

Russia did not provide evidence for either accusation.
