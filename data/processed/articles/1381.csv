BRUSSELS, Feb 27 (Reuters) - The European Union will tighten sanctions on Russia, target Russian ally Belarus with measures and fund weapons for Ukraine to help it defend itself against Russia's invasion, top EU officials said on Sunday.

""For the first time ever, the European Union will finance the purchase and delivery of weapons and other equipment to a country that is under attack, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said.

She said the European Union would close its airspace to Russian aircraft, including the private jets of Russian oligarchs.

The bloc will ban Russian state-owned television network Russia Today and news agency Sputnik. Von der Leyen said this was to render them unable to ""spread their lies to justify Putin's war and to sow division in our Union"".

Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.

For Russian ally Belarus, the European Union will impose a ban on imports of products from mineral fuels to tobacco, wood and timber, cement, iron and steel.

These come on top of a series of sanctions on Russia already unveiled, such as on its energy sector and the exclusion of certain Russian banks from the SWIFT messaging system that dominates global payments.

The European Union will also finance the purchase and delivery of weapons and other equipment to Ukraine.

""Another taboo has fallen. The taboo that the European Union was not providing arms in a war,"" EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in a statement before a meeting of EU foreign ministers.

The bloc aims to spend 450 million euros ($507 million) of EU funds on weapons for Ukraine, a Commission source told Reuters, and a further 50 million euros on items such as medical supplies.

“We are stepping up our support for Ukraine. For the first time, the EU will finance the purchase and delivery of weapons and equipment to a country under attack. We are also strengthening our sanctions against the Kremlin,” tweeted Ursula von der Leyen President of the EU Commission. Leyen said that NATO allies are shutting down the EU airspace for Russian-owned, Russian-registered or Russian-controlled aircraft.

“They won’t be able to land in, take off or overfly the territory of the EU. Including the private jets of oligarchs,” said President of the EU Commission.

Leyen also said that they are banning Kremlin’s media machine in the EU.

“The state-owned Russia Today and Sputnik, and their subsidiaries, will no longer be able to spread their lies to justify Putin’s war. We are developing tools to ban their toxic and harmful disinformation in Europe,” said Leyen.

She also said that Belarus’ leader Alexander Lukashenko will also be targeted with a new package of sanctions.

“We will target the other aggressor in this war, Lukashenko’s regime, with a new package of sanctions, hitting their most important sectors. All these measures come on top of the strong package presented yesterday, agreed by our international partners,” said Leyen.

Earlier, during a phone call with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy agreed that the Ukrainian delegation would meet with the Russian delegation without preconditions on the Ukrainian-Belarusian border, near the Pripyat River.

“Lukashenko has taken responsibility for ensuring that all planes, helicopters, and missiles stationed on Belarusian territory remain on the ground during the Ukrainian delegation’s travel, talks, and return, Zelensky’s office wrote,” The Kyiv Independent tweeted.

Meanwhile, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Lieutenant-General Valery Zaluzhny said that they are opposing one of the largest armies in the world.

“We are opposed by one of the largest armies in the world. But we are stronger! And every day our benches get stronger. In 2 days almost 100 thousand citizens were mobilized, half of them are reservists of the TRO Forces!, said Zaluzhny.

“Mriya aircraft ruined in a Russian attack near Kyiv. The world’s biggest cargo aircraft, Antonov An-225, was moored at the Antonov Airport in Hostomel during the recent battle. UkrOboronProm said that the aircraft may be restored for USD 3 billion at Russia’s expense,” tweeted The Kyiv Independent.

Airlines are cancelling flights in and out of Russia and numerous countries closed airspace to Russian airlines.

The US Embassy reminded US citizens that the Department of State’s Travel Advisory level for Russia is at “Level 4: Do Not Travel.”

“I spoke today with Greek Foreign Minister @NikosDendias about our efforts to support Ukraine in resisting Russia’s unbridled aggression. Greece remains a vital @NATO Ally and supporter of Ukrainian sovereignty,” tweeted US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.

Meanwhile, Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio also spoke with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and said that he has signed a resolution for the immediate disbursement of 110 million euros to the government of Kyiv.

Kuleba said that what is happening now in Ukraine is a real people’s war.

“What is happening now in Ukraine is a real people’s war. We will not fall. We will not stop or get tired. We are determined to fight back fiercely as long as it is needed to defend our land and our people,” tweeted Kuleba

“I told my colleague @DmytroKuleba that I have just signed a resolution for the immediate disbursement of 110 million euros to the government of Kiev, as a concrete expression of Italy’s solidarity and support for a people with whom we have a fraternal relationship,” tweeted Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio.

“As part of the strengthening of the Alliance’s deterrence posture, starting from Monday the commitment of @ItalianAirForce in #Romania will be doubled. 4 additional #Eurofighters to the TF Air Black Storm in defense of #NATO airspace,” he added.

Moreover, Vladimir Putin had a telephone conversation with Prime Minister of the State of Israel Naftali Bennett at the initiative of the Israeli side.

Vladimir Putin briefed the Prime Minister on the course of the special military operation to defend Donbas and noted that the Russian delegation is in Gomel, Belarus, and is ready for talks with representatives from Kyiv, who have not yet seized this opportunity, thereby showing their lack of consistency, read Kremlin statement.

In turn, Naftali Bennett Bennett Naftali Bennett NaftaliPrime Minister of the State of Israel offered Israel as a mediator with a view to suspend military operations.

The EU’s plan to fund weapons purchases will use millions of euros to help buy air-defense systems, anti-tank weapons, ammunition and other military equipment for Ukraine’s armed forces. It would also supply things like fuel, protective gear, helmets and first-aid kits.

""For the first time ever, the European Union will finance the purchase and delivery of weapons and other equipment to a country that is under attack,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said of the weapons purchases, calling it a “watershed moment.”

Von der Leyen expects the measure to be endorsed by EU leaders along with other significant moves -- a ban on pro-Kremlin media outlets RT and Sputnik, the closure of EU airspace to Russian planes, and sanctions against Belarus.

She said RT and Sputnik are part of the ""Kremlin’s media machine,” and the EU is “developing tools to ban their toxic and harmful disinformation in Europe,” von der Leyen said.

They will “no longer be able to spread their lies to justify Putin's war and to sow division in our union,” von der Leyen said.

The closure of the EU’s airspace comes after many individual European countries along with Britain and Canada announced they would ban Russian planes. The EU airspace ban will prohibit flights into or over the EU by ""every Russian plane -- and that includes the private jets of oligarchs,” von der Leyen said.

The EU also will hit Russian ally Belarus with sanctions for facilitating the invasion. The regime of Belarusian strongman Alyaksandr Lukashenka had been “complicit in the vicious attack against Ukraine,” von der Leyen said.

New restrictive measures will hit Belarus’s most important sectors, including tobacco, wood, cement, iron and steel.

The measures come on top of EU sanctions announced Feb. 26, including cutting some Russian banks from the SWIFT interbank messaging network, banning all transactions with Russia's central bank, and added restrictions on Russian oligarchs.

The measures also follow Germany’s decision to commit 100 billion euros ($113 billion) to a special armed forces fund and to keep its defense spending above 2% of GDP from now on.

The EU will also ban the “Kremlin’s media machine,” this entails banning state-owned Russia Today and Sputnik and their subsidiaries.

“[RT and Sputnik] will no longer be able to spread their lies to justify [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s war and to sow division in our union,” she said.

Von der Leyen also announced that the EU will “target the other aggressor,” namely Russian ally Belarus with sanctions.

“[Belarus President Alexander] Lukashenko’s regime is complicit in the vicious attack against Ukraine. So we will hit Lukashenko’s regime with a new package of sanctions,” she said, adding that the sanctions will target a variety of sectors, restricting their exports from mineral fuel to tobacco, wooden timbre, iron and steel.

The EU will also sanction Belarusian individuals helping the Russian war effort.

The new sanctions come on top of the measures announced by the EU on Saturday, including excluding main Russian banks from the SWIFT system, and banning the transactions of Russia’s central bank and freezing its assets, in addition to targeting the assets of Russian oligarchs.

Russia’s began its invasion of Ukraine on Thursday bringing explosions and setting off air raid sirens in Kyiv and other cities, and leading to dozens of Ukrainian casualties both civilian and military.

Putin ordered earlier on Sunday Russian nuclear forces on high alert, citing NATO’s “aggressive [and] illegitimate sanctions” against Russia as the cause.

The European Union agreed Sunday to provide some €500 million in arms and other aid to the Ukrainian military as it battles Russia’s invasion, in a move the bloc described as a “watershed moment” in its history.

The EU’s treaties bar the bloc from using its normal budget to fund operations with military or defense implications. Under the plans announced Sunday, as first reported by POLITICO, the EU will use an off-budget so-called “European Peace Facility” financing instrument with a ceiling of €5 billion that can be used to provide military aid.

“For the first time ever, the EU will finance the purchase and delivery of weapons and other equipment to a country that is under attack,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said at a media appearance alongside the EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell. “This is a watershed moment,” she added.

The plan was agreed at an emergency videoconference of EU foreign affairs ministers on Sunday evening.

“Another taboo has fallen,” Borrell said. “The taboo that the EU was not providing arms in a war, yes we are doing it … This war requires our engagement in order to support the Ukrainian army.”

Borrell said the EU had agreed “to provide arms — lethal arms, lethal assistance — to the Ukrainian army for a value of [a] €450 million support package and €50 million more for the non-lethal supplies – [such as] fuel and protective equipment.”

The amount represents 10 percent of the €5 billion allocated to the European Peace Facility for the 2021-2027 budget cycle and “almost all what we can spend for this year,” one diplomat said.

The plans were announced a day after the German government said it would provide lethal weapons to Ukraine — a historic shift by a country that had long prohibited sending such arms into conflict zones.

Von der Leyen and Borrell said the proposal will also strengthen the EU’s previously announced package of measures designed to step up international support for Ukraine by imposing more financial sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, like removing “selected Russian banks” from the SWIFT international payments system.

The EU is also set to shut down its airspace for Russian planes — following similar moves made by most EU countries — and ban what von der Leyen called the Kremlin’s “media machine,” referring to state-owned outlets like Russia Today and Sputnik, as well as their subsidiaries.

Sanctions will also be strengthened against Belarus and Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko, a close Russian ally, with restrictive measures affecting the country’s mineral, fuels, tobacco and steel sectors, and “those Belarusians helping the Russian war effort,” von der Leyen added.

8,4e220abb-9bf9-47a6-9a39-eb65c168936f,"['Emily Schultheis', 'Associated Press', 'Lorne Cook']",2022-02-27 12:51:23-04:00,"BRUSSELS — The European Union plans to close its airspace to Russian airlines, fund weapons purchase to Ukraine and ban some pro-Kremlin media outlets in its latest response to Russia’s invasion, European Commission officials said Sunday.

The measures, which Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she expected to be endorsed, would mark the first time the 27-nation bloc finances the purchase and delivery of weapons and equipment to a country under attack.

“Another taboo has fallen. The taboo that the European Union was not providing arms in a war,” said the EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell.

Canada’s transport minister, Omar Alghabra, said his nation was also closing its airspace to all Russian planes to hold the country accountable for an unprovoked attack on its neighbor.

The European Commission’s plans followed the announcement earlier in the day that Germany was committing 100 billion euros ($113 billion) to a special armed forces fund and would keep its defense spending above 2% of GDP from now on. The shift underscored how Russia’s war on Ukraine was rewriting Europe’s post-World War II security and defense policy in ways that were unthinkable only a few weeks ago.

Anti-war protesters, meanwhile, took to the streets in Berlin, Rome, Prague, Istanbul and other cities — even Russian cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg and in a dozen Belarusian cities — to demand an end to the war, the largest ground offensive on the continent since WWII.

Human rights advocates reported that more than 170 people had been arrested in the Belarusian protests, even as the country’s authoritarian leader offered the country’s territory to his ally Russia. In Minsk, a large pile of flowers kept growing at the building of Ukraine’s embassy.

Tens of thousands of people massed Sunday in front of Berlin’s Brandenburg Gate, with some carrying posters with slogans such as “Hands off Ukraine,” “Tanks to Windmills” and “Putin, go to therapy and leave Ukraine and the world in peace.”

The EU’s plan to fund weapons purchases was unprecedented and would use millions of euros to help buy air defense systems, anti-tank weapons, ammunition and other military equipment to Ukraine’s armed forces. It would also supply things like fuel, protective gear, helmets and first aid kits.

The system might also use EU money to reimburse EU countries that have already sent lethal and non-lethal aid to Ukraine this year, giving an incentive for those countries to invest more in such assistance.

To bolster its military training and support missions around the world, the 27-nation bloc has set up a European Peace Facility, a fund with a ceiling of around 5.7 billion euros ($6.4 billion). Some of the money can be used to train and equip partner countries, including with lethal weapons.

Von der Leyen said beyond the weapons purchases, EU nations would shut down EU airspace for Russians — decisions that over a dozen EU members had already announced.

“We are proposing a prohibition on all Russian-owned, Russian registered or Russian-controlled aircraft. These aircraft will no more be able to land in, take off or overfly the territory of the EU,” she said.

She said the EU will also ban “the Kremlin’s media machine. The state-owned Russia Today and Sputnik, as well as their subsidiaries, will no longer be able to spread their lies to justify Putin’s war and to sow division in our union.”

Von der Leyen added that the EU will also target Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko for supporting Russia’s widespread military campaign in Ukraine.

“We will hit Lukashenko’s regime with a new package of sanctions,” she said.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s announcement of new defense funding is hugely significant for Germany, which has come under criticism from the United States and other NATO allies for not investing adequately in its defense budget. NATO member states committed to spending 2% of their GDP on defense, but Germany has consistently spent much less.

“It’s clear we need to invest significantly more in the security of our country, in order to protect our freedom and our democracy,” Scholz told a special session of the Bundestag in Berlin.

Scholz said the 100 billion euro fund ($113 billion) was currently a one-time measure for 2022. It wasn’t immediately clear whether similar funding would be allocated in future years. But Scholz indicated Germany will exceed the 2% of GDP threshold going forward, signaling an overall future increase in defense spending.

A day earlier, Germany announced another major policy shift, saying it will send weapons and other supplies directly to Ukraine, including 500 Stinger missiles, which are used to shoot down helicopters and warplanes, and 1,000 anti-tank weapons.

Israel announced it was sending 100 tons of humanitarian aid — medical equipment and medicine, tents, sleeping bags and blankets — to help civilians in Ukraine. Israel also offered itself as a potential mediator during a phone call between Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and Putin, the Kremlin and Israel said. Bennett spoke also Friday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is Jewish.

As Greece sent more military aid, Turkish officials termed Russia’s invasion a “war,” a categorization that could lead Ankara to close down the Turkish straits to Russian warships, which Ukraine requested earlier this week. The 1936 Montreux Convention gives Turkey the right to bar “belligerent states” from using the Dardanelles and the Bosporus during wartime but provides an exception for Black Sea vessels to return to port.

On the sanctions front, Japan joined the United States and European nations in cutting key Russian banks from the SWIFT international financial banking system. Japan will also freeze assets of Putin and other top Russian officials, while sending $100 million in emergency humanitarian aid to Ukraine, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters.

Catholic and Orthodox religious leaders, meanwhile, prayed Sunday for peace, voiced solidarity with Ukrainians and denounced the Russian invasion.

At the Vatican, Ukrainian flags fluttered in St. Peter’s Square as Pope Francis delivered his weekly Sunday blessing and appealed for global solidarity for “the suffering people of Ukraine.”

“Those who make war forget humanity,” Francis said. He refrained from citing Russia by name, in apparent deference to his hopes of keeping dialogue open with the Russian Orthodox Church.

Also Sunday, the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople described Russia’s invasion as “beyond every sense of law and morality” and pleaded for an end to the war.

Patriarch Bartholomew is considered the spiritual leader and first among equals of Eastern Orthodox Christians worldwide. He granted the independence of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, which severed it in 2019 from the Russian church to which it had been tied since 1686. The Russian Orthodox Church severed relations with him as result.",https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/eu-shuts-airspace-to-russian-airlines-will-buy-ukraine-arms
