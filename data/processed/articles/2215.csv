Early Thursday morning local time, Putin claimed that the operation was protecting eastern Ukraine from what he said was a “regime.”

According to The Associated Press, explosions were heard in Kyiv, the northeastern city of Kharkiv and other parts of Ukraine as the Russian president was speaking.

Russia has amassed up to 190,000 troops on Ukraine’s border, and the U.S. and allies have warned that a military incursion against Ukraine was imminent.

The Biden administration has warned that major cities in Ukraine could be targeted for an attack, including the capital of Kyiv, a city of 2.8 million people.

Following Putin’s announcement, CNN’s Matthew Chance reported hearing what he described as a “big bang” behind him.

“I just heard a big bang right here behind me,” Chance said during a live broadcast of CNN’s “Don Lemon Tonight.”

“There are big explosions taking place in Kyiv right now, I can’t see where they’re taking place from this vantage point here on top of the roof of the hotel in central Kyiv,” he continued.

Chance said the sounds were “quite distant” from where he was standing.

Separately, during a broadcast of CBS News Special Report, CBS international correspondent Charlie D’Agata reported hearing “five loud explosions,” and then stopped his update for what he said was a fighter jet flying overhead.

D’Agata then said there were three explosions to begin with, followed by two more.

Another CBS correspondent Holly Williams also reported hearing explosions shortly past 5 a.m. local time in Kharkiv, just 20 miles near the Russian border.

The Washington Post reported that explosions could be heard in Kyiv, as well as the northeastern city of Kharkiv. A senior Ukrainian official also told the Post that there were explosions at Kyiv’s Boryspil airport.",https://thehill.com/policy/defense/595609-explosions-heard-in-major-ukraine-cities-following-putin-announcement

The images emerging from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are reminders of what wars often prove: cities are both key strategic targets and the places that bear the greatest costs of conflict.

Towns and villages in the path of the Russian advance have also been devastated. But it is the cities, which were home to about two-thirds of Ukraine’s 44 million people before the invasion, that are the focus of the Russian assault.

Now, from Kharkiv and Kyiv in the north to Mariupol in the south, many women and children have fled, and urban neighborhoods are becoming battlegrounds. Businesses, homes, schools, cultural institutions and historical buildings are all threatened with destruction, and as of late March, at least 1,500 civilian targets have been damaged or destroyed.

Russian missiles destroyed an airport in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro and five emergency workers were injured in the attack.

“There has been another attack on Dnipro airport. There is nothing left of it,” Valentyn Reznichenko, governor of the central Dnipropetrovsk region, said on Sunday.

“The airport itself and the infrastructure around it has been destroyed. Rockets keep flying and flying,” Reznichenko said on Telegram.

A missile also hit a building in the city’s Pavlohrad district, and emergency workers were combing through an infrastructure facility that was hit in the town of Zvonetsky.

Reznichenko said attacks on Dnipro city, which lies on the banks of the Dnieper River, intensified on Sunday.

The industrial city of one million people has been targeted by Russian forces since the invasion, but has so far been spared major destruction.

Separately, the head of the Dnipro region council, Mykola Lukashuk, says five staffers of the state emergency service had been wounded by the strike on the airport.

Russia’s Defence Ministry said that missiles fired overnight had destroyed a Ukrainian military base in Zvonetsky that had recently “received reinforcements from foreign mercenaries”.

On Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy tweeted that he had discussed possible additional sanctions on Russia in a call with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Zelenskyy has called for an embargo on imported gas and oil from Russia, but Germany so far resisted pressure to declare an embargo.

Scholz said on Friday that Germany could end Russian oil imports this year, but stopping gas imports would be tougher because the country would need to build infrastructure to import gas from alternative sources.

Russian oil accounts for 25 percent of German imports, down from 35 percent before the February 24 invasion. Gas imports to Germany from Russia have been cut to 40 percent from 55 percent, and hard coal imports to 25 percent from 50 percent.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/4/10/russian-rockets-destroy-airport-in-ukrainian-city-of-dnipro

Russian forces have seized control of Chernobyl nuclear power plant after a 'fierce' battle, with the condition of nuclear storage facilities 'unknown', sparking fears of a radiation leak that could cause fallout in Europe.

Video revealed Russian tanks and armoured vehicles standing in front of the destroyed reactor, which sits just 60 miles north of the capital Kiev.

An official said Russian shelling hit a radioactive waste repository and an increase in radiation levels was reported, although this has not yet been corroborated.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said it is following the situation in Ukraine 'with grave concern' and appealed for maximum restraint to avoid any action that may put Ukraine's nuclear facilities at risk.

Ukrainian presidential advisor Myhailo Podolyak said: 'After the absolutely senseless attack of the Russians in this direction, it is impossible to say that the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is safe.'

Meanwhile Turkey reported that one of its ships had been hit by a 'bomb' off the coast of Odessa, where fighting is also going on. Turkey is a member of NATO, underlining fears that the war in Ukraine could quickly suck in other states and spark an all-out conflict in Europe.

Speaking after the latest developments, Joe Biden announced more sanctions against Russia but admitted that he had not expected previous threats of financial penalties to deter Vladimir Putin.

He also resisted calls to send in US troops to Ukraine, saying he has no plans to speak to the Russian leader who he accuses of trying to rebuild a Soviet empire.

The sanctions will target Russian banks, oligarchs, state-controlled companies and high-tech sectors, but Russian oil and natural gas were exempt in a bid to avoid disruption to global markets.

'Putin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war. And now he and his country will bear the consequences,' Biden said in remarks at the White House.

Elsewhere, Kiev ordered civilians into bomb shelters and declared a curfew amid concerns Russia is about to strike the capital as Ukrainian troops lost control of a key airfield around 15 miles away. Russian forces had attacked it with around two dozen attack helicopters earlier in the day, four of which are thought to have been shot down.

'They are going to bomb Kyiv now. Authorities told us to hide in shelters,' a source in the city told MailOnline as authorities said a hospital had been hit, killing four people.

The Ukrainian army was this afternoon fighting in almost every region of the country, battling the Russians for control of military bases, airports, cities and ports from Kharkiv to Kiev, and Donetsk to Odessa.

It came after Vladimir Putin personally gave the order to attack around 5am, unleashing a salvo of rocket fire that American intelligence said involved more than 100 short and medium-range ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and surface-to-air missiles, and 75 bombers that targeted military sites including barracks, warehouses and airfields in order to knock out the country's military command structure.

Russia said the strikes destroyed 74 Ukrainian military ground facilities, 11 airfields, three command posts and 18 radar stations controlling Kiev's anti-aircraft batteries.

That was followed by attacks from Crimea in the south towards the city of Kherson, a northern advance from Belarus to Kiev, and an eastern advance from Belgorod towards Kharkiv where the heaviest fighting is going on.

American officials said this was merely an 'initial phase' of the attack, and that the majority of Russia's 190,000 troops at the front remain in reserve. The goal of the attack is to 'take key population centres' and 'decapitate the Ukrainian government', the officials added.

Ukraine's health ministry said so far 57 people have been killed on the first day of conflict, while 169 have been wounded.

The port cities of Mariupol and Odessa, where Ukraine's main naval bases are located, were also attacked - though Odessa appeared to remain under Ukrainian control as of Thursday afternoon. Russian tankers blockaded the Kerch Strait, leading from the Back Sea to the Sea of Azov, cutting off Mariupol.

Ukraine has hit back, shooting down five Russian helicopters, destroying dozens of tanks and capturing Russian troops.

A Russian AN-26 military transport aircraft also crashed in the southern Voronezh region, killing its crew on board.

The accident could have been caused by a technical failure and has not inflicted any damage on the ground, Interfax said, citing a press office of Russia's western military district.

Volodymyr Zelensky, in an address to the nation on Thursday evening, described Russia as 'evil' and said Putin had attacked 'like a suicidal scoundrel... just as Fascist Germany did in World War II'.

'Ukraine will not surrender its freedom, whatever Moscow thinks,' he added. 'For Ukrainians independence and the right to live free on our land is the highest value.'

He had earlier called on all Ukrainian citizens willing to defend their homeland to step forward, saying guns will be issued to everyone who wants one. He also asked for civilians to give blood to help wounded troops. And he asked world leaders to impose the 'harshest sanctions possible' on Putin.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, addressing the nation at midday, said western allies are preparing a 'massive' package of sanctions against Russia and told the people of Ukraine: 'We cannot and will not just look away.' Johnson referred to Putin as a 'dictator' who would never 'subdue the national feeling of the Ukrainians'.

As the West prepared to cut off Russia financially, Vladimir Putin summoned his oligarchs to demand loyalty over his attack on Ukraine - perhaps fearing a rebellion from within after prominent Russian TV figures and celebrities spoke out to oppose the conflict.

Speaking in the Kremlin, he said that Russia had been 'forced' to take action over Ukraine and had 'no other choice' but to attack, saying the country remains 'part of the global economy' and that he 'will not hurt the system we belong to'. 'I want you to show solidarity with the government,' he told them.

It came after the Russian strongman gave an extraordinary address to the Russian nation - broadcast in the early hours during a UN meeting aimed at avoiding war - in which he declared a 'special military operation' to 'de-militarise' and 'de-Nazify' Ukraine in what amounted to a outright declaration of war. The video appeared to have been pre-recorded, around the same time as Putin's Monday address recognising Donbass as independent.

Putin also issued a chilling warning to any country thinking of coming to Ukraine's aid, vowing 'consequences greater than any you have faced in history'. 'I hope I have been heard,' he said.

The mood on the ground in Ukraine was mixed. Some showed incredible resolve - heading to work via train and road even as the bombs dropped. Elderly women in the city of Kharkiv, under heavy attack, gathered in the street to pray. But for others, the sight of Russian attack was too much. Highways out of Kiev clogged with cars as people fled, while refugees began crossing the borders into Poland and Slovakia.

One Ukrainian woman voiced the outrage of her nation today as she confronted heavily armed Russian soldiers and demanded to know what they were doing in her country.

The woman, wearing a headscarf, shouted at two of the invaders: 'What the f*** are you doing in our land?' while one of the embarrassed soldiers in Henichesk, a port city on the sea of Azov, tried to calm her.

She walked away, then called back: 'You should put sunflower seeds in your pockets so that they will grow on Ukranian land after you die.'

Speaking in an emergency White House press conference, Biden today called Putin a 'pariah' on the international stage and called on the West to stand up to the 'bully'.

But he insisted the US would not be helping Ukraine with troops.

He said: 'Our forces are not, and will not be, engaged in the conflict with Russia in Ukraine. Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our Nato allies and reassure those allies in the east.

'When the history of this era is written, Putin's choice to make a totally unjustifiable war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger.

'He has much larger ambitions than Ukraine. He wants to, in fact, re-establish the former Soviet Union. That's what this is about.'

Meanwhile protesters in Moscow voiced their support for Ukraine as they chanted 'There is no war' outside Pushkinskaya Metro station in the Russian capital.

The invasion - a naked attempt to redraw the map of Europe by force - marks the most concerted attempt to up-end world order since the end of the Cold War, and risks sparking the bloodiest conflict in Europe since the end of the Second World War.

Underlining the gravity of the moment, Ukrainian Interior Ministry advisor Anton Herashchenko said: 'Starting today, the world has a new geopolitical reality. Either Ukraine and the world will stop the new Hitler now, or there will be a Third World War.'

Western leaders lined up to condemn Russia's actions in the early hours, with security councils convened the world over to mount a response. Heavy sanctions are expected to follow, along with more shipments of military equipment to Ukraine - provided they can find a route in.

But NATO and the US have made it clear that no troops will be sent, leaving Ukraine's military - far the inferior of Russia - to hold off the assault alone. Few expect it to emerge victorious from what is almost certain to be a prolonged, bloody, and vicious war.

NATO is expected to focus its efforts on stopping the war from spilling over into neighbouring countries. Poland, a member of the alliance, shares an extensive land border with Ukraine. The Baltic states - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, also NATO members - will now fear a Russian assault.

The alliance began moving its forces early Thursday, putting 100 warplanes on high alert in Europe whole moving more troops to the Baltics.

Moldova, where some Russian ground troops are already based, is also at risk of falling to Putin. From there, he could strike out at Romania - another former Soviet state.

Unconfirmed reports said that Russian forces had destroyed or rendered unusable the Ukrainian navy, and struck Boryspil Airport in Kiev. Access to the Black Sea and Azov Sea was cut off.

President Joe Biden will address the nation at noon on Thursday, and on Wednesday night he condemned Russia's 'unprovoked and unjustified attack.' He was speaking to Ukraine's president.

Biden said in a statement: 'President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering.

'Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way. The world will hold Russia accountable.'

Biden said he will be monitoring the situation from Washington, DC, and will continue to get regular updates from his national security team.

Putin justified it all in a televised address, asserting that the attack was needed to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine - a false claim the U.S. had predicted he would make as a pretext for an invasion.

He accused the U.S. and its allies of ignoring Russia's demands to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO and for security guarantees. He also claimed that Russia does not intend to occupy Ukraine but will move to 'demilitarize' it and bring those who committed crimes to justice.

Biden in a written statement condemned the 'unprovoked and unjustified attack,' and he promised that the U.S. and its allies would 'hold Russia accountable.' The president said he planned to speak to Americans on Thursday after a meeting of the Group of Seven leaders. More sanctions against Russia were expected to be announced Thursday.

Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba described the assault as a 'full-scale invasion' and said Ukraine will 'defend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now.'

In the capital, Kyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko advised residents to stay home unless they are involved in critical work and urged them to prepare go-bags with necessities and documents if they need to evacuate. An Associated Press photographer in Mariupol reported hearing explosions and seeing dozens of people with suitcases heading for their cars to leave the city.

'We are facing a war and horror. What could be worse?' 64-year-old Liudmila Gireyeva said in Kyiv. She planned to head to the western city of Lviv and then to try to move to Poland to join her daughter. Putin 'will be damned by history, and Ukrainians are damning him.'

The Russian claims about knocking out Ukrainian air defenses and Ukrainian claims to have shot down several Russian aircraft could not immediately be verified. The Ukrainian air defense system and air force date back to the Soviet era and are dwarfed by Russia's massive air power and its inventory of precision weapons.

The Russian Defense Ministry said it was not targeting cities, but using precision weapons and claimed that 'there is no threat to civilian population.'

Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister, said on Facebook that the Russian military had launched missile strikes on Ukrainian military command facilities, air bases and military depots in Kyiv, Kharkiv and Dnipro.

Biden announced he will join G7 counterparts on Thursday morning, and will address the country later on Thursday to 'announce the further consequences the United States and its Allies and partners will impose on Russia.'

'We will also coordinate with our NATO Allies to ensure a strong, united response that deters any aggression against the Alliance. Tonight, Jill and I are praying for the brave and proud people of Ukraine,' the statement added.

Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, tweeted early on Thursday: 'I am appalled by the horrific events in Ukraine and I have spoken to President Zelenskyy to discuss next steps. President Putin has chosen a path of bloodshed and destruction by launching this unprovoked attack on Ukraine. The UK and our allies will respond decisively.'

Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has also signed restrictions prohibiting all scheduled Russian airlines from entering UK airspace or touching down on British soil.

Putin in his speech on Thursday told other countries not to get involved.

'To anyone who would consider interfering from the outside - if you do, you will face consequences greater than any you have faced in history,' he said in the television broadcast around 6am Moscow time.

The consequences of the conflict and resulting sanctions on Russia could reverberate throughout the world, upending geopolitical dynamics in Europe as well as affecting energy supplies in Europe and jolting global financial markets.

'An explosion made the ground beneath our feet tremble': NICK CRAVEN reports from Kiev Ukrainians woke to the sound of missiles and air strikes as their worst fears were realised, with explosions in Kiev causing the ground to tremble and windows shake. All across the country people ran to basement bomb shelters as Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade. Shortly after 5am the crumps of explosions shook the windows of my hotel room as myself and MailOnline photographer Simon Ashton donned the body armour and helmets that have weighed us down, unused in their bag for the last month. For an hour the night sky lit up in the distance to the north and east of the city as military targets were pounded by bombs, and we run to the basement for safety. Braver - or perhaps more foolish - souls headed in the other direction to the 11th floor roof bar in the Intercontinental Hotel where many international media have based themselves. At 6.36am there was by far the loudest explosion from our perspective, believed to be an air strike on a military airfield near Kyiv, which made the ground beneath our feet tremble. By dawn there was an eerie calm as an overcast drizzly day began, broken only by the cheerful chimes of the bells of St Michael's golden domed Monastery across the square from the hotel at 7am. At 7.05am the first air raid sirens rang out all across the city, though no blitz followed in the central area at least. Surreally, even as the dreaded noise of the sirens rent the air, a steady stream of headlights could be seen driving into the city as commuters came in to start the day. But the calm wasn't to last long as the full extent of the Russian invasion began to reveal itself, with troops attacking the border on three sides and air strikes right across the country, even as far west as Lviv, near the Polish border. By 8am local time, queues of people were seen at bank ATMs in the city, perhaps the first sign of panic, following the introduction of a state of emergency across the country from midnight last night. Police and soldiers stood on many of the street corners to keep order. Long lines also formed at gas stations around the city, but with so many places being pounded from the air, it wasn't obvious where would be the safest place to flee to. Having said that, although the streets were noticeably quieter than usual as the working day began, people were mostly calmly going about their business, perhaps still coming to terms with what might be next. When I first arrived in this country a month ago, few Ukrainians took Putin's sabre-rattling seriously. Most admitted that it was possible he might move into the Donbas to annexe the pro-Russian breakaway republics of Luhansk and Donetsk, but very few believed Russia would mount a full-scale invasion of their neighbour.

Asian stock markets plunged and oil prices surged as the attack began. Earlier, Wall Street's benchmark S&P 500 index fell 1.8% to an eight-month low after the Kremlin said rebels in eastern Ukraine asked for military assistance.

Anticipating international condemnation and countermeasures, Putin issued a stark warning to other countries not to meddle, saying, 'whoever tries to impede us, let alone create threats for our country and its people, must know that the Russian response will be immediate and lead to the consequences you have never seen in history.'

Putin urged Ukrainian servicemen to 'immediately put down arms and go home.'

In a stark reminder of Russia's nuclear power, Putin warned that 'no one should have any doubts that a direct attack on our country will lead to the destruction and horrible consequences for any potential aggressor.' He emphasized that Russia is 'one of the most potent nuclear powers and also has a certain edge in a range of state-of-the-art weapons.'

Though the U.S. on Tuesday announced the repositioning of forces around the Baltics, Biden has said he will not send in troops to fight Russia.

Putin announced the military operation after the Kremlin said rebels in eastern Ukraine asked Russia for military assistance to help fend off Ukrainian 'aggression,' an announcement that the White House said was a 'false flag' operation by Moscow to offer up a pretext for an invasion.

Putin's announcement came just hours after the Ukrainian president rejected Moscow's claims that his country poses a threat to Russia and made a passionate, last-minute plea for peace.

'The people of Ukraine and the government of Ukraine want peace,' Zelenskyy said in an emotional overnight address, speaking in Russian in a direct appeal to Russian citizens. 'But if we come under attack, if we face an attempt to take away our country, our freedom, our lives and lives of our children, we will defend ourselves. When you attack us, you will see our faces, not our backs.'

Zelenskyy said he asked to arrange a call with Putin late Wednesday, but the Kremlin did not respond.

In an apparent reference to Putin's move to authorize the deployment of the Russian military to 'maintain peace' in eastern Ukraine, Zelensky warned that 'this step could mark the start of a big war on the European continent.'

'Any provocation, any spark could trigger a blaze that will destroy everything,' he said.

He challenged the Russian propaganda claims, saying that 'you are told that this blaze will bring freedom to the people of Ukraine, but the Ukrainian people are free.'

At an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council called by Ukraine because of the imminent threat of a Russian invasion, members still unaware of Putin's announcement appealed to him to stop an attack. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres opened the meeting, just before the announcement, telling Putin: 'Stop your troops from attacking Ukraine. Give peace a chance. Too many people have already died.'

NATO Secretary-General Jen Stoltenberg issued a statement condemning 'Russia's reckless and unprovoked attack on Ukraine, which puts at risk countless civilian lives. Once again, despite our repeated warnings and tireless efforts to engage in diplomacy, Russia has chosen the path of aggression against a sovereign and independent country.'

European Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen promised to hold the Kremlin accountable.

CNN's correspondent reporting live as Kiev attacked

CNN's correspondent in Kiev was live on air on Thursday morning as Russia's attack was launched. 'I just heard a big bang right here behind me. I've never heard anything like it,' said Matthew Chance, CNN's senior international correspondent. Chance quickly put on his flak jacket and helmet while he continued to report from a balcony in the Ukrainian capital. 'There are big explosions taking place. I can't see them or explain what they are,' he said. 'But I will tell you the U.S has warned the Ukrainian authorities there could be air strikes and ground attacks as well around the country, including the capital. 'I don't know if that's what's occurring now but it's a remarkable coincidence that the explosions come just minutes after Putin gave his speech,' Chance explained. 'This is the first time we've heard anything. It has been absolutely silent. This is the first time. It has to be more than just a coincidence. 'I think it's safe where I am. I have a flak jacket,' Chance remarked before ducking down to put on his protective gear. Advertisement

'In these dark hours, our thoughts are with Ukraine and the innocent women, men and children as they face this unprovoked attack and fear for their lives,' they said on Twitter.

Even before Putin's announcement, dozens of nations imposed sanctions on Russia, further squeezing Russian oligarchs and banks out of international markets.

The Russian Foreign Ministry has shrugged off the sanctions, saying that 'Russia has proven that, with all the costs of the sanctions, it is able to minimize the damage.'

The threat of war has already shredded Ukraine's economy and raised the specter of massive casualties, energy shortages across Europe and global economic chaos.

Across Ukraine, cruise and ballistic missiles were destroying military infrastructure and strategically important facilities, according to unofficial Russian sources.

Mariupol, on the Black Sea 50 miles from the Russian border, appeared to be under fierce attack. Taking this strategic location would give the Donbas republics access to the sea.

The moment Ukraine and the rest of Europe had dreaded for months finally came shortly after 4.35am local time when huge explosions were heard in Kiev and other cities across the country.

Terrified citizens rushed to bomb shelters, though no air raid warnings sounded in the capital – only the frequent muffled crump of missile or air strikes breaking through the pre-dawn stillness.

In Kiev, people were sheltering in basements as the sounds of distant explosions became a constant backdrop.

Within an hour Russians special force and airborne troops were reported to be on the ground at Kiev's Boryspil Airport, amid fierce fighting.

A woman in the Ukrainian capital said: 'I was woken by a friend.

'I am in the centre of Kiev.

'I hear the sound of distant explosions and ambulance sirens.'

At 7.05am the first air raid sirens were heard in central Kiev.

A CNN reporter in Kiev reported hearing blasts live on air in the early hours of Thursday morning.

'I just heard a big bang right here behind me. I've never heard anything like it,' said Matthew Chance, senior international correspondent for the network.

Donald Trump claims that the invasion was sparked by 'election fraud' in 2020 Donald Trump, speaking to Fox's Laura Ingraham on Wednesday night as the Kremlin's 'special military operation' began, claimed that the so-called 'Russia hoax' ruined his good relationships with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi, arguing he kept the two apart. Ingraham asked Trump about the continuing closeness between Putin and Xi. 'Well, I had a good relationship with both,' he said. 'It was hurt by the Russia hoax. You see what happened with Durham and those reports and other reports including Mueller. 'It was just a made up hoax and it really hurt our country but despite the hoax, I had a good relationship and with President Xi of China, other than the fact that I was tariff-ing and taxing the hell out of him. 'As a young man growing up, I always heard that the worst thing that could happen is drive those two countries together. 'It really started with Obama and energy. He drove them together because one needed the energy and the other needed the money,' Trump added. 'He drove them together and Biden - I kept them apart - and Biden now it's a great love fest and that's a very bad thing and I think you can probably add Iran into it too.' Earlier in the interview, in which Trump spoke over the phone with Ingraham, Trump bemoaned that this was happening at all. 'This should have never happened. This would not have happened during my administration. 'In fact, some people are saying why didn't this take place over the last four years?' Advertisement

Chance said that he heard between seven and eight explosions and quickly put on his flak jacket and headgear while he continued to report from a balcony in the Ukrainian capital.

'There are big explosions taking place.

'I can't see them or explain what they are.

'But I will tell you the U.S has warned the Ukrainian authorities there could be air strikes and ground attacks as well around the country, including the capital.

'I don't know if that's what's occurring now but it's a remarkable coincidence that the explosions come just minutes after Putin gave his speech,' Chance explained.

'This is the first time we've heard anything. It has been absolutely silent.

'This is the first time. It has to be more than just a coincidence.

'I think it's safe where I am. I have a flak jacket,' Chance remarked, before ducking down to put on his protective gear.

He suggested that the blasts he heard in the Ukrainian capital were still some distance away from the center.

'It was so quiet in Ukraine tonight up until those explosions,' Chance explained.

The blasts came within minutes of Putin saying Russia would conduct a military operation in eastern Ukraine.

Explosions could also be heard from Ukraine in the Russian city of Belgorod.

Putin told Russians: 'I have decided to conduct a special military operation.

'Russia cannot exist with a constant threat emanating from the territory of Ukraine.

'You and I have been left with no opportunity to protect our people other than the one we use today.'

It comes after explosions were also heard near the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, as fears mounted that shelling is underway.

Residents in the city, which is located in south eastern Ukraine, have been woken up at 3.30am by blasts 30 miles from the Russian border.

Video footage appeared to show clouds of smoke rising up into the night sky near Mariupol, but it was unconfirmed whether it was as a result of shelling.

Putin earlier this week said he wanted to take the major Azov Sea Port of Mariupol, which handles 50 percent Ukraine's steel and mineral exports.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Russia's actions were a 'grave breach of international law' and that allies would meet to address the 'renewed aggression'.

He said on Twitter: 'I strongly condemn #Russia's reckless attack on #Ukraine, which puts at risk countless civilian lives.

'This is a grave breach of international law & a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security. #NATO Allies will meet to address Russia's renewed aggression.'

The British foreign secretary Liz Truss tweeted her condemnation of the attack just after 4am local time.

'I strongly condemn the appalling, unprovoked attack President Putin has launched on the people of Ukraine,' she said.

'We stand with Ukraine and we will work with our international partners to respond to this terrible act of aggression.'

The explosions come just hours after the U.S. warned the Ukrainian government that Putin's troops are 'ready to go now' with an invasion of Ukraine, with 80 percent of Russian soldiers now assembled around the country in attack positions.

U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken issued a further stark warning and said, hours before the invasion, that he believed Russia would invade before the night is over.

Russia on Wednesday afternoon issued a notice to airmen (NOTAM) which closed the airspace along its northeastern border with Ukraine to all civilian air traffic.

Ukraine later said early on Thursday it had restricted civilian flights in its airspace due to 'potential hazard'.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy vowed that the Ukrainian people will 'fight back' if Putin threatens their freedom and lives by launching a full-scale invasion.

President Zelenskyy made an emotional address to his nation after Moscow-backed rebel leaders in eastern Ukraine asked Putin for military assistance in fending off Ukrainian 'aggression'.

In an emotional televised address on Wednesday night, President Zelenskyy said: 'The people of Ukraine and the government of Ukraine want peace.

'But if we come under attack, if we face an attempt to take away our country, our freedom, our lives and lives of our children, we will defend ourselves.

'When you attack us, you will see our faces, not our backs.'

The Ukrainian president said he had tried to call Putin this evening, but there was 'no answer, only silence', adding that Moscow now has around 200,000 soldiers by Ukraine's borders.

The United Nations Security Council quickly scheduled an emergency meeting Wednesday night - the second in three days - at Ukraine's request.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called the separatists' request 'a further escalation of the security situation.'

Earlier on Wednesday, Ukraine was placed on a war footing: A state of emergency was declared and approved by parliament, 200,000 military reservists called up, border zones were restricted and three million Ukrainians told to leave Russia, with Kiev acknowledging for the first time that an attack could now take place anywhere, at any time.

Biden on Wednesday warned President Zelenskyy of an 'imminent' attack by Putin's troops in the next 48 hours - , just hours after Ukraine was hit by a 'massive' cyberattack targeting its government and banks.

But Blinken cut that time frame of a Russian invasion drastically and said on Wednesday night he expected Russia to invade Ukraine before the night was over.

U.S. intelligence chiefs knew Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, was at particular risk of being targeted in a Russian invasion as it is close to the Ukrainian-Russian border.

According to the reports, visuals of explosions from airstrike reported near Boryspil Airport in Kiev, Oblast were seen on Wednesday night. The disastrous incident comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a “military operation” in Ukraine's Donbas region. He made the declaration in a televised speech at the same time as the UN Security Council was imploring him to stop.

Several reports on social media confirm that there have been explosions in Kharkiv in the north-east, Odesa in the south, and the eastern Donetsk Oblast area. Some suggest Russia has started intense artillery and rocket fire from Belgorod. Another explosion has been reported in Mariupol

Multiple explosions resound across Kiev

Speaking on the attack, Russia's UN representative Vasily Nebenzya told Reuters: ""We don't know all the details today about his president's [Putin's] operation in eastern Ukraine."" Ukraine's UN Representative Sergiy Kyslytsya said: ""The ambassador of the Russian Federation, three minutes ago, confirmed that his president declared a war on my country.""

According to local reports, special operations forces are already working at the Boryspil airport, as well as parts of the airborne forces. Earlier it was reported about a series of attacks on the airport. There are reports of strikes on the aviation base in Vasilkov.

Russia's defense ministry said it is using ""high-precision weaponry to take out Ukrainian military infrastructure, air defense, aerodromes, and aviation."" It claims ""there is no threat to the civilian population of Ukraine.""
