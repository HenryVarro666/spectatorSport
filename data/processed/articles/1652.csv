US to move troops and aircraft to Eastern Europe

US armed forces are moving aircraft and soldiers to Eastern Europe, Defense Department spokesperson John Kirby said on Tuesday.

This includes a unit of around 200 marines which has been moved to Lithuania from Norway, Kirby said.

Ten F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets and a few C-130 Hercules transport planes, as well as some 200 associated soldiers, will be brought to Eastern Europe from the US. Kirby said that they would be moved shortly but that their precise destination remained unclear.

US says some Russian troops leaving Kyiv region

Following the announcement earlier on Tuesday that Russia would cut back on its military actions around Kyiv and Chernihiv, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said that the US believed some Russian troops had already left.

""Has there been some movement by some Russian units away from Kyiv in the last day or so? Yes, we think so. Small numbers,"" Kirby told reporters.

""But we believe that this is a repositioning, not a real withdrawal, and that we all should be prepared to watch for a major offensive against other areas of Ukraine. It does not mean that the threat to Kyiv is over,"" he added.

Biden voices skepticism over Russia's pledge to cut activities

US President Joe Biden said he wasn't convinced that Russia's promise to cut back military operations around Kyiv will lead to a significant change in the conflict.

""We'll see if they follow through,"" he told reporters after holding a phone call with the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Italy.

""There seems to be a consensus that let's just see what they have to offer.""

Russian negotiators pledged to scale back hostilities near Kyiv and the city of Chernihiv during talks with Ukraine in Turkey on Tuesday.

France says no Mariupol humanitarian mission possible 'at this stage'

The conditions for carrying out a humanitarian operation sought by France to help civilians in the besieged port city of Mariupol have not been met ""at this stage,"" French President Emmanuel Macron's office said.

The French leader spoke to his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in a phone call on Tuesday.

Macron had outlined the mission sought alongside Turkey and Greece to Putin, who said ""he was going to think about it"" before responding, an Elysee Palace official said.

Mariupol has been one of the worst struck cities since the start of the Ukraine war with the local mayor saying it is now ""on the brink of humanitarian catastrophe.""

The Russian president also told Macron that Ukrainian ""nationalists"" in besieged Mariupol must lay down their arms.

""It was stressed that in order to resolve the difficult humanitarian situation in this city (Mariupol), Ukrainian nationalist militants must stop resisting and lay down their arms,"" the Kremlin said in a statement about the call.

The two presidents also discussed Russia's decision to request payments in rubles for Russian gas supplies to the EU, the statement added.

Russia-backed Donetsk considers joining Russia

The head of the so-called Donetsk People's Republic — a part of Ukraine controlled by Russian-backed separatists since 2014 — has said the region will consider joining Russia, according to the Donetsk News Agency.

""As for joining the Russian Federation, as for this wish and drive, they have been obvious since 2014 — the wish to be in Russia,"" Denis Pushilin said.

Moscow recognized the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics on February 24, just days before Russian troops invaded Ukraine.

Pushilin's comments come two days after Russian-backed rebels in Luhansk said they may hold a referendum on joining Russia. Kyiv said such a move would not have legal basis and warned of an international response.

Snake Island soldier receives medal

The Ukrainian soldier, whose comments to a Russian warship went viral, has returned home.

Roman Hrybov was taken prisoner by Russian forces while he was serving on the so-called Snake Island (Zmiinyi Island in Ukrainian), a small island in the Black Sea.

A recording of Hrybov telling a Russian warship to ""go f*** yourself"" went viral.

The Ukrainian troops stationed on the island were at first presumed to have been killed in an attack. It later turned out they had been taken captive and were exchanged for Russian prisoners.

The Ukrainian military shared a picture of the soldier receiving a medal on social media. They said he has returned to ""his native Cherkasy region.""

Russia files two cases against Google over banned content

Russia has filed two legal cases against Alphabet Inc, which owns Google, for failure to remove banned information from its YouTube video-sharing platform, the country's communication regulator said on Tuesday.

Roskomnadzor accused the tech giant of blatantly promoting false content about Russia's invasion, which the Kremlin calls a ""special military operation.""

It said YouTube had become one of the key platforms in the ""information war"" against Moscow.

The regulator added that Google could be fined up to 8 million rubles ($91,533; €82,500), or as much as 20% of the company's annual revenue in Russia for repeat offenses.

Russia has blocked Google News and restricted access to Twitter, Facebook and Instagram

US skeptical of Russian gestures

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken questioned the seriousness of Russia's claims of progress at the Ukraine-Russia talks in Turkey on Tuesday.

""I've not seen anything to suggest that this is moving forward in an effective way because we have not seen signs of real seriousness"" from Russia, Blinken said during an official visit to Morocco.

""There is what Russia says and there is what Russia does. We're focussed on the latter,"" he added.

""If they somehow believe that an effort to subjugate ""only,"" in quotation marks, the eastern part of Ukraine and the southern part of Ukraine can succeed, then once again they are profoundly fooling themselves,"" CNN quoted Blinken as saying.

He once again called on Russia to end the fighting and said the Ukrainians were engaged in negotiations ""with a gun literally to their heads.""

""This is not a cease-fire but this is our aspiration, gradually to reach a de-escalation of the conflict at least on these fronts,"" Medinsky told TASS news agency.

He went on to say that talks between the two sides ""still have a long way to go.""

UK calls for 'complete withdrawal' of Russian troops from Ukraine

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for a full withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine, his spokesperson said.

Asked about Russia's promise to scale back their armed forces around the cities of Kyiv and Chernihiv, the spokesman said: ""We will judge [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and his regime by his actions, not by his words.""

""There has been some reduction in Russian bombardment around Kyiv, largely because Ukrainian forces have been successfully pushing back the Russian offensives in the northwest of the city,"" he told reporters.

""But fighting continues. There's heavy bombardment in Mariupol and other areas. So we don't want to see anything less than a complete withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukrainian territory.""

Netherlands, Belgium, Ireland expel dozens of Russian diplomats

Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra said the Netherlands has expelled 17 Russian ""intelligence officers"" who were ""undercover as diplomats.""

""These intelligence officers are a threat to the security of [the Netherlands],"" Hoekstra wrote on Twitter.

""Experience shows that Russia does not leave such measures unanswered. We cannot speculate on that, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is prepared for various scenarios that may occur in the near future,"" he said in a statement.

Shortly after the Dutch announcement, Belgian Foreign Minister Sophie Wilmes said Belgium was also expelling 21 Russian diplomats for actions related to espionage or unlawful influence peddling.

Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney later said Ireland was expelling four Russian diplomats whose activities have not been ""in accordance with international standards of diplomatic behavior.""

Poland approves law to ban Russian coal imports

Polish government spokesman Piotr Muller said the Cabinet has adopted draft legislation that will allow a ban on imports of Russian coal.

""We don't want these imports to be possible any longer, although we realize that there's a risk related to the fact that the European Union has not approved such actions to date,"" Muller told reporters in Warsaw.

Generally, the whole EU has to agree on sanctions imposed in the bloc, and Brussels could potentially punish members states acting unilaterally.

Russian representatives not welcome at Buchenwald commemoration

German officials have told Russian and Belarusian diplomatic representatives that they are not welcome at the commemoration for the 77th anniversary of the liberation of the Buchenwald and Mittelbau-Dora Nazi concentration camps.

""We have informed the consular representations in writing that they are not welcome at the events,"" director of the Buchenwald and Mittelbau-Dora Memorials Foundation, Jens-Christian Wagner, said on Tuesday.

One reason for the move was the death of the 96-year-old Buchenwald camp survivor Boris Romanchenko.

Romanchenko, who had previously served as vice-president for the international committee of survivors for the two camps, was killed by Russian bombardments in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv in mid-March.

The Nazi camps were liberated by US troops on April 11, 1945, shortly before the end of the Second World War.

UK detains Russian-owned superyacht

Britain has detained a Russian-owned superyacht in what it called a ""warning"" to Moscow of the consequences of invading Ukraine.

Phi is a 58.5-meter (192-foot) vessel worth $50 million (€45 million), boasting a fresh-water swimming pool. It was docked at Canary Wharf in London.

The UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) said the ship is registered to a company based in the Caribbean country of St Kitts and Nevis and sails under a Maltese flag.

""The ownership of the yacht was deliberately well-hidden,"" the agency said in a statement, adding that it had ultimately uncovered that its owner was a Russian businessman.

Amnesty International accuses Russia of war crimes in Ukraine

Agnes Callamard, secretary-general of the human rights organization, told DW that Amnesty has been ""documenting an escalation of human rights and humanitarian law violations, including the indiscriminate or deliberate targeting of civilians.""

""Russia's crackdown on freedom of speech started before the aggression against Ukraine,"" Callamard said. She pointed to ""the shrinking space for independent media and dissenting voices,"" which she said goes back to at least 2021.

She added that disinformation and propaganda are part of the war, making it difficult to keep track of what is actually going on.

Watch video 06:52 Human rights in 2021: Amnesty's Callamard speaks with DW

Callamard also insisted that ""the standards that are applied to … Ukrainian refugees are applied across the board to others.""

""As we speak right now, there are refugees stuck between Belarus and Poland who are denied entry into Poland,"" she added, saying that the failure to support those refugees mean that the west was ""losing a war of values.""

She added that as an outcome of the war, many countries will experience food shortages and skyrocketing prices, exacerbated by the failures of governments to ""build back better"" after the coronavirus pandemic. ""That is the betrayal of 2021,"" she told DW.

UNHCR: More than 3.9 people fled Ukraine

The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, said 3,901,713 people have fled the war in Ukraine — an increase of 38,916 from Monday's figure.

Francesco Rocca, the president of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), said refugees were arriving exhausted and feeling ""hopeless.""

""We are seeing millions of people arriving at borders, their coping capacities stretched by what they have experienced and witnessed,"" he said.

""People are understandably tired and stressed, physically, mentally and emotionally.""

Russia-Ukraine talks conclude in Istanbul

Ukrainian and Russian negotiators concluded face-to-face peace talks in Istanbul on Tuesday, with the Ukrainian side saying that there have been enough developments to have a meeting between the presidents of the two countries.

Russia said the talks were ""constructive,"" raising hopes that there could be progress toward ending the war.

However, Russian top negotiator Medinsky said a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy is possible only if a deal has been approved by the foreign ministries of both countries.

Following the talks, Ukrainian negotiators told reporters that Kyiv would agree to a neutral status if a security guarantee system is put in place. They said, under the new system, Israel, Poland, Canada and Turkey could be among Ukraine’s security guarantors.

The neutral status would include not hosting any foreign military bases on Ukrainian territory.

There needs to be full peace across Ukraine for any final agreement with Russia to come into force, the Ukrainian side stressed, adding that a referendum would be needed in Ukraine on the terms of any final deal.

They also proposed holding consultations with Russia on the status of Crimea.

The talks on Tuesday lasted around four hours with occasional breaks. It is unclear if the discussions will continue for a second day.

Peskov said the plan would be ready by Thursday, in line with Russian President Vladimir Putin's set deadline.

""No one will supply gas for free, it is simply impossible, and you can pay for it only in rubles,"" Peskov told reporters on Tuesday.

He added that ""all modalities are being developed so that this system is simple, understandable and feasible for respected European and international buyers.""

Peskov's remarks came a day after Germany said the G7 nations rejected Putin's demand to pay for Russian gas in rubles. Berlin said the demand was a breach of the pre-agreed terms and conditions.

Russia says the military's main task is now to 'liberate' Donbas

Russia's defense minister Sergei Shoigu said on Tuesday that Ukraine's military capacity had been seriously degraded, the Interfax news agency reported. ""The combat potential of the Ukrainian armed forces has been significantly reduced, which makes it possible to focus the main attention and main efforts on achieving the main goal — the liberation of Donbas.""

Shoigu's assertion came despite Ukraine's unexpectedly strong resistance since the war began last month, which has seen Russia fail to take any major cities, and stall in advancing along multiple fronts.

However, Shoigu reiterated statements made last week by officials that the Russian military had completed the main objective of the first phase of its invasion.

The minister also stressed the change in Russia's war aims, underlining that the main task of the Russian military is now to ""liberate"" Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, part of which has been under the control of Russian proxies since 2014.

Furthermore, he warned the West that Moscow will respond appropriately if NATO supplies fighter aircraft and air defense systems to Ukraine.

US to deploy fighter jets to Germany to boost NATO posture

The United States is deploying six Navy EA-18G Growler aircraft to the Spangdahlem airbase in Germany to bolster NATO's defense posture, Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said.

This is ""to bolster readiness and NATO's collective defense posture and further increase air integration capabilities with our Allied and partner nations,"" he said during a conference call.

Kirby stressed that the aircraft were not intended to be used against the Russian military in Ukraine, but were intended to strengthen NATO's eastern flank and serve as a deterrent against Russia.

Kirby added that some 240 Navy personnel, consisting of pilots and maintenance crew, will also be stationed to maintain the aircraft.

The aircraft, developed by the US firm Boeing, are used in electronic warfare to counter adversaries by offering tactical jamming capabilities besides offering land and naval defense.

""The restrictions have been in place for roughly a month, a little bit over a month, and we certainly haven't seen any indication that there's non-compliance, in fact, we've seen the reverse,"" he said.

""I think there's also a fair amount of additional self-sanctioning, if you will, by multinational companies operating in Russia,"" the official added.

Deliveries of lethal weapons to Ukraine by the West are irresponsible, Shoigu said. Indian Navy's Second P-81 Air Squadron INAS 316 Commissioned At INS Hansa.

""We consider the position of the West, which supplies lethal weapons to Ukraine, to be irresponsible,"" Shoigu said.

He noted that the uncontrolled distribution of weapons to the population and mercenaries ""only aggravates the situation and in the future may pose a threat to the Europeans themselves.""

Russian Defence Minister announced the fulfilment of the main tasks of the first stage of the special operation in Ukraine.

""In general, the main tasks of the first stage of the operation have been completed. The combat potential of the Ukrainian armed forces has been significantly reduced, which makes it possible to focus the main attention and main efforts on achieving the main goal - the liberation of Donbass,"" he said.

Shoigu noted that the Ukrainian Armed Forces suffered significant damage.

""Air supremacy has been won. The air force and the air defence system were practically destroyed... The country's naval forces ceased to exist. Significant losses were suffered by all formations of the ground and airborne assault forces,"" the Minister of Defence stated.

According to Shoigu: ""First, regarding the course of the special military operation of the Russian Armed Forces on the territory of Ukraine. In general, the main tasks of the first stage of the operation have been completed. The combat potential of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has been significantly reduced.""

Details: According to the Russian Defence Minister, Russian troops ""gained control over the air, and virtually destroyed the Ukrainian Air Force and its air defence system.""

Shoigu also said that Ukraine’s navy has ""ceased to exist.""

Background: Today is the 34th day of the heroic resistance of the Ukrainian people against the Russian military invasion. Russian troops are shelling Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Luhansk, and continue to destroy Chernihiv. In the Donetsk region, Ukrainian troops are steadfastly repelling attacks by the Russian forces.

The Ukrainian Defence Forces are holding the enemy back on all fronts. In some areas, Ukrainian soldiers have begun to counter-attack and push back the Russian troops.

On 28 March, the Ukrainian Air Force (which, according to Shoigu, is almost non-existent) destroyed 17 Russian air targets: 8 planes, 3 helicopters, 4 UAVs, and 2 cruise missiles.

Earlier: On the night of 24 February 2022, the Russian Federation insidiously attacked Ukraine from the territory of Belarus; Russian troops began advancing from the Belarusian border into Ukraine on several fronts. Putin called this military invasion a ""special operation."" The Russian leadership first falsely described its ultimate goal as ""helping the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics,"" and then as the ""liberation of Ukraine from [unspecified] Nazis."" Later on, Russia began spreading the misinformation that Ukraine is allegedly developing ""ethnically targeted biological weapons"" and even ""nuclear weapons.""

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

She sends this report: “I advise anyone going through negotiations with the Russian Federation not to eat or drink anything, and preferably avoid touching any surface,” Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba reportedly told delegates. Pictures from inside the negotiations, expected to stretch into the afternoon, suggest Kuleba’s instructions might be a challenge. While Abramovich’s presence inside the negotiation room alongside Kalin, who reportedly arranged a series of talks between him and Umerov at five-star hotels across Istanbul, suggested to some that this parallel track of negotiations might have ended in favour of these official talks, others were not convinced. “A presence in the room doesn’t mean the parallel track has collapsed,” said Sinan Ülgen, of the Istanbul think-tank the Centre for Economics and Foreign Policy Studies (EDAM). “We can read into [Abramovich’s presence] is the receptivity of both Kyiv and Moscow to Turkey’s involvement. Not only is Turkey acting formally as a facilitator but it also has an active role in this second track of diplomacy to defuse the conflict.” “From a Turkish perspective, what matters is that Turkey remains a central piece of diplomatic efforts going forward, first to agree on a ceasefire and then to reach a political settlement,” he said. “I would pay particular attention if, at the end of the talks, the two sides issue a statement outlining some degree of convergence.” However Ülgen added that observers should temper their expectations from today’s talks, after previous rounds of negotiations in Belarus and in the southern Turkish city of Antalya yielded few results. “I think we should not harbour any big expectations from this specific round of talks. I think the dynamics on the ground are not very suitable to this type of...more positive expectations,” he added.

29 Mar 2022 06.43 Here’s more from Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, who said relations between Russia and the US would inevitably be affected by “personal insults” by the US President, Joe Biden, directed at his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. Personal insults cannot but leave their mark on relations between heads of state. However, Peskov said: One way or another, sooner or later, we will have to speak about questions of strategic stability and security and so on. The Kremlin was referring to unscripted remarks made by Biden at a speech in Poland at the weekend, in which the US president said Putin “cannot remain in power”. US President Joe Biden outside the Royal Palace, Warsaw, Poland. 26 Mar 2022 Photograph: Anna Voitenko/Ukrinform/NurPhoto/REX/Shutterstock On Monday, Biden defended his remarks and denied that he was seeking “regime change” as a new policy. “I’m not walking anything back,” Biden said. I was expressing the moral outrage I felt … I had just come from being with those families. But I want to be clear that I wasn’t then, nor am I now, articulating a policy change.

29 Mar 2022 06.28 Kremlin dismisses reports of Abramovich poisoning as 'part of information war' Pjotr Sauer Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday dismissed reports that Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich suffered symptoms consistent with poisoning during an informal round of talks earlier this month, calling the reports “part of the information war”. Peskov said during his daily call with reporters: This is part of the information panic, part of the information sabotage, information war. These reports are not true…it is necessary to strongly filter the flow of information. Peskov further confirmed that Abramovich was part of the talks in Istanbul that will kick off today, but said the Russian billionaire was not an official member of the delegation. Abramovich is involved in ensuring certain contacts between the Russian and Ukrainian sides. There was photographic evidence to confirm that Abramovich is indeed in the room this morning with Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.

29 Mar 2022 06.21 Russia's main goal is 'liberation' of Donbas, Shoigu says Pjotr Sauer Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu said Moscow’s “main goal” in Ukraine was now the “liberation” of the Donbas region, a sign that Moscow may be switching to more limited objectives after facing fierce Ukrainian resistance in the first month of the war. Russian state news agency Interfax quoted Shoigu as saying on Tuesday: The main tasks of the first stage of the operation have been completed. The combat potential of the Ukrainian armed forces has been significantly reduced, which makes it possible to focus our main attention and main efforts on achieving the main goal – the liberation of Donbas. Shoigu further claimed that the Ukrainian air force and the air defence system have been “practically destroyed” and that Russia now controlled the skies. Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu. Photograph: Russian Defence Ministry Press Service/EPA Last Friday, a spokesperson of Russia’s defence ministry also said that the first phase of its military operation was “generally” complete, saying the country would focus on the “liberation” of Ukraine’s Luhansk region and Donetsk region, jointly known as the Donbas. The country’s forces, however, have continued their action on several battlefronts across Ukraine over the weekend, including attacking the western city of Lviv, where a Russian cruise missile slammed into a fuel depot. Russia has been shifting its objectives in Ukraine throughout the war, as the country failed to secure a quick victory over Ukraine. The Financial Times on Monday reported that the Kremlin no longer requested Ukraine be “denazified” and “demilitarised”, initial core demands that Russian president Vladimir Putin raised to justify the invasion. The two sides will hold highly anticipated peace talks in Istanbul today, but some Ukrainian officials have warned Russia could be using the talks as an opportunity to regroup and fix its tactical and logistical issues.

29 Mar 2022 05.45 Here is a round-up of this morning’s latest diplomatic developments from my colleague Jon Henley: Fresh talks between Ukraine and Russia have begun in Istanbul, with Kyiv seeking a ceasefire without compromising on its sovereignty or territorial integrity and both sides playing down hopes of an early breakthrough. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, opened the talks – the two delegations’ first face-to-face meeting in more than a fortnight – at the Dolmabahçe Palace in Istanbul, urging both sets of negotiators to “put an end to this tragedy”. With Russia’s invasion appearing stalled on the ground, Erdogan said each side had “legitimate concerns” but added: “We have now entered a period where concrete results are needed. It should be “possible to reach a solution acceptable to the international community”, he said, with further conflict “in no one’s interest”. Ukrainian media said the talks – with the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich in attendance – started with “a cold welcome and no handshake”. Mykhailo Podolyak, a political adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymr Zelenskiy, said delegations were working on “the entire spectrum of contentious issues”. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said the least he was hoping for was an end to the country’s humanitarian catastrophe, and the most was a ceasefire. “We are not trading people, land or sovereignty,” he insisted. “If we see that the mood has changed and they are ready for a serious, substantive conversation and balanced arrangements, then things will move forward,” Kuleba said. He said if it was a “repetition of their propaganda”, then talks would again fail.

NatSec Daily has heard lots of assessments on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but none quite like the one a European official provided us this morning. We’re going to detail our main takeaways, but it’s worth keeping in mind that these are only one official’s views and that this person would only speak on the condition of anonymity per ground rules established by this official’s government.

Putin-Shoigu relationship suffering: Russian President VLADIMIR PUTIN’s relationship with Defense Minister SERGEI SHOIGU clearly isn’t as close as it was during the height of the Syria War. Russia’s intelligence officials are closest to Putin so far, but they aren’t necessarily the right people to brief the autocrat on military strategy and tactics. “We see much less of the professional military going to brief Putin directly,” the official said.

Russia wants Ukraine’s southern coast: Russia wants to take much or all of Ukraine’s southern coast, stretching from the Donbas all the way to the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria. The reason for going all-out on Mariupol is to make it easier for troops in the east to join up with those coming from ships and then target Odesa. That also explains why the Ukrainians are putting in an immense effort to hold Mariupol and why the U.S. could be considering sending anti-ship missiles to Kyiv.

‘Look less awful’: The official believes Putin has multiple objectives as peace talks between Ukraine and Russia proceed. “Part of it’s to buy time and make him look less awful in the eyes of the world,” but the other part is to put him in a position to accept a Ukrainian offer he actually likes. It’s classic Putin opportunism, the official insisted.

Long-term effort: The official indicated that weapons will continue to flow into Ukraine as long as Ukrainians continue to put up a good fight. That will be costly, of course, but there is resolve among transatlantic allies to provide Ukraine with the equipment it needs to hold Russia at bay.

No U.S. endgame — yet: The shift in Russian military strategy has led to a rethink on the war within President JOE BIDEN’s administration. “It doesn’t have an endgame yet,” the official said, saying the administration is waiting to see if Russia sticks to siege tactics throughout Ukraine or seeks to focus on one main area of battle in the east. It’s also looking to see how the negotiations progress and if the U.S. should put its weight behind certain proposals.

SITUATION REPORT: We will only cite official sources. As always, take all figures, assessments and statements with a healthy dose of skepticism.

War in Ukraine:

— Since the war began on Feb. 24, Russia has lost around 17,500 personnel, 614 tanks, 1,735 armored combat vehicles, 311 artillery systems, 96 multiple-launch rocket systems, 135 warplanes, 131 helicopters, seven ships and 83 drones. (Ukrainian Ministry of Defense)

— ”The enemy is taking measures to regroup and form a group of Russian Federation armed forces in order to infiltrate the Eastern operating zone. The transfer of some of the enemy's military and equipment from the territory of the Republic of Belarus to the territory of the Russian Federation by rail transport was recorded.” (Ukrainian Ministry of Defense)

— “Despite Russian statements indicating an intended reduction of military activity around Chernihiv, significant Russian shelling and missile strikes have continued. Russian forces continue to hold positions to the east and west of Kyiv despite the withdrawal of a limited number of units. Heavy fighting will likely take place in the suburbs of the city in coming days. Heavy fighting continues in Mariupol, a key objective of Russian forces, however Ukrainian forces remain in control of the centre of the city.” (U.K. Ministry of Defence)

— Russia continues to hit Kyiv, Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Mariupol with airstrikes despite public signaling of deescalation. (U.S. Department of Defense)

— All of the $350 million in U.S. weapons shipments to Ukraine pledged on March 14 has arrived, with another $800 million set to arrive within the next two weeks. (U.S. Department of Defense)

Global response:

— U.K.: Britain sanctioned 14 more Russian entities and people, including propaganda outlets RT and Sputnik.

— France: France’s military intelligence chief lost his job after assessing Russia wouldn’t invade Ukraine, while other countries like the U.S. rightly concluded otherwise.

— Time: “Inside the Historic Mission to Provide Aid and Arms to Ukraine”

— The Washington Post: “Voices From the Siege of Mariupol”

BIDEN TO TAP OIL RESERVES: Biden will order the release of 1 million barrels of oil per day from the nation’s strategic reserves and urge Congress to press the oil industry to increase drilling on federal lands in bid to tame high gasoline prices, report our own ZACK COLMAN and BEN LEFEBVRE.

In a background call with reporters, a senior administration official said oil companies “need to be stepping up,” adding: “There is nothing standing in their way.” The announcement is the latest attempt by the White House and Democrats to temper the volatile oil markets that drove gasoline prices to all-time highs in the weeks since Russia launched its invasion.

Although the U.S. tapped the Strategic Petroleum Reserve twice before with limited effectiveness, this new effort will be a sustained release for six months, putting as much as 180 million barrels onto the market. The addition of 1 million barrels per day represents an increase in U.S. supply of 8.5 percent.

FIRST IN NATSEC DAILY –– SENATORS URGE ‘IMMEDIATE ACTION’ ON GIRLS SCHOOLS IN AFG: A bipartisan group of 21 female senators wrote to Biden asking him to take “immediate action” in response to the Taliban barring girls from attending secondary school.

“Since the Taliban’s overthrow of the legitimate government of Afghanistan in August 2021, Afghanistan’s women and girls have suffered. Women have been banned from most jobs, are required to be accompanied by a male relative and are restricted in where they can travel. When women protest this treatment, they are arrested, beaten and disappeared,” wrote the lawmakers, led by Sen. JEANNE SHAHEEN (D-N.H.).

“[T]here must be clear consequences for the Taliban’s disregard of the rights of women and girls and the will of the Afghan people. We welcome your decision to suspend engagements with the Taliban over the reversal of the Taliban’s promise to allow Afghan girls to attend secondary school. We urge you to use the tools at your disposal—including reinstating travel bans under the United Nations Security Council sanctions regime—to clearly convey to the Taliban that anything short of full education for girls and women is unacceptable to the United States, our allies and the Afghan people,” they continued.

The Taliban promised it wouldn’t revert to its medieval form of governance once the group reassumed power following America’s military withdrawal from Afghanistan. The cancellation of secondary school instruction for girls is a broken promise, one that some fear portends even more horrors to come for Afghanistan’s women.

PUTIN IS ‘MISGUIDED’: Sir JEREMY FLEMING, director of Britain’s intelligence agency GCHQ, made some astounding remarks about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine today at the Australian National University.

“[I]t increasingly looks like Putin has massively misjudged the situation. It’s clear he misjudged the resistance of the Ukrainian people. He underestimated the strength of the coalition his actions would galvanise. He under-played the economic consequences of the sanctions regime. He over-estimated the abilities of his military to secure a rapid victory. We’ve seen Russian soldiers — short of weapons and morale — refusing to carry out orders, sabotaging their own equipment and even accidentally shooting down their own aircraft,” he said.

He also said “Putin’s advisers are afraid to tell him the truth,” echoing what U.S. officials have been telling reporters in recent days.

It’s as bleak a picture as the British intelligence boss could’ve painted, showing that things really are that bad for Russian forces in Ukraine. It helps explain why Moscow may have given up on its maximalist aims and instead shifted its focus to conquering eastern Ukraine.

Flashpoints

BURNS GETS COVID: CIA Director WILLIAM BURNS has tested positive for Covid-19, the agency announced today. Burns is “fully vaccinated and boosted” against the virus and has experienced “mild symptoms,” the CIA said in a news release. He will “continue to perform his duties” from home and “plans to return to the office after isolating for five days and testing negative.”

Burns most recently saw Biden in a socially distanced meeting Wednesday morning, during which Burns was wearing an N-95 mask, according to the CIA. “Their interaction is not considered close contact as defined by CDC guidance, and Director Burns is sharing the news of his positive test out of an abundance of transparency,” the CIA said.

Burns is the latest high-ranking administration official to test positive for Covid-19 in recent days. White House press secretary JEN PSAKI tested positive last week, and her principal deputy KARINE JEAN-PIERRE tested positive on Sunday.

RUBLE REBOUNDS: Barely a month after a raft of sanctions sent Russia’s currency crashing, the ruble has staged a dramatic recovery, reports our own KATE DAVIDSON. The comeback is partly due to a surge in oil and gas prices — commodities that were explicitly carved out of the initial sanctions — that has boosted Russia’s energy revenue.

Some current and former Treasury officials, foreign exchange traders and sanctions experts say the ruble’s rebound doesn’t necessarily mean the West’s economic weapons are losing their punch. They argue the resurgence primarily reflects the extraordinary steps Russia’s central bank has taken to stop the currency’s freefall.

Still, the ruble’s rise puts new pressure on the U.S. and its allies to deploy even tougher measures to undercut Russia’s ability to finance its invasion — through further cutting off Russian energy exports or escalating existing sanctions.



Keystrokes

TREASURY TARGETS RUSSIAN TECH: The Biden administration announced new sanctions today aimed at major Russian technology companies and sanctions-evasion networks, and expanded its ability to level penalties on the aerospace, marine and electronics sectors, Davidson also reported.

The sanctions, which follow penalties on Russia’s defense industry last week, are part of a broader administration effort to restrict the country’s access to resources it needs to supply and finance its invasion of Ukraine, the Treasury Department said.

Among the sanctioned firms is Moscow-based OOO Serniya Engineering, which the Treasury said is at the center of an illicit network operating under the direction of Russia’s intelligence service to help evade sanctions. The company worked with various front businesses across multiple countries, including the U.K. and Spain, to procure critical Western technology for Russia’s defense sector, the Treasury said.

‘IMMINENT’ STINGER AND JAVELIN REPLACEMENTS: Per our own CONNOR O’BRIEN (for Pros!), a plan to begin replenishing U.S. stocks of Javelin and Stinger missiles sent to Ukraine will soon be sent to Congress, the Army's top acquisition official told lawmakers.

DOUG BUSH, the Army's assistant secretary for acquisition, logistics and technology, told the House Armed Services' Tactical Air and Land Forces panel that several notifications will be sent to Congress to tap into $3.5 billion earmarked for the Pentagon to replenish its inventories, including missiles and ammunition.

""We already have that money. Congress will very soon get the first of several responses showing how we intend to use that funding,"" Bush said. ""It'll be specifically to Stinger and Javelin. So that is imminent. You'll see the plan to address that near-term thing.""

AND SHIPS, AND SO THE BALANCE SHIFTS: Our friends at Morning Defense (for Pros!) reported on Navy Secretary CARLOS DEL TORO’s rebuke of critics who note China has more ships than America.

China is ""probably not that great at building ships, but they build them in great numbers,” he told an online forum sponsored by The Hill. “And there’s a marked difference, as well, to the quality of our ships and the capabilities that we have [which] significantly outpace the quality and the capabilities that they bring to bear.”

“That's more important than the comparison of how many ships we have in each other's navies,” he added. “It's really not just about the ships. It's about capacity, it's about capability and the combined lethality that it brings.”

The fiscal 2023 budget released this week would decommission 24 ships, further retreating from its goal of a 355-ship fleet.



On the Hill

CONGRESS CAN’T STOP JCPOA REENTRY: Republicans and a handful of Democrats may oppose America’s return to the Iran nuclear deal, but there’s very little the Senate can do to stop it from happening, our own ANDREW DESIDERIO reported.

“A disapproval resolution in the Senate would require 60 votes; even if that hurdle is cleared, opponents of the new deal would not be able to reach the two-thirds threshold required to override a presidential veto,” he wrote.

Here’s why: The Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act — often shorthanded as INARA — will likely be triggered if the Biden administration completes a deal. It will focus attention on some of the same lawmakers who had an impact on the original pact, in addition to the new crop of senators who have to consider the new agreement in the context of their reelection.

The INARA gives Congress the ability to block any nuclear agreement with Iran through a resolution of disapproval. Such a vote would put immense pressure on Democrats looking to show some independence from Biden foreign policy decisions that have faced significant blowback. But opponents of the new agreement would need to recruit at least 10 Democrats to support a disapproval resolution — an unlikely prospect, and one that nuclear-deal advocates see as an easy political choice for vulnerable senators.

That explains why Sen. BEN CARDIN (D-Md.), who opposed the deal in 2015, told Desiderio, “I think at the end of the day the president will get his way.”



Broadsides

‘DISQUALIFYING’: Rep. ADAM KINZINGER (R-Ill.), the outgoing lawmaker who is one of the few Republicans criticizing former President DONALD TRUMP’s behavior, bashed his choice to ask Putin to release information on Biden’s family.

“No former President should ever ask an evil man like Putin for a favor … like Trump did just yesterday,” Kinzinger tweeted Wednesday evening. “This is absolutely undermining the national security of this country and should be disqualifying for any re-election. @GOPLeader must address this, as must every Republican.”

Trump’s comment was reminiscent of his infamous July 2016 request of Russia to release a tranche of HILLARY CLINTON’s emails. Top Republicans have remained silent since Trump asked Moscow again for help against his political opponents.

Belying its claims of de-escalation, Russia increased bomb and artillery attacks in Ukraine on Wednesday and sent conflicting signals about the prospects for peace, suggesting new tensions in the Kremlin hierarchy about the course of the war.

The contradictory messaging came as a newly declassified U.S. intelligence assessment suggested that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had been misinformed about the war’s trajectory by subordinates, who were fearful of his reaction to the Russian military’s struggles and setbacks.

The intelligence, according to multiple American officials, showed Mr. Putin’s isolation and what appeared to be growing tension between him and the Ministry of Defense, including with his defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu, who was once among the most trusted members of the Kremlin inner circle and had been rumored to be a possible successor one day to Mr. Putin.

It was not clear whether the release of the declassified intelligence was intended to sow anxiety within Mr. Putin’s circle as part of a broader information battle between the United States and Russia over Ukraine, the source of the worst tensions between the two nuclear powers since the Cold War. Nor was it clear if the intelligence was accurate.

But American intelligence officials have proved right so far in their assessments of Mr. Putin’s intentions toward Ukraine, beginning with the Russian troop buildup along its borders last year that culminated in the Feb. 24 invasion.

White House officials said that they had released the intelligence to share what they said was a “full understanding” of how Mr. Putin had miscalculated.

“We believe he’s being misinformed by his advisers about how badly the Russian military is performing and how the Russian economy is being crippled by sanctions,” Kate Bedingfield, the White House communications director, told reporters.

Asked about the declassified assessment during a trip to Algiers, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said it was not surprising that Mr. Putin was ill-informed.

“One of the Achilles’ heels of autocracies,” he said, “is that you don’t have people in those systems who speak truth to power or who have the ability to speak truth to power. And I think that is something that we’re seeing in Russia.”

The latest assessment also appeared to track with the mixed messages from the Kremlin on Wednesday about peace talks with Ukraine this week in Istanbul. The chief Russian negotiator described them as promising, but was basically contradicted by the Kremlin’s top spokesman.

New Russian attacks in Ukraine, on the northern city of Chernihiv and the suburbs of Kyiv, also appeared to reflect disarray in Kremlin messaging, coming one day after the Russian military said it was de-escalating in those areas. They suggested that Mr. Putin might be stalling for time, redeploying his invasion forces elsewhere in the country and girding for a protracted conflict.

Mr. Putin’s ultimate aim, however, remains murky.

With the war about to enter its sixth week, its calamitous economic and humanitarian impact has widened. Germany has taken the first steps toward rationing natural gas, in anticipation of Russia potentially cutting off deliveries; the total number of Ukrainian refugees has surpassed four million — half of them children; and the United Nations is forecasting the most dire world hunger crisis since World War II. Ukraine and Russia are ordinarily major suppliers of the world’s wheat and other grains.

The Chernihiv region, which extends to the border with Belarus, appeared to have been targeted with intense Russian strikes early Wednesday, hours after Russia had vowed to sharply reduce combat in that area and near Kyiv. Both were early targets of the Russian invaders, who were stymied by intense and unexpectedly stiff Ukrainian resistance.

“Yesterday, the Russians publicly stated that they were reducing their offensive actions and activity in the Chernihiv and Kyiv areas,” the Chernihiv governor, Vyacheslav Chaus, said in a statement posted on the Telegram social media app. “Do we believe that? Of course not.”

Mr. Chaus said that “civil infrastructure has been destroyed again” by Russian strikes. “Libraries, shopping malls and other facilities have been destroyed, and many houses have been destroyed,” he said. “Because, in fact, the enemy roamed Chernihiv all night.”

In Kyiv, the regional military administration said in a Wednesday post on its Telegram channel that “more than 30 shellings by Russian troops of housing estates and social infrastructure” in the Kyiv region had been recorded over the previous 24 hours.

The mixed messaging from Russia on Wednesday raised questions about whether progress in the peace talks was real.

The lead Russian negotiator in the talks, Vladimir Medinsky, said on Russia’s state television that they appeared to be verging on a breakthrough. Mr. Medinsky said Ukraine’s proposal to declare neutrality, among what he called other concessions, represented its readiness for “building normal and, I hope, good neighborly relations with Russia.”

That language clashed markedly with hard-line rhetoric emanating from Moscow, where supporters of the war, who do not consider Ukraine to be a legitimate country, denounced Mr. Medinsky’s diplomacy as bordering on traitorous.

“Any talks with Nazis before your boot is on their throat are perceived as weakness,” Vladimir Solovyov, a popular state television host, said on his YouTube show, reprising the Kremlin’s false characterization of the Ukrainian government. “You cannot meet with them or talk to them.”

And the Kremlin’s chief spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, was far more cautious in his own comments than Mr. Medinsky. He said that Ukraine’s willingness to put some proposals in writing was a “positive factor,” but that “we do not see anything very promising or any breakthroughs.”

Russia first signaled last week that it was recalibrating the aims of what Mr. Putin has described as a “special military operation” in Ukraine, no longer focusing on seizing Kyiv and other important cities in the north and west of the country but instead on securing the eastern region, known as the Donbas. Russian-backed separatists have been fighting there since 2014.

The Russian Defense Ministry has cast its decision to wind down military operations around Kyiv as a good-faith gesture of de-escalation, but it appeared to be an attempt to explain away a battlefield defeat.

On Wednesday, the ministry said Russian forces around Kyiv were “regrouping,” although that assertion could not be independently confirmed. And it claimed that all along, the aim of gathering forces near Kyiv had not been to take the city but to tie up and weaken Ukrainian troops in the area.

“All these goals were achieved,” the ministry said in a statement, adding that it would now focus on “the final stage of the operation to liberate” the Donbas area.

The secretary of Ukraine’s national security council, Oleksiy Danilov, said Wednesday that at least part of the Russian military’s assertions appeared to be accurate. Some Russian units were relocating to eastern Ukraine and “the enemy is intensifying its formations there,” he said.

But Mr. Danilov cautioned that it would be premature to conclude that Russia had abandoned a push toward the capital, even if it was relocating some troops.

In the Donetsk part of Donbas, fighting escalated on Wednesday, the Ukrainian military said in a statement, as Russian forces “intensified fire and assault operations” with air and missile strikes. Ukraine’s military also reported Russian shelling and bomb strikes in the eastern city of Kharkiv, one of the invasion’s early targets.

Casualties in the war are difficult to confirm. The United Nations, which keeps a daily tally, said Wednesday that at least 1,189 people had been killed so far, although that is almost certainly an undercount.

The possible legal consequences for Russia over its targeting of civilian structures in Ukraine — a potential war crime — moved forward on Wednesday with the formation of a United Nations panel of inquiry. The three-person panel, named by the U.N. Human Rights Council, will “establish the facts, circumstances and root causes” of any crimes arising from the invasion, the council said.

Amid the litany of negative news, there was one potential bright spot: A NASA astronaut returned to Earth on Wednesday with two Russian colleagues, suggesting that despite their antipathy over the crisis in Ukraine, the United States and Russia could still collaborate in space.

ISTANBUL — The first signs of significant progress in peace talks between Russia and Ukraine emerged on Tuesday, but there was no hint of an imminent end to the suffering, with Russia appearing determined to capture more territory in eastern Ukraine and officials predicting that weeks of further negotiation were needed.

After three hours of talks in Istanbul, Ukrainian officials said their country was ready to declare itself permanently neutral — forsaking the prospect of joining NATO, a key Russian demand — and discuss Russian territorial claims in exchange for “security guarantees” from a group of other nations. An aide to Ukraine’s president called the Russian delegation “constructive,” while Russia said it would “drastically” scale back its military activity around Kyiv to “increase mutual trust.”

Russia’s statement that it will de-escalate the fighting around Kyiv — even as it keeps pounding other parts of Ukraine — may be little more than putting a positive gloss on its military being stymied in its attempts to seize or encircle the capital. In recent days, Ukrainian counteroffensives around the city have forced back Russian forces in some of the fiercest street battles of the war, though they remain within striking distance of Kyiv.

Now, Russian officials said, the goal will be to take more territory in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, where Russia has installed two separatist statelets that President Vladimir V. Putin recognized last month as independent, but that no other nation has formally acknowledged.

Western officials and security analysts cautioned against taking at face value Russia’s statements about its aims in Kyiv or elsewhere.

President Biden said he would not draw any conclusions about Russia’s intentions “until I see what their actions are.” Speaking after a White House meeting with the prime minister of Singapore, Mr. Biden added, “We’ll see if they follow through with what they are suggesting.”

“In the meantime,” Mr. Biden said, “we’re going to continue to keep strong the sanctions and will continue to provide the Ukrainian military with the capacity to defend themselves.”

Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, on a diplomatic trip to Morocco, told reporters, “There is what Russia says and there’s what Russia does,” adding, “and what Russia is doing is the continued brutalization of Ukraine and its people.”

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has worked hard to present Mr. Putin with a negotiated way to end the war, accompanied by Ukrainian concessions that would not go so far as to make his country a Russian satellite.

The offer to declare a permanent neutral status, Ukrainian officials in Istanbul said, means it would neither join the NATO alliance nor host foreign troops — a scenario that Mr. Putin used as one of the justifications for his invasion.

Ukrainian officials envision an arrangement in which a diverse group of countries — potentially including the United States, Germany, Turkey and China — would commit, if Ukraine were attacked, to providing it with military assistance and to imposing a no-fly zone if necessary. It was not clear that any of those countries had signed on to such guarantees.

“This is probably the best outcome that could’ve been hoped for today,” said Samuel Charap, who studies Russian foreign policy at the RAND Corporation. “The Ukrainians have at least come up with something concrete to address the core Russian demand for Ukraine’s neutrality.”

Ukraine also signaled readiness to consider concessions related to the parts of its territory already occupied by Russia. It proposed a 15-year negotiating process for Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula seized by Russia in 2014, and said it was ready to rule out trying to retake it by force. Questions surrounding the eastern Donbas region, Ukrainian officials said, could be discussed at a possible meeting between Mr. Putin and Mr. Zelensky.

Russia, for its part, said it was prepared to accelerate planning for such a summit meeting — something that Mr. Zelensky had long sought and that Moscow had resisted, casting Ukraine’s government as a mere puppet of Washington. But now, the Kremlin appears to be increasingly prepared to deal with Mr. Zelensky — in part because Ukraine’s resistance on the battlefield is leaving it no other choice.

Vladimir Medinsky, the head of Russia’s delegation, said that he viewed Ukraine’s proposals as “a constructive step in the search for a compromise.”

“If the treaty is worked out quickly and the required compromise is found, the possibility of making peace will be much closer,” Mr. Medinsky said.

Ukraine and Russia would need at least two more weeks for talks with Russia and potential guarantor countries, Oleksandr Chalyi, a member of the Ukrainian delegation, told reporters after Tuesday’s session. Turkey said it was prepared to host a meeting of the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers to flesh out Tuesday’s talks, followed by a possible meeting between the two presidents.

“You have shouldered a historic responsibility,” President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, who hosted Tuesday’s talks at a 19th-century Ottoman palace on the banks of the Bosporus, told the Russian and Ukrainian delegates. “All the world is expecting good news from you.”

Turkey has emerged as a pivotal intermediary in the talks, one of the few countries to maintain close ties to both Russia and Ukraine after the invasion. Though it is a NATO member, Turkey has refused to put in place sanctions against Russia, even as it offers military support to Ukraine. To underscore the latter, a member of the Ukrainian delegation, Mykhailo Podolyak, posted on Twitter on Tuesday a selfie with Haluk Bayraktar, a close associate of Mr. Erdogan and the head of a Turkish company that makes armed drones used by Ukraine.

But despite the positive signals, myriad diplomatic pitfalls remained. For example, Ukraine said that the international security guarantees would not apply to the disputed Donbas, but it is not clear how that area would be defined; the separatists claim far more territory than they controlled before the war.

“The Russian delegation is constructive,” Mr. Podolyak, who is an aide to Mr. Zelensky, said. “This doesn’t mean that the negotiations are easy. They are difficult.”

There was also no reprieve on the ground in Ukraine. On Tuesday morning, a Russian cruise missile strike destroyed part of the main regional government office building in the southern city of Mikolaiv, killing at least nine people and injuring at least 28, Ukrainian officials said.

It was one of many attacks since the Feb. 24 invasion that appeared aimed at disabling government operations; the regional administrator, Vitaly Kim, said his own office was destroyed, but he was not in the building at the time. The Russian advance along the Black Sea coast west of Crimea stalled outside Mikolaiv, in an area that has seen intense combat.

Another Russian missile struck an oil depot on Monday night in the Rivne region in northwestern Ukraine, the second to be destroyed there, according to the regional administrator.

“The scale of the challenges has not diminished,” Mr. Zelensky said in a statement. “The Russian army still has significant potential to continue attacks against our state. They still have a lot of equipment and enough people completely deprived of rights whom they can send to the cauldron of war. Therefore, we stay alert and do not reduce our defense efforts.”

The U.S. and British governments confirmed Ukrainian gains in towns around Kyiv — notably Irpin, scene of some of the fiercest street fighting — but advised skepticism about claims that Russia’s stance had changed.

“Has there been some movement by some Russian units away from Kyiv in the last day or so? Yeah, we think so, small numbers,” said John F. Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman. But, he added, “We believe that this is a repositioning, not a real withdrawal, and that we should be prepared to watch for a major offensive against other areas in Ukraine.”

The British Defense Ministry warned that “Russia still poses a significant threat to the city through their strike capability.”

Russia has signaled that it was narrowing its war aims to focus on taking more territory in the Donbas. Sergei K. Shoigu, the Russian defense minister, on Tuesday offered a possible justification for winding down the war effort elsewhere in the country by declaring, in televised remarks in Moscow, that Russia’s initial mission was accomplished.

“In general, the main goals of the first stage of the special operation have been completed,” Mr. Shoigu said. “The combat potential of the Ukrainian Armed Forces has been significantly reduced, which makes it possible to focus the main attention and main efforts on achieving the main goal — the liberation of Donbas.”

Russian forces have taken control of a land bridge along Ukraine’s southeastern coast linking Crimea to the Donbas. The lone holdout in that strip is the center of the devastated port city of Mariupol, where, the Institute for the Study of War reported on Tuesday, the Russians are still gaining ground, slowly tightening the noose around the fighters and civilians who remain.

Thousand of civilians have been killed in Mariupol, according to local officials — a claim that cannot be independently verified — and much of the city has been flattened. It remains under “continuous heavy shelling” by Russian forces, the British Defense Ministry said on Tuesday.

In the nearby port of Berdyansk, captured by the Russians, an evacuation convoy took 34 buses full of civilians out of the city, headed into territory held by Ukraine. In anther occupied city in the region, Melitopol, the mayor said the schools chief had been detained after she and local teachers refused orders by the occupying forces to change what was taught and to teach in Russian, not Ukrainian.

The war has cost Ukraine $564.9 billion in damage and lost economic activity — roughly three times its prewar gross domestic product — Yulia Svyrydenko, the economy minister, said in a Facebook post on Monday.

There are as yet no reliable estimates of civilian casualties, and some four million people have fled the country, along with about six million who are internally displaced, according to the United Nations.
