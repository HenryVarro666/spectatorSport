Flights from Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Poland can be operated only with the special permission of Rosaviatsiya or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia.

As of midnight, Bulgaria imposed a ban on the take-off/landing and entry of Russian aircraft into the country's airspace.

The action is being taken in connection with the escalation of the military conflict and in solidarity with Ukraine.

Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has lashed out at Western sanctions imposed on Russia -- of which he is also a target -- saying they are a sign of “political impotence.”

I believe it is obvious to intelligent people: sanctions are a myth, a threat, a figure of speech. I am fundamentally indifferent to these widely publicized restrictions of rights abroad,” Medvedev said in a post on Russian social network VK on Saturday.

“The reason for the sanctions is this. It is political impotence arising from inability to change Russia’s course. Also, a hope to make up for the shameful decisions like the cowardly flight from Afghanistan.”

Medvedev, who currently serves as deputy chairman of the Security Council, added: “These amazing prohibitions will change nothing, of course. Even the ignorant people at the State Department know this.”

The ex-president went on to compare the incursion into Ukraine, with Russia’s military operation in Georgia in 2008.

“[The military operation] will be conducted in full, until all the objectives the president of Russia has set out are achieved, no more and no less. As it was in a similar situation in 2008,” he said.

He argued that this move by Western nations would further increase the support the Russian government currently has.

Well done to our US and EU partners – nothing consolidates the authorities, the ruling elites and, largely, the citizens of our country more than their love for Europeans and Americans,” he said.

Medvedev also threatened to nationalize assets that foreign companies held inside Russia, and said sanctions gave Russia a “good reason” to review its diplomatic relations with the countries who are imposing them.

“Diplomatic relations are not that necessary, either,” he wrote. “Time to put a padlock on embassies and confine contacts to gazing at one another through binoculars and rifle scopes.”

Russia has reportedly prohibited airlines from 36 countries, including 27 EU nations, as a response to sanctions imposed on the country for the Ukraine invasion.

The move comes soon after Europe, Canada and the UK shut their airspace for Russian airlines.

Names of some of the banned nations were announced by the Russian Federal Air Transport Agency Rosaviatsiya.

Rosaviatsiya said that countries including Albania, Anguilla, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, British Virgin Islands, Canada, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Gibraltar, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Iceland, Italy, Jersey, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg and Malta are part of the banned countries list.

The list also includes countries such as the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the UK.

By imposing a ban on using Russian airspace, airlines will have to take a new path for carrying passengers from Europe to Asia.

However, Rosaviatsia noted that flights will be allowed to use the Russian airspace only during special circumstances and must obtain the approval of the Russian aviation authority or foreign ministry.

Last month, the Russian aviation authority banned UK airlines from landing at its airports and crossing its airspace.

The move was made after the UK banned Russian flag carrier Aeroflot from landing in the country.

BBC quoted Russia’s civil aviation authority Rosaviatsia as stating: “This measure was taken in accordance with the provisions of the Intergovernmental Air Services Agreement between Russia and the UK as a response to unfriendly decisions by the UK aviation authorities regarding the restriction on regular flights of aircraft owned, leased or operated by a person associated with Russia or registered in Russia.”",https://www.airport-technology.com/news/russia-shuts-airspace/

These are the key effects.

Who’s banned from Russian airspace?

According to Rosaviatsiya, Russia’s Federal Agency for Air Transport, airlines from all 27 members of the European Union plus the UK, Albania, Canada, Iceland, Norway and Switzerland are banned from flying to, from and over the biggest country in the world.

(The order also covers British Overseas Territories including Anguilla, Gibraltar and the British Virgin Islands, but these are irrelevant since their airlines do not use Russian airspace.)

Other carriers, such as Japan Airlines, have voluntarily decided to avoid Russian airspace.

In addition, Ukraine’s airspace is closed to civilian traffic.

What is the main effect?

Links between the four main western European hubs – London, Amsterdam, Paris and Frankfurt – and east Asia are blocked from their obvious and most direct flight paths. The “keep out” sign over the world’s biggest country particularly affects flights from western Europe to Tokyo.

Russia’s state-owned news agency, Tass, says that on 25 February, UK air carriers planned to carry out 70 flights in Russia’s airspace, as well as two London-Moscow flights operated by British Airways.

Japan Airlines’ daily service is now flying from London to the Japanese capital via Iceland, Greenland, Canada and Alaska, effectively reinventing the Polar Route between Europe and Tokyo.

Links from Paris and Frankfurt to the Japanese capital are currently suspended.

But Korean Air is continuing to fly over Russian airspace between London and Seoul.

The impact would be far greater if the Covid-19 pandemic had not effectively closed down most flights between western Europe and the key Chinese cities of Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong.

The most direct flight between London and Beijing spends many hours overflying Russia, while about half the journey time of the former Cathay Pacific link between Manchester and Hong Kong was spent in Russian airspace.

Who is worst affected?

Finnair, which has built its entire operation on a Helsinki hub perfectly placed between western Europe and East Asia, flying over Russia, is now in a tricky position.

The Finnish airline resumes flying from Helsinki to Tokyo Narita four times a week today, but with the normal nine-hour flight time almost 40 per cent longer at 12 hours 30 minutes.

Ole Orvér, Finnair’s chief commercial officer, said: “Japan is one of our most important markets, and we want to continue offering safe and reliable connections between Helsinki and Tokyo.”

Ahead of the relaunch, Robert Boyle, former director of strategy for the airline combine IAG, wrote: “The geographic position of Helsinki has allowed Finnair to operate highly efficient aircraft schedules to northeast Asia.

“A daily flight [from Helsinki to Tokyo and back] uses just one aircraft. Adding three hours to the journey time each way to avoid Russia would destroy that. Very loosely, they would need twice as many aircraft to operate the same number of flights.”

Finnair continues to fly to Bangkok, Delhi, Phuket and Singapore, but with much longer flightpaths.

Mr Boyle believes Asian carriers “are the main beneficiaries of overflight restrictions on European carriers”.

While British Airways, Air France/KLM and Lufthansa cannot cross Russian airspace en route to south and southeast Asia – including key destinations including Delhi, Bangkok and Singapore – they are only seeing flights times increase by only 10 per cent or so.

Which way are they flying?

A good example is the flightpath of British Airways BA118 from Bengaluru in India to London Heathrow, which the captain has tweeted.

Going places: the flightpath of British Airways 118 from Bengaluru to London Heathrow (British Airways)

The most direct route would overfly Ukraine. With airspace closed, an alternative track would be to go further north over Russia.

Instead, the current route heads west to the Gulf, over much of Iraq and northern Turkey, clipping the southwest corner of the Black Sea. This is popular flight path, with Iraqi airspace now regarded as safe.

What is happening to Russian airlines?

They are banned from the UK, the European Union and many other nations. On Tuesday evening, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, tweeted: “I have made it a criminal offence for ANY Russian aircraft to enter UK airspace and now HMG [Her Majesty’s Government] can detain these jets.

“We will suffocate Putin’s cronies’ ability to continue living as normal while thousands of innocent people die.”

In practice, Russian airlines are already limiting their operations to domestic and Belarus links. This is because so many aircraft are leased from Western firms, and there are concerns that they would be impounded if they were to land at a foreign airport.

Are there any flights in and out of Russia? Yes. Looking at Wednesday’s operations from the nation’s three biggest airports (by 2019 passenger numbers), these are the options:

Moscow Sheremetyevo

Abu Dhabi (UAE) on Etihad

Antalya (Turkey) on Nordwind and Pegasus

Istanbul (Turkey) on Nordwind

Belgrade (Serbia) on Air Serbia

Delhi (India) on Air India

Doha (Qatar) on Qatar Airways

Moscow Domodedovo

Baghdad (Iraq) on Red Wings

Bishkek (Kyrgyzstan) on Avia

Baku (Azerbaijan) on Azerbaijan Airlines

Casablanca (Morocco) on Royal Air Maroc

Dubai (UAE) on Emirates

Minsk (Belarus) on Belavia

Nur-Sultan (Kazakhstan) on Air Astana

Samarkand (Uzbekistan) on Red Wings

Sharjah (UAE) on Air Arabia

St Petersburg

Belgrade (Serbia) on Air Serbia

Doha (Qatar) on Qatar Airways

Istanbul (Turkey) on Turkish Airlines

Minsk (Belarus) on Belavia

Do the flight bans have ripple effects in other regions?

Marginally. On journeys such as New York-Delhi, a natural choice for American travellers would be to connect in a western European hub such as Heathrow, Amsterdam, Paris or Frankfurt.

But the speed advantage of connecting in western Europe has been lost, making Turkish Airlines and the Gulf-based airlines relatively more appealing.

Will air fares rise?

Yes – partly because of the soaring price of oil, partly by the extended routes. Just as aviation was finally opening up post-Covid, the horrific situation in Ukraine has triggered a near-doubling in the price of oil within 10 weeks.

While some airlines are protected to some extent by “hedging” - effectively financial insurance against price surges in the oil market - lots have given up the practice because it is expensive.

Adding three or four hours to the flying time between London or Helsinki and Tokyo is also extremely costly, and means that aircraft utilisation is poor.

However, the financial hit from having to avoid Russian airspace is not so great, because the country’s airspace charges are so high in normal times.

The precise arrangements are a closely guarded secret, but using available published data it appears there is a special payment to Aeroflot – under the terms of an agreement signed in the days of the USSR, when Aeroflot was a national airline.

The Independent calculates that the payment is around £5,000 per flight, in addition to standard overflight charges of around £6,000 for a five-hour journey above Russia on a full wide-bodied plane. The overflight charge works out at around £37 per passenger.

This represents almost eight times as much as flying the same distance over American territory.

On a typical £500 return flight between London and Bangkok the “toll” works out at 15 per cent of the total fare.

Optimists hope that once peace returns, Moscow will be in a weaker position for demanding what is effectively an extremely expensive toll – because the world’s airlines will have seen they can do without Russia.",https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/airspace-ban-travel-disruption-flights-b2031833.html

The Biden administration’s decision to prohibit Russian airlines from entering American airspace will further isolate the nation, as Western governments weaken Russia’s aviation system and hinder its ability to access the portion of its fleet owned by other countries. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight President Biden announced Tuesday during his State of the Union address that the United States will join Canada and several European nations in limiting Russia’s access to the global aviation network in response to the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine. Federal transportation officials said the ban would go into effect by the end of Wednesday.

“Tonight, I am announcing that we will join our allies in closing off American airspace to all Russian flights, further isolating Russia and adding an additional squeeze on their economy,” Biden said.

Airlines have scrubbed more than 100 flights into and out of Moscow’s Sheremetyevo International Airport this week as restrictions come into force. The new measures announced Tuesday are part of an expansive set from Western nations that could rapidly hamstring Russia’s commercial aviation industry.

The global restrictions target Russian aviation on multiple fronts. The most immediate measures are airspace closures that severely limit where Russian national carrier Aeroflot, and private airlines from the country, can fly. Sanctions and export controls also threaten Russia’s access to spare aviation parts and the hundreds of leased aircraft that make up about half the nation’s commercial fleet.

“Closing airspace to Russian airlines is one of the most visible actions countries can take and one of the most hard hitting,” said Henry Harteveldt, an aviation industry analyst at Atmosphere Research Group. “Lessors requiring Russians return their aircraft is definitely a severe blow to Russian airlines, as well.”

In return, Russia has closed its airspace to European airlines, all but blocking some routes to Asia for some carriers and potentially slowing the return of international travel as the airline industry tries to recover from the coronavirus pandemic.

Aeroflot operates a fleet of more than 300 aircraft — mostly Boeing and Airbus jets — and serves destinations around the world. Europe and the Western Hemisphere are now nearly out of reach, and the war has disrupted some domestic routes to cities near the Ukrainian border.

Boeing announced Tuesday evening that it was suspending parts, maintenance and technical support services for Russian airlines and had “suspended major operations in Moscow.” Airbus made a similar announcement Wednesday, saying the move was “in line with international sanctions now in place.”

Britain took the first step to block Russian airlines, closing its airspace within hours of the invasion. Over the weekend, some European nations and Canada followed, and a European Union-wide ban went into effect Monday.

As a safety precaution, the Federal Aviation Administration last week had prohibited U.S. airlines from flying over Ukraine, Belarus and parts of Russia, extending restrictions over contested territory in eastern Ukraine.

Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said he spoke Tuesday with Ukraine’s minister of infrastructure, Oleksandr Kubrakov, and the country’s ambassador to Washington, Oksana Markarova, who requested the closure of U.S. airspace. Buttigieg, appearing Wednesday before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said “other steps” could follow, but he didn’t specify what those might be.

Airlines have, in some cases, been left looking for other routes to cross the globe as the skies become divided into blocs closed to certain nations.

Even before Biden’s announcement, Aeroflot said Monday that the closure of Canadian skies to its planes has forced it to cancel flights to cities in the United States, Mexico and the Caribbean.

An Aeroflot flight from Miami arrived in Moscow on Sunday after flying through Canadian airspace, an action Canadian authorities described as a “violation” of the ban. The next day, a Russian cargo flight from Chicago to Moscow departed while following a fishhook-shaped route that avoided northern Europe.

Even as Russian airspace remained open to U.S. airlines, many flights to East Asia were avoiding flight paths over the nation, according to records from data service Flightradar24. One exception included United Airlines flights from India, which continued to pass through Russian skies.

United said Tuesday that it would stop using that route.

Russia’s decision to reciprocate — blocking other nations’ airlines from its airspace — has caused economic harm to some carriers. Finnish carrier Finnair said Monday that if restrictions remained, it would affect the carrier’s bottom line.

“Bypassing the Russian airspace lengthens flight times to Asia considerably and, thus, the operation of most our passenger and cargo flights to Asia is not economically sustainable or competitive” Topi Manner, the airline’s chief executive, said in a statement.

With international travel down because of the pandemic, analysts say the immediate effects will be somewhat blunted, while costing Russia revenue it would otherwise generate in overflight fees.

Michael McCormick, an assistant professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, said if the world’s airspace remains fragmented in the long term, airlines would suffer from being unable to use certain routes over the Arctic.

“Those are very efficient routes in terms of mileage and time,” he said. “The loss of those polar routes will have a significant impact on direct flights.”

American aviation businesses also face export restrictions imposed by the Biden administration. Those include provisions for exceptions to be granted for safety-critical components, but it’s not clear how that system might work. The E.U. has imposed similar restrictions.

Russia is not a major market for American aviation firms, according to an analysis by the Aerospace Industries Association. However, Russian airlines are heavily dependent on European and American technology and will struggle if they cannot access it, said Bijan Vasigh, an economics professor at Embry-Riddle.

“That is a big issue for them,” Vasigh said.

Sanctions affecting leased aircraft also could hit hard, depriving Russian airlines of much of their fleets.

The nation’s airlines have 981 jets and turboprops in service, according to figures compiled by aviation consultant Ascend by Cirium. Of those, 531 are owned by foreign companies and leased to the airlines, with Irish companies holding an outsize number. Under the European sanctions, those Irish businesses will have until late March to end their agreements in Russia.

In a statement, Dublin-based AerCap, which has 154 planes leased to Russian airlines, said it “intends to fully comply with all applicable sanctions, which will require us to cease our leasing activity with Russian airlines.”

Private companies also have severed ties with Aeroflot. Delta Air Lines ended a code-sharing partnership last week, and American Airlines said it has ended agreements with Aeroflot and S7, another Russian carrier. FedEx and UPS have suspended service to Russia.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine and airspace restrictions pose huge challenges to global aviation as hundreds of flights that used to fly over Russian air space now have to opt for alternative routes, leading to an increase in operating costs due to more fuel burn. The sector faces a double whammy as ATF prices are also rising due to soaring crude prices.

Airlines are bracing for impact as the global aviation map could be redrawn due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine has been closed to civilian flights since February 24 after Russia escalated military advances in the country. After Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, the European Union, Canada has shut its airspace to Russian aircraft. The US too has also banned Russian aircraft from American airspace.

In line with global giants imposing sanctions against Russia, Boeing and Airbus have also suspended maintenance support to the Russian fleet. Do remember that Russian flag carrier Aeroflot, which flies to 146 destinations worldwide, has a mixed fleet of Airbus and Boeing aircraft. Russia has also retaliated to the flight ban and has shut its air space to around 40 nations.

Why is Russian airspace important?

Russian airspace has a unique advantage due to geography, provides crucial Asia-Europe corridors, and hence airlines save money and fuel.

The immediate impact is the concern over longer routes, extra fuel for airlines, impact on cargo traffic as global supply-chain is set to be hit, flight cancellations, and the increase in usage of alternative routes such as Kazakhstan's airspace usage has been tripled in the recent days. Also, globally there is caution among airlines due to the conflict zone as in the past we have seen the MH17 incident where a missile shot down Malaysia Airlines passenger plane, killing all on board, in Ukraine airspace in 2014 during the then-ongoing conflict.

For some airlines, the impact is more severe such as Finland’s Fin Air’s core business model is based on shorter routes via Russian air space, after the ban, the airline says most Asia flights are now neither financially sustainable nor competitive.

Fin Air managed the shortest flight time between Europe and Asia as it has an agreement with Russia to fly 80 flights a week over Siberia.

""Negative financial effects on Fin air are considerable due to closure of Russian air space. Circulation of Russian air space extends flight time to Asia to such an extent that operation of most cargo and passenger flights to Asia is neither financially sustainable nor competitive,"" Fin Air said on the implications of the closure of Russian air space.

For Virgin Atlantic, flight paths have to be adjusted for some of its services between the UK, Pakistan, and India. Flight times on these routes will be extended by between 15 minutes and an hour.

European Union officials announced on Feb. 27 a plan to close all EU airspace to Russian aircraft as part of an increasing package of sanctions against the Kremlin for its recent invasion of Ukraine. The ban will prohibit all Russian-owned, -registered, or -controlled aircraft, including private and charter flights, from landing in, taking off from, or transiting any EU nation. Authorities have as yet not stated precisely when the measure will enter into effect. Canada also closed its airspace to Russian aircraft effective Feb. 27.

The bloc decision by the EU comes after several European countries had already implemented such closures, or announced plans to do so in response to Russia's military action in Ukraine. EU member nations Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovenia, and Romania had earlier announced individual closures, while Denmark and Finland were preparing their own plans. Non-EU members Iceland and the UK had also closed their airspace to Russian aircraft, with Norway planning to follow suit as of Feb. 27.

Russia has thus far responded by closing its own airspace to airlines belonging to Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia, Estonia, the UK, Poland, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, and Romania; however, the government in Moscow will likely expand its airspace closures to target additional nations in retaliation. Russia's Federal Air Transportation Agency (Rosaviatsiya) announced on Feb. 27 that, although flights to and from Kaliningrad are operating, scheduling changes and lengthier flight times are likely since aircraft serving the enclave can only use routes over the Gulf of Finland and international waters of the Baltic Sea. The recent increase in airspace closures on Feb. 27 forced several in-flight Russian airplanes, including those operated by Aeroflot (SU), Ural Airlines (U6), and Rossiya (FV), to return to Russian airports.

Aside from national airspace closures, a number of airlines have either partially or fully suspended services using Russian airspace. Air France (AF) has suspended services to and overflights via Russia until further notice. As a consequence, flights to and from China, South Korea, and Japan will be temporarily suspended. Lufthansa (LH), Wizz Air (W6), and KLM (KL) have also halted flights to Russia temporarily; British Airways has stopped its service to Moscow (BA). US carrier Delta (DL) has suspended its code-share arrangement with Russian carrier Aeroflot.

Further sanctions and countersanctions, including flight bans, are likely in the coming days.

Russian Domestic Air Restrictions

Russia has suspended commercial flight operations at several southern airports through at least March 2. Impacted airports include Rostov-on-Don Airport (RVI), Krasnodar International Airport (KRR), Anapa Airport (AAQ), Gelendzhik Airport (GDZ), Elista Airport (ESL), Stavropol Shpakovskoye Airport (STW), Belgorod International Airport (EGO), Bryansk International Airport (BZK), Oryol Yuzhny Airport (OEL), Kursk Vostochny Airport (URS), Voronezh International Airport (VOZ), and Simferopol International Airport (SIP).

European Air Travel Restrictions

Belarus has partially closed its airspace, including the southern Brest Region and areas south of Asipovichy and Krichev in the Mogilev Region. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has also issued a warning for Ukraine and surrounding regions, including an advisory to avoid using the airspace within 100 nautical miles (185 km/115 miles) of the Belarus-Ukraine and Russia-Ukraine borders. The full warning is available by clicking here. Moldova, on the other hand, has fully closed its airspace.



Heightened Security and General Disruptions

Several countries sharing borders with Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia have implemented heightened security measures. Multiple NATO members in the region have invoked Article 4 of the NATO treaty. They could increase the readiness of their militaries as a result, though this is not an indication that they expect to become engaged in the conflict.

Moldova, Lithuania, and Slovakia have enacted states of emergency. Slovakia has suspended international rail services with Ukraine. Moldova, Slovakia, Hungary, and Poland are all keeping their respective borders with Ukraine open and are making preparations to receive refugees; these countries are also likely to maintain heightened troop deployments near their borders with Ukraine over at least the short term. Enhanced security measures and a sharp increase in individuals attempting to leave Ukraine will likely result in border crossing delays.

Ukraine has closed its border checkpoints with Belarus, Russia, and the Transnistria region of Moldova to foreign nationals; Ukrainian citizens are permitted to return, however.



Sanctions

Authorities in the US, UK, and the EU have agreed to block certain Russian banks from the SWIFT global financial messaging system and impose sanctions on the Russian Central Bank. Authorities have not specified which banks will be affected by this decision; it also remains unclear as to when the decision will come into force.

The US Embassy in Russia issued a statement Feb. 26 noting that it had received multiple reports of non-Russian credit and debit cards being declined in Russia.

Potential sanctions and countersanctions could also limit the ability of some foreign nationals to operate in Russia and Belarus and of Russian and Belarusian nationals to operate in Europe. Still, foreign nationals seeking to leave Russia or Belarus, or Russians and Belarusians seeking to leave European nations, are unlikely to face administrative obstacles although flight availability will be significantly reduced. Foreign diplomatic missions in Russia or Belarus could be forced to limit consular services if sanctions prompt expulsions or withdrawals of embassy and consulate staff. While there may be an elevated threat of arbitrary politically-motivated detentions until tensions ease, the likelihood of such actions remains low.



Generalized public fear over the potential impact of strong economic sanctions could prompt shortages of cash at ATMs as citizens attempt to withdraw large quantities of funds, as well as shortages of essential goods due to panic buying.



Anti-Western Sentiment

In the coming days, heightened anti-Western sentiment is possible in Russia and Belarus in reaction to the international response to the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine. While there is currently no increased direct security threat to Western or other foreign nationals in Russia or Belarus, isolated incidents of low-level harassment are possible. The frequency of such incidents could increase depending on the severity of any Western economic sanctions.

Advice

Confirm flight status with carriers; do not check out of accommodations until onward travel is confirmed. Avoid nonessential travel to affected border regions; defer travel to Ukraine. Exercise heightened vigilance at public gathering places in major urban areas. Heed authorities' instructions; remain calm and cooperative if questioned by law enforcement officers. Carry proper identification, including a passport with a current Russian or Belarusian visa if one is required. Prepare for disruption to card payments in Russia. Ensure alternative payment methods are available. Avoid all demonstrations as a routine security precaution and leave the area at the first sign of a confrontation. Refrain from discussing the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, or other politically sensitive topics.
