Russia reorganized the command of its flagging offensive in Ukraine on Saturday, selecting for the mission a general accused of ordering strikes on civilian neighborhoods in Syria, as Western nations poured more weapons into the country in anticipation of a renewed Russian assault in the east.

The appointment of the general, Aleksandr V. Dvornikov, as the top battlefield commander came as Britain announced that it was sending missiles that target aircraft, tanks and even ships, and as Slovakia handed the Ukrainian military a long-range S-300 air defense system, with the blessing of the United States.

In another show of support for Ukraine, Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain made a surprise visit on Saturday to Kyiv, the capital, where he met with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, and discussed a “new package of financial and military aid,” the British government said.

Mr. Zelensky called on other Western leaders to similarly provide military aide to Ukraine and impose further sanctions on Russia.

“Other Western democratic countries should follow the U.K.’s example,” Mr. Zelensky said after meeting with Mr. Johnson.

The two leaders walked through the mostly empty cobbled streets of Kyiv in a show of confidence that the Ukrainian capital was now safe from Russian attacks. Outside a shop, one man warmly greeted them, thanking Mr. Johnson for Britain’s support in effusive Ukrainian as Mr. Zelensky translated.

“In the last few weeks the world has found new heroes, and those heroes are the people of Ukraine,” said Mr. Johnson.

“What Putin has done in places like Bucha and Irpin, his war crimes, have permanently polluted his reputation and the reputation of his government,” he added. “There is a huge amount to do to make sure that Ukraine is successful, that Ukraine wins and that Putin fails.”

The effort by Mr. Johnson to bolster Ukraine came as fears of a new Russian onslaught escalated. Despite its large army and considerable military might, Russia was unable to take Kyiv and now appears to be scrambling to retain dominance in Ukraine’s southeast, appointing a new commander for its offensive and withdrawing troops from the capital to an area where it has the advantage of support from local ethnic Russian separatists.

“Russian forces continue to attempt to regroup and redeploy units withdrawn from northeastern Ukraine to support an offensive in eastern Ukraine, but these units are unlikely to enable a Russian breakthrough and face poor morale,” said a report from the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank.

Moscow denied responsibility for the attack, but U.S. military officials and independent analysts in Washington said they believed Russian forces had launched the missiles.

In a statement condemning the train station attack, the European Union said on Saturday that Russia was clearly culpable and that “attempts to hide Russia’s responsibility for this and other crimes using disinformation and media manipulations are unacceptable.”

Mr. Zelensky described the attack as “another war crime” and said it would be investigated, along with other atrocities attributed to Russian troops, including the apparent murders of civilians in Bucha, a suburb of Kyiv.

“Like the massacre in Bucha, like many other Russian war crimes, the missile strike on Kramatorsk must be one of the charges at the tribunal, which is bound to happen,” Mr. Zelensky said, calling for Russian commanders to face trials like those faced by the Nazis at Nuremberg after World War II.

Japan said it would join the United States and European nations in supporting investigations and would expel eight Russian diplomats, ban Russian coal and restrict Russian imports of timber, vodka and machinery.

Japan accused Russia of repeatedly attacking civilians and nuclear power plants, a sore point for Japan after the 2011 nuclear disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi plant.

“We must hold Russia strictly accountable for these atrocities,” the Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida, said.

Legal experts have said that bringing war crimes charges against Kremlin officials would be difficult. The burden of proof is very high, requiring prosecutors to show that soldiers and their commanders intended to violate the international law that establishes the rules of war.

Western analysts and European intelligence officials believe that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is trying to achieve battlefield gains by May 9, when he is planning to give a victory day speech commemorating both the Soviet victory in World War II and the military operation in Ukraine.

On Saturday, Russian forces stepped up shelling in eastern Ukraine, with explosions reported in the Odesa and Kharkiv regions. The massing of Russian forces in the region, after they withdrew from areas around Kyiv, has prompted officials in the east to urge residents to flee. And thousands have.

“The Russian troops are coming, so we are leaving to save our lives,” said Svitlana Kyrychenko, 47, who evacuated from Kramatorsk with her 18-year-old daughter, elderly mother and aunt on Saturday morning. She was at the train station in the central city of Dnipro, looking for a place to stay.

“I brought nothing with me,” she said. “I only brought my documents and clothes to change into for a few days.”

Elsewhere in Dnipro, dozens of people waited to board buses to Bulgaria.

“The air raids are becoming more and more frequent,” said Ludmila Abramova, 62, who had fled from Pavlograd, a city close to the eastern Donbas region, where Russia has been refocusing its forces. “I’m leaving.”

“But it’s all going to be all right,” Ms. Abramova added. “I’ll be back soon.”

More than 6,600 people managed to flee besieged Ukrainian cities on Friday — a record number for the week — according to the country’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk.

But in Kramatorsk, there was no sense of panic after the train station attack, said the mayor, Oleksandr Honcharenko. He said that he expected about one-quarter of the city’s 200,000 residents to stay there, and was preparing food, water and medical supplies.

“The only thing that will convince them to leave the city is if it comes under siege,” Mr. Honcharenko said.

Fewer than 400 people had boarded buses out of Kramatorsk on Saturday, he said, presumably headed for areas to the west that are believed to to be safer.

The European Commission on Saturday said that a global fund-raising effort called “Stand Up for Ukraine” had raised 9.1 billion euros, including 1 billion euros from the commission, for people fleeing the Russian invasion.

More than seven million Ukrainians have left their homes since the invasion on Feb. 24, and more than 4.4 million have left the country altogether, in the fastest-moving exodus of European refugees since World War II, according to the United Nations.

The appointment of General Dvornikov came as the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank that tracks the fighting, said in its latest assessment that Russian forces in the east appeared to be stalled, and were “unlikely to enable a Russian breakthrough and face poor morale.”

General Dvornikov was the first commander dispatched by Moscow to oversee Russian forces in Syria’s civil war in 2015 after the Kremlin intervened to shore up President Bashar al-Assad’s struggling military.

General Dvornikov was there for about a year and was named a hero of the Russian Federation for his role. He oversaw forces that have been widely accused of bombing civilian neighborhoods, targeting hospitals and resorting to other scorched-earth tactics to break the back of the rebel movement that sought to oust Mr. al-Assad.

“Bashar al-Assad is not the only one to be held accountable for killing civilians in Syria. The Russian general should, too,” said Rami Abdulrahman, the head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor based in Britain. “As the commander of military operations, that means he’s behind killing Syrian civilians by giving the orders.”

The actions of the Syrian government and Russian forces were widely decried by Western officials and human rights organizations, which said that some of their tactics amounted to war crimes.

The commander of a Syrian Christian militia that received support from and fought alongside Russian forces in Syria said General Dvornikov was involved in battles in many parts of the country.

“He was a real commander, very serious, proud of the Russian army and its military history,” the commander said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak with journalists.

Russia had been running its military campaign against Ukraine out of Moscow, with no central commander on the ground to coordinate air, ground and sea units. That approach helped to explain why the invasion struggled against an unexpectedly stiff Ukrainian resistance, and was plagued by poor logistics and flagging morale, American officials said.

The disorganized assault also contributed to the deaths of at least seven Russian generals, as high-ranking officers were pushed to the front lines to untangle tactical problems that Western militaries would have left to more junior officers or senior enlisted personnel.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has entered its second month, with casualties mounting on both sides.

Ukraine's forces continue to resist, while its President Volodymyr Zelenskyy regularly calls on the world to do more to help. Governments around the globe have imposed heavy sanctions against Moscow but have stopped short of direct intervention for fear of sparking a wider conflict.

Meanwhile, rising geopolitical risk and volatile energy and financial markets are rocking Asia.

4:00 p.m. All options would be on the table in response to any use of chemical weapons in Ukraine by Russia, British armed forces minister James Heappey said. British foreign minister Liz Truss on Monday said the country was working with its partners to verify the details of reports Russian forces may have used chemical agents in an attack on Mariupol. ""There are some things that are beyond the pale, and the use of chemical weapons will get a response and all options are on the table for what that response could be,"" Heappey told Sky News on Tuesday.

2:20 p.m. Fighting in eastern Ukraine will intensify over the next two to three weeks as Russia continues to refocus its efforts there, the U.K.'s Ministry of Defense tweeted in a regular bulletin. Russian attacks remain focused on Ukrainian positions near Donetsk and Luhansk, with further fighting around Kherson and Mykolaiv and a renewed push toward Kramatorsk, British military intelligence said. The report also said Russian forces continue to withdraw from Belarus in order to redeploy in support of operations in eastern Ukraine.

11:14 a.m. The mayor of the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol told the Associated Press that more than 10,000 civilians have died in the Russian siege of his city and that the death toll could surpass 20,000, with weeks of attacks and privation leaving bodies ""carpeted through the streets."" Mayor Vadym Boychenko also accused Russian forces of having blocked humanitarian convoys from entering the city for weeks in an attempt to conceal the carnage there from the outside world.

11:00 a.m. Japan's Cabinet has approved additional sanctions against Russia, freezing assets of 398 Russian individuals, including President Vladimir Putin's daughters and the wife of Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

10:05 a.m. Japan's wholesale inflation remained near record-high levels in March as the Ukraine crisis and a weak yen pushed up the costs of fuel and raw materials, government data shows. The corporate goods price index, which measures the prices that companies charge each other for goods and services, rose 9.5% in March from a year earlier. That followed a revised 9.7% spike in February, which was the fastest pace on record. The March index, at 112.0, was the highest level since December 1982.

6:24 a.m. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his daily video address late on Monday that Russia forces could use chemical weapons in Ukraine, but he did not say that chemical weapons have already been used. Unconfirmed reports earlier in the day had suggested that chemical weapons were used in the besieged southern port of Mariupol.

5:00 a.m. European Union officials discussing additional sanctions on Russia have failed to agree on a Russian oil embargo despite support from some countries.

Many of the ministers meeting in Luxembourg showed support for sanctions on Russian oil imports, top EU diplomat Josep Borrell says. But for others, such a ban would constitute an ""asymmetric shock,"" he says. The bloc did agree to step up the delivery of weapons to Ukraine.

1:38 a.m. Axel Springer says it has hired the former Russian state TV worker who made international headlines last month by bursting onto her then-employer's live newscast to protest the war.

Marina Ovsyannikova will report for the German company's Welt brand as a freelance correspondent, including from Ukraine and Russia. She will write for the newspaper and regularly contribute to Welt news channel coverage, according to Axel Springer.

Ovsyannikova was fined 30,000 rubles ($373 at current rates) in mid-March and could still face further prosecution in Russia.

1:30 a.m. ""This is not a friendly visit,"" Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer says in a statement issued by his office about talks just outside Moscow with Vladimir Putin.

This marked the first meeting with the Russian president by a European Union leader since the invasion of Ukraine started more than six weeks ago.

Nehammer has expressed solidarity with Ukraine and denounced apparent Russian war crimes. His government last week ordered the expulsion of a total of four Russian Embassy and Russian Consulate personnel over conduct that has ""not been in accordance with their diplomatic status"" -- generally a euphemism for spying.

Monday, April 11

10:30 p.m. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called on South Korea to send weapons to his country to defend its people against a Russian invasion.

In his 17-minute speech to South Korean lawmakers, Zelenskyy showed images of the ravages of war in Mariupol and other cities.

Seoul's defense ministry on Monday said it had rejected a request by the Ukrainian defense minister for anti-aircraft weapons, Reuters reports.

6:00 p.m. Witnessing Russia's struggles in Ukraine, China is likely reassessing any plans it had to make a move on Taiwan, a prominent Japanese scholar on China says in Tokyo.

""If China does possess a scenario of invading Taiwan, it will rethink, push back or at least make sure that all preparations are made before proceeding. It is unthinkable that they will decide to bring forward an invasion,"" Shin Kawashima, a professor at the University of Tokyo, says at the Japan National Press Club. Read more.

5:44 p.m. Tens of thousands of people have likely been killed in Russia's assault on the southeastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. ""Mariupol has been destroyed, there are tens of thousands of dead, but even despite this, the Russians are not stopping their offensive,"" Zelenskyy said in a video address to South Korean lawmakers.

5:14 p.m. Russia has destroyed S-300 anti-aircraft missile systems which had been supplied to Ukraine by a European country, Russia's defense ministry said. The ministry said that Russian sea-launched Kalibr missiles on Sunday destroyed four S-300 launchers which were concealed in a hangar on the outskirts of the Ukrainian city of Dnipro. Russia said 25 Ukrainian troops were hit in the attack. Russia did not say which European country had supplied the S-300 systems.

10:50 a.m. A senior U.S. official in Washington said Russia has appointed Gen. Alexander Dvornikov, one of its most-seasoned military chiefs, to oversee the invasion, The Associated Press reports. Dvornikov gained prominence as head of Russian forces deployed to Syria in 2015 to shore up President Bashar Assad's government during the country's devastating civil war. U.S. officials say he has a record of brutality against civilians in Syria and other war theaters.

9:41 a.m. Ramzan Kadyrov, head of Russia's republic of Chechnya, says there will be an offensive by Russian forces on the besieged port of Mariupol, Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities. ""There will be an offensive ... not only on Mariupol, but also on other places, cities and villages,"" Kadyrov said in a video posted on his Telegram channel. ""Luhansk and Donetsk -- we will fully liberate in the first place ... and then take Kyiv and all other cities."" He said, ""I assure you: Not one step will be taken back.""

5:00 a.m. Ukraine's economic output will likely contract by a staggering 45.1% this year as Russia's invasion has shuttered businesses, slashed exports and destroyed productive capacity, the World Bank said in a new assessment of the war's economic impacts. The World Bank also forecast Russia's 2022 GDP output to fall 11.2% due to punishing financial sanctions imposed by the United States and its Western allies on Russia's banks, state-owned enterprises and other institutions.

3:30 a.m. Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Monday, he said, adding he hoped to help build bridges between Russia and Ukraine and stop the ""war of aggression."" Nehammer's meeting would be the first face-to-face encounter between Putin and a European Union leader since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, triggering a broad Western effort to isolate Moscow.

""I'm going to meet Vladimir #Putin in Moscow tomorrow,"" Nehammer wrote on Twitter. ""We are militarily neutral, but (have) a clear position on the Russian war of aggression against #Ukraine,"" he wrote, referring to Austria's position. ""It must stop! It needs humanitarian corridors, ceasefire & full investigation of war crimes.""

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed to RIA news agency that Putin would be holding talks with Nehammer on Monday.

2:50 a.m. The death toll from a missile strike on the train station in Ukraine's Kramatorsk has risen to 57 people, Donetsk region governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said. Kyrylenko said 109 people were wounded in the attack, which Ukraine has blamed on Russia. Moscow has denied responsibility, saying the missile was Ukrainian.

Sunday, April 10

1:38 p.m. A new grave with dozens of civilian Ukrainians was found on Saturday in Buzova, a liberated village near the capital Kyiv that for weeks was occupied by Russian forces, a local official says. Taras Didych, head of the Dmytrivka community that includes Buzova and several other nearby villages, told Ukrainian television that the bodies were found in a ditch near a petrol station. The number of dead is yet to be confirmed. ""Now, we are returning to life, but during the occupation we had our 'hotspots', many civilians died,"" Didych said.

10:41 a.m. Ukraine has banned all imports from Russia, one of its key trading partners before the war with annual imports valued at about $6 billion, and called on other countries to follow and impose harsher economic sanctions on Moscow. ""Today we officially announced a complete termination of trade in goods with the aggressor state,"" Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko wrote on her Facebook page. ""From now on, no Russian Federation's products will be able to be imported into the territory of our state.""

6:11 a.m. The British Ministry of Defense says Russian forces are continuing to use improvised explosive devices to inflict casualties, lower morale and restrict Ukrainian freedom of movement, Reuters reports. ""Russian forces also continue to attack infrastructure targets with a high risk of collateral harm to civilians,"" the ministry says in a statement, citing intelligence reports. Russia's departure from northern Ukraine leaves evidence of the disproportionate targeting of non-combatants, the statement adds.

Saturday, April 9

11:40 p.m. The European Commission pledges 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) to support Ukraine and countries receiving refugees fleeing the war following Russia's invasion, Reuters reports. ""Six hundred million of those will go to Ukraine, to the Ukrainian authorities and partially to the United Nations,"" the president of the EU's executive branch, Ursula von der Leyen, says at a fundraising event for Ukraine in Warsaw, Poland. ""And 400 million euros will go to the frontline states that are doing such an outstanding job and helping the refugees that are coming.""

11:22 p.m. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson makes a surprise trip to Kyiv to meet Zelenskyy. ""Right now a visit of Boris Johnson in Kyiv started from one-on-one meeting with President Zelenskyy,"" Andriy Sybiha, deputy head of Ukraine's president office, said on Facebook.

Officials in the U.K. confirm the meeting, saying the two are discussing long-term support for Ukraine as well as further financial and military aid. Johnson's trip is ""in a show of solidarity with the Ukrainian people,"" a Downing Street spokesperson says.

""The U.K. will send more defensive weapons to Ukraine and will work with G-7 partners to target every pillar of the Russian economy to ensure Putin fails,"" Johnson tweeted earlier on Saturday.

11:10 p.m. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala says the country should cut its dependence on Russian energy resources within five years, calling the current situation one of the Czech Republic's ""greatest security risks."" The EU member meets its gas needs almost entirely through shipments directly or indirectly from Russia, and gets roughly half its crude imports from the same source. Fiala adds the country's energy sector has to change ""completely.""

9:59 p.m. European Union countries sharing borders with Russia and Belarus bar some cargo vehicles registered in the two countries from entering due to sanctions, the Russian customs service says, according to Reuters. Vehicles used as international transport that have Russian and Belarusian number plates will not be able to move goods on EU territory, the Russian customs service says. This comes after the EU on Friday formally adopted new sanctions against Russia, including bans on the import of coal, wood, chemicals and other products, while also preventing many Russian vessels and trucks from accessing the bloc.

3:31 p.m. S&P lowers Russia's foreign currency ratings to ""selective default"" on increased risks that Moscow will not be able and willing to honor its commitments to foreign debtholders. Facing waves of sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine, Russia could face its first sovereign external default in over a century after it made arrangements to make an international bond repayment in rubles this week, even though the payment was due in dollars.

11:50 a.m. Russia's justice ministry says it has revoked the registration of 15 foreign organizations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. The Russian units of the 15 organizations, which include the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, ""were excluded due to the discovery of violations of the current legislation of the Russian Federation,"" the ministry said in a statement on Friday.

The decision, which did not give details of any violations, was announced days after New York-based HRW said it had found ""several cases of Russian military forces committing laws-of-war violations"" in Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly denied war crimes allegations by Ukraine and Western countries during its six-week-long invasion of Ukraine and denies targeting civilians.

4:10 a.m. Germany is working to end imports of Russian oil and believes it may do so this year, Chancellor Olaf Scholz says in London during a news conference with U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

The European Union is studying ways to phase out its imports of Russian oil, according to EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. But ending German dependence on Russian natural gas poses a higher hurdle. No timeline has been set for such a transition.

The U.K. has announced plans to phase out imports of Russian coal and crude oil by the end of 2022, followed by gas imports at an early date.

3:17 a.m. The U.S. believes Russia used a short-range ballistic missile to strike a railway station in east Ukraine on Friday, a senior U.S. defense official says. Ukraine said at least 50 people were killed and many more wounded in the strike.

2:15 a.m. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen pledges to offer a speedier start to Ukraine's bid to become a member of the European Union. ""It will not as usual be a matter of years to form this opinion but I think a matter of weeks,"" she says.

1:45 a.m. Slovakia has donated its S-300 air defense system to Ukraine, Prime Minister Eduard Heger says.

12:30 a.m. The Czech Republic has delivered tanks, multiple rocket launchers, howitzers and infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine among military shipments that have reached hundreds of millions of dollars and will continue, reports Reuters, citing two Czech defense sources.

Friday, April 8

10:30 p.m. The ruble rallied after Russia's central bank cut its main interest rate in a surprise move. The cut, which follows new sanctions on Russia including a U.S. ban on crude oil imports, partly reverses an emergency rate hike in late February after the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

""Today's decision reflects a change in the balance of risks of accelerated consumer price growth, decline in economic activity and financial stability risks,"" the Central Bank of Russia says in a statement reported by Interfax.

8:50 p.m. Russian citizens are spending on average 40% of their disposable income on food, about double the amount from before Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, the director of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization's Russia liaison office tells Reuters. Russian government data shows annual food inflation hit 18.75% on April 1 as the economy reels from Western sanctions. The average European Union household spends about 12% of its income on food, the director says.

Meanwhile, global food prices have hit record levels in the wake of the Ukraine war, the latest FAO data shows.

6:00 p.m. More than 30 people were killed and over 100 were wounded in a Russian rocket strike on a railway station in eastern Ukraine on Friday as civilians tried to evacuate to safer parts of the country, the state railway company says. It said two Russian rockets struck a station in the city of Kramatorsk, which is used to evacuate civilians from areas under bombardment by Russian forces.

4:50 p.m. Japan's Foreign Ministry says it will expel a number of Russian diplomats stationed in the country in Tokyo's latest response to the civilian killings reported during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Eight Russians, including diplomats, will be expelled, it announced Friday. Japan has been cautious about expelling Russian diplomats up to now, but changed course as the U.S. and European countries have moved to punish Russia diplomatically. Tokyo's decision is likely to prompt Moscow to make tit-for-tat expulsions of Japanese diplomats from Russia.

3:30 p.m. India's central bank cuts its economic growth forecast for the fiscal year that started April 1 to 7.2%, from the 7.8% projected in February, citing the Russia-Ukraine war.

""Although India's direct trade exposure to countries at the epicenter of the conflict is limited, the war could potentially impede the economic recovery through elevated commodity prices and global spillover channels,"" Reserve Bank of India Gov. Shaktikanta Das says.

There are several other factors at work, he adds. ""Financial market volatility induced by monetary policy normalization in advanced economies, renewed COVID-19 infections in some major countries with augmented supply-side disruptions and protracted shortages of critical inputs, such as semiconductors and chips, pose downside risks to the outlook.""

3:18 p.m. Ukraine says it aims to establish up to 10 humanitarian corridors to evacuate trapped civilians on Friday, but civilians trying to flee the besieged southern city of Mariupol will have to use private vehicles. The 10 planned safe corridors announced by Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk were all in southern and eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian officials say Moscow plans to seize as much territory as it can in the eastern part of Ukraine known as Donbas bordering Russia.

11:00 a.m. The chairman of Russian aluminum giant Rusal calls for an impartial investigation into the killing of civilians in the Ukrainian town of Bucha, which he described as a crime, and urged an end to the ""fratricidal"" conflict. While the statement from Chairman Bernard Zonneveld, a Dutch national, did not touch on who was to blame for the deaths of civilians in the town, it is unusual for a large Russian company to comment publicly on the conflict. ""We support an objective and impartial investigation of this crime and call for severe punishment for the perpetrators,"" he said.

10:18 a.m. Japan will phase out Russian coal imports as part of its sanctions against Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine, Japan's industry minister says, joining other Group of Seven industrialized nations. Koichi Hagiuda told a regular news conference that Japan will gradually reduce the amount imported from Russia, and eventually break Japan's dependence on its coal, saying, ""We seek to stop importing in the end."" The move comes a day after G-7 foreign ministers vowed to ""expedite"" plans to end their energy dependence on Russia by phasing out and banning Russian coal imports to punish Moscow.

9:05 a.m. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says work has begun to dig through the rubble in Borodianka, a city northwest of Kyiv that was occupied by Russian military forces. He also said ""it is much scarier"" there, with even more victims of Russian troops.

As voting continues, the tally in the 100-member Senate was 65-0 in favor of removing Permanent Normal Trade Relations status.

5:00 a.m. The U.S. believes Russian forces have completely withdrawn from the area around Kyiv, a senior American official says.

The troops were pulling back to Belarus and Russia to regroup, the official says. They may join the fighting in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donbas, which Russia has designated the new focus of its ""special military operation"" -- what Moscow calls its invasion.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also says a small number of Ukrainians are receiving training in the U.S. to use tank-killing Switchblade drones. These Ukrainians are supposed to return to their country soon, the official says.

4:00 a.m. Chinese President Xi Jinping's personal alliance with Russian President Vladimir Putin is hampering China's diplomacy. That is becoming clearer as the war in Ukraine rages on.

Both men have laid the groundwork to stay in power until the middle of the 2030s. Both have territorial ambitions: reestablishing the former Soviet Union's sphere of influence for Putin, Taiwan for Xi. But the association comes with significant risk. Read more in this week's China Up Close.

2:00 a.m. One world leader willing to accept Russia's demand to pay for natural gas in rubles is Hungary's Victor Orban.

The Hungarian prime minister, whose right-wing ruling party won by a landslide in a parliamentary election Sunday, tells a news conference he has called on Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine immediately and says he is reconsidering his country's close ties with Moscow. Yet Orban says ""if the Russians request it, we will pay in rubles,"" the Financial Times reports.

Germany and other countries have rejected Putin's demand for payment in rubles, which Russia has yet to enforce.

2:10 a.m. New U.S. sanctions on Russia add the country's top bank, Sberbank, to the list of targets, as well as family members of Russia President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. These and other international responses to Russia's invasion of Ukraine are not lost on China, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman says.

""The strong and coordinated response from the international community, including nations in the Indo-Pacific, to Russia's flagrant violations on international law and principles like sovereignty and territorial integrity sends a strong signal that such actions will not go ignored,"" Sherman tells the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

The range of sanctions and ""unprecedented"" coordination between the U.S. and its partners give Chinese President Xi Jinping a ""good understanding of what might come his way should he in fact support Putin in any material fashion,"" Sherman says.

On support for U.S. partners, Republican Congressman Michael McCaul of Texas says: ""Putin's invasion of Russia shows us how critical it is to give our allies the weapons they need before an invasion and not after."" McCaul is preparing to introduce a bill that would create ""a security assistance program for Taiwan.""

Wednesday, April 6

8:00 p.m. Mere months ago Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was on the ropes. The lira had crashed and his unorthodox monetary policy was being ridiculed in financial markets.

But the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and its subsequent struggles on the battlefield, have led to a dramatic diplomatic turnaround for Turkey, which finds itself at the center of efforts to establish a cease-fire.

It stands in contrast to China and India, who have been criticized by the global community for sitting on the fence. Read more.

6:00 p.m. Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar says in parliament that New Delhi is ""deeply disturbed"" by the reports of civilians killed in Bucha. ""We strongly condemned the killings which have taken place there. This is an extremely serious matter, and we support the call for an independent investigation,"" he adds.

India, which has extensive defense dealings with Russia, has been reluctant to speak out against the invasion.

""If India has chosen a side, it is the side of peace and it is for an immediate end to violence,"" Jaishankar says.

5:37 p.m. Pope Francis condemns the ""massacre of Bucha,"" while holding up a Ukrainian flag sent to him from the town where hundreds of civilians were executed and mass graves have been found.

""Recent news from the war in Ukraine, instead of bringing relief and hope, brought new atrocities, such as the massacre of Bucha,"" he said during his weekly address. ""Cruelty that is increasingly horrendous, even against civilians, defenseless women and children. They are victims whose innocent blood cries out up to heaven and implores: 'Stop this war! Let the weapons fall silent! Stop sowing death and destruction.'""

The Kremlin said on Tuesday allegations that Russian forces committed war crimes by executing civilians in Bucha were a ""monstrous forgery"" aimed at denigrating its army.

11:18 a.m. U.S. chipmaker Intel says it has suspended operations in Russia, joining a slew of companies exiting the country following its invasion of Ukraine. The company, which last month suspended shipments to customers in Russia and Belarus, said it has implemented business continuity measures to minimize disruption to its global operations.

IBM, too, has suspended shipments, as Ukraine urged U.S. cloud-computing and software companies to cut off business with Russia. Servers from IBM, Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard top the market in Russia, where companies and government agencies have relied on technology developed by the West as the basis for their IT systems.

4:20 a.m. The U.S. and its Group of Seven and European Union allies on Wednesday will impose new sanctions against Russian banks and government officials and ban investment in Russia, a source familiar with the announcement tells Reuters.

3:00 a.m. NATO foreign ministers will meet with their counterparts from the Asia-Pacific this week, seeking to gain their cooperation in deepening the economic and diplomatic isolation of Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.

In light of reports of alleged war crimes by Russia in Ukraine, the ministers are expected to discuss their responses, including additional assistance to Kyiv.

""Targeting and murdering civilians is a war crime,"" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg tells reporters on Tuesday. Read more.

2:45 a.m. Asked whether the U.S. was providing military training to Ukrainians outside of Ukraine, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin says: ""To use some of the gear, certainly they have to have training, and we're doing that.""

Austin's comments come at a House Armed Services Committee hearing with Joint Chiefs of Staff Chair Gen. Mark Milley.

2:30 a.m. The United Nations has failed to function in the face of the worst war crimes since World War II, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has told the U.N. Security Council.

Tuesday, April 5

11:13 p.m. The Czech Republic has sent T-72 tanks and BVP-1 infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine, a Czech defense source tells Reuters.

10:00 p.m. The 30 NATO allies would welcome Finland and Sweden into the alliance if they decided to join, but any such move is up to the two nations, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg says.

5:52 p.m. Italy has expelled 30 Russian diplomats because of security concerns, according to Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio. Denmark says it will expel 15 Russian diplomats, in line with steps taken by other European Union countries, after reports of mass graves of civilians being found in Bucha.

5:30 p.m. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Ukraine has no option but to negotiate with Russia to end the fighting but that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin may not personally hold talks. ""All of us, including myself, will perceive even the possibility of negotiations as a challenge,"" Zelenskyy says in an interview with Ukrainian journalists broadcast on national television.

2:50 p.m. Ukrainian forces have retaken key northern terrain, forcing Russian forces to retreat from areas around the city of Chernihiv and north of the capital, Kyiv, British military intelligence says. Low-level fighting is likely to continue in some of the recaptured areas but reduce this week as the remainder of the Russian forces withdraw, the defense ministry said in a regular bulletin on Twitter. Many of the withdrawing Russian units are likely to require significant reequipping and refurbishment before they redeploy for operations in the country's east, the ministry added.

12:10 p.m. The U.S. has stopped the Russian government from paying holders of its sovereign debt totaling more than $600 million from reserves held at American banks. Under sanctions put in place after Russia invaded Ukraine, foreign currency reserves held by the Russian central bank at U.S. financial institutions were frozen. But the Treasury Department had been allowing Moscow to use those funds to make coupon payments on dollar-denominated sovereign debt on a case-by-case basis.

11:54 a.m. Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi returns home from Poland, bringing 20 evacuees from Ukraine in a show of Tokyo's latest support for the war-torn nation and neighboring countries. The 20 people who boarded a Japanese government plane in Warsaw had hoped to travel to Japan but had been unable to secure their own transportation, according to Hayashi.

9:56 a.m. Russia will respond proportionately to the expulsion of its diplomats from a number of Western countries, says Dmitry Medvedev, former Russian president and current deputy secretary of the country's Security Council.

""You saw what happened in Bucha,"" Biden tells reporters at the White House, referring to the discovery of a mass grave and tied bodies shot at close range. ""This warrants him -- he is a war criminal."" The Kremlin denies any accusations related to the murder of civilians, including in Bucha.

12:30 a.m. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says it will be more difficult for Ukraine to negotiate with Russia after the scale of atrocities carried out by Russian troops in occupied territories has become known. The Ukrainian leader speaks on national television from the town of Bucha in the Kyiv region, where tied bodies shot at close range, a mass grave and other signs of executions have been found in territory retaken from Russian troops.

8:28 p.m. France faces a repeat of the 2017 presidential election showdown between Emmanuel Macron and far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, with Macron still favored but in a much tighter race as his lead narrows, opinion polls show ahead of the first round of voting on Sunday.

Five years ago, Macron beat Le Pen with 66.1% of the vote in the runoff, with voters of all stripes rallying behind the centrist. But the latest poll forecasts just a 53%-47% margin of victory for President Macron.

12:05 p.m. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made a surprise video appearance at the music industry's star-studded Grammy Awards celebration in Las Vegas and appealed to viewers to support his country ""in any way you can.""

Support us in any way you can. Any, but not silence."" He added, ""Our musicians wear body armor instead of tuxedos, they sing to the wounded, in hospitals, even to those who can't hear them, but the music will break through.""

10:10 a.m. Oil prices extend losses Monday as investors eye the release of supplies from strategic reserves from consuming nations, while a truce in Yemen could ease supply disruption concerns in the Middle East. Brent crude futures fell 79 cents, or 0.8%, to $103.60 a barrel by 0037 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was at $98.45 a barrel, down 82 cents, or 0.8%.

8:00 a.m. Hungary's nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban scored a fourth consecutive landslide win in Sunday's election, as voters endorsed his ambition for a conservative, ""illiberal"" state and shrugged off concerns over Budapest's close ties with Moscow. Russia's invasion of Ukraine had appeared to upend Orban's campaign, forcing him into awkward maneuvering to explain decade-old cozy business relations with President Vladimir Putin. But he mounted a successful campaign to persuade his Fidesz party's core electorate that the six-party opposition alliance of Peter Marki-Zay promising to mend ties with the European Union could lead the country into war, an accusation the opposition denied.

5:50 a.m. Pope Francis pays tribute to journalists killed during the Ukraine war, saying he hoped God would reward them for serving the common good whatever side they were on. At least six journalists have died since Russian forces invaded Ukraine in late February.

12:28 a.m. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba accuses Russian forces of carrying out a ""massacre"" in the town of Bucha as images of corpses in civilian clothes left behind by departing Russian troops prompt calls from officials in Ukraine and Europe for tougher sanctions on Russia.

Russia's Defense Ministry denies the allegations, calling footage and photographs showing dead bodies in the town near Ukraine's capital ""another staged performance by the Kyiv regime for the Western media.""

Sunday, April 3

11:26 p.m. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken tells CNN the images of dead Ukrainian civilians found in Bucha after Russian troops left are a ""punch in the gut"" and that those responsible for any war crimes must be held accountable. Ukrainian forces had moved into the town near Kyiv and found what officials and witnesses say were the bodies of nearly 300 civilians killed by Russian troops.

Blinken would not confirm reports that the U.S. is facilitating the transfers of Soviet-era tanks to Ukrainian forces from eastern European allies, but says that there ""are or will soon be in Ukraine more than 10 anti-tank systems for every Russian tank.""

9:44 p.m. Bucha Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk shows journalists dead bodies in an area he says Chechen fighters controlled during the month that Russian forces occupied the Ukrainian city on the northern outskirts of Kyiv. One corpse appeared to have his hands bound by white cloth, and to have been shot in the mouth.

""The Russians have demonstrated that they were consciously killing civilians,"" Fedoruk alleges.

Reuters, which was taken to the scene by Ukrainian authorities, was not immediately able to verify the mayor's allegations. Russia's Defense Ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Chechnya is a region in southern Russia that has deployed troops to Ukraine to support Russian forces.

8:10 p.m. A leading rights group says it documented ""apparent war crimes"" committed by Russian military forces against civilians in Ukraine. Human Rights Watch says it found ""several cases of Russian military forces committing laws-of-war violations"" in Russian-controlled regions such as Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Kyiv.

7:16 p.m. Ukrainian grain exports in March were four times less than February levels, due to the Russian invasion, the economy ministry says.

7:00 p.m. Allegations of attacks against civilians during Russia's invasion of Ukraine must be investigated as war crimes, British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss says, adding that the U.K. will fully support any such move by the International Criminal Court.

""As Russian troops are forced into retreat, we are seeing increasing evidence of appalling acts by the invading forces in towns such as Irpin and Bucha,"" Truss says in a statement, referring to places near Kyiv. ""Their indiscriminate attacks against innocent civilians during Russia's illegal and unjustified invasion of Ukraine must be investigated as war crimes.""

2:15 p.m. Russian naval forces continue to blockade the Ukrainian coast on the Black Sea and Sea of Azov, preventing resupply by sea, British military intelligence says.

1:00 p.m. Missiles struck Ukraine's southern port city of Odessa in the early hours of Sunday, the city council says in an online post. One of the city's ""critical infrastructure facilities"" was hit, regional administration spokesperson Sergey Bratchuk tells Ukraine's public broadcaster.

6:29 a.m. Russian forces want to seize east and south Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says in a late night address, adding Western nations had not provided enough anti-missile systems in their aid.

4:27 a.m. Ukrainian military reports Russia is sending soldiers to Moldova's breakaway region of Transnistria, where they were preparing to launch ""provocations"" along the border, near Odessa, the Financial Times reports.

Russian troops already in Transnistria were preparing for ""a demonstration of readiness for the offensive and, possibly, hostilities against Ukraine,"" says the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

Moldova's Foreign Ministry says it is unaware of a troop buildup while officials in Transnistria deny the reports as ""completely untrue.""

We had thought that invasions of other countries, savage street fighting and atomic threats were grim memories of a distant past,"" the pope says in an address to Maltese officials after arriving on the Mediterranean island nation for a two-day visit.

""However, the icy winds of war, which bring only death, destruction and hatred in their wake, have swept down powerfully upon the lives of many people and affected us all.""

3:00 p.m. Ukrainian troops continue to advance against withdrawing Russian forces in the vicinity of Kyiv, British military intelligence says.

Speaking to a group of Russian journalists via video call, Zelenskyy says the invasion caused the destruction of Russian-speaking cities in Ukraine and says the damage exceeded that from the Russian wars in Chechnya.

1:51 a.m. Russia's communications watchdog tells Russian media not to report on an interview done with Zelenskyy and says it has started a probe into the outlets that had interviewed him.

In a short statement distributed by the watchdog on social media and posted on its website, it says a host of Russian outlets had done an interview with Zelenskyy.

""Roskomnadzor warns the Russian media about the necessity of refraining from publishing this interview,"" it says. It does not give a reason for its warning.

9:30 p.m. The U.S. has no strategy of regime change for Russia, Secretary of State Antony Blinken tells reporters in Jerusalem. ""I think the president, the White House, made the point last night that, quite simply, President [Vladimir] Putin cannot be empowered to wage war or engage in aggression against Ukraine or anyone else,"" Blinken says.

""As you know, and as you've heard us say repeatedly, we do not have a strategy of regime change in Russia -- or anywhere else, for that matter,"" he adds. ""In this case, as in any case, it's up to the people of the country in question. It's up to the Russian people.""

3:37 p.m. Ukraine and Russia have agreed on two ""humanitarian corridors"" to evacuate civilians from front-line areas on Sunday local time, including allowing people to leave by private car from the southern city of Mariupol, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk says.

3:52 a.m. U.S. President Joe Biden says in Poland that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""cannot remain in power"" in a comment soon walked back by a White House official. ""The president's point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region,"" the official says. ""He was not discussing Putin's power in Russia, or regime change.""

Biden's comments, including an earlier one in which he called Putin a ""butcher,"" mark a sharp verbal escalation in the American approach to Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.

Saturday, March 26

8:56 p.m. Ukraine received additional security pledges from the United States on developing defense cooperation, its Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba says. ""We did receive additional promises from the United States on how our defense cooperation will evolve,"" Kuleba tells reporters.

7:06 p.m. More than 100,000 people still need to be evacuated from the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol, Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk says on national television.

6:53 p.m. Ukraine's Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov says that he and Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba had held a joint meeting with their U.S. counterparts for the first time. ""We discuss current issues & cooperation in political and defense directions between Ukraine and the United States,"" Reznikov says on Twitter, posting a photograph of the meeting in Warsaw with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.

5:54 p.m. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu was seen chairing an army meeting and discussing weapons supplies in a video posted by his ministry, the first time he had publicly been shown speaking for more than two weeks. In the video, uploaded on social media, Shoigu said he had discussed issues related to the military budget and defense orders with the finance ministry.

5:25 p.m. Russian forces have taken control of the town of Slavutych, where workers at the defunct Chernobyl nuclear plant live, the governor of the Kyiv region Oleksandr Pavlyuk says. In an online statement, Pavlyuk says Russian troops had occupied the hospital in Slavutych and kidnapped the mayor.

3:46 p.m. The war in Ukraine has killed 136 children in the 31 days since the start of the Russian invasion, Ukraine's office of the prosecutor-general said on Saturday in a message on the Telegram app. Of the total, 64 children have been killed in the Kyiv region, the office said. A further 50 children have died in the Donetsk region, it said. Additionally, 199 children have been wounded.

Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine will not cede territory in the Russian-occupied Donbas region in any attempt to reach a peace agreement.

The Ukrainian president, speaking to CNN, said that doing so would leave open the possibility of Russia using the territory to launch another attack aimed at seizing Kyiv.

Meanwhile, Russia has threatened to “destroy” Ukrainian troops in the besieged Black Sea port city Mariupol if they do not surrender.

About 2,500 Ukrainian fighters are hiding out at a steel plant in Mariupol that has a network of underground tunnels, Russia’s military estimates.

“All those who will continue resistance will be destroyed,” Igor Konashenkov, the Russian defense ministry’s spokesman, said – adding that those who surrender were “guaranteed to keep their lives”.

Russia had given Ukrainian troops a deadline of 3am GMT to surrender, but they continue to defy the demand – Ukraine’s deputy PM Denys Shmyhal said.

The capture of Mariupol would give Vladimir Putin’s forces an advantage after the troops failed to seize Kyiv during the seven weeks so far of the ongoing invasion.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russia-ukraine-war-train-station-putin-latest-b2053922.html?

It was renamed later. Back in autumn 1989, I went out to the Black Sea Fleet base in Sevastopol and visited and walked in and around that cruiser, advancing the Malta summit. The ship was the pride of the Soviet fleet. At Malta, Mikhail Gorbachev used the Slava as his base ship. There was originally some thought that one or another meeting might have been held onboard the Slava if weather had not made that too difficult. I recall a point, on the ship, when President George H. W. Bush's communications adviser Sig Rogich was speculating about where to put the photo-op, and I cautioned him that his preferred spot was on top of the ship’s main missile tubes. Notably, the ship that hosted FDR and Winston Churchill for the Atlantic Charter meeting in August 1941 was also ill-fated: The Prince of Wales was sunk by the Japanese on December 10, 1941

April 15, 2022 THE LESSONS OF UKRAINE FOR TAIWAN—AND THE U.S. Miller Center Senior Fellow Eric Edelman writes in The Bulwark that the policy of 'strategic ambiguity' over Taiwan's defense is played out Although Ukraine’s potential membership in NATO has been discussed for more than a decade and half, it is not a member—and so the alliance is not committed to defend it, nor to attempt to deter attacks against it. (Indeed, a vote over whether to deter an attack against Ukraine would likely have splintered the alliance.) Vladimir Putin took full advantage of Ukraine’s living in this gray zone where its frequently voiced aspirations for NATO membership are not matched by a security guarantee. Still, after Russia’s invasion began, NATO’s guilty conscience prompted decisions to funnel arms and equipment into the beleaguered country; the Western anti-tank and anti-aircraft systems reinforced and enhanced the ability of Ukrainian defenders to wreak enormous damage on the Russian aggressor, rendering combat ineffective some 15 to 20 percent, if not more, of the Russian battalion tactical groups devoted to the operation. Today, despite the Ukrainians’ various successes against the invaders and despite Russia’s apparent withdrawal from the environs of Kyiv and northwestern Ukraine, the country’s situation remains parlous. There are many lessons for Americans to draw from all this. And there are lessons, too, for Xi Jinping and his colleagues among China’s top leadership. For starters, the United States does not have a formal treaty commitment to Taiwan’s defense, à la NATO’s famous Article 5. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, this presents the Biden administration, as well as other Republican and Democratic leaders who profess to care about security in Northeast Asia, with a clear choice: If the United States is prepared to see Taiwan conquered by the People’s Liberation Army, the United States should retain its current policy. If, however, we are not prepared to see a thriving, prosperous democratic society swallowed up by a brutal autocratic regime led by messianic zealot, there are a series of steps the United States must take—and soon.

April 8, 2022 FRICTION, FRAMING, AND U.S. CYBERSECURITY-RELATED ACTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA The U.S. is making life more difficult for Russian cyber actors, writes Miller Center Senior Fellow Kristen Eichensehr in Just Security On Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that it had “disrupt[ed] a two-tiered global botnet of thousands of infected network hardware devices under the control of a threat actor known to security researchers as Sandworm,” and identified by the U.S. government as “the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (the GRU).” This action is the latest in what appears to be a string of public moves to impose additional friction on malicious Russian actors in cyberspace since the invasion of Ukraine, and it’s also emblematic of the efforts by the United States over the last few months to shift the framing of some cybersecurity threats from purely criminal matters to national security concerns. Some hints have emerged about what the United States may be doing to help Ukraine on cybersecurity. In congressional testimony last month, National Security Agency Director and Commander of Cyber Command Gen. Paul Nakasone said, “We had ‘hunt forward’ teams from U.S. Cyber Command in Kyiv. We worked very, very closely with a series of partners at NSA and the private sector to be able to provide that information.” He noted the engagement had been long-standing in saying, “We’ve worked very, very hard with Ukraine over the past several years.” And in testimony earlier this week, he explained that “a series of assumptions” the Russians “may have made,” “coupled with the defensive capabilities” the United States has built with Ukraine have contributed to the relative lack of significant successful cyber operations against Ukraine in recent weeks.

April 5, 2022 THE WAR AND THE POPULIST INTERNATIONAL Miller Center Senior Fellow John M. Owen IV notes that the West will remain divided over Russia's invasion of Ukraine Wars often unsettle and reconfigure politics within and among other countries. This one, so far, has strengthened pro-NATO sentiment and policy in Europe and weakened the populism that has divided the West. But the policies of Hungary’s government and its landslide reelection this past Sunday ensure that the West will remain divided, and that in turn could inhibit NATO and the EU from responding to Russia more vigorously. In most European countries, Russia’s aggression in Ukraine has empowered the Atlanticists. Germany, Europe’s largest economy, has decisively shifted from engaging and accommodating Russia to opposing it, pledging to increase its military budget by at least 50 percent. Neutrals Finland and Sweden are considering joining NATO. But less reported in the United States has been the confusion, division, and weakening of pro-Russian opinion and skepticism about NATO and the European Union – a skepticism that had congealed in recent years into what we can call the ""Populist International."" The Populist International is a set of politicians, parties, journalists, and intellectuals who reject modern liberalism and all its works. Convinced that a conspiracy of elites in the corporate world, government, foundations, and universities is patiently building what Francis Fukuyama years ago called the “universal and homogeneous state,” populists labor to save national sovereignty and tradition and to restore power to what they regard as the “real people” of their countries. Active in most countries in Europe and North America, the International is especially powerful in the countries that were once part of the Soviet bloc. In recent years, Vladimir Putin has fed the Populist International and successfully presented Russia as its champion. A loose transnational coalition has formed, with Putin supplying rhetorical aid, particularly via a host of social media trolls, and sometimes money as well. His most prominent ally in Europe is Hungary’s Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, who has attracted a wide following for his defiance of the cosmopolitanism of the European Union (of which Hungary is a member). Poland, a much larger country, has been a member of the Populist International in good standing, although it has never cottoned to Russia. Tiny Slovenia had recently joined the club. Governments of these countries have backslid to varying degrees from modern liberal democracy by, for example, court-packing or increasing their control over the news media. And they were starting to form a kind of bloc that stood together against the more liberal policies of the EU; some also voiced resentment against the United States. All in all, Putin was using the Populist International to divide the West and erode American influence in Europe. Then came the 24th of February. Although most Europeans across the political spectrum were shocked that Russia actually invaded Ukraine, the right-populists of Europe were especially on the back foot. Virtually all have condemned the invasion and its supposedly anachronistic brutality. But there the unity among the populists ends. NATO is sending most of its war matériel into Ukraine through Poland, and Poland appears determined to use all means at its disposal to defeat Russia, short of joining the war. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki recently compared Putin to the genocidal Pol Pot of Cambodia. Slovenia’s Prime Minister, Janez Janša, has struck a similar pose. These two leaders, along with their counterpart from the Czech Republic, bravely (and very publicly) visited Kyiv on March 15 to offer encouragement to Ukraine’s Churchillian President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Russia has lost some of its most useful tools in the West. But not Orbán’s Hungary. It has refused to send weaponry through its 85-mile border with Ukraine. It is blocking moves in the EU to ban imports of Russian gas. Orbán has refused to condemn Putin. The Poles and Slovenians have condemned Hungary’s equivocation. Most bitter has been the comment of the Czech defense minister: “Hungarian politicians now find cheap Russian oil more important than Ukrainian blood.” In his recent reelection campaign, Orbán stressed that he would not allow Hungary to be dragged into war with Russia. Although we cannot be certain why Hungarians voted as they did, the message evidently resonated. Sunday’s crushing election victory for Orbán’s Fidesz Party gives it four more years in power. Hungary could use its leverage to block NATO and the EU from imposing harsher punishment on Russia. Putin’s war has shrunk the anti-liberal side of Europe’s ideological divide, but it has made that divide sharper and more consequential for Ukraine and, perhaps, for the future of the liberal international order.

March 31, 2022 WHY DEMOCRACIES WIN MORE WARS THAN AUTOCRACIES Miller Center Senior Fellow Allan Stam writes in The Washington Post that, like Putin, dictators tend to start risky wars From President Biden to the U.S. media, almost everyone frames the war in Ukraine as a battle between democracy and autocracy. Are democracies equipped to prevail, some wonder? With slow decision-making, volunteer armies and polarized public opinion, democracies might seem at a disadvantage. Questions about the security capabilities of democracies resonate beyond the crisis in Ukraine. Whether democracies can successfully fight speaks to the ability of South Korea to fend off North Korea, of Israel to survive in its hostile environment and of the United States to compete with China in the 2020s and beyond. Our research suggests democracies are well-equipped to win in fights against autocracies. The unfolding war in Ukraine suggests autocracies enjoy few advantages on the battlefield. Ukraine is faring far better against Russia than many had projected. In four weeks, Russia has reportedly experienced 7,000 to 15,000 combat fatalities. The United States suffered around 7,000 deaths across two decades of conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan. Russia has also reportedly lost more than 1,500 military vehicles to Ukrainians armed with U.S. and British antitank weapons. What’s happening in Ukraine isn’t an outlier but part of a broader pattern. Warfare is one of many areas in which democracies regularly outperform autocracies. Indeed, our research finds that democracies have won their wars at higher rates than autocracies over the last two centuries. READ MORE

March 29, 2022 PUTIN IS DISCOVERING THAT OVERWHELMING MILITARY POWER CAN BE A CURSE Senior Fellow Todd Sechser writes in The Washington Post that small countries can inflict serious damage on invading superpowers Consider the following scenario: Authoritarian Russia invades a small, democratic neighbor. Western democracies express support for the targeted nation but decline to send troops. The Russian army gains ground. Cities are bombed. The smaller country is outnumbered and outmatched. Few expect the war to last long. But the invasion prompts a fierce resistance. The defenders know and use their terrain, and they deploy inventive tactics to exploit weaknesses in the Russian army. Thousands of Russian soldiers are killed, and the war grinds to a stalemate. Ukraine in 2022? Yes — and also Finland in 1939. More than 82 years ago, Joseph Stalin invaded Finland, aiming to capture territory and replace Finland’s democratic government with a puppet Communist regime. Then, as now, the war followed an unsuccessful Russian campaign of threats and coercion. And then, as now, the war did not go as planned for the invaders. The outgunned Finnish army mounted a determined defense of their nation, surprising even themselves — and embarrassing the Red Army. READ MORE

March 29, 2022 WHAT IS A WAR CRIME? UVA Law School Professor Thomas Nachbar tells UVA Today that defining a war crime is complicated The U.S. government alleged last week that members of the Russian armed forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine. But what exactly does that mean? University of Virginia law professor Thomas Nachbar has written on war crimes and is a judge advocate in the U.S. Army Reserve who, among other assignments, served in Iraq during the fight against ISIS. Though he’s not privy to White House intelligence, Nachbar can lean on experience to try to sniff out meaning behind statements such as the one Secretary of State Anthony Blinken delivered Wednesday. Blinken’s statement accuses Russia President Vladimir Putin of “unrelenting violence that has caused death and destruction across Ukraine” and includes references to specific attacks, such as the deadly Mariupol maternity hospital bombing on March 9. The statement also notes that, as of March 22, more than 2,400 Mariupol civilians have been killed in that city. Defining “war crime” is complicated, Nachbar said. “If you actually want to figure out if an act is a war crime, that’s a technical inquiry,” he said. “When people say, ‘They’re committing war crimes,’ the first thing I do is ask, ‘What are you talking about?’ Because that term gets used rhetorically, and there are many different kinds of war crimes, from targeting civilians to mistreating prisoners of war.” READ MORE

March 28, 2022 THE NAVAL WAR FOR UKRAINE Miller Center Senior Fellow Allan Stam notes that there's been little attention paid to what's happening in the Black Sea The naval war for Ukraine has received relatively little attention in the open press. Exceptions include the now-debunked story on the Snake Island Defenders and occasional reports of Russian ships shelling the Black Sea coast. The lion’s share of analysis focuses on the Russian Army’s stalled campaign in northern Ukraine. This likely reflects two factors: the greater risk for western journalists who might otherwise choose to work in the country’s eastern region and the apparent desire of the mainstream media to highlight good news and human rights violations rather than Ukrainian military losses. The lack of naval-focused media coverage results from the greater difficulty of providing news coverage at sea and the relative lack of hopeful news about the Ukrainian Navy. Identifying and tracking Russian warships at sea is a challenging assignment. TikTok and Twitter do not have the same reach off the coast of Crimea as they do in Kyiv. Lack of coverage, however, does not mean a lack of importance. Just as the scale of the land war aspect has exceeded early expectations, so too has the naval front. In an operation reminiscent of Russia’s deployment of its Black Sea Fleet to the Far East during the Russo-Japanese War, warships from all four of Russia’s geographic fleets converged on the Eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea in late January 2022. They likely did so to execute the traditional naval roles of power projection and sea control. The Russian Navy’s critical tasks supporting Putin’s strategic objectives include resupply of ground troops, precision fires to support military operations in littoral locations and deep within Ukraine, and maintaining sea control of the maritime passage of all concerned parties.

March 27, 2022 'CHINA IS BEING HURT BY THE CRISIS' Miller Center Senior Fellow Brantly Womack tells the Gulan News Service that China is currently in a fragile economic and political situation Q: It has been said that there are two options the Russia has to choose between them, either to be an ally for the west, or a vassal for China, do you agree with that, and do believe that china will take advantage of the situation( Russia- Ukraine war) to work in this direction? Womack: President Putin has made a major blunder that is tragic for Russia as well as for the Ukraine. However, Russia is a big country with lots of resources and a high opinion of itself. It does not need a patron. Q: Do you envisage any positive and constructive role for China to play to end the invasion or mediate between the warring parties? Womack: China should certainly make every effort to help end the conflict. It has strong relations with all parties so perhaps it can make a contribution in mediation. More importantly in the longer run, China could make a major contribution to the rebuilding of Ukraine. Q: Or you expect that China will work to lessen the impact of the sanctions imposed on Russia and help that country militarily? Womack: China is being hurt by the crisis. It would be foolish to do anything that would prolong or exacerbate the conflict. While it is conceivable that China might try to keep Russia from being cornered, because Russia might be more dangerous if cornered, it will not be an accessory to the conflict. READ MORE

March 26, 2022 UKRAINIANS ARE DYING FOR DEMOCRACY. IN AMERICA, REPUBLICANS WON'T STAND UP TO TRUMP. Miller Center Senior Fellow John Bridgeland writes in USA Today that too many of our policymakers are not willing to risk the ire of their base to defend our system The contrast now between Ukraine and the United States is striking, but in an unexpected way – in the defense of democracy. The world is seeing the bravery of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian people, who are willing to die to defend their democracy and freedom. When offered a flight out of the country, President Zelenskyy and his family chose to stay. As Russian tanks roll into Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities, Ukrainians are using their bodies to stop them, making Molotov cocktails to defend their cities and building barricades with whatever they can assemble to repel the attacks. No cost is too high to defend their democracy and beloved Ukraine. Ironically, the threat to democracy in America is coming from our own. When America was confronted by an insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021, incited by a president who was trying to overturn an election, the majority of Republican senators and members of Congress cowered and failed to check President Donald Trump’s power.

March 24, 2022 BIDEN HEADED TO THE EPICENTER OF THE UKRAINIAN REFUGEE CRISIS: POLAND Senior Fellow Stephen D. Mull, a former U.S. ambassador to Poland, tells The Washington Post that there may be limits to the Poles' generosity As in the United States and many parts of Europe, immigration can be a fraught topic in Poland and a public backlash against the refugees could make a bad situation worse. In fact, “the current government in Poland, which came to power in 2015, did so by their exploitation of popular fears that Poland might become a massive waypoint for refugees coming from the Middle East,” former U.S. ambassador to Poland Stephen D. Mull told The Daily 202. Mull is now Vice Provost for Global Affairs at the University of Virginia. So in the very recent past, refugees have been politically weaponized in Poland. But that’s not the case with the Ukrainian refugees, Mull said. READ MORE

March 24, 2022 COULD RUSSIA AND UKRAINE BE READY FOR REAL NEGOTIATIONS? UVA Russia expert Allen Lynch talks with Russian TV Channel 24 about prospects to end Russia's assault Once wars are underway, they tend to continue until the certain costs of continuing the war are seen as clearly much higher than the uncertain benefits of compromises to bring about peace. One or both sides have to believe that a politically meaningful military victory is impossible. Unfortunately, this usually means that all military options have to be exhausted before a real negotiation begins. Three examples from the cold war come to mind: (1) In 1986, Gorbachev gave the Soviet military one year to find a military solution in Afghanistan. When that failed, as he likely expected, he began negotiations to end the war. That took two years. (2) During the Korean War, by April 1951, after 10 months of bitter fighting, the military line stabilized at roughly the 38th Parallel, where the war began; neither side could do much to move the line significantly. Negotiations then began in earnest but it took two years to reach an armistice. (3) By December 1965, U.S. Defense Secretary Robert McNamara privately concluded that the U.S. could not win the war in Vietnam, but he continued in that office for two more years as the U.S. kept escalating, until by early 1968, the domestic political costs of continuing the war became too high. A provisional peace settlement was not reached until January, 1973. While this is a gloomy vision, perhaps it underscores the costs of delay in moving toward peace and relying unduly upon military instruments in advancing one’s security. READ MORE

March 22, 2022 CHINA'S NEW STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITY IN EUROPE Miller Center Senior Fellow Brantly Womack writes that China has reasons not to side with either party in the conflict President Vladimir Putin’s historic blunder in Ukraine has created a crisis in Europe that is costly for China but at the same time opens for it an opportunity for a new role in global politics. The costs are real and will continue to grow as long as the Russian invasion and occupation of Ukraine continues. China’s tactical opportunity to contribute to mediation creates a strategic opportunity to move beyond the strategy of peaceful rise in a given international environment to one of providing key coordination in a post-hegemonic world. In 2002, then-President Jiang Zemin announced that China was facing a “strategic opportunity” brought about by multipolarisation and globalisation, an opportunity that would last for twenty years. China made good use of said opportunity, more than doubling its share of the global economy. But the 20-year window to which Jiang pointed also proved prescient. Both multipolarisation and globalisation appeared to be fading fast, and Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has closed that strategic opportunity. While China has vigorously criticised the “Cold War mentality” of the United States, Putin has returned Europe to familiar battle lines and battle cries. The crisis will cost China dearly. More importantly, China has a vital interest in avoiding the slipping of Russia and Europe back into a Cold War configuration. However, China has reasons not to side with either party in the conflict. China cannot support Russia’s military invasion of a sovereign state or the response of comprehensive sanctions. Thus, China is interested in mediation, and its ties to both sides encourage that role. Moreover, successful involvement in resolving the crisis could position China well for a new strategic opportunity in a post-crisis environment. READ MORE

March 21, 2022 WHERE DOES THE UKRAINE WAR GO FROM HERE? UVA experts on war and terrorism assessed escalation scenarios during this Miller Center event

March 21, 2022 IS THE WAR IN UKRAINE THE FAULT OF THE WEST? Miller Center Senior Fellow John M. Owen IV argues that many analysts are misdiagnosing what caused Putin to invade Ukraine A thesis is ricocheting around the world that the Russian war on Ukraine is really the fault of the United States and the West. I don’t mean the fable propagated by Russia that Ukraine is ruled by Nazis doing the bidding of the Americans. I mean the more measured, academically respectable claim that in attacking Ukraine, Russia is really only reacting to a sustained and misbegotten policy by the Western countries since the 1990s: the eastward expansion of NATO. The chief proponent of the “blame the West” thesis is John Mearsheimer, an A-list international relations scholar at the University of Chicago and the high priest of the school of thought called realism. Mearsheimer’s 2014 Foreign Affairs article “Why Ukraine Is the West’s Fault,” which followed hard on Russia’s annexation of Crimea, is enjoying countless hits. His video lecture of a similar title has nearly 22 million views as of this writing. In late January, Mearsheimer’s fellow A-lister, Harvard’s Stephen Walt, blamed the crisis on Western “hubris, wishful thinking, and liberal idealism.” (Full disclosure: Walt taught me in a graduate seminar many years ago, and both scholars are long-time mentors of mine.) Although Putin’s invasion of Ukraine certainly is a reaction to NATO expansion, it won’t do to say that the war is therefore the West’s fault. The flaw in the thinking of Mearsheimer, Walt, and other academic realists is that they present an inconsistent view of how international relations works. Mearsheimer, for example, is no more entitled to say that the West caused the war by expanding NATO than he is to say that Russia caused the West to expand NATO by being weak. A fuller explanation for the war takes into account the ideological differences between authoritarian Russia and the democratic West. The argument of Walt, Mearsheimer, and many other academics goes like this: Geography makes Russia permanently vulnerable to invasion from the west, and indeed Western powers often have invaded it – most famously in 1812, when Napoleon’s armies made it to Moscow, and 1941, when Hitler’s troops ravaged vast territories and besieged Leningrad (now St. Petersburg). Today, the United States, at the head of NATO, is the threat. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, NATO has taken in 14 members, all either former Soviet allies or republics within the Soviet Union itself: Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary in 1999; Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, and Slovenia in 2004; Croatia and Albania in 2009; Montenegro in 2017; and North Macedonia in 2020. And in 2008, then-President George W. Bush announced his “strong support” for membership for two more former Soviet republics: Georgia and, yes, Ukraine. In 2014, a revolution ousted Ukraine’s pro-Russian government and installed a pro-Western one in its place. All during these years, Russia has repeatedly and consistently warned that it would regard Ukraine’s membership in NATO as a dire threat to its security. Its 2014 invasion and annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region made clear that Russia was not bluffing. READ MORE

March 18, 2022 AMERICAN ECONOMIC POWER OVER RUSSIA Miller Center Research Fellow Scott Miller explores the long-term financial implications of the war in Ukraine Over the past month, the United States and its Western allies have levied unprecedented sanctions on the Russian financial system. Excluding Russian banks from the SWIFT messaging system, freezing assets of Russian individuals and institutions, discouraging Western firms from doing business in Russia, and preventing the Bank of Russia from accessing hundreds of billions of dollars in reserves represent a remarkable display of financial power. Yet Western nations must think long and hard about the strategic implications of this demonstration of economic might. American policymakers must concentrate on how they replenish and solidify their financial powerbase in the medium- and long-term while using it to combat Russia’s challenge to the rules-based global order. It is understandable to focus on the rapid-fire events in Ukraine. However, wars are won over years, decades, and centuries. We must remain awake to the fact that American financial and economic power undergirds every element of American military and diplomatic prowess. If the world decides that America cannot or should not be trusted to anchor the global financial system, the liberal order of the post-WWII era will collapse very quickly. If the world decides that America cannot or should not be trusted to anchor the global financial system, the liberal order of the post-WWII era will collapse very quickly Recent years have seen an uptick in challenges to American financial dominance. Numerous countries have proposed replacing the dollar as the global reserve currency with a basket of currencies, possibly underwritten by the World Bank or IMF. China has begun building an interbank messaging system to rival SWIFT. That network remains small but is growing. Fossil fuel–producing nations have introduced the ""petrodollar"" to facilitate energy purchases outside the reach of the U.S. Treasury. Many cryptocurrencies are expressly designed to evade American regulations. None of these by themselves will founder America’s role in global finance. Yet American policymakers should be aware how Western sanctions on Russia could supercharge competitors. The creation of this challenge will take time. But once begun in earnest, it will be difficult to stop. To be very clear, I believe that the West has a moral duty to mobilize and consider using every resource at its disposal to push back against Russia’s unprovoked and brutal invasion of Ukraine. That said, if we believe that both the United States and the world benefits from American economic and financial hegemony, we must keep a clear eye on how to win both the tactical and broader strategic engagements. Much of that begins at home. We must convince the world that it still benefits from granting American institutions such power over global finance and trade. Domestic political stability is a large part of that. American commitment to democracy and the rule of law must be strong. This also means that the United States must do everything necessary to hold together the global economic system that makes its sanctions effective—including underwriting a trade regime that benefits not just developed nations, but the developing economies into which China is making significant investments. India is another vital part of this puzzle. The United States must convince India that it is a more reliable long-term partner than its northern neighbor. We must be judicious and strategic in how we deploy American financial muscle It also means being judicious and strategic in how we deploy American financial muscle. The risk of continuously using sanctions as deterrence is that they eventually lose their shock value. If the “market” of disaffected nations is large enough, they will begin to build systems of finance and trade capable of circumventing American power. Lastly, this means convincing allies that the United States has their interests a heart. The United States, the European Union, and Japan make up well over half of global GDP. Any challenge to American financial power would have to include a fracturing of the “western” alliance. We should consider a Marshall Plan–like partnership to make Europe independent of Russian energy To convince Europe that America remains committed to its well-being, we should consider a Marshall Plan–like partnership to make Europe independent of Russian energy. This could take many forms. One element could be offering to help finance liquified natural gas terminals across the continent. (Since American producers will likely benefit from these terminals, the financing should be offered on very generous terms.) Of course, European nations are more than capable of developing these projects themselves, especially with rumors of a joint Euro-bond to finance energy independence and defense. However, the offer, and others like it, would signal our commitment to European well-being beyond the military and security sphere. In sum, while working to punish and deter the Russian invasion of Ukraine, American and Western policymakers must recognize the threat inherent to their recent exercise of financial and economic power. The challenge resembles Greek tragedy—the exercise of power in the short-term risks being the very thing that could destroy it in the long-term. Policymakers must remember that preserving U.S. financial power, not just deploying it, is central to American long-term strategic interests.

March 18, 2022 RUSSIA'S GROWING INFLUENCE IN LATIN AMERICA Are these relationships cause for concern? asks Miller Center Assistant Professor Cristina Lopez-Gottardi Chao In a surprising development, the administrations of U.S. President Joe Biden and Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro met recently to discuss what many assume to be Venezuela’s close relationship with Russia. They talked about the possibility of lifting U.S. oil sanctions, unleashing an alternative to Europe’s reliance on Russian oil supplies. What makes this move noteworthy is that the United States and Venezuela have not engaged diplomatically in the past four years. Citing Venezuela’s 2018 election as fraudulent, the United States relinquished ties with the Maduro regime in 2019. Former President Trump is even said to have considered a possible U.S. military invasion in an effort to address regional security concerns. At the time, Trump also recognized Venezuelan opposition leader, Juan Guaido, as the country’s legitimate president. Biden appears to benefit more politically from a continuation of Trump-era policies, even if not accompanied by the same degree of negative rhetoric And in Biden’s first year in office, the president has done little to shift course on the South American country appearing to benefit more politically from a continuation of Trump-era policies, even if not accompanied by the same degree of negative rhetoric (recall former President Trump’s reference to Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua as the “troika of tyranny”). But this round of U.S.-Venezuela talks are fascinating, and an important development that appears to acknowledge America’s long neglect of its Latin American neighbors. This is also coming at a time when both Russia and China have been happy to fill this void and thus expand their spheres of influence. In fact, today—in a dramatic shift from just a few decades ago—China is Latin America’s top trading partner, with massive investments in infrastructure throughout the continent as part of its Belt and Road Initiative. And by 2035, trade between China and the region is expected to grow exponentially to a whopping $700 billion. Russian influence has also been on the rise via cooperative endeavors, including the sale of military equipment to Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua, and broader political and diplomatic cooperation. In recent weeks, Russia’s outreach to Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua, and other regional neighbors has been particularly worrisome. In fact, in a January meeting between U.S. and Russian representatives, Russia stoked fears reminiscent of the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis when the Soviet Union placed ballistic missiles in Cuba, just 90 miles from Florida shores. At the time, Sergei Ryabkov, leader of the Russian delegation, said that “he could neither confirm nor exclude sending military assets to Cuba and Venezuela if talks fail.” Asked about these steps, Ryabkov said, “It all depends on the actions by our U.S. counterparts.” Just a few days after Russia’s attack on Ukraine, Cuba justified Russia’s incursion by expressing concern over ""the progressive expansion of NATO toward the borders of the Russian Federation."" Cuba also specifically condemned the United States for what it viewed as undue American threats and manipulation of the international system. Days later, Russia agreed to postpone $2.3 billion in Cuban debt payments. As the United States continues to navigate the rapidly shifting geopolitical landscape unleashed by Russia’s unprovoked war in Ukraine, the Biden administration should be sure to keep an eye on the southern portion of this hemisphere and to reignite U.S. commitments in the region. After all, 1962 was not that long ago and developments we didn’t think possible in early February are now at least within the realm of possibility.

March 18, 2022 ZELENSKY SURRENDER HOAX Miller Center Senior Fellow Danielle Citron talks with UVA Today about the future of ""deepfakes"" A “deepfake” video purportedly depicting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky calling on his forces to surrender to the Russian army circulated online Wednesday—including on Facebook, which later removed the misinformation. University of Virginia professors Danielle Citron, a Law School expert on deepfakes and digital privacy, and David Nemer, an assistant professor of media studies who researches online misinformation, talked to UVA Today about the future of malign actors using digital tools to create false impressions for their own ends, including the ill omen for democracies and their security. Q. Is this the pivotal moment experts have been fearing for deepfakes? Citron: Alas, yes. When Bobby Chesney [a professor at University of Texas, Austin] and I started writing about deepfakes in early 2018, the national security implications were largely hypothetical. Then, and now, the problem was very real in the case of deepfake sex videos, where mostly women’s faces were inserted into porn in a fairly realistic way. Chesney and I warned about the national security implications, but then we only saw glimmers of a well-timed, destructive fake. Now, we see our warnings coming to fruition. It is a bummer to say, “I told you so.” READ MORE AT UVA TODAY

March 18, 2022 LEADERSHIP DURING WARTIME On his podcast, Miller Center Senior Fellow Eric Edelman draws parallels between Volodymyr Zelensky, Ronald Reagan, and Winston Churchill On this episode, British author and historian Andrew Roberts discusses his revisionist account of King George III and how a good man was nonetheless the monarch under whom the American colonies were lost. Edelman and his cohost Eliot Cohen discuss Roberts' new podcast, Secrets of Statecraft, the most important characteristics of leadership in wartime, and the how Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is similar to Churchill and Reagan. They also talk about Vladimir Putin and the role of individuals in history. Shield of the Republic is co-sponsored by the Miller Center of Public Affairs at the University of Virginia.

March 17, 2022 HEALTH SECURITY IS NATIONAL SECURITY Miller Center Associate Professor Guian McKee makes the case for why the pandemic preparedness bill matters in the struggle for Ukraine The unified Western response to Vladimir Putin’s war of aggression has generated a sense of palpable relief that the democratic world is still capable of determined, unified action. A glimmer of hope, perhaps more than a glimmer, has emerged that the liberal international order might yet hold. In the United States, however, the past week provided evidence that the deep dysfunction of democracy remains. Congress, inexcusably, has failed to take the minimum necessary steps to prepare for future stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although many on Capitol Hill seem not to recognize it, this is an urgent matter not only of public health but of national security. During the final stages of the debate over the government spending bill (which itself is the product of a legislative branch that is now incapable of passing an actual budget), Congress stripped out the Biden administration’s request for $15.6 billion in funding for additional vaccines, tests, treatments, and other measures necessary to prepare for future COVID surges, or worse, dangerous new variants. Most experts agree that even this request is only a part of what will be needed in the coming months, and it already represents a decrease from the administration’s original request for $22.5 billion. Justifications for cutting the funding were crassly partisan: for Republicans, a newly rediscovered concern or fiscal responsibility, along with a continuing thread of pandemic denialism; for Democrats, opposition to funding the measure by retrenching money already committed to the states, mixed with a view that compromise is unacceptable. The sum is that Congress acted with no attention to the medium-term (let alone the long-term) threats that the pandemic still poses. Instead, it chose to wave the (Ukrainian) flag while pretending that the current decline in cases marks the end of the pandemic. A separate pandemic preparedness bill now stands before Congress, but its fate is at best uncertain. In failing to fund measures to prepare for future stages of the pandemic while we have time, Congress is not only needlessly sacrificing the country’s most vulnerable citizens but is potentially jeopardizing the nation’s capacity to support Ukraine and check Vladimir Putin’s aggression. Today, cases are rising in Europe. Wastewater testing shows an increased presence of the virus in approximately one-third of U.S. cities. Today, cases are rising in Europe. Wastewater testing shows an increased presence of the virus in approximately one-third of U.S. cities. Even if Congress doesn’t care about serious illness and death among the elderly and immunocompromised, unchecked future waves of the pandemic will invariably harm the U.S. economy, exacerbate supply chain issues, further intensify inflation, and increase internal political divides. This limits our ability to stick to the economic sanctions against Russia and manage the wider costs of supporting Ukraine. In a worst-case scenario, a vaccine-evasive variant could once again undermine the functioning of U.S. society and weaken our capacity to counter Russia in the months—and years—to come. All of this is particularly tragic given that we really do have the capacity to manage the pandemic—if we fund and deploy the tools available. The United States needs a reality check as we celebrate Ukrainian bravery and the revived Western alliance. Given that we are unwilling to engage Russia militarily, our strength—and our ability to respond effectively—lies in our economy and in our capacity to exert leadership in the democratic world. All of this depends on effectively moving into a new phase of pandemic management, which will be impossible without passage of the pandemic preparedness bill. In order to prove that democracy can meet the challenges of this period, Congress needs to demonstrate that it can fulfill the basic responsibilities of governance. Maintaining a modicum of public health preparedness during a wartime pandemic is exactly such a test. Congress should pass the pandemic preparedness bill. Until it does, we need to hold off on self-congratulation about the revival of the Western democratic order.

March 17, 2022 COULD PRICE CONTROLS BE BIDEN'S ANSWER TO INFLATION? Miller Center Associate Professor Guian McKee explores in The Hill how public support for Ukraine could be influenced by high energy prices Analysis of the Russian attack on Ukraine has rightly focused on the strategic, military, and humanitarian considerations of the conflict itself. Very soon, however, domestic implications will begin to impinge on the geo-political. Maintaining public support will be critical as President Joe Biden and other democratic leaders around the world ask their citizens to sacrifice for the cause of countering Russian aggression in Ukraine. The pressing nature of this challenge is made obvious by the ban on Russian energy imports that President Biden announced on March 8. Cutting off the revenue that Russian oil and gas sales generate for the Kremlin is of clear strategic importance, but most analysts agree that it will raise gas and other energy prices for consumers. Such hikes will come on top of the existing inflation problem with which the Biden Administration has struggled for months. To date, public enthusiasm for the Ukrainian cause has run high. If the conflict drags out through the spring and summer months, however, a real risk exists that high gas and other prices could undermine public support, thus weakening the Western position against Russia. Although blaming the president for high gas prices is not actually a rational position given the global nature of energy markets, the reality is that many Americans remain dependent on gasoline to do their jobs and meet their own families’ needs. Many have little economic cushion against such a rise in gas prices. READ THE FULL ARTICLE IN THE HILL

March 16, 2022 WHAT'S GOING ON WITH CHINA AND RUSSIA? Miller Center Senior Fellow Aynne Kokas explores the tension between the two nations As we enter the fourth week of the Ukraine conflict, the dynamic between China and Russia has shifted. The rise of the China-Russia alliance has been complicated by competing domestic interests in China. Despite the Chinese government’s support for Russia and heavily controlled media, Chinese social media posts are not unified on the Ukraine question. New research led by Stanford’s Jennifer Pan has found mixed public opinion about the Ukraine conflict on Chinese social platforms. This suggests a softening of censorship of critical views of Russia, as well as domestic popular opinion pressuring Chinese leaders to contend with efforts to collaborate with Russia. Reports have emerged of Russia asking China for weapons—a claim that the Chinese government has ardently denied. Asking for support from China demonstrates the rise of China’s military preeminence globally. Yet China’s rising stature, has little to do with its appetite for taking on the role of a global military actor on behalf of a foreign power at present. The seven-hour meeting between White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi was about rebalancing Sino-U.S. relations in the longterm. Further complicating China and Russia’s alliance “without limit” was the meeting between U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and former Chinese Foreign Minister and Politburo member Yang Jiechi. It is difficult to know how effective the seven-hour Sullivan and Yang meeting was in rebalancing Sino-U.S. relations in the longterm. However, the fact that it occurred at all was a slap in the face to Russian President Vladimir Putin, following his new alliance with China's leader, Xi Jinping. While Russia is a valuable supplier of energy to China, its trade relationship with the United States is also essential for maintaining domestic economic growth. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang just released a 5.5 percent growth target for 2022. China’s longterm trade interests through the Belt and Road Initiative, reliable supply chains, and its relationship with U.S. and European markets are all being impacted as the conflict continues to grow. Further complicating the China-Russia alliance are the domestic challenges emerging in China, as it undergoes a major lockdown of its cities. More than 51 million people in China are under COVID restrictions. What this means in practice is that China’s efforts to protect its domestic economic growth (and related domestic stability) already face significant headwinds. It is unclear that China would even provide economic aid to Russia, beyond serving as a market willing to accept its goods. While a robust China-Russia alliance would present significant long- and short-term challenges for liberal democracies around the world, such a challenge must first contend with China’s intense focus on maintaining domestic stability at home.

March 16, 2022 FIRST LADIES AND WAR Miller Center Director of Presidential Studies Barbara Perry writes about how presidential spouses long have fought the good fight How can first ladies, who are unelected and have no government authority, participate in a traditionally male arena of war? Such conflict is the epitome of “hard power,” exercised through military means. In contrast, first ladies typically have mastered “soft power,” marked by cultural exchanges and public diplomacy, which can be especially useful in wartime. But presidential spouses have gone beyond these symbolic roles to embrace substantive duties, too. Their historic efforts fall into the following octet of accomplishments.

March 16, 2022 HOW AMERICANS CAN PROTECT AGAINST RUSSIAN CYBERATTACKS Miller Center Senior Fellow Kristen Eichensehr, director of UVA's National Security Law Center, weighs in What has the U.S. done since to shore up its defense? Miller Center Senior Fellow Kristen Eichensehr, a former special assistant to the legal advisor of the U.S. Department of State and current director of UVA’s National Security Law Center, said executive edicts have moved the nation to a stronger cybersecurity footing. “In the wake of SolarWinds, the Biden administration issued an executive order that was aimed at better securing U.S. government systems, which makes sense because that’s what was ultimately compromised with SolarWinds,” said Eichensehr, a Martha Lubin Karsh and Bruce A. Karsh Bicentennial Professor of Law at the University of Virginia. “So that’s doing things to harden the defenses and make more U.S. government systems more resilient. “In recent weeks, the Biden administration has been advocating that private sector entities look to that executive order for guidance on what they, too, should be doing. This is all in the spirit of hardening defenses, making attacks less likely to succeed and also making companies more resilient. Resilience means helping entities to come back online faster and to contain damage when things do happen.” READ MORE

March 15, 2022 FRENCH KING LOUIS XVIII VS. VLADIMIR PUTIN Even before the Russian invasion of Ukraine last month, Miller Center Senior Fellow John Owen wrote in The Washington Post about the parallels with the 19th-century ruler While Russia’s invasion of Ukraine conjures up memories of the Cold War or other recent bouts of aggression, such as the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, the most illustrative historical parallel is actually a forgotten episode from nearly 200 years ago. In January 1823, not unlike today, a more powerful country ruled by an authoritarian leader deployed 100,000 troops to its border with a weaker neighbor governed by a liberal constitutional regime. But on that occasion, the countries were France and Spain. French King Louis XVIII worried that Spain’s liberal constitutional regime could bleed over into his country, putting his reign at risk. Louis XVIII’s fears shed light on the current situation in Eastern Europe. Russia has demanded that NATO commit to never admitting Ukraine as a member, but the 1823 French invasion of Spain suggests that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s worries may be far deeper. He, too, may view a democratic neighbor as a threat to his regime and its international position. READ THE FULL ARTICLE IN THE WASHINGTON POST

March 14, 2022 BIDEN AND PUTIN: PATIENCE AND RESOLVE Miller Center Director and CEO William Antholis takes stock of Russia's invasion of Ukraine By all accounts, Russian President Vladimir Putin conceived of and is the driving force behind Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. That means that, for good or bad, this will be a central crisis for President Joe Biden – in competition with the pandemic, economic shocks, and the deep polarization that has divided America. Putin’s rash move is obviously about much more than the relationship between him and Biden. Yet each man’s assessment of the other was essential to Putin’s decision to go to war. Their actions and relationship will shape how the war moves forward, how it ends, and what comes next. As we approach the war’s three-week mark, it is worth taking stock of how all this is going. This essay argues that Putin feared the growing power of Western economic and cultural systems while badly misperceiving the strength of Western political leaders and institutions – particularly Joe Biden. In scoping out possible scenarios forward, it is tempting to work backwards from a hoped-for end game of Putin having to settle for an outcome short of victory. As Putin’s war effort has gone badly, Biden, his team and the West now appear to have an upper hand. It will require ongoing support for Ukraine and patience to grind Putin to a tacit admission that his effort has failed. And yet the challenge of thinking about an end game is that Putin will continue to be tempted to escalate the war, even if he is seeking a way out. READ MORE

March 14, 2022 'ALL WARS END' UVA Russia expert Allen Lynch outlines how the Russian invasion of Ukraine might end Defense scholar Fred Ikle famously noted that “all wars end.” Moreover, they almost always end via negotiations and not the physical annihilation of the adversary. Even the “unconditional surrender” of Japan in August 1945 was conditioned upon U.S. assurances that Emperor Hirohito would stay on his throne, thereby saving millions of Japanese (and likely hundreds of thousands of American) lives. With the Russian war in Ukraine now in its third week, certain conclusions can be drawn with a high degree of confidence: The Russian leadership was unprepared for a war of this intensity. Putin expected that a show of force would induce the Ukrainians to capitulate and allow him to install a Quisling government that would formalize Ukraine’s status as a Russian vassal state. Instead, Putin has discovered that Ukraine is a real nation and that it will not accept rule from Moscow, directly or indirectly. Russia has the capacity to destroy almost anything that it wants in Ukraine, but it does not have the capacity to end Ukrainian military resistance, not to mention occupy and govern Ukraine. With fewer than 200,000 Russian troops of all kinds currently deployed (in a country the size of France, with 44 million people), there is relative parity on the battlefield, whereas historically, decisive offensive operations require a superiority on the order of 4:1 or more. With Ukraine having a roughly 900-mile land border with four NATO countries (Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and Romania) in the mountainous west, it is unlikely that Russia would be able to seal off that border from the delivery of powerful anti-aircraft and anti-tank weapons that have to date wreaked havoc with Russia’s military plans. The longer the war goes on, the harder it will be for Putin to disguise the true nature of the war and its costs from the Russian people, who in fact tend toward pacifism; that is why Russian censorship is so strict. But you can’t censor thousands of burials of sons. On the Ukrainian side, the European Union on March 10 rejected membership for Ukraine anytime soon and the nature of the Western commitment to Ukraine, impressive as it is, underscores that Ukraine will not be joining NATO either. President Biden’s pre-war declaration that the U.S. will not risk a direct war with Russia over Ukraine by sending troops, or now by trying to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine (affirmed by NATO on March 4), prove that Ukraine’s security future was never a vital interest for the United States or NATO in the way that it is for Russia. The Ukrainian military, with prolonged military aid from NATO countries, may be able to avoid defeat but it cannot impose defeat upon a determined Russia, which is actually advancing steadily if clumsily in the south and northeast of Ukraine READ MORE

March 14, 2022 WHY WE CAN'T DISCONNECT RUSSIA FROM THE INTERNET UVA Law School Professor Thomas Nachbar writes in Bloomberg Law that ICANN protects Russia's access While the rest of the world is busy sanctioning Russia, there’s one sphere where the country’s interests appear to be safe: the internet. Russia’s prowess in using the internet to conduct information operations is world-renowned. Like removing Russia from the SWIFT financial system, a ban from the internet could both serve as a sanction and deny Russia a means for prosecuting the war. Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine’s viceprime minister, made just such a request on March 2. So why aren’t world leaders talking about how to remove Russia from the internet? The short answer is that they can’t. READ MORE

March 13, 2022 CHINA'S UKRAINE CONUNDRUM Miller Center Senior Fellow Evan Feigenbaum, an expert on China, writes that China aims to avoid being dragged too directly into a conflict between Russia and the West This week on the Sinica Podcast, Kaiser chats with Evan Feigenbaum, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, former vice-chairman of the Paulson Institute, and (during the second George W. Bush administration), Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs under Condoleezza Rice. Evan offers a very compelling analysis of the difficult position that Beijing now finds itself in after Putin’s invasion of Ukraine — caught on the horns of a dilemma and unable to resolve conflicting commitments to, on the one hand, territorial sovereignty and, on the other, opposition to American unipolar hegemony. Meanwhile, Beijing is fearful of the repercussions of siding with Russia, fearing that sanctions may have a real bite. Evan also shares his thoughts on how China and Russia differ significantly in their posture toward the “rules-based international order,” on misguided thinking about Taiwan and the “strategic triangle,” and on the reshaping of the geopolitical and geoeconomic order that the Russian invasion of Ukraine will usher in.

March 11, 2022 RUSSIA HAS A HISTORY OF NOT RESPECTING HUMANITARIAN CORRIDORS Batten School Professor Kirsten Gelsdorf writes in The Conversation that these corridors can expose fleeing civilians to greater danger As Russia continues to target houses, apartment buildings, hospitals and civilians in Ukraine, there are mounting calls from international aid groups to safely evacuate and protect Ukrainians caught in the war. Simultaneously, rising numbers of people still in Ukraine are in desperate need of food, medical supplies, water and other lifesaving materials. Russia and Ukraine have discussed what are called “humanitarian corridors” during negotiations. These are meant to allow civilians trapped in dangerous cities to leave, with the assurance that they will be safe while evacuating. They are also often used to ensure the safety of aid workers and conveys delivering aid. An estimated 35,000 Ukrainians were evacuated through such pathways on March 9, 2022, alone, according to Ukrainian President Vlodymyr Zelenskyy. But these corridors remain unreliable transit points in Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly attacked civilians traveling these routes. READ MORE

March 10, 2022 IS VLADIMIR PUTIN A RATIONAL ACTOR? Miller Center Senior Fellow Dale Copeland considers what might have motivated Putin to attack Ukraine There has been much discussion since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as to whether Vladimir Putin should be considered a rational actor, given his brutal assault on Ukraine and his apparent unwillingness to recognize the high costs the invasion has already imposed on both his military and his nation. This issue matters a great deal as the West considers options that could end the tragedy by giving Putin a negotiated way out of the debacle. Indeed, if Putin is not rational, and does not see that the costs and risks of this war are far larger than any benefits, some analysts believe he might escalate the war beyond Ukraine in a desperate attempt to salvage something from a campaign that has not gone the way he expected. This could mean a direct clash with NATO, and the potential use of nuclear weapons. Yet the assessment of any leader’s level of rationality, especially in moments when his or her decisions are going badly, is much more difficult than it seems. First, there is the question of time frame: Are we talking about the rationality a leader displays in the decision-making leading up to an action or the rationality of decision-making once it is clear that the costs and risks are turning out to be much higher than any benefits? Truly rational actors accept when things are not going as expected, and then adjust to the new reality. Here it does seem that Putin’s refusal to negotiate even a ceasefire, let alone a withdrawal based on a Ukrainian agreement not to join NATO, reflects his inability to see the long-term implications of a continued fight. The separate question of whether he was rational to attack Ukraine in the first place could go either way. International relations experts emphasize that we must look at “the information available at the time” and avoid Monday morning quarterbacking. Some of these experts have argued recently that given the West’s weak response to Russia’s 2008 invasion of Georgia and its 2014 annexation of Crimea, Putin had reason to believe that any sanctions by the West this time would again be mostly slaps on the wrist. In the face of Ukraine’s stated desire to join NATO and align with the European Union, Putin had reason to believe not only that Russia must act sooner rather than later to stop additional NATO expansion, but that Russia’s military would quickly be able to control the country and install a pro-Russian puppet that would reorient Ukraine toward the east.

March 10, 2022 PUTIN—THE NEWEST FIVE-LETTER WORD Miller Center Professor Russell Riley suggests adding a new profanity to the lexicon Trump, COVID, Putin: Five-letter words are the new four-letter word. (Those objecting to Trump’s inclusion here are free to substitute the current president’s name instead—merely confirming the point.) Whether or not one formally subscribes to televangelist Pat Robertson’s interpretation that the Russian invasion of Ukraine is evidence that the Book of Revelation is unfolding before our very eyes, there is an undeniable End of Times feel to the daily newspapers—causing most of us to mutter inventive forms of profanity each time we check the headlines. Scatology recapitulates eschatology. Between my junior and senior years in high school, I spent a month with a group of international students on a bus touring the American South for a program sponsored by Lion’s Club International. The purpose was to foster transcultural exchange. Our lot being made up entirely of teenage boys, however, we first fulfilled our obligation by learning each other’s dirty words. In short order we could all curse in Danish, Hebrew, French, Portuguese, Spanish, German, English, and more. But the go-to obscenity that summer, echoing down the center aisle whenever a soft drink got spilled or a hand of cards went awry, was a common Italian vulgarity, literally for “prostitute,” but with cruder connotations depending on its utterance. Decorum prevents me from repeating it here, but suffice it to say that in print it looks an awful lot like “Putin.” That expletive had collected dust in my memory for decades—until last week. My juvenile mind now refreshed, it will, inescapably, be what I hear whenever someone mentions to me the man who ordered troops unprovoked into Ukraine.

March 9, 2022 DISTANT ALLIES: CHINA AND RUSSIA Miller Center Senior Fellow Aynne Kokas, an expert on China, ponders the reality of the China-Russia alliance International relations scholars pay close attention to the relationship between China and Russia, particularly China's reluctance to condemn Russian actions in Ukraine. China's international relations doctrine focuses on maintaining territorial sovereignty, a tenet violated in Russia's Ukraine attack. China and Russia have a clear interest in allying across various issues, from technical standards to pushing back against human rights sanctions from Western democracies. However, they are unlikely – and not credible - partners in the era still mired in the politics of COVID-19. The two countries have taken radically different approaches to manage COVID-19. At the pandemic's start, the two countries were competing in vaccine markets to distribute the Sinovac and the Sputnik V vaccines. China, for its part, had exported roughly seven times as many vaccines as Russia had made in total as of September 2021. Russia and China released a joint statement on February 4 on the occasion of the Beijing Olympics Opening Ceremonies. They asserted their cooperation in the ""new era,"" a term often used to refer to Xi Jinping's reign over China. Despite this renewed statement of cooperation, no effort has been made on China's part to improve cross-border movement between the two countries. China's “Zero COVID” policy requires a three- to five-week quarantine for entering the country, depending on exposure and symptoms. Russia's vaccination rate is 50 percent compared to China's 87.4 percent rate. Trade between the two countries offers a valuable buffer to Russia. China can serve as a market for Russia's energy amidst sanctions. It can serve as a trade destination for goods that European and American economic sanctions might otherwise constrain. Large-scale trading with China provides a lucrative financial buffer for Russia. However, China's continued Zero COVID strategy means that travel between the two countries and any trade it may enable is off the table for the near- to medium-term. How is it possible to be close allies at such a distance?

March 9, 2022 THE ATTACK ON UKRAINE: WHY IT MATTERS Miller Center Senior Fellow Stephen D. Mull discussed the global effects of Russia's invasion at a UVA Office of Engagement event

March 8, 2022 Q&A: HOW THE WEST IS WORKING TO AVOID WORLD WAR III Miller Center Senior Fellow Stephen D. Mull talks with UVA Today about what might come next in Ukraine Tuesday’s decision by the United States to ban imports of oil and natural gas from Russia represents the latest ratcheting of sanctions designed to pressure and punish Vladimir Putin for his country’s military assault on neighboring Ukraine. Allies of Ukraine have continued using diplomatic tools to isolate Russia economically and politically in an effort to stop the violence. Though they have supplied weapons and technology to help Ukraine resist the Russian invasion, the U.S. and other nations have not granted Ukraine’s plea to provide a secure air space, which would likely spark direct military confrontation between Russia and the West. To find out why and to explore what might come next, UVA Today checked in with UVA Vice President for Global Affairs Stephen Mull, former acting undersecretary for political affairs at the U.S. Department of State and former U.S. ambassador to Poland and to Lithuania.

March 8, 2022 UKRAINE AND THE FUTURE OF WAR CRIMES UVA Law School Professor Thomas Nachbar explains that holding Russia accountable for war crimes will not be easy Many have recently highlighted the possibility that Russia may be committing war crimes in Ukraine. The United States has gone so far as to announce that is collecting evidence of potential war crimes. But whether Russia is ever held to account for these crimes depends in part on the actions of the Ukrainian government, in more ways than one. Commentators note that Russian officials are unlikely to ever be held personally accountable for war crimes. Russia, like the United States, is not a party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, and as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, it is unlikely to be referred to either the ICC or an ad hoc tribunal, as happened in the wars in Yugoslavia and Rwanda. Many nations have domestic laws with universal jurisdiction that might apply to conduct in Ukraine, but the practical difficulties of arresting and trying Russian leaders make this unlikely, too. Yet there are other forms of accountability, and the war in Ukraine might provide a lamentable laboratory for the development of the law of armed conflict. The war in Ukraine is a particularly high-profile example of a decreasingly frequent event: a conflict governed by Common Article 2 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions. That is, it is a war between two or more states, all of whom are parties to the Geneva Conventions. Most of the wars over the past two decades have either been what American military doctrine calls “irregular wars” — that is, wars between states and nonstate actors, like al-Qaida and ISIS — or mixed conflicts that feature both state and non-state actors. In Common Article 2 conflicts, different and clearer rules apply than in irregular wars, which makes it comparatively easier to determine if there’s been an actual war crime. Whether things remain so clear, though, depends in part on Ukraine. If nonstate actors — such as informal insurgent groups — start taking part in the conflict, the war will become a mixed one, and it will be comparatively hard to determine which rules apply in which circumstances. There is already some complexity here, as the Russians claim they are supporting nonstate separatists in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. But outside of that area, the most likely irregular forces would be Ukrainian. The Ukrainian government has a say over whether those forces satisfy Article 4 of the Third Geneva Convention (and consequently how they are categorized under the Geneva Conventions). Tactical considerations are likely to receive greater weight than legalistic ones, but this is something the Ukrainians should keep in mind when organizing their resistance. The law of armed conflict also imposes an obligation on combatants to not only distinguish between military and civilian targets, called ""offensive distinction,"" but also to distinguish their own forces from civilians, known as ""defensive distinction."" Russian bombardment of cities is a violation of offensive distinction if Russia fails to distinguish between military and civilian targets, but strikes in populated areas have been a necessary part of many irregular conflicts because irregular forces so frequently fail to engage in defensive distinction. For example, ISIS’ common practice of hiding among civilians and using human shields is a failure of defensive distinction — a war crime. The Ukrainians, by keeping their military forces distinct, can remove the cloud of doubt that shrouds so many inquiries into civilian casualties. Defensive distinction is costly, but not only is it a legal obligation, it enables accountability by making offensive distinction violations all the more clear. In a world with more cell phones than people, the potential to document war crimes has never been greater. That evidence can go a long way toward holding individuals and nations accountable through formal mechanisms, like trials or international sanctions, and it can develop the law of war crimes itself. It is too soon to tell how much the war in Ukraine will shape the development of the law of armed conflict, but given the highly sophisticated media environment in Ukraine, combined with the clarity of Russia’s actions, it’s hard to imagine that it won’t affect the law of armed conflict in some profound ways. Ukraine has rightly united the world behind its cause. The shape and durability of this moment of unity depends not only on how Russia conducts the war, but also on how Ukraine does.

March 8, 2022 WE MUST PREPARE FOR THE SYSTEMIC COLLAPSE OF THE RUSSIAN ECONOMY Miller Center Research Fellow Scott Miller anticipates what might come next for Russia Over the past few days, observers have begun to forecast the results of Western sanctions on the Russian economy. In short, we are likely watching the collapse of Russia’s economic system. The savage nature of Putin’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine has drawn much of the media oxygen, but the severity of a possible collapse should put Western observers on alert. Crises on this scale produce profound societal volatility and often result in spillovers that few see coming. Russia is no stranger to episodes of economic distress. Its 2014 proxy occupation of Donetsk and Luhansk resulted in a significant depreciation of the ruble against the dollar, stock market crashes, and negative economic growth for the first time since the global financial crisis of 2008-09 (GFC). Alongside most of the developed world, the GFC caused a dramatic contraction of GDP growth in Russia, from approximately 6 percent in 2008 to -8 percent in 2009. More important, however, the Russian debt default and crisis of 1998 erased all hopes of a smooth transition to a liberal market order. Real output declined by 4.9 percent as Russian stock, bond, and currency markets collapsed in August and September of 1998. The Russian government stopped meeting its domestic debt obligations as well. After depleting its foreign exchange reserves in an attempt to defend its exchange rate peg of approximately 5 rubles/1 USD, the Bank of Russia allowed the ruble to float. The ruble/dollar exchange rate rose to approximately 30 to 1 in September of 1999, causing prices to rise 92.6 percent in 1999 and then 20.9 percent the following year. The impending crisis is likely to make these previous events look miniscule by comparison. Robin Brooks and Elina Ribakova of the Institute of International Finance estimate a 15 percent contraction in Russian GDP in 2022. By comparison, U.S. GDP contracted by just 3.5 percent in 2020, when we intentionally shut down the economy to deal with the COVD-19 pandemic. The U.S. economy shrunk just 2.5 percent in 2009 at the height of the Great Recession. The Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, himself sanctioned for his connections to the Kremlin, on Sunday suggested, “This is going to be like [the] 1998 crisis but three times worse and will last three years.” Deripaska’s prognostication stands out because while Russia has faced numerous crises in the past two decades, they have been short-lived. Growth returned to 4-5 percent in 2010 and over 6 percent in 1999. The brief nature of these contractions made them painful yet manageable. So why would the impending crisis last for so long? The nature of recovery in 1999 is instructive. The collapse of the ruble made Russian exports much less expensive to foreign buyers, resulting in an inflow of foreign exchange and boosting tax revenue for the Russian state. A budget surplus, increasing ForEx reserves, and rising prices for Russian commodity exports soothed investors. Net capital inflows remained positive despite the credit crisis and sovereign default. In short, the crisis stunned the Russian economy but it was able to quickly resume its export-based growth pattern because the broader global market structure had not changed. The present circumstances could not be more different. The depreciation of the ruble will not result in an increase of Russian exports because Western governments have sanctioned many of the largest Russian firms. Even if the opportunity for robust trade existed, central bank sanctions have cut off potential dollar and euro flows. As a result, the Russian government has few prospects for a restoration of its balance sheet. A slow-rolling sovereign debt default has made Russian bonds virtually uninvestable. Furthermore, capital controls (imposed to stem hemorrhaging private capital stocks) have cut the Russian economy off from the foreign direct investment that it desperately needs. In sum, the mechanisms that paved the way for Russian recoveries from previous crises are and will not be available in the near future. The highly volatile nature of economic crises makes current circumstances even more dangerous. Economic and social volatility feed on each other, often producing a combustible atmosphere. Tensions will grow as Putin tightens his grip on Russian society amidst worsening economic conditions. Put another way, economic crises are difficult enough to deal with in times of relative social and political stability. Policy makers can focus on the crisis itself and do not face added volatility from military defeats, riots, coups, or external threats. Russia is facing the potential of all of these. The economic headwinds facing the Russian economy are unprecedented, but that is not the half of their problems. Economic crises that take place amidst social disruption often erupt into a self-perpetuating firestorm of civic unrest and economic collapse. I hope that Russia can avoid this, but I would not count on it.

March 7, 2022 THE GLOBAL RIPPLE EFFECTS OF RUSSIA'S ATTACK ON UKRAINE Miller Center Senior Fellow Stephen D. Mull discussed implications for international security and diplomacy at a Batten School event

March 7, 2022 WHAT THE WAR IN UKRAINE TELLS US ABOUT U.S. TECH FIRMS Miller Center Senior Fellow Aynne Kokas, an expert on China, reflects on the autonomy of U.S. corporations When tech entrepreneur Elon Musk enabled his Skylink satellite internet service in Ukraine, Ukrainian officials hailed him as a hero. But as a “free speech absolutist” he also noted he would not close off access to Russian state-run news sources, a well-documented source of disinformation about the war. Meanwhile, Apple paused product sales in Russia and has limited the use of Apple Pay and other services. Musk has had a checkered track record in business dealings with authoritarian states, choosing to share advanced autonomous vehicle data with Chinese government servers, for example. Similarly, Apple established data-sharing joint ventures with Chinese government agencies for its iCloud servers in China to protect its access to the market. With the Ukraine conflict, the U.S. tech sector has solidified its role as an unpredictable, independent geopolitical actor that has the potential to advance or sink U.S. foreign policy objectives. Seeing such corporate decision-making unfurl in real time during the Ukraine conflict has wide-ranging implications not just in the current moment. What we see in this conflict are examples of how U.S. corporate autonomy plays out relative to a battle with a country where U.S. corporations have substantial business interests. Divergent corporate decision-making allows us to observe how the market-based system in the U.S. might operate in a conflict with China, where economic exposure by U.S. corporations is much higher. One of the strengths of the U.S. economy is the autonomy that corporations enjoy in building global markets while raising capital domestically in the U.S. Unlike firms in China, U.S. corporations have the option to choose how and when they engage in the conflict in Russia. However, what this also means is that, as in the case of Musk’s decision to expand the reach of Russian disinformation and Apple’s decision to limit – but not end – its engagement in Russia, we are also seeing a preview of how tech companies with much more extensive exposure to China might respond to conflict between the United States and China. The answer suggests a very high bar for imposing any significant consequences that might endanger the firms’ profitability in a key market.

March 7, 2022 PUTIN'S NEW WAVE OF REPRESSION Miller Center Assistant Professor Cristina Lopez-Gottardi Chao warns that even harsher crackdowns on dissent in Russia may be coming While Russian President Vladimir Putin’s hardline stance against opposition is well-established, there is reason to worry the Russian leader may be ushering in a new wave of repression. In an effort to deal with mounting internal dissent that has become increasingly active in the days since Russia began its war on Ukraine, more than 7,000 protesters were detained last week in cities across Russia. On Sunday alone, an estimated 4,300 more were arrested as a result of their participation in anti-war activities. These developments come after an alarming escalation in repressive tactics over the last year. In the run up to last fall’s parliamentary elections, Human Rights Watch noted, “Russian authorities unleashed a full-fledged witch hunt on civic groups, independent media and journalists, political opposition and other critics… The actions decimated [Russian] civil society and forced many…into exile.” And in another alarming development late last week, Russian authorities effectively silenced what remained of Russia’s independent media, passing a law targeted at guarding against what the Russian state falsely considers “fake news” coverage of the war. More specifically, it appears to be an effort by the Russian government to manage the war’s narrative including criminalizing language that refers to the war as an “invasion,” rather than the state’s preferred term of “special military operation.” The offense comes with a possible 15-year prison sentence and has already led to the closing of several news organizations and the exile of dozens of journalists. According to Human Rights Watch, “Today, Russia is more repressive than it has ever been in the post-Soviet era,” and there are growing fears of what might come next. But perhaps unexpected for Putin, opposition to Russia’s attack on Ukraine appears to be coming not only from ordinary Russian citizens, but may be emanating from within military ranks as well. There are multiple frontline reports of young Russian soldiers abandoning their posts. There is also increasing speculation that portions of the Russian military may lack a clear understanding of their mission and purpose, and thus possess a weak resolve towards achieving Putin’s aim. In addition, they may be influenced by the strong cultural and family ties between Russians and Ukrainians, and so it may be safe to assume some degree of Russian sympathy for the plight of the Ukrainian people. Further, as Western sanctions take hold and financial conditions in Russia deteriorate, it is also reasonable to expect these factors might fuel greater discontent within Russia, resulting in increased opposition and perhaps fueling outward migration. But how far is Putin willing to go in exerting control over the Russian populace? And were the Russians to succeed in taking over Ukraine, what degree of repressive tactics will he deem necessary to control the occupied territory? Given Putin’s track record, the prospects are daunting, so let’s hope we don’t have to find out.

March 6, 2022 CAN PUTIN'S ECONOMY SURVIVE WESTERN SANCTIONS? Miller Center Research Fellow Scott Miller suggests ""Fortress Russia"" could collapse Many recent reports have emphasized Russian President Vladimir Putin’s post-2014 efforts to build a “Fortress Russia” that could resist Western economic sanctions. With American and European governments now ratcheting up restrictions on the Russian financial system, the question remains whether Russia will be able to circumvent those efforts to punish their unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. The answer is almost certainly “No.” While Russia has built up foreign exchange reserves of approximately $600 billion and a rainy-day fund of nearly $150 billion, sanctions on the Russian central bank have rendered a significant portion of those funds inaccessible. Russia possesses substantial gold reserves, but gold remains a relatively illiquid asset. Gold is difficult to transport, and thus gold sales are often done by contract without physically moving the gold to a new location. Western sanctions have made clearing those contracts very difficult. Russia could load a train of bullion bound for Beijing, but the journey would be risky and Chinese officials would likely exact a steep premium. Furthermore, the Bank of Russia already holds a large reserve of Chinese bonds (with which China would pay for the gold) that remain only moderately useful for procuring goods and material on global markets. Put simply, Putin has access to only a part of the “fortress” war chest he has trumpeted in recent years. So what does this mean for the Russian economy? It may be teetering on the edge of all-out collapse. The ruble has fallen to approximately 120rb/1 USD as of Friday, March 4. Facing a full-scale bank run on February 28, the Bank of Russia hiked interest rates from 9.5 percent to 20 percent and instituted large-scale capital controls in an effort to keep people from draining their accounts. Russian authorities had little choice but to take these drastic measures to prevent the collapse of their banking system. Yet despite these steps, the ruble continued to depreciate throughout the week. While necessary, these emergency measures may prove to be catastrophic in the medium term by starving the Russian economy of investment. The Russian government has essentially initiated a slow-motion sovereign debt default by outlawing the payment of bond coupons to foreign debt holders. Russian government bonds have been downgraded to junk status. Combined with 20 percent interest rates at domestic banks, a near-total freeze has descended on Russian capital markets. Furthermore, the Moscow stock exchange remained shuttered for a fifth straight day in an attempt to “maintain orderly markets.” This suggests that Russian officials fear a full-scale sell-off of Russian stocks. Russian equities traded on European markets have been decimated—stock of the largest bank in Russia, Sberbank, has lost nearly 98 percent of its value. If a similar crash occurs once domestic trading reopens, the Russian government will be forced to initiate a massive bailout or see its institutions go bust. It has the rubles to prop up those institutions, but such profound capital losses would represent rescues much larger than the American TARP program of 2009 (in relative terms). Furthermore, Russian firms rely heavily on imported components and materials that can only be procured in dollars or Euros. Thus, a massive injection of rubles would only forestall the inevitable. An influx of rapidly-depreciating cash would supercharge the inflation problem that the Bank of Russia is already fighting. Furthermore, such bailouts will spook the public. The government can prop up Russian institutions with injections of rubles, but if the public doesn’t believe that its savings are safe (from bank runs or inflation), no amount of government cash will persuade them. Panics are notoriously difficult to map out, and no one can foresee the fire sales and liquidation spirals that could ensue. Civic unrest often erupts during financial crises, but the Russian state has proven increasingly willing to crack down on internal dissent. This could produce a combustible environment that will only add to Russian economic volatility. The unpredictability of financial crises is what makes them so dangerous. Even if Russia manages to prevent an all-out collapse, high internal interest rates, sanctions on its largest firms, and its sovereign debt default will make the nation largely uninvestable. For a country that is already capital-deficient and whose human capital is fleeing the country, already-low Russian productivity will decline. With sanctions on the Russian energy sector becoming more likely as Russian attacks become more brutal, the Russian government may resort to printing currency to sustain its basic operations. This will result in an even faster depreciation of the ruble, rapidly declining output and real incomes, and a systemic fracturing of the Russian economy. Putin’s creation of a “Fortress Russia” depended on the viability of his reserves, but he clearly did not expect such swift and unified action by the West. Put simply, Russia’s illiquid and insufficient reserves cannot protect it from the economic firestorm of its own making that has only just begun.

March 4, 2022 THIS IS NO 'WAR OF CHOICE' Miller Center Senior Fellow Eric Edelman, former undersecretary of defense for policy, notes that Russia's invasion of Ukraine was an unprovoked war of aggression Observers and commentators need to stop referring to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine as Putin's ""war of choice."" This is an unprovoked, premeditated, scripted, war of aggression -- something the Nuremberg Tribunal after World War II called the ""supreme international crime."" The Russian campaign has also now targeted civilians, also a war crime, and nuclear power plants which are also war crimes. The alleged use by Putin of Islamist thugs and assassins from Chechnya to secure the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (the largest in Europe) and the irresponsible shelling of the plant make it clear that Putin is using the implied threat of a nuclear incident to terrorize Ukraine and Europe and reinforce the impact of his earlier threats to use nuclear weapons in the conflict. All of this underscores that the U.S., NATO, and the international community are not dealing with a normal nation state in this instance, but rather something more akin to a criminal enterprise. This is not the first time this has happened in international history. As the late historian Paul Schroeder pointed out years ago, Napoleon ran his foreign policy like a criminal enterprise as well until he finally succeeded in uniting all of Europe against him. This is an achievement that Putin seems well on his way to replicating.

March 4, 2022 RATING THE RISK OF NUCLEAR ESCALATION Miller Center Senior Fellow Todd Sechser, an expert on nuclear security, tells NBC29 that the risk of nuclear escalation is small -- for now The world is on high alert following threats Russia has made towards using nuclear weapons as a result of its military invasion of Ukraine. “The risk of nuclear escalation is very small,” said University of Virginia Professor of Politics Todd Sechser. Sechser says just because the risk is low right now, doesn’t mean it will remain that way. “Russia didn’t seem to be moving any of its nuclear forces or increasing its readiness on the ground to use nuclear weapons,” Sechser said. Sechser said that Russia has made three recent threats that warned of the potential for escalation, but there’s one main factor that could prevent tensions from boiling over: “As long as NATO countries don’t become directly engaged in combat with Russian forces, I would say the risk of nuclear weapons is extremely small,” Sechser said. But that doesn’t mean the world shouldn’t pay attention to the moves Russia is making. “Taking cautious and deliberate actions, I think, will help cooler heads prevail and reduce the risk of miscalculation or misunderstanding that could lead inadvertently to escalation,” Sechser said.

March 4, 2022 THE CHINA CONNECTION AND PUTIN'S ENDGAME Miller Center Senior Fellow Dale Copeland discusses China's critical role in the crisis Vladimir Putin has got himself into a terrible mess. Aside from setting most of the world against him and reinvigorating the very alliance, NATO, which he claims he is acting to thwart, his actions in Ukraine have placed his own country on the brink of economic collapse. Such a collapse would not only endanger Russia’s position as a middle power between the economic superpowers of the United States and China, but it might even bring about his downfall. Putin’s original plans – of taking Ukraine quickly, installing a puppet regime in Kyiv, and perhaps lopping off the eastern half of Ukraine as parts of a reconstituted Russian empire – have been thrown out the window. At this point, he can either keep escalating and hope his situation improves or he can seek a way out that allows him to stay in power by claiming, at least to his military, that he has achieved a “victory” that makes Russia’s security position stronger. Most likely, in the short term, he will do the former to improve his bargaining position for the latter. This is where China comes in. As of 2020, the European Union (EU) became China’s largest trade partner, overtaking China’s relationship with the United States. At present, most of that trade goes by sea. But Chinese leaders have been making a big push as part of their Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to increase the transport of goods to and from Europe by rail. Railway links cut the transport time from China to the EU by 50 percent compared to sea, and Beijing expects this savings to grow significantly through the extension of its high-speed rail system. Even in the last five years, the amount of railway traffic connecting the EU and China has skyrocketed, going from a mere one percent of total EU-China trade to almost five percent and growing. Or at least it was growing prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Since most of the railways go through Russia and Belarus to get to the EU, Chinese leader Xi Jinping has been worried for some time about sanctions against these two countries interfering with burgeoning EU-China trade. He has developed an alternative route that goes through Central Asia and Turkey, and in the fall of 2021 held important talks with Ukraine to keep the trade flowing even if dictatorial Belarus is cut off from commerce with the EU. But with the imposition of severe sanctions against Russia and Belarus over the last week, this critical dimension of Xi’s whole BRI project – a project needed to sustain the six percent GDP growth the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) believes it requires to maintain stability at home – is now called into question. All this means that China may be critical over the coming days and weeks in putting the kind of pressure on Putin needed to find a solution to his Ukrainian debacle. Already we see Beijing pulling back from full support of Putin. The China-dominated Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank has frozen all lending to Russia and Belarus. Government-controlled banks are restricting credit to Chinese firms responsible for the purchase of Russian oil and gas. If Xi starts to see not only a decline in EU-China trade but a more general slowdown in Europe and the world affecting his plans for continued economic growth, it is highly likely he will put direct pressure on Putin to find a face-saving exit strategy to the war against Ukraine. Russia needs the economic and political support of China in the coming days much more than China needs Russia. Most importantly, the long-term strength of China and legitimacy of the CCP are on the line. Mr. Putin, expect a phone call!

March 4, 2022 WHERE DOES THE WAR GO NEXT? Miller Center Senior Fellow Allan Stam thinks about the implications if Russia next targets the Baltic States If the Russians can subdue Ukraine, where might an expansion-focused Russian leadership turn next? If restoring in part or whole the borders of the 19th century Russian empire is a goal of President Putin, then the Baltic States -- Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia -- may be a target for aggression. The risks there for the United States are very high. First, these states are members of NATO, which means the U.S. is legally committed to their defense. Our willingness to honor that commitment affects the credibility of our defense commitments everywhere else in the world. Unfortunately, the geography of national borders would make defending those countries difficult if not impossible using solely conventional weapons. First, they are physically small states, which restricts their ability to trade space for time, a standard defense strategy. The small scale also limits the ability of NATO states to forward-deploy lar",https://millercenter.org/ukraine

Russia Flounders in Ukraine but Doubles Down in Mali

On March 30, as Russian forces continued their struggle to conquer Ukrainian cities, Russian arms suppliers delivered a pair of menacing Mi-35M attack helicopters and an advanced air radar system thousands of miles away in West Africa to the Malian capital of Bamako.

Despite the Kremlin calling back an international network of national and foreign mercenaries to fight in Ukraine, some of whom are leaving battlefields in Syria and Africa to do so, Russia has largely maintained its presence in Mali, where a force of about 1,000 Russian officials and instructors from the Russian mercenary outfit, popularly known as the Wagner Group, is deployed, according to United Nations-based diplomats. Some 200 Malian service members and nine police officers are currently receiving training in Russia, a Russian diplomat recently told the U.N. Security Council.

The development suggests that despite its military reversals in Ukraine, Russia is seeking to preserve its growing diplomatic and military interests in Africa, where irregular Russian forces have been supplying training and fighting forces to governments and rebel movements from the Central African Republic to Libya. It is positioning itself to fill a political vacuum in Mali, as French and European forces and trainers begin withdrawing from the country, ending a nearly decadelong French effort in its former colony to contain the spread of terrorism and pave the way for a peace deal uniting the politically divided country. For Mali, the arrangement provides the military junta with a partner capable of battling the country’s anti-government Islamist movements, without having to endure demands from the West to respect human rights and pursue a democratic power-sharing arrangement with the country’s Tuareg minority in the north.

“Russia has considerable interests in Africa, which [Russian President Vladimir] Putin uses,” said J. Peter Pham, the former U.S. special envoy for the Sahel region during the Trump administration. “It’s not a major part of Russian foreign policy, but it’s like many things that Putin has done throughout his 20 years in power, which is to use things opportunistically.”

The Malian government entered into discussions with the Wagner Group late last year, triggering a warning to Mali’s military rulers from the French government to reconsider the partnership, according to an account from a U.N.-based diplomat familiar with Russia’s role in Mali. Paris, the diplomat noted, warned that France would have to reconsider its commitment to continue Operation Barkhane, the French military mission headquartered in Chad that has led the fight against Islamist extremists throughout the Sahel, if the Russians were invited. In late December 2021, Wagner Group military instructors began deploying in Mali.

In February, France announced that it would begin the process of winding down its presence and would be gone in six months. European military trainers, detached to the Takuba Task Force—which serves under French command and provides advice and assistance to the Malian Armed Forces and a regional counterterrorism force, known as the G5 Sahel—are also set to leave. Without the support of France, which serves as a kind of security guarantor for European and U.N. peacekeepers in Mali, the French-led anti-terror coalition risks unraveling.







Russia’s supply of attack helicopters and advanced radar risks undermining European control of the skies in Mali, exposing U.N. blue helmets to greater danger in the field. The United Nations has already been unsuccessfully trying to acquire attack helicopters. For the time being, France is prepared to fly aircraft from a base in neighboring Niger to deter attacks on U.N. peacekeepers, but it remains unclear whether Mali will continue to grant air access to the French after their troops withdraw from the country.

The Wagner Group defies conventional definitions of a private military contractor. As far as experts can tell, there is no single registered corporate entity called the Wagner Group. Rather, it has become a shorthand, bound up in mythology, to describe a network of companies and groups of mercenaries that Western governments regard to be closely enmeshed with the Russian state.

Having cut their teeth during the fighting in Ukraine in 2014, Wagner operatives have been dispatched to several countries around the world, often melding mercenary activity with natural resource extraction. Their shadowy nature has enabled the Kremlin to deny any connection to the group.

“Wagner is not a counterterrorism force. Wagner is a tool of the Russian government to try and advance its foreign-policy goals,” said Joseph Siegle, director of research at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies at the National Defense University. “They’re there to keep the junta in power because the junta serves Moscow’s interests in displacing France and the EU.”

Although government officials in Mali have described the Russians as instructors, Western officials and human rights monitors fear that their activities will extend far beyond training. Hundreds of Russians associated with the Wagner Group were dispatched to the Central African Republic in 2017 under the guise of a training mission approved by the U.N. Security Council, alleging that they were unarmed. U.N. experts have documented a string of damning allegations against the group, including indiscriminate killings, rape, and sexual violence.

The prospect of a French withdrawal from Mali has alarmed the United States, which has sought to persuade the French to remain in Mali. But another Western diplomat said there is no sense of urgency that “we get Wagner out of Mali because of what is happening in Ukraine.” Alarmed by Russia’s presence, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Michele Sison recently traveled to Mali to assess the viability of the U.N. mission in Mali, known as MINUSMA, after the French leave.

“They came back from the mission very worried,” said one U.N.-based diplomat. The diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the United States is concerned that the U.N. mission risks being inadvertently used to advance the aims of a military junta seeking to secure its future—and that of a Russian mercenary group expanding Moscow’s influence and seeking a payoff. Washington has also expressed concern that the U.N. mission, which has a mandate to support the Malian authorities, could be placed in the awkward position of supporting a government engaged in extensive atrocities or providing an inadvertent benefit to the Wagner Group, the diplomat said.

“Like others, the United States is deeply troubled by the developments in Mali,” Richard Mills Jr., deputy U.S. representative to the United Nations, told the U.N. Security Council on April 7. “The last three months have been marked by alarming accounts of human rights violations and abuses against civilians by terrorist armed groups and the Malian Armed Forces with individuals linked to the Kremlin-backed Wagner Group.”

A senior U.S. State Department official said the Malian regime’s decision to contract Wagner fighters was prompted by its own sense of regional and international isolation as well as the need to ensure its own security.

But the Russians hardly have the capacity to outperform tens of thousands of international troops and peacekeepers who have battled the region’s terrorists over the last decade.

“A thousand Wagner folks ain’t going to fill the security void in Mali,” the senior State Department official said, adding it has done an effective job of selling a “false narrative” that it is providing security to Mali. “They may be killing terrorists, but they are also killing so many civilians.”

“How many new terrorists do they create?” the official added.

Mali—once praised as a model for a fledgling democracy in Africa—emerged as a major terror hub in the years following NATO’s 2011 military intervention in Libya amid a revolution against the government of then-leader Muammar al-Qaddafi, which led to Qaddafi’s ouster and death and set the stage for the spread of weapons and extremists throughout the Sahel.

An Islamist terror group hijacked an insurgency by the Malian Tuareg minority, seized control of northern Mali, and began preparing for an assault on the capital of the former French colony. Alarmed by the development, France launched Operation Serval in January 2013 to crush the Islamists and pave the way for a political settlement between Mali’s southern governments and northern Tuaregs. In August of the following year, the French replaced that with Operation Barkhane, with a wider mandate to battle extremists throughout the region.

Over the years, France has tried to cobble together a coalition of West African and European special forces, working closely with a U.N. peacekeeping mission, to help it contain the terror threat in Mali, restore security in the country, and support African-led political negotiations aimed at ending the country’s political stalemate.

The West’s relationship with Mali has sharply deteriorated since August 2020, when Malian military leader Col. Assimi Goïta staged the first of two military coups, with the second in May 2021, and quickly reneged on pledges to restore civilian democratic rule to Mali.

Russia has taken advantage of the rift, offering to provide military support and training to the Malian army. Russia has positioned itself as a diplomatic champion of Mali’s military junta, praising Russian-backed Malian counterterrorism operations that the country’s critics say have resulted in large-scale violations of human rights.

Following the August 2020 coup, Russia’s ambassador to Mali, Igor Gromyko, the grandson of former Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, became the first foreign dignitary to publicly meet with the new military junta, as U.S. and European diplomats scrambled to craft their own response. Gromyko emerged from the meeting to a small crowd of supporters waving Russian flags, leading Western diplomats to suspect the whole spectacle was a choreographed public relations stunt for Moscow to get a leg up in its influence with the new rulers.







“It’s hard to buy high-quality Malian flags in Bamako, much less high-quality Russian flags,” Pham said. “How do you find nicely made Russian flags in Bamako?”

Most recently, Moscow has provided diplomatic cover to Mali over the massacre of some 300 civilians in the town of Moura, Mali, last month, which human rights watchdogs say was carried out by Malian forces with possible help from Russian mercenaries. (Malian authorities said it was a counterterrorism operation that “neutralized” jihadi fighters.) Russia, backed by China, blocked a U.N. Security Council request for an independent investigation into the massacre.

“Cooperation between Russia and Mali has a long history and tradition,” Anna Evstigneeva, a deputy permanent representative to Russia, recently told the U.N. Security Council. “We are working to improve their capacity, train members of military and law enforcement.”

“We note the commitment of the Malian general staff to observing human rights and international humanitarian law,” she added. “We commend Bamako’s efforts in investigating the incidents of reported human rights violations. As for the information campaign about so-called Russian mercenaries, we regard it as part of a malevolent geopolitical game.”

France’s departure is raising deeper concerns about the West’s role in Mali and the viability of a U.N. peacekeeping mission whose best-trained and resourced peacekeepers come from Europe, including Germany and the United Kingdom. While French forces operate independently of the U.N. mission, the French provide vital services, including a hospital in the city of Gao, Mali, as well as close air support for peacekeepers under armed attack and medical evacuation services for wounded blue helmets. Key European powers are now reviewing their roles in Mali.

This month, the European Union’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said: “We are halting the training missions for the [Malian] Armed Force and national guard.” Borrell cited concerns about the presence of the Wagner Group, which he said may be “responsible for some very serious events, which have led to tens of people being killed in Mali in recent times.” He insisted, though, that the European Union remain committed to participating in counterterrorism efforts in the broader Sahel region.

For the moment, Britain and Germany continue to serve in the U.N. mission in Mali, but they may reconsider their commitment in light of Russia’s growing role, according to U.N.-based diplomats.

The United States and its European counterparts are also concerned about potentially deteriorating relations between Malian forces and the U.N. peacekeeping mission. On March 22, a Malian attack helicopter fired six rockets near a British reconnaissance unit in eastern Mali. The Malian government said it had mistaken the British forces, who are serving in the U.N. peacekeeping mission, for terrorists, who they claim have been operating in the area.

But one U.N.-based diplomat said the U.N. mission’s intelligence unit had not detected a terror presence in the area before the attack, and a European diplomat said the area may have been in territory controlled by the Malian army and Wagner Group, so they did not want U.N. peacekeepers in the area.

The attack, Mills said, is “an affront to all those who serve in U.N. peacekeeping missions.”

Mills raised particular concern about “the extremely disturbing accounts of hundreds of people killed last week in the village of Moura in the Mopti region of central Mali.”

New York-based Human Rights Watch, which conducted an investigation into the killings, cited several unnamed sources who claimed Malian forces and Russian soldiers executed several hundred people, committing the worst atrocity in Mali in a decade.

“The Malian people deserve answers to what happened in Moura this week of March 28 and what led to the gruesome, execution-style killing of over 35 people on March 2 in the Ségou region and who is responsible,” Mills said. He noted that Malian authorities have said it will launch an investigation as well as grant the U.N. mission access for its own inquiry.

“This increase in reports of human rights abuses is exactly why the United States continues to warn countries against partnering with the Kremlin-linked Wagner Group,” Mills said. “Wagner forces have been implicated in human rights abuses, including execution-style killings, in the Central African Republic and elsewhere.”",https://foreignpolicy.com/projects/russia-ukraine-crisis-live-updates/

The prime minister and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz used a press conference on Downing Street to directly accuse Putin of committing war crimes.



Johnson said leaders shared ""the same feeling of horror and disgust"" at the attack on a train station in Kramatorsk, in eastern Ukraine, which left at least 50 people dead. He added: ""It shows the depths in which Putin's once-glorified army was immersed.""



Scholz said: ""Killing civilians is a war crime. The Russian president is responsible for war crimes. Boris Johnson and I share that appreciation.""



Asked about the risk of escalating the conflict, Johnson said Putin has already escalated it targeting innocent civilians. He said: ""He has already carried out systematic massacres of innocent people. What we are looking at now is finding ways to support friends and partners who want to send other types of equipment that might be useful to Ukrainians.""

He suggested that some of NATO's military equipment would not be useful to Ukraine, suggesting that the focus should be on equipment that is ""really useful"" to Kiev forces.



He criticized the talks between Emmanuel Macron, the French president, and Putin. ""Negotiations with Putin do not seem to me to be full of promises,"" he said. ""I do not think he can be trusted. I'm deeply, deeply sceptical - I'm cynically afraid now.""



Johnson said Germany was ""massively dependent"" on Russian oil and gas, but was ""leaving very, very quickly."" Scholz said it was not ""so easy"" to reduce Germany's dependence, but said it was building infrastructure for alternatives, including terminals for national liquefied natural gas imports and increasing wind energy.",https://albaniandailynews.com/news/uk-pledges-more-military-equipment-to-ukraine-1-1

The ""dire"" situation in the besieged city of Mariupol may be a ""red line"" in the path of negotiations, Ukraine's foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba has said.

In an interview with CBS News, Mr Kuleba also said there had not been any recent diplomatic communications between Russia and Ukraine at the level of their foreign ministries.

The foreign minister went on to say he was expecting ""intensification of heavy fighting in eastern Ukraine"" in the coming weeks.



Mr Kuleba said: ""We didn't really have any contacts with Russian diplomats in recent weeks at the level of foreign ministries.

""The only level of contact is the negotiating team that consists of the representatives of various institutions and members of parliament.

""They continue their consultations at the expert level but no high level talks are taking place.""
