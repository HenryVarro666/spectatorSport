Russian dictator Vladimir Putin has to put on a brave face. ‚ÄúThe special operation in Ukraine is going according to plan and in full compliance with the timetable,‚Äù he said in a session of his nation‚Äôs security council, though via Zoom, because no table is long enough anymore. ‚ÄúAll tasks set during the special operation in Ukraine are being accomplished successfully.‚Äù Well, Kyiv and most of the country‚Äôs major cities remain in Ukrainian hands, they‚Äôve lost thousands of soldiers, Russia still lacks air superiority, the whole world is against them diplomatically (even Cuba!) and sports-wise, and they‚Äôve had to shut down the remaining vestiges of independent media and protests.

That was the plan? If so, it was a shitty plan. This is the far more likely reality, from a supposedly trustworthy source:

x ""Everyone is fucking stunned,"" says one source close to the Kremlin. Another source says no one in the presidential administration expected a full-scale war‚Äîor the sanctions. ""You can't resign,"" said first source. ""You can only resign right to jail.""

WOW.https://t.co/uhnrthdhSf ‚Äî Julia Ioffe (@juliaioffe) March 3, 2022

President Joe Biden was the only person who was clear and blunt about Putin‚Äôs intent to invade, and maybe U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Much of the world heaped scorn on Biden for his relentless proclamations that war was coming, and that Putin had decided to invade. Here is El Salvador President (and dictator-in-training) Nayib Bukele, a few days before Russia invaded, responding to Biden‚Äôs announcement that Russian commanders had been given the order by Putin to attack:

x These ‚Äúcommanders‚Äù are getting 4 attack orders a week?



The Biden administration is loosing all the credibility it has left.



And yet, a new supposed order that didn‚Äôt happen.



Weird strategy. https://t.co/1PZMiOQTAT ‚Äî Nayib Bukele üá∏üáª (@nayibbukele) February 21, 2022

If you‚Äôre wondering if Bukele ever admitted he was wrong, the answer‚Äîof course‚Äîis no. Just like the myriad people (like Glenn Greenwald and so many Fox News personalities) that relentlessly attacked Biden when he was right all along. (El Salvador did abstain on the U.N. General Assembly vote condemning Russia and its invasion.)

Just imagine: Had Putin held back, Biden would‚Äôve looked the fool. Fox News would‚Äôve had a field day, happy to carry Putin‚Äôs water and do his bidding by continuing to tear Democrats down, while building up Russia-loving Republicans.

Still, it wasn‚Äôt just the punditry and Russia-loving diplomatic establishment that was wrong about Putin. If you take a gander at that news report above, it seems that the Russian political establishment was also caught unaware. And apparently, so was the Russian military, given its sorry state of readiness and performance. With an actual invasion a distant possibility, it was okay to grift grift grift, from the oligarchs delivering broken equipment to military commanders and supply officers pilfering their unit‚Äôs equipment for vodka and other luxuries. I mean, even tire maintenance was severely lacking, to disastrous effect.

Now, if this entire Russian establishment was caught unaware, and the diplomatic world was caught unaware (including clearly, top Russian ally China), then it‚Äôs clear that only a handful of people would‚Äôve known of Putin‚Äôs plans.

Plus Biden. Biden knew. And you know that‚Äôs not driving Putin‚Äôs paranoia to most extreme levels, as it should. Wouldn‚Äôt be surprising if Putin executed his entire inner circle, just in case an American source is among them.",https://www.dailykos.com/story/2022/3/3/2083659/-Ukraine-Update-Everyone-even-in-Russia-was-surprised-that-Putin-invaded-Except-Biden-Biden-knew

My journalists and I were in prisons. The founder of our website was killed in Belarus. Throughout all these years, we have been struggling for the freedom of our country, and the freedom of Ukraine.

We have always supported all the revolutions that took place in Ukraine. Belarusians also died on the Maidan. Now we are with you with all our hearts. Understand us. We are doing everything we can. Today I spoke with Belarusian volunteers, they are traveling from different parts of the world today through Poland to Ukraine to fight for the freedom of your country.

I know that now there are already many Belarusians who are fighting in Ukraine from Mykolaiv to Chernihiv. A large group, a battalion is now being formed near Kyiv. People are fighting, people are ready to die for the freedom of Ukraine. Please remember this. And I want to ask you to distinguish and divide: the Lukashenka regime with his junta and us, Belarusians, because we are with you.

I believe, I know, I am convinced that Belarus will also rise. We will gain our freedom. Belarusians, if you do exist, I see the white-red-white flags, and in 2020 we showed that we are a nation, that we are ready to fight for freedom. We need to finish this.

They are blocking the supply of food, creating a blockade for us, as in the former Leningrad. Deliberately, for seven days, they have been destroying the city's critical life support infrastructure. We again have no light, water and heat. The military of Putin's horde is constantly shelling the city and preventing the evacuation of the wounded, women and children.‚Äù

12:37 A powerful appeal of Ukrainians to the people of Russia.

02:08 US President Joe Biden believes that the destruction of civilian objects in Ukraine from missiles, bombs and shells is not accidental, and the Russian military deliberately attacks civilian areas.

In connection with this Blinken emphasized that the United States very thoroughly follow the situation and document all violations in order to bring Russia to justice.

‚ÄúEach occupier must know: they will obtain from the Ukrainians furious rebuff. Such, and they will memorize forever, that we will keep ours!

We are the people who have broken the enemy's plans. In a week! We broke the plans they've been making for years. Morale deteriorates. Even more, invaders are escaping from us to their homes. I am sincerely enraptured by the Ukrainians, who come empty-handed and expel the occupiers from their cities! We will chase them away with disgrace! As when they attempt to find some food. They are not the soldiers of a state. These are just lost and used children!

Almost 9 thousand killed Russians in one week. They have to take their dead and wounded 19 and 20-year-old people by tens of helicopters from the Nikolayevsk side‚Ä¶

For us, Ukrainians, it is the Patriotic War. We remember how such things start. And we know how they end up for the invaders! They'll be destroyed no matter where they go. The occupiers will get a fight from Ukrainians!""

01:51 There was a video of the detention of Vladimir Ruban, who cooperated with Medvedchuk and the LPR/DPR. The regimental ‚ÄúAzov‚Äù battalion officer captured him in the train destined for Lviv. The arrest took place in the daytime on February 28.
