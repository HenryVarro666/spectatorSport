Tension is building in the Luhansk region as Russian forces gather military machinery and equipment in the region. Chechen militants have entered the region, too.

According to Haidai: ""There has been a significant build-up of tension. We are observing the arrival of a lot of [military] equipment. For the most part, it is unloaded in Debaltseve [a city in the Donetsk region on the border with the Luhansk region] and then brought into our region. Chechen soldiers have already entered the temporarily occupied territory of our region.""

Details: Haidai also noted that Russian forces bring in the Chechen soldiers ""as if they are some creatures from hell.""

""Truth be told, yesterday our troops covered about 50 units of military equipment with artillery fire and shot the headquarters of the Chechen troops. No one was left alive there,"" Haidai said.

He added that the Russian army deploys the Chechen troops to contain and control those soldiers who are mobilised from the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine under the threat of being shot.

Head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration said that he believes that having gathered forces and equipment in the region, Russian troops might go on the offensive in Popasna and Rubizhne.

""Shelling here has intensified. I think that once they gather enough equipment, they will attempt a major breakthrough near Popasna and Rubizhne. Currently they are just constantly deploying these newly accumulated forces on the offensive, in order to break through [the Ukrainian defence] at least somewhere, but they have no success. So they are just shelling everything now,"" he said.

Efforts underway to protect artwork in Lviv’s National Gallery Venice is preparing special material to send to Lviv’s National Art Gallery and other museums in the Ukrainian city so artworks can be better protected during the war. Mariacristina Gribaudi, head of the Venice Civic Museums Foundation, said in a statement Friday that some 65,000 artworks and 2,000 sculptures have been placed in Lviv storerooms as a precaution, but the objects aren’t adequately protected. The Venice foundation will oversee a shipment of special fabric that can cover paintings and graphic art as well as furniture, costumes and materials made from glass or marble to protect the objects from the majority of solvents and gasses. The fabric also impedes mold and fungus growth while the works are in storage. Also being sent are polyethylene foam shock-resistant panels. Venice museums experts also gave advice in a video call with the Lviv gallery’s management about how to best store artworks. Share this -







Russian forces leaving mines behind, Zelenskyy says Zelenskyy says retreating Russian forces leaving mines behind April 2, 2022 01:32 Minefields have been planted in areas where Russian forces have left or been pushed back, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a video address Friday. He said that in northern Ukraine, Russian forces have either left or been pushed back and ""complete catastrophe is left after them."" ""Firstly, the airstrikes can continue,"" Zelenskyy said. ""Secondly, they lay minefields on those territories, in houses, on equipment, even on dead bodies. There are a lot of trip wires, a lot of other dangers."" He said in reclaimed territory, people need to wait until the land is cleared of explosives. There has been some reduction in Russian forces arrayed against Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, but U.S. military officials said Thursday it had not been a wholesale repositioning. On Friday, the mayor of the town of Bucha, northwest of Kyiv, said it was recaptured by Ukrainian forces. Share this -







Ukraine's president warning to Russian 'conscripts': 'We do not need new dead people here' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a video address Friday accused Russia of trying to recruit residents of Crimea to join its army and urged people there to ""sabotage this at any stage."" Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, in a move that sparked condemnation. Many countries, including the U.S., do not recognize it as part of the Russian Federation and consider it part of Ukraine. Zelenskyy also referred to conscription inside Russia, saying in Russian: ""Warn every such conscript, their parents, we do not need new dead people here."" Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday signed a decree for the annual spring draft, in the amount of 134,500, Russia's defense ministry said. There are two drafts a year in Russia. Last year's spring target was slightly higher, at 134,650. Putin had pledged that conscripted soldiers would not be used in Ukraine, which Russia invaded on Feb. 24, but the military later acknowledged that Russian military had used conscripted soldiers there and some had been captured.

Evacuations from Ukrainian cities climb to more than 6,200 people Despite a humanitarian group's failed effort to help civilians evacuate Friday from the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, about 771 people were still able to escape from there and more than 6,200 people nationwide fled through humanitarian corridors, a senior government official said. Many people left using their own cars, although some 42 buses left the city of Berdyansk carrying Mariupol residents en route farther north to the city of Zaporizhia, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said in a Telegram post. Ten buses also arrived Friday in Zaporizhia carrying about 80 tons of humanitarian aid, she added.

Ukraine denies Russia's accusation that it attacked Russian oil depot Ukrainian officials denied Russia's accusation that Ukraine was behind a fiery blast at an oil depot Friday in the Russian city of Belgorod, which would mark the first instance of Ukrainian forces launching an airstrike on Russian soil since the invasion of Ukraine began. ""For some reason they say that we did it, but according to our information this does not correspond to reality,"" Ukraine Security Council Secretary Oleksiy Danilov said on Ukrainian television. Footage verified by NBC News showed a large fire at the oil and natural gas fuel depot. NBC News, however, could not independently verify the claim that Ukrainian forces were responsible. Russia's Defense Ministry reiterated its claim that Ukraine was to blame for the blast, which they said occurred at 5 a.m. local time. Two Ukrainian helicopters fired missiles at the storage facility on the outskirts of the city, and led tanks on the site to catch fire, officials said. ""The oil depot has nothing to do with the Russian armed forces,"" Igor Konashenkov, a Defense Ministry spokesman, said. Share this -







Kyiv mayor: Nearby towns still under siege KYIV, Ukraine – The mayor of Kyiv said the bombardment of satellite towns near the Ukrainian capital was ongoing despite Russian promises of scaling back troops from the region. Vitali Klitschko told British broadcaster Sky News on Friday he could hear the sounds of explosions “nonstop during the day and night.” Klitschko said that the cities northwest of Kyiv such as Irpin, Borodyanka and Hostomel were being targeted after Ukrainian fighters moved back Russian troops, and that fighting also persisted in Brovary, east of Kyiv. For those who may want to return to Kyiv in light of the supposed Russian withdrawal, he urged people to wait a “couple of weeks” to see how the situation develops. Share this -







Antigua says it is willing to help U.K. seize Abramovich yachts Antigua and Barbuda is willing to help Britain seize yachts owned by sanctioned Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, the Caribbean nation said on Friday, adding London must seek such assistance via an international treaty. The vessels Halo and Garcon, currently moored in Antigua and Barbuda, were owned by Abramovich via a British Virgin Islands company that was on the Britain's sanctions list. The Financial Times first was first reported the story. Antigua alone would have no way to seize or detain the vessels because they have not been linked to any crimes committed there, said Ronald Sanders, the country's ambassador to the United States. Doing so would require a formal request under the two countries' mutual legal assistance treaty, a common mechanism by which nations cooperate with one another to help enforce laws. ""We've said that we're quite happy to cooperate, but under the rule of law,"" Sanders said in a telephone interview. Share this -

Red Cross unable to reach Mariupol to help evacuate civilians The International Committee of the Red Cross said a convoy sent Friday to the besieged southern Ukrainian port city of Mariupol was unable to get passage to help civilians evacuate, while local officials accused Russia of failing to abide by a promise of a humanitarian corridor. The Red Cross said it would attempt to send its three vehicles and nine personnel to Mariupol on Saturday, but for the operation to succeed, ""it is critical that the parties respect the agreements and provide the necessary conditions and security guarantees."" Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of the Donetsk regional military administration, said on Ukrainian television that the city remained under a blockade that has not allowed movement. ""Humanitarian deliveries, despite all the agreements and promises of the Russian side, are not being carried out,"" Kyrylenko said. ""The humanitarian corridor ... is essentially not operational.""

U.S. nuclear missile test cancelled to avoid Russian 'misinterpretation' WASHINGTON ⁠— A U.S. test launch of a missile that can deliver nuclear warheads to Russia has been canceled to avoid “misinterpretation” by the Russians, say Pentagon officials. The officials said the test launch of the Minuteman III was canceled because of concerns Vladimir Putin could view it as escalatory. Minuteman missiles have formed the core of the U.S. land-based nuclear capability for 60 years. The launch had already been postponed once in March, and then was expected to occur in April. “The Department of the Air Force recently cancelled the routinely planned test flight of an LGM-30G Minuteman III missile,” Pentagon Deputy Press Secretary Todd Breasseale said in a statement to NBC News. “The launch had been previously delayed due to an overabundance of caution to avoid misinterpretation or miscommunication during the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.” On March 2, in announcing that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had ordered the postponement, Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said Austin wanted to show the U.S. was “a responsible nuclear power” with “no intention of engaging in any actions that can be misunderstood or misconstrued.” The Air Force generally tests four Minuteman III rockets per year from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. The tests are planned months and even years in advance and canceling or postponing one because of concerns the launch could be provocative is very rare. Share this -







Some progress made in peace talks with Ukraine, Russia says Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Friday that some progress had been made during another round of negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, but that ""peace talks inevitably have to continue."" Lavrov, who spoke publicly at the end of a visit to India, said Ukraine and Russia came closer to an understanding on the impossibility of Ukraine joining NATO and the need for its nuclear neutrality. He added that there was an increased understanding between the status of Crimea, which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014. Lavrov's comments on the latest peace talks diverge from earlier remarks this week made by Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov, who said that Russia had welcomed Kyiv making demands for an end to the fighting but there was no breakthrough between the two sides.

Ukraine won't confirm or deny involvement in Russia blast Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on Friday declined to confirm or deny allegations that his country was responsible for an air strike on an oil depot in Russia on Friday. “I can neither confirm nor reject the claim that Ukraine was involved in this simply because I do not possess all the military information,” Kuleba said in response to reporters’ questions. The minister's comments came after the governor of Belgorod, which is near the border with Ukraine, blamed the explosion on an air strike carried out by two Ukrainian helicopters.

Russia warns it will only trade agricultural products with friendly countries Russia, a major global wheat exporter, will only export its agricultural products to countries it deems friendly, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said Friday. ""We will not be trading foods with our non-friends,"" he said in a post on Telegram. ""Not exporting, not importing."" Medvedev, a senior security official for the Kremlin, added that Russia will only conduct those transactions in rubles or the national currency of the trading country. He also proposed that Russia expand the list of banned imports from Western countries. Russia already supplies wheat primarily to Africa and the Middle East and poses a trade rivalry with Ukraine, the world's second-largest exporter of grain. Food is a ""quiet but ominous"" weapon, Medvedev added. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development predicted Thursday that the war will increase the vulnerability of food security in the Middle East and Africa. Share this -

China accuses U.S. of instigating the war in Ukraine China is accusing the United States of instigating the war in Ukraine and says NATO should have been disbanded following the break-up of the Soviet Union. “As the culprit and leading instigator of the Ukraine crisis, the U.S. has led NATO to engage in five rounds of eastward expansion in the last two decades after 1999,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian told reporters at a daily briefing Friday. “The number of NATO members increased from 16 to 30, and they have moved eastward more than 600 miles to somewhere near the Russian border, pushing Russia to the wall step by step,” Zhao said. While China says it is not taking sides in the conflict, it has declared a “no limits” partnership with Moscow, has refused to condemn the invasion, opposes sanctions on Russia and routinely amplifies Russian disinformation about the conflict, including not referring to it as an invasion or a war in keeping with Russian practice.

Russia blames Ukraine for oil depot blast in Belgorod A Russian official has blamed a blast at an oil depot in its city of Belgorod on Friday on an airstrike by two Ukrainian helicopters.

Nobody was killed or injured in the attack, he added in a statement on his official Telegram channel.

Mariupol aid efforts blocked amid fresh evacuation push, Ukrainian officials say Ukrainian officials have accused Russian forces of blocking aid from reaching the besieged port city of Mariupol, where fresh evacuation efforts are expected to get underway today. Petro Andryushchenko, aide to the mayor of Mariupol, said Friday morning that Russian forces were blocking the delivery of aid into Mariupol. “The city remains closed to entry and very dangerous to exit with its own transport,” he further warned on Telegram.

In an overnight video address, Zelensky said there was an “accumulation” of Russian troops in the Donbas, a region in eastern Ukraine claimed by pro-Russian secessionists, and cautioned his people not to read too deeply into recent peace talks.

Leaders around the world were also scrambling to address a deepening global energy crisis triggered by steep international sanctions on Russia. On Thursday, as Europe grappled with low stockpiles of fuel, President Biden announced that the United States will release a million barrels of oil a day from the nation’s strategic petroleum reserve for six months in a bid to control energy prices.

As the war entered its sixth week, Zelensky dismissed Russia’s claims that it was drawing down its forces in the north — where local officials near Chernihiv and the capital of Kyiv have reported days of intense shelling — as “verbal constructions.”

Russian troops are not conducting a withdrawal but facing “the consequences of exile” at the hands of Ukrainian fighters, he said. “Yes, there is an ongoing negotiation process. But these are still words.”

In the east, Ukrainian military leaders said they were preparing for an all-out assault by Russian forces.

“We clearly feel that the transfer of [military] technology in our direction is beginning now,” Serhiy Haidai, the head of the regional military administration in Luhansk, said on Ukrainian television. “And as the equipment and personnel are being turned over, our enemies are simply firing more densely, powerfully.

“Everything is already involved here: aircraft, artillery, heavy-caliber weapons, mortars — all settlements are being shelled.”

The British Ministry of Defense on Thursday predicted heavy fighting in and outside the capital, saying that “Russian forces continue to hold positions to the east and west of Kyiv despite the withdrawal of a limited number of units.”

At the same time, Jeremy Fleming, head of Britain’s intelligence agency, said morale was so low among Russian soldiers that they were committing self-sabotage.

“We’ve seen Russian soldiers — short of weapons and morale — refusing to carry out orders, sabotaging their own equipment and even accidentally shooting down their own aircraft,” he said Thursday in a speech in Canberra, Australia.

During a news conference in Brussels, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Kyiv was still in danger: “Russia has repeatedly lied about its intentions,” he said. “So we can only judge Russia on its actions, not on its words.”

Still, Ukrainian forces appeared to make some progress.

Energoatom, which oversees the country’s nuclear power plants, said Russian forces had withdrawn from Chernobyl, the site of the world’s worst nuclear power plant disaster in 1986. A senior defense official confirmed on Thursday that Russian troops had drawn down in the area, which they had taken over in the first few days of the war.

× Energoatom, which oversees Ukraine’s nuclear power plants, said that Russian forces had withdrawn from Chernobyl.

Ukrainian media reported that Russian soldiers had been exposed to radiation while digging trenches. The International Atomic Energy Agency, however, released a statement saying it has not been able to confirm those reports.

Meanwhile, Zelensky addressed the Belgian Parliament urging its leaders to help with “weapons, sanctions, membership of the European Union.“

“We need to know that Ukraine will be in the European Union, because if we are, they will lose,” Zelensky said referring to Russian forces. “But if we lose, if we lose Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities, there will no longer be a strong European Union because tyranny will come and take away from you that which you have and you are proud of. This is not a threat, this is reality.”

In the battered city of Mariupol, where government officials have described scenes of desperation as residents struggle to leave for safe zones and wait hours in line for food and water, Russia and Ukraine agreed to a temporary cease-fire to evacuate civilians, both sides said Thursday.

The Russian Defense Ministry said its troops, which have set up checkpoints on a main artery, would allow Ukrainians to move inland to Zaporizhzhia via the Russian-controlled port city of Berdyansk. Russia said it would cooperate with the United Nations and Red Cross to allow for the evacuations.

Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said 45 buses were ready to transport families. “We will do everything possible to ensure that buses arrive in Mariupol today and pick up people who have not yet been able to get out of the city,” Vereshchuk said in a Facebook video.

It was unclear late Thursday whether the evacuation route from Mariupol, where the mayor has said the death toll tops 5,000 and satellite images show entire neighborhoods razed, had opened and, if so, for how long. Of the 430,000 people who lived there before the war, about three-quarters have already fled.

In a statement late Thursday, the Red Cross said it was “standing by” to aid in evacuations if Russia and Ukraine could “agree to the exact terms, including the route, the start time and the duration.”

Ukraine has accused Russia of routinely blocking aid routes into the city, where Russian troops are spread out, although Ukraine still controls the city center. Local officials also said this week that Russians had shelled a Red Cross building that bore a red cross against a white background on the roof.

If overtaken, Mariupol could form a key part of a strategic passage for Russia to Crimea. Russia seized the peninsula in 2014 but has no land routes connecting to it.

In the northeastern city of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-most populous, regional Gov. Oleh Sinegubov said there was shelling overnight.

“Over the past day, Russian troops have struck 47 times with artillery, mortar, tank and strikes” around the city, Sinegubov said on the Telegram messaging app.

In Dnipropetrovsk, a region in central Ukraine, an official said missiles struck Ukrainian troops Thursday, killing two people, wounding five and wiping out a fuel depot.

After the talks with Russians on Tuesday in Istanbul, Zelensky said he was open to negotiating the status of Crimea as part of a peace process to end Russian aggression. The president said he was also ready to talk about the Donbas, and indicated a willingness to give up Ukraine’s aspirations to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Zelensky said a national vote would be required on NATO and territorial changes.

In exchange, Russia said it would “drastically” reduce its troops around Kyiv and Chernihiv, but missiles have continued to rain down. Russian state media also reported that President Vladimir Putin had ordered the draft of nearly 135,000 new conscripts.

The White House this week described Putin’s drawn-out war, which has led to a historic humanitarian crisis with more than 4 million Ukrainian refugees, as a “strategic blunder.” It said Putin has been “misled by the Russian military” about setbacks.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov shot back Thursday, saying Washington’s “complete misunderstanding” of Putin could result in “bad consequences.”

“Neither the State Department nor the Pentagon have real information about what is happening in the Kremlin. They do not understand President Putin, they do not understand the decision-making mechanism and they do not understand the efforts of our work,” Peskov said.

Biden, at a White House event touting his plan to reduce gas prices, elaborated on Putin being misinformed by his advisors in response to a question from a reporter.

“There’s a lot of speculation, but he seems to be — I’m not saying this with a certainty — he seems to be self-isolating. And there’s some indication that he has fired or put under house arrest some of his advisors,” Biden said. “But I don’t want to put too much stock in that at this time, because we don’t have that much hard evidence.”

Russian and Ukrainian representatives are set to meet again Friday via videoconference. It will be the sixth round of negotiations since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.

Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said his nation also planned to host a meeting between the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, and his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov. Speaking to a Turkish news channel, Cavusoglu did not give a date for the meeting but said it could be within weeks.

KYIV, Ukraine -- Russian troops handed control of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant back to the Ukrainians and left the heavily contaminated site early today, more than a month after taking it over, Ukrainian authorities said, as fighting raged on the outskirts of Kyiv and other fronts.

Ukraine's state power company, Energoatom, said the pullout at Chernobyl came after soldiers received ""significant doses"" of radiation from digging trenches in the forest in the exclusion zone around the closed plant. But there was no independent confirmation of that.

The withdrawal took place amid growing indications the Kremlin is using talk of de-escalation in Ukraine as cover while regrouping, resupplying its forces and redeploying them for a stepped-up offensive in the eastern part of the country.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russian withdrawals from the north and center of the country were just a military tactic and that the forces are building up for new powerful attacks in the southeast.

""We know their intentions,"" Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address to the nation. ""We know that they are moving away from those areas where we hit them in order to focus on other, very important ones where it may be difficult for us.""

Zelenskyy said there was an ""accumulation"" of Russian troops in Donbas, a region in eastern Ukraine claimed by pro-Russian secessionists, and cautioned his people not to read too deeply into recent peace talks. He and Western officials continued to cast doubt on Moscow's pronouncements of a partial military pullback around Kyiv, the capital.

""There will be battles ahead,"" he added.

Zelenskyy dismissed Russia's claims that it was drawing down its forces in the north -- where local officials near Kyiv and Chernihiv have reported days of intense shelling -- as ""verbal constructions.""

Russian troops are not conducting a withdrawal but facing ""the consequences of exile"" at the hands of Ukrainian fighters, he said. ""Yes, there is an ongoing negotiation process. But these are still words.""

Meanwhile, a convoy of buses headed to Mariupol in another bid to evacuate people from the besieged port city after the Russian military agreed to a limited cease-fire in the area. But Russian forces blocked 45 of the buses, and only 631 people were able to get out of the city in private cars, according to the Ukrainian government.

Twelve Ukrainian trucks were able to deliver humanitarian supplies to Mariupol, but they were all seized by Russian troops, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said late Thursday.

A new round of talks was scheduled for today, five weeks into the war that has left thousands dead and driven 4 million Ukrainians from the country.

CHERNOBYL

The International Atomic Energy Agency said it had been informed by Ukraine that the Russian forces at the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster had transferred control of it in writing to the Ukrainians.

The last Russian troops left the Chernobyl plant early today, the Ukrainian government agency responsible for the exclusion zone said.

Energoatom gave no details on the condition of the soldiers it said were exposed to radiation and did not say how many were affected. There was no immediate comment from the Kremlin, and the atomic energy agency said it had not been able to confirm the reports of Russian troops receiving high doses. It said it was seeking more information.

Russian forces seized the Chernobyl site in the opening stages of the Feb. 24 invasion, raising fears that they would cause damage or disruption that could spread radiation. The workforce at the site oversees the safe storage of spent fuel rods and the concrete-entombed ruins of the reactor that exploded in 1986.

Edwin Lyman, a nuclear expert with the U.S.-based Union of Concerned Scientists, said it ""seems unlikely"" a large number of troops would develop severe radiation illness, but it was impossible to know for sure without more details.

He said contaminated material was probably buried or covered with new topsoil during the cleanup of Chernobyl, and some soldiers may have been exposed to a ""hot spot"" of radiation while digging. Others may have assumed they were at risk too, he said.

Early this week, the Russians said they would significantly scale back military operations in areas around Kyiv and the northern city of Chernihiv to increase trust between the two sides and help negotiations along.

But in the Kyiv suburbs, regional governor Oleksandr Palviuk said on social media Thursday that Russian forces shelled Irpin and Makariv and that there were battles around Hostomel. Pavliuk said there were Ukrainian counterattacks and some Russian withdrawals around the suburb of Brovary to the east.

Chernihiv came under attack as well. At least one person was killed and four were wounded in the Russian shelling of a humanitarian convoy of buses sent to Chernihiv to evacuate residents cut off from food, water and other supplies, said Ukrainian Human Rights Commissioner Lyudmyla Denisova.

In the east, Ukrainian military leaders said they were preparing for an all-out assault by Russian forces.

""We clearly feel that the transfer of [military] technology in our direction is beginning now,"" Serhiy Haidai, the head of the regional military administration in Luhansk, said. ""And as the equipment and personnel are being turned over, our enemies are simply firing more densely, powerfully.

""Everything is already involved here: aircraft, artillery, heavy-caliber weapons, mortars -- all settlements are being shelled.""

The British Ministry of Defense on Thursday predicted ""heavy fighting"" in and outside the capital, saying that ""Russian forces continue to hold positions to the east and west of Kyiv despite the withdrawal of a limited number of units.""

Ukraine also reported Russian artillery barrages in and around the northeastern city of Kharkiv.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said intelligence indicates Russia is not scaling back its military operations in Ukraine but is instead trying to regroup, resupply its forces and reinforce its offensive in the Donbas.

""Russia has repeatedly lied about its intentions,"" Stoltenberg said. At the same time, he said, pressure is being kept up on Kyiv and other cities, and ""we can expect additional offensive actions bringing even more suffering.""

In the past few days, the Kremlin said that its ""main goal"" now is gaining control of the Donbas, which consists of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, including Mariupol.

The top rebel leader in Donetsk, Denis Pushilin, issued an order to set up a rival city government for Mariupol, according to Russian state news agencies.

Tens of thousands have managed to get out of Mariupol in the past few weeks by way of humanitarian corridors, reducing its population from a prewar 430,000 to an estimated 100,000 as of last week, but other efforts to relieve the city have been thwarted by continued Russian attacks.

After talks with Russians on Tuesday in Istanbul, Zelenskyy said he was open to negotiating the status of Crimea as part of a peace process to end Russian aggression. The president said he was also ready to talk about the Donbas, and indicated a willingness to give up Ukraine's aspirations to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Zelenskyy said a national vote would be required on NATO and territorial changes.

In exchange, Russia said it would ""drastically"" reduce its troops around Kyiv and Chernihiv, a hard-hit northern city, but missiles have continued to rain down. Russian state media also reported that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered the draft of nearly 135,000 new conscripts.

Putin said that conditions weren't yet ""ripe"" for a cease-fire and that he wasn't ready for a meeting with Zelenskyy until negotiators do more work, Italian Premier Mario Draghi said after a telephone conversation with the Russian leader.

APPEAL TO AUSTRALIA

Zelenskyy appealed directly to Australian lawmakers Thursday for more help in its war against Russia, including armored vehicles and tougher sanctions.

Zelenskyy has been tailoring his message to individual countries through video appeals like the one shown to legislators in the Australian Parliament. Lawmakers gave him standing ovation at the start and end of his 16-minute address.

Zelenskyy specifically asked for Australian-manufactured Bushmaster four-wheel-drive armored vehicles.

""You have very good armed personnel vehicles, Bushmasters, that could help Ukraine substantially, and other pieces of equipment,"" Zelenskyy said.

While the Ukrainian capital Kyiv was 9,300 miles from the Australian capital Canberra, Zelenskyy said Australia was not safe from the conflict which threatened to escalate into a nuclear war.

""The most terrible thing is that if we don't stop Russia now, if we don't hold Russia accountable, then some other countries of the world who are looking forward to similar wars against their neighbors will decide that such things are possible for them as well,"" Zelenskyy said.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said afterwards that Australia will send the Bushmasters to Ukraine. He told reporters the vehicles will be flown over on Boeing C-17 Globemaster transport planes. He didn't specify how many would be sent or when.

SOCCER WAR

The appearance by video of the head of Ukrainian soccer, wearing an armored vest from the streets of Kyiv, brought the impact of Russia's war into the FIFA Congress on Thursday.

""We have regularly received sad news of the deaths of members of the Ukrainian football community,"" Andriy Pavelko said in a recorded message to the gathering in Qatar including delegates from Russia.

""They have been killed by the aggressors' rockets from one of the biggest army in the world. Football has taken a back seat in our country.""

Kyiv hosted the Champions League final only four years ago. Then the soccer world shifted to Russia in 2018 for a World Cup that FIFA President Gianni Infantino still celebrated Thursday as ""a great success sportingly and culturally.""

""Obviously it did not solve the problems of the world,"" Infantino said. ""It did not even solve the problems in the region. It did not create a lasting peace.""

Infantino did not mention the man he was filmed juggling a ball with and praising in 2018: Putin. Nor did Infantino mention Russia in his speech.

There was a plea to ""stop conflicts and wars"" generally rather than specifically issuing a direct message to Putin, who awarded Infantino Russia's Order of Friendship medal after the World Cup. And in the Doha audience was Alexey Sorokin, the chief executive of Russia's 2018 organizing committee and former member of the FIFA Council.

There was an expression of regret from Sorokin but only that Pavelko ""has these emotions"" in the video address.

""It is difficult for them, we understand that,"" Sorokin said. ""But I'm here not to discuss politics or military activities or anything, I am here in the FIFA Congress.""

Russia won't be in the draw for the World Cup on Friday after being disqualified from playing internationally by FIFA over the war. Ukraine can still qualify but its playoff semifinal against Scotland has been postponed until June with the hope the team will be in a position to return to the field by then.

For now, the priority for Ukraine is protecting the country from Russia as Pavelko told the FIFA Congress.

""Our children have suffered terrible psychological injuries. Perhaps football will help them forget the horrors of war,"" he said. ""I believe every word, prayer and action in support of Ukraine and against the war can stop it.

A Ukrainian photojournalist who worked for a number of major Western news outlets including Reuters and the BBC has been killed by Russian forces near Kyiv, the office of Ukraine’s attorney general said Saturday.

The body of Maksym (Maks) Levin – who had been capturing the ongoing conflict – was found with two gunshot wounds in the Vyshgorod district which sits just north of the capital, the attorney general’s office said in a Facebook post, citing preliminary reports.

“According to the preliminary information, the soldiers of the Russian Armed Forces killed the unarmed Maksym Levin with two gunshots,” it claimed. His next of kin have been informed, the office told CNN.

Photographer Markiian Lyseiko told CNN that he was last in touch with his friend, known as Maks, on March 12, the day before he went missing in a district north of Kyiv, where he had been reporting on the fighting and fleeing civilians.

In their final conversations, Lyseiko said that Levin had asked him to come to the Ukrainian capital so they could cover the war together.

Lyseiko, who worked alongside Levin since 2014 documenting the war in Donbas, where they embedded with Ukrainian soldiers for weeks at a time, described his friend in an interview with CNN on March 24 as an energetic and tenacious reporter, who often looked like he “had no fear.”

Since the war broke out eight years ago, Levin wanted to show the world what was happening in Ukraine, especially to Russia, Lyseiko said.

“The best way to understand Maks is to look at his work,” Lyseiko said. “When you watch Maks’ films or see his photos, you will understand him, without words.”

A criminal investigation is being carried out by the Vyshgorod District prosecutor's office into alleged violations of “laws and customs of war,” the attorney general’s office said, adding that “measures are being taken to establish all circumstances of the crime.”

Levin began working as a photojournalist in 2006, according to his bio on LensCulture, a photography resources website. He worked for Ukrainian news outlet LB.ua and was “well-known” in his field, having collaborated with Reuters, BBC, TRT World and Associated Press, according to the attorney general’s office.

In a statement online, LB.ua said Levin is survived by four sons, a civil partner and elderly parents. LB.ua said that in addition to journalism, Levin worked on dozens of photo and video projects for humanitarian organizations such as the World Health Organization, UNICEF and UN Women.

In his bio, Levin described himself as a “documentary photographer/videographer, father, human being.”

The Reuters news agency on Saturday said it is “deeply saddened” over Levin's death.

“We are deeply saddened to hear of the death of Maksym Levin, a long-time contributor to Reuters, in Ukraine,” John Pullman, Reuters' global managing editor for visuals, said in a statement to CNN.

“Maks has provided compelling photos and video from Ukraine to Reuters since 2013. His death is a huge loss to the world of journalism.

22:47 Oleksiy Arestovich, advisor to the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, believes that the outcome of this war will be decided in 2-3 weeks.

""I think everything will turn out in our favor. They don’t have a reserve to continue this phase actively. It will take at least 2-3 months to gather these reserves. Sanctions will finish off the economy. That is, now it should be decided within 2-3 weeks. I often said 2-3 weeks, but this is from the beginning of the second phase. Now it begins. I think they should actively leave in three days, and after that 2 weeks will decide everything,"" Arestovich said during a visit to Irpen, liberated from the invaders.

He also added that, in his opinion, the Russian troops will no longer return to the north of the Kyiv region:

""They will definitely not return here. Because in order to return here, you need to at least create the same grouping, which they are not capable of. They do not have a mobilization potential.""

22:38 Today in Dnipro, in the Ashan store, which is located in the Dafi mall, a one-person picket was held.

22:22 The United States will facilitate the transfer of Soviet tanks to Ukraine, CNN reports, citing a source familiar with the plan.

The White House is expected to facilitate the transfer of Soviet tanks to Ukraine. Officials declined to say how many of the tanks would eventually make their way to Ukraine, or when.

The invaders paid the price for intensifying the offensive in several directions at once.

21:57 The head of the Ukrainian negotiating group David Arakhamia commented on the course of the negotiations:

— conceptually, there is nothing new in the negotiation process at the moment;

— the Russian Federation gave an official response to the Ukrainian position, voiced in Istanbul. This answer is as follows: the position is accepted, with the exception of the issue of Crimea;

— Foreign Minister Dmiytro Kuleba said that he was waiting for confirmation (of the Russian reaction to our position on Crimea) in writing, so far there has been no oral confirmation. At the same time, according to Arakhamia, yesterday, verbally during a video conference, ""we heard that the Russian side is not against such a position and we are moving forward more from a legal point of view"";

— According to Arakhamia, the Russian side confirmed the thesis of the Ukrainian delegation that the draft documents have been developed enough to conduct direct consultations between the two leaders of the countries, that is, with the presidents of Ukraine and the Russian Federation;

— now the task is to quickly work out some final stage not of the document itself, but of those issues that have already been touched upon and to prepare a possible meeting of the presidents;

— Turkish President Erdogan called both Zelensky and Putin yesterday and confirmed for his part that they were ready to organize a meeting in the near future. Therefore, with a high degree of probability, the meeting will be held in Istanbul;

— There are active consultations with potential security guarantees. Officially, the three NATO countries agreed to provide (guarantees) exactly in the format in which Ukraine offers (Turkey, Germany, Italy). It is also important to obtain guarantees from the UK and the US;

— it is important that nuclear states enter the pool of guarantors. Ukraine is negotiating with China through diplomatic channels. The state of negotiations with China is the least ready when compared with countries that actively help, but Arakhamia expects that China will still enter the pool of guarantors.

21:51 The Ukrainian security forces are inspecting the downed Ka-52 helicopter of the Russian Aerospace Forces.

Also in the postscript, he added ""conspiracy theory fans"", what are you doing out there? Sleeping?"", which was an irony over recent rumors that there is a conflict between him and Zaluzhny.

19:49 Advisor to the President of Ukraine on economic issues Oleh Ustenko said on the air of the telethon that the Ukrainian government is considering the possibility of introducing an unconditional basic income for the population.

That is, the regular payment by the state of a certain amount from the budget to each citizen just like that — without any conditions and the need to work off the money received. Ustenko did not specify what amount he was talking about.

""The possibility of introducing the so-called unconditional income for the population for a long time is being considered — this was discussed before the war, but did not find support, now it should and will work. This issue is not just being considered, we already have an understanding of where to move in this direction,"" Ustenko said.

19:41 Almost the entire Luhansk region was left without gas, because a gas pipeline near Severodonetsk was damaged during the fighting, — said the chairman of the Luhansk regional state administration Serhiy Haidai.
