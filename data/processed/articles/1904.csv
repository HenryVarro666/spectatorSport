0,e22f9aea-69a2-4a34-897b-5a149b93c54f,[],,"Russia's Defense Ministry warned on April 15 that it will intensify attacks on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, after accusing Ukraine of targeting Russian border towns.

The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making “the most important decision of their life -- to fight.”

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.”

Zelenskiy noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.”

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

If you are catching up on the latest developments in the Ukraine-Russia conflict, here's what you should know:

From Mariupol: Denis Pushilin, the head of the separatist Donetsk People’s Republic, has ordered the formation of a city administration for the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol, according to a decree published on the DPR head’s website on Thursday, Russian state news agency TASS reported Thursday.

The city is within the boundaries of the Donetsk region of Ukraine. The city was under Ukrainian government control before the war, but the Russian government — which recognized the independence of the DPR in late February — considers the entire region to belong to the separatist republic.

Meanwhile, the evacuation corridor in Mariupol agreed by Ukrainian and Russian officials, announced on Thursday, is “insufficient” to allow the rescue of civilians “in the right conditions,” France said.

Rubles for Russian gas: According to a newly signed decree, gas buyers from ""unfriendly countries"" will need to open and pay from ruble accounts in Russian banks, President Vladimir Putin announced. France, Germany and the UK made statements to say they will not pay for Russian gas in rubles.

Russia withdraws from Chernobyl: The site of the world's worst nuclear disaster in 1986 and its surrounding territory fell into the hands of Russian troops in the first week of the war in Ukraine. But in a Telegram post made on Thursday, Energoatom, the state enterprise overseeing Ukraine’s nuclear power plants, said that Russian troops announced their intention to leave and hand over control to Ukrainian personnel. The US is also seeing Russian forces “drawing down” from Chernobyl and from the north and northwest of Kyiv, a senior US defense official told reporters Thursday.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asked the Belgian government to help with “weapons, sanctions, membership of the European Union,"" adding, ""maybe soon the future will pay you back.” By the end of Thursday, Zelensky will have addressed 17 global parliaments in a bid to drum up support during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

NATO secretary-general says Russian troops ""are not withdrawing but repositioning"": Speaking at a news conference in Brussels for the secretary general’s 2021 Annual Report, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that according to intelligence, “Russian units are not withdrawing but repositioning. Russia is trying to regroup, resupply and reinforce its offensive in the Donbas region. At the same time, Russia maintains pressure on Kyiv and other cities ... we can expect additional offensive actions bringing even more suffering,” Stoltenberg said.",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-31-22/h_efc48b8dd85ba4af73e8f402c43e3cf0

BUCHA, Ukraine — The Russian forces that were intent on overwhelming Kyiv at the war’s start with tanks and artillery retreated under fire across a broad front on Saturday, leaving behind them dead soldiers and burned vehicles, according to witnesses, Ukrainian officials, satellite images and military analysts.

The withdrawal suggested the possibility of a major turn in the six-week war — the collapse, at least for now, of Russia’s initial attempt to seize Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, and the end of its hopes for the quick subjugation of the nation.

Moscow has described the withdrawal as a tactical move to regroup and reposition its forces for a major push in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. While there are early indications that the military is following through on that plan, analysts say it cannot obscure the magnitude of the defeat.

“The initial Russian operation was a failure and one of its central goals — the capture of Kyiv — proved unobtainable for Russian forces,” Michael Kofman, the director of Russian studies at C.N.A., a research institute in Arlington, Va., said in a telephone interview Saturday.

Elsewhere in Ukraine, Russian attacks continued unabated, and the Pentagon has cautioned that the formations near Kyiv could be repositioning for renewed assaults.

In the south, an aid convoy organized by the International Committee of the Red Cross that had stalled on its way to bring some relief to the besieged city of Mariupol was on the move again. The hope, repeatedly frustrated by Russian shelling, was to bring emergency supplies to trapped residents and to evacuate hundreds of those who have endured weeks of bombardment that has left shortages of food and water.

In the suburban towns north of Kyiv, the Ukrainian army was advancing through a tableau of destruction, with dozens of wrecked tanks on streets, extensive damage to buildings and the bodies of civilians still lying uncollected. Kyiv and its surroundings, which had echoed with artillery booms and gunfire for weeks, had gone quiet.

Ukraine’s military on Saturday moved into Bucha, a key town on the west bank of the Dnipro River — which divides Kyiv — days after Russian forces had sacked it on their way out.

“They went from apartment to apartment collecting televisions and computers, loaded them on their tanks and left,” Svetlana Semenova, a retiree, said of the Russian departure, which she described as chaotic. “They left in a hurry.”

A few dozen people who had been living mostly in basements for a month staggered outside to collect food — bags of potatoes and bread — brought by Ukrainian soldiers.

Elena Shur, 43, an accountant for Ukraine’s national airline, said the first sign of the Ukrainian military came on Friday, when a civilian car carrying soldiers drove through town waving the country’s flag.

“We saw people on the street, and soldiers,” Ms. Shur said. “I cried.”

Reporters counted six bodies of civilians on the streets and sidewalks of Bucha. It was unclear under what circumstances they had died, but the discarded packaging of a Russian military ration was lying beside one man who had been shot in the head.

As photos of casualties in Bucha emerged, a senior adviser to Ukraine’s president said on Saturday that some of the dead wearing civilian clothes appeared to have been bound and executed.

“The bodies of people with tied hands, who were shot dead by soldiers lie in the streets,” the adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said on Twitter. “These people were not in the military. They had no weapons. They posed no threat.” He included an image of a scene, photographed by Agence France-Presse, showing three bodies on the side of a road, one with hands apparently tied behind the back. The New York Times was unable to independently verify Mr. Podolyak’s claim the people had been executed.

The town was the site of a major Ukrainian ambush of a Russian armored column in the first days of the war, and one street was blocked by dozens of incinerated tanks and trucks.

Despite that setback, the Russians had captured Bucha and held it for about a month. They executed half a dozen members of the Territorial Defense Force — the volunteer army many Ukrainians joined when the war started — leaving the bodies in a heavily mined part of town, said Varvara Kaminskaya, 69.

The Ukrainians have advanced at least another 15 miles to the northwest of Bucha, where they now fly Ukrainian flags over former Russian checkpoints.

After their initial assault on the capital failed, the Russian army had dug into defensive positions outside of Kyiv, suggesting an intention to hold a front line near the city. In an artillery war, trenches afford soldiers the best chance of survival.

Those were abandoned in and around Bucha on Saturday. On the northern edge of town were the abandoned berms that had sheltered Russian artillery emplacements, surrounded by green boxes and hundreds of empty shell cases.

“According to our information, they are running away from all areas around Kyiv,” said Sgt. Ihor Zaichuk, the commander of the 1st company of the 2nd Azov battalion in the Ukrainian army, which fought in Bucha.

“They can say on their own television stations, if they want, that they are the second most powerful army in the world,” he said. “But they aren’t anymore.”

He cautioned, however, that the Russians might return. “Only their commanders know if they will be re-equipped and return.” Even as cars lined up on some roads, making their way back into Kyiv, workers were building new defenses from heavy logs.

On the east bank of the Dnipro, Ukrainian forces were pressing forward in villages dozens of miles from the capital, according to an intelligence officer with the S.B.U., the Ukrainian domestic intelligence service, who declined to be identified for security reasons.

Analysts said that Moscow’s stated decision to refocus its military on the Donbas in eastern Ukraine is likely to be accurate, but mostly because they had little option.

“The Russians are adjusting their goals to reality,” Lawrence Freedman, emeritus professor of war studies at King’s College London, said in an interview on Saturday. “I think they know they’re in trouble, so I don’t think it’s a ruse to say they’re concentrating on the Donbas, because in reality that’s all they can do.”

Mr. Kofman, the expert on the Russian military, said the Russian army had lost about 2,000 pieces of equipment that was either destroyed, captured or abandoned, including about 350 tanks.

As the Russians retreated, they left mines and booby traps behind in an effort to slow the Ukrainians’ pursuit, according to Ukrainian officers in different towns. In the suburb of Irpin, which the Ukrainians had recaptured before Bucha, demining operations were in full swing on Saturday. Some civilian bodies had been booby-trapped to kill emergency workers, Ukrainian officials said.

One group of military engineers, dressed in heavy blue Kevlar armor, had tied a rope to a body. They pulled on it, to see if the motion would trigger booby traps. By late in the day, however, the body remained there, with the engineers apparently unable to ascertain if it was safe to collect.

In the village of Dmytrivka, west of the capital, there were signs of a hasty Russian retreat from a scene of carnage. On a forest road leading out of the village, nine tanks and armored vehicles lay destroyed and gutted by fire, the detritus of a tank battle three days earlier. The turrets and heavy guns of two tanks lay tossed aside. Inside one armored personnel carrier, the burned human remains of men were visible.

Valentina Yatsevich, 58, a villager walking past the wrecks toward her home, said, “They did not leave, they were destroyed.”

In Russia itself, the retreat caused consternation among the war’s cheerleaders, with state television having previously raised expectations that the Russian military would capture Kyiv.

Semyon Pegov, a popular pro-Kremlin war blogger embedded with the Russian troops, posted a video to the social messaging app Telegram on Saturday describing the move as “a withdrawal, not a flight.”

The retreat was necessitated, he said, by Russia’s stretched-out supply lines and the threat of further losses as its troops tried to survive in field conditions facing a much better supplied and fortified enemy.

It was an effort, mirrored by other pro-Kremlin outlets, to explain why Russia seemed to have sharply scaled back its war aims in recent days, after taking painful losses in fighting for the Kyiv suburbs.

Russian hard-liners calling for an assault on Kyiv saw the retreat as a disappointment. “I don’t know why this decision was made,” Aleksandr Kots, a war correspondent for the Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda, wrote on Telegram. “The war is only beginning. We’ll figure out later who was right and who was at fault.”

The Kremlin maintained its defiance as state television released an interview with Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin’s spokesman, characterizing the United States as being at the root of Europe’s ills. He expressed confidence that European countries would renew relations with Russia once they “sober up a little from the American bourbon.”

In Lithuania, President Gitanas Nauseda announced that his country would no longer import Russian gas starting this month. “If we can do it, the rest of Europe can do it too,” he wrote on Twitter. The European Union is looking for ways to reduce Europe’s dependency on Russian oil and gas.

In other developments on Saturday, Pope Francis, visiting the Mediterranean island nation of Malta, edged closer to blaming President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia for the war in Ukraine than he had before. In an address to Maltese dignitaries and officials, the pope blamed a “potentate, sadly caught up in anachronistic claims of nationalist interests” for casting “dark shadows of war” from Europe’s east.

Francis has declined to explicitly blame Mr. Putin or Russia as the aggressor for various reasons, including the Vatican’s hopes of playing a role in a potential peace agreement. But on Saturday, he clearly seemed to be speaking about Mr. Putin, who he said was “provoking and fomenting conflicts.”

From The New York Times, I’m Sabrina Tavernise. This is The Daily.

[music]

Today, as Russia tries to reset its war in Ukraine, one city has become central to Moscow’s strategy. My colleague, Valerie Hopkins, on what’s happening inside Mariupol and what the fight there tells us about the wider war. It’s Friday, April 1st. Valerie, this is a pretty dizzying week of news out of Ukraine. Catch me up on what happened.

valerie hopkins

So over the past week, we saw a series of moves by the Russians that sent pretty mixed signals. First, about a week ago, the defense ministry in Moscow announced that they were shifting their strategy. They said that the first phase of the war was over, that they were going to be reducing their combat in the west while consolidating their military gains in the east. But at the same time that they said that, they started sending missiles to the west, and they continued their assault on Kyiv. So it was pretty unclear if they would stick to their word. And then, in the middle of the week, we saw another round of talks between the Russians and the Ukrainians, where it kind of looked, for a minute, like some kind of deal could happen. But then the Russians actually came out and said they were a very long way from the agreement, and they would just continue their campaign.

sabrina tavernise

OK, so it sounds like things on the ground are in flux, at least when it comes to territory. But the bombings and the fighting are continuing. So what’s the upshot here? Are the Russians losing?

valerie hopkins

Well, I mean, the Russians have been losing territory around Kyiv. They say that they’re sort of preparing to withdraw from that area, but NATO officials have pretty much concluded that they’re actually regrouping rather than retreating. There’s just so much skepticism from Western officials. The bottom line is they say they’re watching what Russia does rather than what it says.

sabrina tavernise

So Valerie, you’ve been in Ukraine now since the war began. You’ve been covering it every day. I’m wondering what you’re focusing on now.

valerie hopkins

Well, one of the places I can’t take my eyes off is Mariupol, where Russia’s claims definitely don’t match with reality. Russia has waged a brutal siege campaign around this port city for more than a month. They’re portraying their efforts as key to their war of liberation, of helping Ukrainians who they think want to be part of Russia become part of Russia. But in reality, it’s a brutal campaign against a city that’s critical to Russia’s strategy for taking and growing its territorial gains.

sabrina tavernise

Explain that. Why is Mariupol so critical?

valerie hopkins

So Mariupol is a big port city that was, before the war, home to about half a million people. It’s really close to the Russian border. And it’s also very close to Russian-occupied territory in Eastern Ukraine. Right now, it’s the last sliver of Ukrainian territory along the strategic body of water, the Sea of Azov. So controlling Mariupol would not only mean controlling its port but it would also create what we call a land bridge from the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014, to these territories in the east that Russia also controls. So it would be a crucial resupply route and just this kind of strategic symbol of victory for Russia.

sabrina tavernise

Got it. So taking Mariupol would mean that they really gained this important stronghold. It’s like the last puzzle piece in this whole part of Ukraine South.

valerie hopkins

Exactly, Sabrina.

sabrina tavernise

So what’s actually happening in Mariupol?

valerie hopkins

Well, we know it’s being heavily bombed. But beyond that, it’s really hard to tell. The siege of the city started very early in March. Over the last four weeks, the power and the water got shut off. The communications went down at the very beginning of March. And around that same time, the Russians effectively encircled the city. Around mid-March, some people were able to get out as part of a humanitarian corridor. But since then, the situation has grown more dire by the day and by the week. People are running out of food and water. People have been sheltering in basements. However, it’s very difficult to be able to get accurate, up-to-date information while it’s happening from there, simply because of the lack of connection to the city.

sabrina tavernise

Right. I wanted to ask, how do you report on a place you can’t talk to?

valerie hopkins

It’s pretty hard. But occasionally, people inside Mariupol are able to get a signal. There’s a few spots inside the city, and they’re able to post something on Facebook or Telegram or Instagram about the situation. And a big part of what I do is just scouring social media, watching these videos, trying to get a sense of what the situation is on the ground and how much it’s changed from day to day or week to week. And—

[phone rings]

—I’ve also spent a lot of time on the phone, talking to people who’ve somehow managed to make it out. Hello?

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

One woman whose story really stuck out to me was this woman, Kristina.

sabrina tavernise

Tell me about Kristina.

valerie hopkins

Kristina is 28. She’s married. She has two young kids who are six and eight years old. I talked to her on the phone some days after she had escaped from Mariupol.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

And she told me in great detail, and with tremendous pain, about what the past few weeks have been like for her there.

[music]

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

She started out describing what it was like for her when the siege began in early March, when the Russians cut off the phone service and the electricity while continuing, and actually intensifying, their airstrikes. She described this moment when the airstrikes hit the building right next to her. And the war had basically arrived in her front yard.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

And she said she was standing near a window in her apartment, looking outside, talking with her husband. It was really quiet, she said. Then suddenly—

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

—a bomb hit right next to her building.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

She said, suddenly, three houses were just gone. She said her neighbors ran outside and found the body of an 11-year-old girl and her grandfather.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

And this airstrike also shatters the windows of Kristina’s building. So she and her family moved to the corridor of her building, where they think they’ll be safer from more shelling. And this begins a period where they’re, for the most part, too afraid to go out. Because she’s afraid that the shelling will hit them.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

So she tells me about what it was like for her and her family to be essentially living now in their hallway. They have to live without windows and without heat. And it’s actually minus 7 degrees Celsius, which is really, really cold.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

And they’re also starting to run out of food. So she’s going into her pantry. She’s trying to make what little food she had last for a long time. And—

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

—she said there was no gas, so they had to build a fire right inside the entrance to the building and cook their meals there, over an open flame.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

And for a while, they had had one meal a day. But as the bombing increased, people were sometimes scared to go to that entrance to light the fire and cook even that one meal.

kristina [SIGHS] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

And fairly early on, they started rationing the water supplies. Her husband would go out and try to collect it. People in Mariupol, some of them were walking six miles every day to get a few liters of water from wells or other sources. They were collecting rainwater and melting snow. And—

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

—she told me about how they had this tiny teapot. And they had a family meeting and agreed that the first half of the day, between her, her husband, her two kids, and her mother-in-law, they would share this tiny teapot of water. And in the evening, they would also all drink about a teapot of the water.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

And she said, after the first week, those two teapots a day between five people became one. And after a while—

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

—some days, there was also just no water. She would say how her kids would cry because of hunger and thirst. And they were sort of fading. And as they sat in this corridor, she said she tried to distract them with books and reading fairy tales and—

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

—even teaching math.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

But she said that they were so hungry and tired that—

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

—the fire had left their eyes.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

And she said, every day they would sit in the corridor and pray and, essentially, prepare to say goodbye to their lives.

[music]

It went on like this for a couple of weeks. And then—

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

—in mid-March, her own apartment building took a direct hit. The strike killed three children and two adults.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

They were her neighbors.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

And she decided, right there and then, that, even though it was incredibly dangerous, to try to get out of the city in that moment, while it was under siege and under such intense shelling. It would be even more dangerous to stay. She felt they had to leave, or they would die there. But there was a problem.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

They had two cars, enough to take their whole family. But they only had enough gas for one of them.

[music]

sabrina tavernise

We’ll be right back. Valerie, you told us that Kristina and her family were facing this impossible decision. They didn’t have enough gas for everybody to leave Mariupol. So what did they do?

valerie hopkins

Well, there was enough space in the car for her father but not for his parents. And he doesn’t want to leave them alone.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

So the older family members decide to stay in Mariupol. And Kristina and the kids and her husband go. And as Kristina and her family start driving,

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

—that’s when she told me she saw the full extent of what had happened her city.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

She said it was a terrible picture, that there were no roads left, utility poles lying on their sides, shells and shrapnel everywhere, and lots of dead people.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

And she told me how she felt guilty as a mom that she wasn’t able to cover her children’s eyes and prevent them from seeing the destruction and the corpses. And as they’re driving in this long, slow line of cars, there’s so much ordnance on the road, actually, that she talks about how lots of people have tire blow-outs. And there’s broken bridges and all these other obstacles. But the main obstacle, for them, actually, are these Russian checkpoints that are pretty common. I think she mentioned passing, like, 15 of them. And at the final checkpoint—

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

—she mentions these Russian soldiers who are sort of showing off.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

They’re trying to look as if they are these liberating, benefactor good guys—

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

—handing out candy and chocolate to her kids. And Kristina is really conflicted. On the one hand, she’s livid. These are the forces that have just bombed her city to destruction and forced her to leave her home. But on the other hand, she doesn’t want her kids to be scared. She says she has to lie to her children.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

She told them they’re actually Ukrainian soldiers, and she allows them to take the candy.

So after 12 hours of driving, Sabrina, they reach the city of Zaporizhzhia, which is usually a three-hour drive. And she told me that she and her family arrived and went inside a center for people displaced from Mariupol and saw food and water and supplies and just burst into tears. She said—

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

—it would seem like such a simple thing—

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

—a cup of tea and a piece of bread.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

But they were like miracles.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

And she told me that, on the one hand, she realized that she’d arrived, and she was safe, and she had gotten out.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

But all of her feelings about that were tempered because of the people that she’d left behind. And she’s since left Ukraine and gone to the Czech Republic. But she’s still trying to stay in touch with her father and her grandparents, who remain back in Mariupol. Shortly after she left, she got a message from her dad saying they were now living with no roof and no food and no water. And then, a few days later, he got in touch again to ask how he could leave. And then, finally, the last time she’s heard from him was a while ago. And he said that they’d run out of medicine for her grandma and that they still can’t find any gas and that Russian troops had taken control of their part of the city.

Valerie, Kristina’s story is so wrenching. But she left two weeks ago. So I guess I’m wondering, where do things stand now in Mariupol? How much of the city do the Russians control?

valerie hopkins

Well, Sabrina, it’s really difficult to tell. Because there’s so little information coming out, and the fighting seems to still be raging. But I recently spoke to the mayor, who said he did estimate that about 50 percent of the city is under Russian control.

sabrina tavernise

And how many people are left in the city, and who are they?

valerie hopkins

I’ve heard so many different estimates, from 100,000 people left to 160,000 people left. The mayor is calling for a full evacuation of the city. And it’s going to be difficult. Because most of the people who are left are older, elderly, infirm people. And the pictures and videos that we’ve seen coming out of Mariupol in recent days, including with people who have been embedded with Russian forces, tend to confirm that. But one reason that the estimates are also tricky is that we don’t really know what’s happening to people who are in neighborhoods that are being taken by Russian forces. There are hundreds and hundreds of reports of Russian forces coming in to a neighborhood, finding the bomb shelters or the collective centers where people are sheltering, and taking them out of the city and bringing them either to Russia-held territory further east and then directly to Russia.

sabrina tavernise

Wait, taking them?

valerie hopkins

Well, it’s very unclear. The Russians, of course, are trying to present themselves as liberators. And they need to show evidence of the people that they’ve liberated. So that’s why they’re handing out chocolate to kids. And that’s why they are encouraging people to come to Russian-held territory and possibly to Russia. But then there are other stories that are more horrific, of people being taken places, having their fingerprints taken, photographed, and then having their documents taken away from them. And they are waiting to find out what’s going to happen to them.

sabrina tavernise

Wow, effectively, prisoners.

valerie hopkins

Well, that is certainly what the city administration of Mariupol is saying. And they actually estimate that between 20,000 and 30,000 people may have had this happen to them. And they also estimate that 2,000 kids have had this fate. And I spoke to a grandfather who’s been trying to get his 12-year-old granddaughter back, who was taken to Donetsk, a Russian-held city now. And he has no way of communicating with the authorities there or organizing her transfer.

sabrina tavernise

So Valerie, the picture you’re painting here is incredibly dark. And this is a very, very bleak situation for Ukrainians in Mariupol. And I guess what I’m wondering is, what would a Russian victory in Mariupol mean for the future of the war?

valerie hopkins

Well, Sabrina, of course, territorially, it would be a victory for Russia, even if the whole city is completely destroyed. But I think that, in many ways, whether or not Mariupol falls, it’s not really the point.

[music]

This brutal campaign has already sent a message to Ukraine and to the world and, especially, definitely, to the people of Mariupol about just how far Putin is willing to go. We talked about looking at what Russia does and not what it says. And Mariupol is what Russia is doing.

sabrina tavernise

Valerie, thank you.

valerie hopkins

Thank you, Sabrina.

On Friday morning, a convoy from the International Committee of the Red Cross that had been on its way to Mariupol to facilitate a large-scale evacuation of civilians had to turn back after, quote, “arrangements and conditions made it impossible to proceed.” Separately, a limited number of buses with civilians made it out of the city. But it was not clear if more would be allowed to leave. Kristina said she did not know whether her father and grandparents were among those able to get out. We’ll be right back.

[music]

Here’s what else you need to know today.

archived recording (joe biden) Today, I want to talk about one aspect of Putin’s war that affects and has real effects on American people, Putin’s price hike that Americans and our allies are feeling at the pump.

sabrina tavernise

On Thursday, President Biden said he would release up to 180 million barrels of oil from the U.S. Strategic Reserves over the next six months in an effort to lower gas prices that have surged as a result of the war in Ukraine and sanctions against Russia’s energy industry.

archived recording (joe biden) There isn’t enough supply. And the bottom line is if we want lower gas prices, we need to have more oil supply right now.

sabrina tavernise

It is the largest release of oil from the emergency stockpile since the Strategic Reserve was created in the early 1970s. And a lower court in New York state ruled that the state’s newly drawn congressional maps were unconstitutional, a decision that could block their use in this year’s midterm elections. A judge ruled that the map drawing process, overseen by the Democratic majority, had been tainted. He gave the legislature until April 11 to come up with fairer maps for U.S. Congress and the state legislature. The ruling is likely to be appealed, but if it stands, it could endanger a major achievement by Democrats over the past few years— the creation of an even congressional map that no longer favors Republicans.

Photo Reuters

Today is April 1. Russia's military attack on Ukraine continues for the second month in a row. We're reporting on all the current news. The article will be constantly updated.

What about today?

Key points.

The key points from the night address of Volodymyr Zelenskyy:

We endured many times more than the enemy thought. They talked about three or five days. They thought that would be enough for them to take over our entire country. And it has been 36 days. And we stand and will fight further , to the end.

Another decision on anti-heroes, and traitors , was made today. Andrii Naumov, former head of the State Security Service's internal security department, and Serhii Kryvoruchko, former head of the State Security Service's management in the Kherson region, are no longer generals. These senior officers will be deprived of higher military ranks.

In Donbas, in Mariupol, in the Kharkiv direction , Russian troops are accumulating the potential for strikes. We will defend ourselves, we will do everything we can to stop the occupiers and clean our land from their evil and senseless chimeras.

Russian war crimes in Ukraine. We will not forgive anything!

The largest Ukrainian IT companies, with the support of the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine and in cooperation with the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE), have created a fund to combat misinformation, Truth Fund. The task and goal of TruthFund.com are to disseminate reliable information about Russia's war against Ukraine. People all over the world have the right to access true facts about events in Ukraine without fabrications and fakes.

The Air Force Command dispels the over-optimism of many media outlets about Ukraine's war with the Russian fascists. The department emphasizes that although the Ukrainian army has advantages on the ground, in any war, the decisive factor is the advantage in the air. Our defenders are courageously defending the sky, but the Russian air force is significantly superior to the Ukrainian one.

Ukraine desperately needs fighter jets, missile systems, and air defense equipment.

17:00 – The Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine voted to ban the use of symbols Z and V in Ukraine and to recognize Russia as a ""terrorist country.""

The Verkhovna Rada also approved a law that would allow the nationalization of the property of Russians and Ukrainians who publicly deny the Russian-Ukrainian war.

86 captured Ukrainian servicemen were exchanged in the Zaporizhzhia region! Among them were 15 women. This was announced by Deputy Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Kyrylo Tymoshenko.

Humanitarian corridors

The evacuation from the town of Barvinkove and the village of Ridne in the Kharkiv region will continue on April 1. The additional train will leave approximately at 15:00, community leader Oleksandr Balo said in his address yesterday.

Almost 15-20 thousand residents of Izium in the Kharkiv region will need to be evacuated, said Deputy Mayor Volodymyr Matsokin. He notes that the ""green corridors"" have not been agreed upon for almost 20 days.

Five humanitarian corridors in the Luhansk region are scheduled to open on April 1. The evacuation is being organized from six towns and villages, said Serhii Haidai, Head of the Luhansk Regional State Administration. He added that they were waiting for the ceasefire. The Russians have not yet complied with it, and shelling continues.

10:25 – The adviser to the mayor of Mariupol Petro Andriushchenko told about the evacuation from the city. People are being boarded by evacuation buses. In the morning, Mariupol almost peacefully stormed the resistance of the Russians, who did not let people out of the city.

Mariupol itself remains closed and very dangerous to leave by personal transport. The occupiers do not allow humanitarian aid into the city, even in small quantities.

13:15 – On the route of the evacuation bus to Lysychansk, the Russians mined the route from a UAV. The driver saw the mines in time, so all passengers are safe.

15:00 – Deputies of the Mariupol City Council appealed to the world community to unite efforts to unblock the international humanitarian aid to Mariupol and organized a full evacuation.

15:30 – Russians did not let out the evacuation convoy, which took women and children out of Velyka Oleksandrivka in the Kherson region. This was announced by the head of the territorial community Ivan Samoilenko.

The Red Cross sent staff to Mariupol for a mass evacuation of residents. The Red Cross team plans to evacuate a convoy of 54 Ukrainian buses and an unknown number of private vehicles. The destination has not been determined yet, but it will be within Ukraine.

Ukraine's talks with Russia

Negotiations between Ukraine and Russia will take place online today. According to Davyd Arakhamia, a member of the negotiating team from Ukraine, in Turkey, the Ukrainian delegation announced that there was a need for a meeting between the leaders of the countries, but the Russian delegation replied that a more agreed draft agreement was needed first.

The British authorities have advised Ukraine not to conclude any agreements with Moscow in the near future and not to make concessions, The Times reports, citing sources in the British government. London believes that the agreement should be signed when Ukraine ""is in the strongest position."" The newspaper also reports that Boris Johnson is in favor of increasing sanctions on Russia until ""Russian troops leave Ukraine, including Crimea.""

Citing sources, CNN writes that the United States and its allies are ""unlikely to offer Ukraine the security guarantees that Ukraine requires of them.""

At the same time, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba dismissed rumors that some Western partners were allegedly pressuring Kyiv, calling for certain concessions from Russia in the talks to end the war: ""Even before the war it has been inappropriate to talk that there could be any pressure on Ukraine; we proved in several situations that Ukraine is not subject to any pressure, we can only be talked to on an equal footing and we cannot be spoken to superficially. After 36 days of the war, I assure you that no one in Europe or overseas will even dare to put pressure on President Zelenskyy or Ukraine.""

Atomic objects

The Russian occupiers who left the Chornobyl nuclear power plant yesterday robbed the station: they took out computers, kettles, and utensils, said the head of the State Agency of Ukraine for Exclusion Zone Management Yevhen Kramarenko. The thief's army knows what to rob.

Our atom is peaceful, but not for those who came to us with the war. According to the data published by the Military Medical Service of the Russian Federation, the first death of a Russian serviceman from radiation sickness was recorded. He accumulated radiation at Chornobyl. Another 26 people were hospitalized and 73 were sent to the hospital in critical condition.

Who's coming to Ukraine?

About financial aid, weapons, and volunteer fighters

The British Ministry of Defense is handing over 84,000 Mk6 and Mk6A helmets to the Armed Forces.

In addition, the 13th cargo with ventilators and other medical devices left the UK for Ukraine. In total, the country has already donated 5.29 million units of medical devices and equipment.

Britain and its allies have also agreed to send more powerful weapons to Ukraine to counter Russia's invasion, said British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace. ""Ukraine will receive more lethal military aid today. Several countries have come up with new ideas or even more money,"" Wallace told reporters after receiving more than 35 international partners at the Second International Defense Meeting. Assistance will include air and coastal defense systems, long-range artillery and battery countermeasures, armored vehicles, as well as more training and logistics.

In response to Zelenskyy's call, Australia will send Bushmaster armored personnel carriers to Ukraine. This was announced by Prime Minister Scott Morrison. Bushmaster IMV is an Australian wheeled all-wheel-drive armored personnel carrier. It was created for use in the desert areas of northern Australia. It can carry 9 soldiers with food supplies (270 liters of water) and ammunition for 3 days of autonomous resistance.

France has delivered 21 ambulances to Ukraine. In the coming days, cars will start working in emergency medical centers near the front line.

European Parliament President Roberta Metsola is on the way to Kyiv. She announced this on Twitter. The leadership of the Verkhovna Rada, representatives of various factions and groups appealed to Metsola and the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen to help the European Commission adopt a positive EU opinion on Ukraine's EU membership as soon as possible.

The International Monetary Fund is working to create a special account for Ukraine, which will provide loans and grants for our country

The Danish government has given Kyiv three specially equipped fire and rescue vehicles.

The German federal government has approved the supply of 58 armored personnel carriers from the Czech Republic to the Ukrainian army, Welt am Sontag reports. PbV-501 armored personnel carriers (known as BMP-1) are equipped with artillery and machine guns. The equipment will not be sent immediately, it needs repair, which will take several weeks.

Assistance to refugees

A free job search platform for refugees from Ukraine, ukrainejobs.at, has been launched in Austria. To create the platform, the leading Austrian vacancy portals have been merged: karriere.at, hokify and jobs.at. The portal is entirely in English, although certain content, such as job titles, can also be published in Ukrainian.

Sweden will allocate $1.1 billion to support Ukrainian refugees.

Travel by Polish rail is free for Ukrainian citizens. Ukrainians who have crossed the border since February 24 and belong to the following groups can take advantage of free travel on TLK and IC 2nd class trains:

– Children under 18 years;

– Women;

– Men over 60 years;

– Men aged 18 to 60 with disabilities.

News from partners

Because of the position of the Russian Federation, the mandate of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, whose key tasks included reducing tensions and building peace, stability, and security, ended yesterday (March 31). The blocking of the mission's mandate confirms Moscow's conscious choice to continue waging an aggressive war against Ukraine.

The President of France, Emmanuel Macron, met at the Elysee Palace with the mayor of the temporarily occupied Melitopol Ivan Fedorov, released from Russian captivity. ""No one can imagine what the mayor of Melitopol, abducted by the Russian army, has survived. He is now free, he says. His story impressed us. I expressed my admiration and support to him and the Ukrainian deputies. We are determined. We are with Ukraine.""

What's in Russia?

On March 29, there was an explosion at an ammunition depot in the Belgorod region, allegedly due to neglect of safety rules. And today in Belgorod, a powerful fire broke out at the oil depot. A pillar of fire and smoke rose. Emergency services went to the place of the emergency. The causes of the fire are still unknown.

However, the governor of the Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, has already said that the oil depot is on fire due to ""an airstrike by two helicopters of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which entered Russia at low altitude."" Russian social media now have their own ""atmosphere"" and ""betrayal.""

In Russia, the relatives of Russian servicemen killed in the war with Ukraine have begun filing applications to court suing military leadership. A similar case of filing a lawsuit against the commander was recorded in the 752nd Motorized Rifle Regiment of the 3rd Motorized Rifle Division of the 20th All-Military Army of the Western Military District.

Russia is redeploying part of its forces from the occupied regions of Georgia to intensify the offensive on Ukraine, according to British intelligence. According to intelligence, 1,200 to 2,000 Russian militants are part of three battalion tactical groups. Such an attempt to replenish personnel indicates the unexpected loss of the Mordor in the war with Ukraine.

14:00 – Russian agency TARS writes that the shell allegedly fired from Ukraine fell in the village of Mykilske, Belgorod region, with no casualties or damage. This was preceded by information appearing in local public communities that the air defense shot down a Ukrainian missile over Belgorod. A strong explosion was reported, and photos were also published. The Ukrainian side has not yet commented on the situation.

And in Penza, 8th graders wrote a denunciation of English teacher Irina Gen, who spoke out against the war in Ukraine. Her words were recorded on a dictaphone and handed over to the police. Now she has been prosecuted under 207.3 of the Criminal Code. Up to 15 years. And really, why do such children need English?

The commander of the 58th All-Russian Army, Lieutenant General Mykhailo Zusko, was removed from office and arrested. Zusko was punished for the failed attack on the Mykolaiv region.

What about Belarus?

The Central Intelligence Agency of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine states that it has full personal data of all servicemen, as well as their relatives, from units of the Belarusian Armed Forces, ""whom Russia is trying to involve in a shameful, alien and clearly losing war against Ukraine."" In this regard, the Defense Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense calls on Belarusians to refrain from participating in the war. ""We hope for your prudence. We will confirm the seriousness of our statements by publishing relevant information,"" the statement said.

Russian lies

The State Security Service has exposed a new enemy bot farm in Kharkiv. It worked exclusively to damage our military and law enforcement officers. Namely, by sending SMS with proposals to surrender and side with the occupiers. During its short work through this channel, the enemy sent about 5 thousand messages. ""The outcome of events is predetermined! Be prudent and refuse to support nationalism and discredited leaders of the country who have already fled the capital!!!"" was the content of the false SMS. All equipment was located in the Dnipropetrovsk region but was remotely controlled by Russia. Currently, all equipment has been confiscated, and the SBU is carrying out appropriate measures with all those involved.

The Russian Foreign Ministry has made a fantastically idiotic statement that Ukraine is donating blood samples of the ""Slavic ethnic group"" to Germany. ""Germany's actions, previously unknown to the general public, pose the same threat as US biological experiments and require detailed study. Theoretically, bioagents can be created that can selectively affect different ethnic groups,"" said Russian diplomat Gennady Gatilov. Yes, and blood samples from the Russian occupiers were taken by fighting bees of the Kherson region, which recently disabled about three dozen Russian orc rapists and robbers.

From the conversation intercepted by the Security Service of Ukraine, it became known that the Russians were destroying their own military equipment and pretending it was ""beaten up Ukrainian equipment."" The Russians are even ready to do this in order to create at least the appearance of their success in Ukraine.

Sanctions on the aggressor!

France has arrested two helicopters of Putin's oligarch Alisher Usmanov worth $26 million.

As it turned out, Microsoft will not completely leave the Russian market. The company will continue to work with Russian customers against whom no sanctions have been imposed, including hospitals and schools. ""Depriving these institutions of software and service upgrades could jeopardize the health and safety of innocent civilians, including children and the elderly,"" said Brad Smith, CEO. Well, Ovsyannikova's annoying cry (""girls with a poster"" that ""ordinary Russians"" are not guilty of anything and suffer) still reached one of the recipients.

Japan has no plans to withdraw from a joint Russian oil and gas project on Sakhalin, 50 percent of which is controlled by Gazprom, despite joining tough sanctions on Russia.

Germany is likely to stop importing oil and coal from Russia within a year, but not gas, German Chancellor Scholz says.

Germany has also suspended tax cooperation with Russia and Belarus.

Russians and Belarusians will not be able to obtain a permanent residence permit in Latvia until June 30, 2023, according to the Latvian Government.

The US Department of Commerce will expand sanctions against Russian and Belarusian companies affecting Russia's defense, aerospace, and maritime sectors.

First Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration of Kazakhstan Timur Suleimenov assured the world community: ""Kazakhstan will not be a tool for circumventing sanctions against Russia by the United States and the EU. We will adhere to sanctions.""

Metro, Auchan, Leroy Merlin, and other companies that continue to operate in Russia will have taxes raised by 50% in Ukraine. The Verkhovna Rada adopted in the first reading amendments to the Tax Code of Ukraine on taxation of economic entities related to economic relations with the aggressor state. The draft law was supported by 309 people's deputies. If you want to support a terrorist country, pay!

Life considering hostilities

The Ukraine Street project has started; it's a call for a free world through street renaming to ""relocate"" Russian embassies and consulates in each country on the streets of Ukraine. Each of us can help. The project's website contains links to petitions to rename the streets where the embassies and consulates of the aggressor state are located in the first 34 countries.

Participate yourself and invite your family and friends abroad:

Find a petition for your city at www.uastreet.world and sign it. Or tell the organizers if the city is not on the list.

Share the petition with friends and the local community. The more people find out and sign up, the more likely the city administration will respond to the request.

Apply directly to your municipality and local deputies to rename the street.

""Russians will literally have to read the name 'Ukraine' everywhere and always,"" said Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba.

Services for sole proprietors, which were previously unavailable because of the shutdown of electronic state registers, have reopened on the Diia portal. Services for making changes to sole proprietorship and business closures have been returned.

The war slowed or stopped 86% of Ukrainian companies. One in five (21%) has started a process of industry transformation to save their business from closure, 16% already have results, and as many plans to join the transformation.

The world's first NFT war museum has raised more than $600,000 to support Ukraine. This amount was collected by the museum on the first day of the sale of virtual exhibits. In total, 1282 digital works of art were purchased. The funds raised will go to a cryptocurrency fund set up by the Ukrainian cryptocurrency exchange KUNA to support the Ukrainian army and digital and cyber resistance. You can visit the NFT Museum or buy a digital work of art at the link.

Rozetka founder Vladislav Chechotkin said the company would be forced to lay off most of the team as a result of the war. The company's monthly turnover dropped from UAH 4 billion to UAH 23 million in three weeks, warehouses were blocked, stores were destroyed, and delivery was interrupted. The businessman assured the employees that he would try to start a business again, in Lviv, in a warehouse fifty times smaller.

Trophies of Ukrainian Armed Forces

The Armed Forces of Ukraine smashed the position of the Russian military disguised among the trees. Supply trucks, tanks, armored vehicles, and the latest Russian GAZ-3344-20 Aleut were destroyed.

And this is an armored tracked tractor BTS-4A. It was captured by our soldiers in the village of Mokrets, Brovary district, Kyiv region. Now the Ukrainian Armed Forces will have another assistant in retrieving orc trophies from Ukrainian chernozem and delivering them to the right locations.

14th separate mechanized brigade named after Prince Roman the Great destroyed the heavy flamethrower system of the enemy TOS-1 Buratino and its improved version of TOS-1A Solntsepek. Now this scrap metal will never be used to kill people.

Above is a photo of the end of the story about how the soldiers of the world's first looting army tried to leave Bucha with things stolen from Ukrainians. But it didn't work out.

Another minus one enemy Mi-28. It burns well!

Another enemy reconnaissance drone was found in the Poltava region. A local resident reported it. This is an Orlan-10 UAV, which is used to conduct reconnaissance and adjust artillery fire. This drone, which is in the service of the Russian Federation, costs more than $80,000. Now this ""bird"" will be included as another piece of evidence in the criminal case of violating the laws and customs of war.

According to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, since the beginning of the war, Ukrainian defenders have already killed 85 enemy drones.

Kyiv and region

Warehouses with food near Kyiv. For more than a week, rescuers have been dismantling the debris after enemy shelling and a large-scale fire (Photo: Kyiv City State Administration, Oleksii Samsonov).

Russian troops have almost left the Brovary district. This was announced by the mayor of Brovary (Kyiv region) Ihor Sapozhko on a telethon. ""The Armed Forces of Ukraine will mop up settlements from occupiers and enemy equipment and conduct demining. In Brovary, the checkpoints are not dismantled and are ready for defense,"" Sapozhko said. People are starting to return to Brovary.

Secretary of the Bucha City Council Taras Shapravskyi said that it is still dangerous to return to Bucha: there are still many mined vehicles and sabotage groups. The liberation of the city continues, both the Armed Forces of Ukraine and territorial defense are working.

It turned out that before leaving Bucha, the Russian occupiers mined the Delicia confectionery factory, according to the Bucha City Council. They also poisoned cookies stored on the factory premises.

The Head of the Hostomel village military administration also urged not to return to the city. It is still dangerous in Hostomel!

A special police operation is also being carried out in Irpin, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine reports. The city was liberated from Russian troops. Employees of the National Police of Ukraine work on the spot in coordination with territorial defense units, rescuers, and representatives of local authorities.

And this is the liberated Ivankiv. The photo was published by the deputy of the local settlement council Oleh Berehovyi.

According to the operative information of the General Staff, units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine regained control over the settlements of Demydiv, Dymer, Lytvynivka, Havrylivka, Kozarovychi, Zhovtneve, Hlybivka, Yasnohorodka, Talakun, Sukoluchchia, Lypivka, Havronshchyna, Makovyshche, Mykolaivka.

Another good news: the OPZZh party in Kyiv City Council has disbanded itself!

19:00 – The mayor of Bucha in the Kyiv region Anatolii Fedoruk confirmed that Ukrainian defenders liberated the city from the occupiers. ""March 31 will go down in the history of our settlement and the entire territorial community as the day of liberation of our settlements from Russian orcs. This is a great victory of our Armed Forces in the Kyiv region,"" said the mayor.

Donetsk and Luhansk regions

7 enemy attacks were repulsed in Donetsk and Luhansk directions during the day. Ukrainian soldiers destroyed 3 tanks, 2 armored personnel carriers, 2 units of motor vehicles, and 2 artillery systems. An Orlan-10 UAV was also shot down.

The occupiers killed 5 civilians and wounded 22 more in the Donetsk region over the past day, March 31, said the head of the Donetsk regional military administration.

In the Luhansk region, Severodonetsk, Rubizhne, and Popasna have completely no water supply, and Lysychansk and Hirne have partially no water. 32 settlements are without gas supply, and 12 have no electricity. This is the data of Governor Serhii Haidai. During the day as a result of hostilities in the region, two people were killed and as many were injured. 20 infrastructure facilities were destroyed.

Serhii Haidai also said that the Russian army fired on Hirne from Grad missile systems, and a woman was wounded during the shelling. Rescuers continue to work.

12:30 – Russian fascists purposefully hit the repair base of public utilities in Severodonetsk. Residential buildings were also shelled, according to Serhii Haidai, the head of the Luhansk Regional State Administration.

In Lysychansk, the enemy passes the central part of the city. Today, patrol officers found mine-like objects on Perenohy Avenue, which were probably planted by enemy sabotage and reconnaissance groups.

In the Luhansk region, Shchastia, temporarily occupied by the enemy, all attempts by the occupiers to restore the operation of the thermal power plant, which was severely damaged by the fighting, proved futile, as qualified specialists left the village.

In Stanytsia Luhanska, Russian invaders are conducting propaganda activities. In particular, employees of the occupation administration work with low-income families registered with social services and distribute so-called ""humanitarian aid.""

17:30 – Putin's criminals are shelling all settlements of the Luhansk region and are preparing to attack in two directions: Popasna and the area between Kreminna and Rubizhne. The head of the Luhansk regional military administration Serhii Haidai reported about it. He said that the intensity of the shelling was very high, there was no possibility of even picking up the bodies of the dead from the streets and delivering humanitarian aid.

The commander of the Azov Regiment, Major Denys Prokopenko, denied in a video message the widespread information about the alleged evacuation of the command of the defenders of Mariupol.

Kharkiv region

In the Kharkiv region, the Ukrainian army managed to destroy four occupying planes over the past 24 hours: one fighter and three bombers. This was announced by the head of the Kharkiv Regional Military Administration Oleh Sinehubov. He clarified information on the situation in the region:

Yesterday, the Russians fired a missile near the center of Kharkiv, and there was also artillery shelling in areas of the city. Data on the victims are being clarified.

Fighting for Izium continues. The Armed Forces are holding positions in this direction.

On the highway near the village of Mala Rohan, near Kharkiv, the occupiers shot more than 20 civilian cars with people. This became known only after the liberation of the village.

As a result of a missile strike on the Kharkiv regional administration on March 1, 29 people died, the head of administration, Oleh Sinehubov reported. A week ago, 24 victims were reported. And this is what the office of the head of the Kharkiv Regional State Administration looks like after the missile strike by the Russians on March 1, 2022:

Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov said that all city utilities would be written off from February 24 until the end of the war. The payments came to Kharkiv residents automatically, but they do not need to be paid.

The First Deputy Minister of Education and Science said that the Karazin University in Kharkiv is completely destroyed, and it will be moved to a safe place.

Kherson region

As of this morning, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have liberated 11 settlements in the Kherson region.

Immediately after the Russian occupation of the city, Ryzhenko said that local political collaborationists were inciting the Russians against him. The journalist was active in volunteering. Ryzhenko himself announced his disappearance with the help of a delayed message in the messenger: ""Hello. If you are reading this text, it means that something happened. This is a scheduled message, the date of publication of which I constantly postpone for a day or two. If it's published, it means I could not postpone the date once again."" Konstiantyn may have lost his phone or communication, or he may have been taken prisoner by the occupiers.

The historic chateau of Prince Trubetskyi, located in Vesele, Kakhovka district, was occupied by Russian troops. The property of the laboratory, restaurant, and shop was damaged.

The supplies follow intelligence of the US and Western allies suggesting Russia could deploy such weapons in Ukraine and might be planning a ""false flag"" operation to lay the groundwork, President Joe Biden's press secretary Jen Psaki said.

It comes as the European Union is stockpiling medicines and protective gear to protect against any potential chemical, nuclear and biological incidents amid escalations in the Ukraine war.

The hoarding, agreed on Friday and expected to last weeks or months, is designed to expand reserves available to the EU population and partner countries, including Ukraine.

Supplies will also include decontamination equipment, gloves, masks and other material for chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defence, officials said, after Russian troops seized the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant early in the war.

6,e22f9aea-69a2-4a34-897b-5a149b93c54f,['Bryan Bender'],,"Jeff Bezos’s space company is back in the running to return NASA astronauts to the moon, but Sen. Bernie Sanders wants him to do it without using taxpayer money.

Blue Origin got a second chance last week to compete for a contract to develop a lunar lander after it lost out to rival Elon Musk’s SpaceX last year.

But as the rocket maker gears up for the new competition, it’s also working behind the scenes to combat the Vermont Independent’s assault on its possible role in NASA’s public-private partnership to land on the moon by 2025, according to Blue Origin officials and congressional staff.

Senate leaders have promised Sanders a vote as soon as Thursday on a resolution urging Congress to strip a provision from a pending bill that would authorize an additional $10 billion for moon landers, calling the measure “a bailout to Jeff Bezos so that his company Blue Origin can launch a rocket ship to the moon.”

But the $10 billion, if it is subsequently appropriated by Congress, would actually be granted to NASA to choose between multiple companies — with no guarantee that Blue Origin would be the winner.

The space agency’s public-private partnership is also designed so the winners kick in a significant amount of their own money — a novel approach that the Biden administration said this week it plans to expand to develop a more permanent presence on the moon and foster a commercial space economy.

Sanders’ broadside is among his highest profile attempts yet to try to use space billionaires such as Bezos and Musk to strengthen the progressive case for addressing income inequality and curtailing the influence of corporations to secure public money.

“There are some people who want to frame this as social inequity and economic inequity,” said Casey Dreier, senior space policy adviser at The Planetary Society. “That is why you see people like Bernie Sanders are latching on to this.”

“We are seeing the association of spaceflight with divisive individuals being used to drive somewhat unrelated policy issues,” he added, “when in reality, Jeff Bezos is losing money on this.”

Story continues

Sanders’s office declined to respond to the criticism that his claims about the moon plans are misleading.

Since NASA chose SpaceX a year ago to build its lunar lander, Blue Origin has been lobbying Congress and NASA to open the program back up for competition. Along with fellow losing bidder Dynetics, Blue Origin formally protested the $2.9 billion award to SpaceX, and then unsuccessfully sued NASA.

Blue Origin has leaned on supporters for a second moon lander in Congress, including home state Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), who chairs the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee.

Cantwell has been the primary booster for authorizing more money after NASA said last year it didn’t have enough funding to finance a second moon lander.

Blue Origin even offered to waive a $2 billion payment from NASA for the chance to participate in the lander program.

NASA announced last week that it wants SpaceX to build a second lander and will also be releasing a new request for proposals in the coming weeks seeking other bidders.

Developing an alternative design to SpaceX’s to land astronauts on the moon was NASA’s original strategy but it said it didn’t have enough money for two contracts.

On Monday, it released a new budget request for next year that sets aside $1.5 billion for the program, and sketches out plans to increase that investment annually over the next three years.

Blue Origin said in a statement it was “thrilled” that NASA has decided to pursue a second lander and “is ready to compete.”



But the latest development has only fueled Sanders’ accusations that Bezos, whose e-commerce behemoth Amazon and grocery chain Whole Foods are favorite targets of progressives for their labor policies, is trying to sidle up to the public trough when he can afford to finance his moon efforts independently.

Sanders has been railing for months against the company and the moon funding, trying to depict Bezos and his space ambitions as symbols of economic disparity and government largesse at taxpayers’ expense.

“If Mr. Bezos wants to go to the moon, good for him,” Sanders said in remarks on the Senate floor last week. “He has $186 billion in personal wealth. He became $81 billion richer during the pandemic. He is the second richest person in America. And, in a given year, Mr. Bezos has paid nothing in federal income taxes.

“If he wants to go to the moon,” the former Democratic candidate for president added, “let him use his own money, not U.S. taxpayers’.”

Sanders has been threatening to hold up consideration of the United States Innovation and Competition Act of 2021 unless he gets a vote on a resolution urging House and Senate negotiators to drop the moon lander provision.

The legislation, which is designed to strengthen America’s technological edge over China, has passed both the House and Senate. The two chambers are now in the process of setting up a conference committee to hash out a final bill.

Sanders’ resolution would urge the negotiators to strip the moon lander funding.

The exact details of his resolution or when it will come to the floor are still being determined. “We won’t really have timing until the conference committee comes over from the House, and don’t have text for you at the moment,” his spokesperson, Freeland Ellis, said via email on Wednesday.

In the meantime, Blue Origin has been “making lots of phone calls” to Capitol Hill in recent days to try to combat Sanders’ narrative, which it insists is a wild mischaracterization of what’s happening, according to an industry official with direct knowledge of the lobbying campaign.

Another space industry official involved in the effort said the company worries that Sanders’ campaign could hurt its prospects in the upcoming NASA competition.

The officials were not authorized to speak publicly about private deliberations.

Blue Origin reps declined to speak on the record about its counteroffensive. But a major talking point, its advocates said, is that the Human Landing System program, unlike most NASA programs, is a public-private partnership in which the manufacturers put up significant funding of their own and the vehicles will not be government-owned.

“This is very different from the old days when a contractor wouldn't proceed with any program unless it was completely funded by the government,” said Robert Walker, a former chair of the House Science Committee who is now CEO of moonWalker Associates, a consulting firm.

“Bernie doesn't seem to have any problem when we’re giving government subsidies — and most of them are not public-private partnerships — for green energy technologies,” Walker added.

Dreier said those who support Sanders’ view either don’t know the details of the project or purposely ignore them because they undermine their argument.

“I don't think one of the things they take into account is how much institutional investment the [landing system] provider also contributes,” he said. “So SpaceX is putting some money into Starship. And if Bezos’ company wins a future competition,” he added, “Blue Origin has made it clear that their money will go into [its lander] as well.”

NASA also refuted Sanders’ characterization of the lander program as geared toward a single vendor.

“NASA’s plan to hold a competition to develop a second lunar lander will help ensure NASA has the technical capabilities to transport astronauts to the lunar surface throughout the Artemis program and increase the cadence of astronaut landings, which is critical to the United States’ continued global leadership in space,” Alicia Brown, NASA’s associate administrator for the Office of Legislative and Intergovernmental Affairs, said in a statement.

“Increased competition not only leads to better, more reliable outcomes — it also benefits the American people,” she added.

Blue Origin is already involved in smaller projects under NASA’s Artemis program to return astronauts to the moon by 2025. That includes the separate Commercial Lunar Payload Services, designing new concepts for landing on the moon known as “Appendix N” and developing sensors for landing on the moon.

For the upcoming moon lander competition, Bezos’ pitch may also have some key allies in its corner. Its original bid that lost out to SpaceX included partners Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman as part of a “national team.”

The trio is considering making another go of it. “We’re evaluating our options and look forward to competing for this exciting capability,” Lockheed said in a statement.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sanders-looks-shoot-down-bezos-165339218.html
