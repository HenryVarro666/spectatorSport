1,ea900dcb-6dc2-4a0d-ad26-55caaeeae1af,['Sarah Perez'],2022-03-05 00:00:00,"Welcome back to This Week in Apps, the weekly TechCrunch series that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.

The app industry continues to grow, with a record number of downloads and consumer spending across both the iOS and Google Play stores combined in 2021, according to the latest year-end reports. App Annie says global spending across iOS, Google Play and third-party Android app stores in China grew 19% in 2021 to reach $170 billion. Downloads of apps also grew by 5%, reaching 230 billion in 2021, and mobile ad spend grew 23% year over year to reach $295 billion.

Today’s consumers now spend more time in apps than ever before — even topping the time they spend watching TV, in some cases. The average American watches 3.1 hours of TV per day, for example, but in 2021, they spent 4.1 hours on their mobile device. And they’re not even the world’s heaviest mobile users. In markets like Brazil, Indonesia and South Korea, users surpassed five hours per day in mobile apps in 2021.

Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours, either. They can grow to become huge businesses. In 2021, 233 apps and games generated over $100 million in consumer spend, and 13 topped $1 billion in revenue, App Annie noted. This was up 20% from 2020, when 193 apps and games topped $100 million in annual consumer spend, and just eight apps topped $1 billion.

This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place, with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and suggestions about new apps and games to try, too.

Top Story

The Russia-Ukraine war continued to have a wide-reaching impact on the world of apps as major tech companies took action to block Russian state media outlets, RT and Sputnik, and to further isolate Russia from participating in the broader tech economy. The EU specifically banned the Kremlin-based media outlets in the region, to prevent the further spread of disinformation and propaganda across EU broadcast channels, online platforms and apps.

The app stores pulled the Russian state-owned media outlets’ apps, RT News and Sputnik News, from their global marketplaces outside Russia. This includes the ban of RT from the Windows app store, plus Google and Apple’s ban of RT and Sputnik’s apps.

Sensor Tower said that RT News had 5.7 million installs worldwide since its launch in May 2013 across the App Store and Google Play, while Sputnik had 2 million installs worldwide since its release in March 2015. Another firm reported different data. Apptopia estimated RT News had 10 million global installs and Sputnik had 3.85 million.

Among other key changes this week:

Facebook and Instagram said they would suppress the spread of Russian state media via algorithms and will begin attaching labels to their content to provide more context. It also restricted access to their content in the EU and, more recently, the U.K., per a government request.

MyHeritage (update with LiveStory)

Last year, genealogy service MyHeritage went viral after introducing a new “deepfake” feature that allowed users to animate the faces of loved ones in still photos. TikTok users posted videos reacting to the technology, called “Deep Nostalgia,” as they brought back relatives they never got to meet or those whose loss they still grieved. To date, more than 100 million photos have been animated with the feature. Now comes the next iteration. This week, MyHeritage along with technology partner D-ID is expanding upon “Deep Nostalgia,” with the launch of “LiveStory,” a feature that doesn’t just bring the people in photos to life with movement, but actually has them speak.

The company licensed the new technology from D-ID, a Tel Aviv-based startup that works to create patented video reenactment technology powered by AI and deep learning techniques.

To make the lips match the words, D-ID trained a neural network on a database of videos of people speaking. Its technology is able to work with any language, the company says. The MyHeritage implementation, however, supports 31 languages, including dozens of dialects, with both male and female voice options. After the LiveStory is created, users can watch it, share it with friends or post it to social media. They also can customize the story further by editing the text, choosing a different voice or even uploading their own audio recording.

The feature is available in the MyHeritage mobile app and is free to use a few times before a subscription is required.",https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/05/this-week-in-apps-apps-blocking-russia-walmart-adds-virtual-try-on-netflixs-trivia-game/

When reached for comment by Ars, a Facebook spokesperson cited a statement from Nick Clegg, president of global affairs, who said, ""We will continue to do everything we can to restore our services so they remain available to people to safely and securely express themselves and organize for action.""

Original article: Russia is reportedly blocking Twitter, Facebook, various news sites, and major app stores, according to a German journalist.

The move comes after the Russian government announced last week that it was partially restricting access to Facebook in retaliation for the company applying fact-checking labels to posts from state-controlled media outlets. Earlier this week, Meta, Facebook’s parent company, and YouTube blocked access to Russian state media outlets RT and Sputnik in the European Union.

The news of Russia’s blockade came from Mathieu von Rohr, head of the foreign desk at German newsmagazine Der Spiegel. He tweeted that “Twitter, Facebook, BBC, Deutsche Welle, App Stores” were all being blocked. (Deutsche Welle is the German public broadcaster.)

Russia blocks Twitter, Facebook, BBC, Deutsche Welle, App Stores — Mathieu von Rohr (@mathieuvonrohr) March 3, 2022

Putin has long sought to control the Internet inside Russia’s borders in much the same way that the Communist Party does within China. Yet, Russia’s attempts to censor the Internet aren’t as sophisticated and haven’t been as sweeping or effective as China’s Great Firewall, instead relying on regulatory harassment, occasional throttling, and government takeovers. For example, VK, the parent company of Russian social media network VKontakte, was recently taken over by Gazprom, the state-owned natural gas company.

Whether Russia’s attempts to censor the Internet will succeed remains to be seen. Compared with China, the country is late to the game, and it doesn’t have the market size to recreate the range of products and services offered by companies like Meta, Apple, or Google. Any efforts to start beefing up capabilities now will face stiff headwinds as Western sanctions begin to bite, with Russian companies unable to obtain advanced chips for computers, telecommunications, and more.

Ars has contacted Meta, Twitter, Apple, and Google to confirm whether their services are still available inside Russia. We will update this article if we hear back.

Update 12:43 EST: After publication, Ars commenter Artem S. Tashkinov said that connections to Facebook and Twitter were timing out in Russia, even when using a VPN, but that Instagram and Google Play remained accessible via the same route.

Previously, Ukraine had asked Apple to remove the App Store from the Russian market. Apple didn’t accede, but it did remove RT News and Sputnik News from the App Store outside Russia. The company also stopped selling products within the country. An Apple spokesperson said the move was in response to the invasion, though Western companies face myriad hurdles to selling in Russia, including problems processing credit card payments, uncertainties around importing products, and rising inflation in the country. Previously, Apple has temporarily suspended product sales in countries like Turkey where inflation has significantly devalued the currency.

Since President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine, the Russian government has been pushing an avalanche of pro-Kremlin propaganda, spreading disinformation about the course of the invasion, casualty figures, and more. Not that this is any different from before—RT and Sputnik have long offered audiences a skewed, if not outright false, view of world events, one that hews to Putin’s party line.

Social media companies have been slow to respond to the war in Ukraine, appearing to fall back on their default “neutral” status and leaving their platforms open to state media companies. Even today, Sputnik and RT and its affiliated channels remain on YouTube outside of the EU, though Google has removed their ability to make money so as to comply with sanctions. Perhaps as a result, RT America ceased production yesterday, though its videos are still available on YouTube.

But, as the war drags on, civilian casualties mount, and Russia places even greater pressure on Western companies, social media platforms will likely be forced to decide whether their markets-first ideology will serve them in the long run. Since their advent, platforms like Facebook and Twitter have been able to thread the needle, doing just enough to stay in hostile markets without risking government probes or catastrophic consumer backlashes in Western markets.

That era may be swiftly coming to a close, though, as a Cyber Curtain begins to take shape amid Putin’s efforts to relitigate the end of the Cold War.",https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/03/putin-reportedly-blocks-russians-access-to-facebook-twitter-app-stores/

Tech companies responding to the war in Ukraine and U.S. economic sanctions imposed on Russia are halting product sales, limiting services, giving up revenue and hurting Russia's access to advanced tech.

Google, Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, Dell and Meta are among the firms announcing changes to their business plans in Russia in response to the country's invasion of Ukraine, sanctions and the urging of one of Ukraine's top officials.

Google cut off ad revenue to Russian-backed state media outlets and increased security measures for Ukrainian users and websites through expansion of its Project Shield campaign. Apple and Microsoft paused new product sales in Russia. Oracle and SAP suspended operations in Russia, and Meta restricted access to Russian state-controlled media outlets Russia Today and Sputnik. According to market research firm IDC, Russia's total Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) spending in 2021 was about $50 billion.

""Like the rest of the world, we are horrified, angered and saddened by the images and news coming from the war in Ukraine and condemn this unjustified, unprovoked and unlawful invasion by Russia,"" said Brad Smith, Microsoft president and vice chair, in a statement.

Economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. on Russia are also causing U.S. companies like VMware as well as the German enterprise software firm SAP to pause some of their services to the country, including stopping new sales transactions with sanctioned Russian customers.

Tech firms are also being urged by Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine's vice prime minister and minister of digital transformation, to step up pressure on Russia. He has mounted a vigorous social media campaign aimed at U.S. tech companies and believes they need to do more in response to Russia's aggression.

Fedorov's push to stop tech companies' services to Russia Fedorov is calling out large tech companies on social media and asking for their support by stopping operations, product sales and services to Russia. Apple was one of many companies Fedorov singled out on Twitter, noting that he had contacted Apple CEO Tim Cook asking him to support U.S. sanctions against Russia and block the company's App Store for Russian residents. Though the company stopped product sales, it has not blocked App Store access in Russia. ""No more @Apple product sales in Russia!"" Fedorov tweeted. ""Now @tim_cook, let's finish the job and block @AppStore access in Russia. They kill our children, now kill their access!"" Fedorov also used social media to ask SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to activate Starlink satellite internet service in Ukraine, which Musk did.

ERP companies respond at Fedorov's urging On March 2, ERP giants SAP and Oracle suspended all operations in Russia, in response to a direct appeal from Fedorov. ""Economic sanctions against Russia are an important mechanism in the efforts to restore peace. We are in constant exchange with governments around the world, have every confidence in their guidance, and fully support the actions taken so far,"" said SAP CEO Christian Klein in a blog post on Wednesday. ""We are stopping business in Russia aligned with sanctions and, in addition, pausing all sales of SAP services and products in Russia."" In a tweet, Fedorov thanked SAP for stopping sales in Russia, but argued that it was not enough. ""We ask you to stop support of SAP products as long as Russian tanks and missiles attack Ukraine,"" he tweeted. More recently, SAP extended its response to the Russian invasion by stating that it is ""actively shutting down our cloud operations in Russia,"" it stated in a March 24 blog post. The statement continued that customers in Russia who have purchased and deployed on-premises SAP products and run them in their own IT centers will be able to run those products, but that SAP will not provide support. It's unclear how much business SAP does in Russia, but in 2018 the Germany-based ERP giant opened the SAP Experience Center Moscow to help develop SAP applications for customers in the Russian market. At the time, SAP reported having 1,600 customers and 1,300 employees in Russia. One of these customers is Gazprom, the giant energy conglomerate based in St. Petersburg. SAP's move to suspend new business in Russia is largely symbolic and is not likely to affect the company's bottom line, said Joshua Greenbaum, principal with Enterprise Applications Consulting in Berkeley, Calif. It's a good start, he said, but it may be a little easier than it seems for SAP to do because Russia's economy is not that big. ""There are probably not huge amounts of revenue at stake relative to most, if not all, other European countries,"" Greenbaum said. ""It's tricky, but I think you have to do something, and they did. It's a symbolic gesture but it's symbolism that matters."" It's a complicated balancing act for SAP because it must take into account how the move will affect its Russian customers, partners and employees, he said. ""I don't think SAP will take a financial hit per se, so it's probably not a very big deal,"" Greenbaum said. ""But it's real and it's something that SAP is going to have to monitor very closely because it may change on a daily basis.""

The impact on Russia as companies stop services As companies respond to Fedorov's calls for aid and Russian sanctions, the country is likely to experience a hit to its ability to produce vital technologies, said Charlotte Newton, analyst at market research firm GlobalData. Newton said the most notable hindrance for Russia and its ability to procure vital technologies is limitations on acquiring Taiwanese semiconductors. ""Without access to those, Russia is limited in its ability to manufacture military equipment and basic devices such as laptops and smartphones,"" she said. Without access to [Taiwanese semiconductors], Russia is limited in its ability to manufacture military equipment and basic devices such as laptops and smartphones. Charlotte NewtonAnalyst, GlobalData Companies such as Apple and Google pausing certain services will have a more significant impact on Russia's infrastructure, she said. The effects are already being felt in Russia. Huge queues were seen in Moscow subways because people were unable to pay for tickets with Apple Pay on their iPhones, Newton said. Along with halting product sales, Apple has limited services in Russia, including Apple Pay and Apple Maps. Google also limited its Google Pay services, meaning several banks in Russia are unable to work with Google Pay and Apple Pay due to the financial sanctions, Newton said. ""While Russia represents only 2% of iPhone sales for Apple, the limits on Apple Pay will impact banks operating in Russia reliant on online transactions,"" she said. While these companies wield a significant amount of global power, Newton said it's important not to overstate the companies' influences, as their response likely won't ""shift the needle"" on Putin's resolve to annex Ukraine. ""If the likes of Meta and Apple leave the country, they will probably be replaced by Russian alternatives, widening the gulf between Russia and the rest of the world. However, the extent to which the Kremlin can create its own version of the internet, Runet, will depend on the available resources.""",https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/news/252514218/Russian-sanctions-prompt-tech-to-stop-sales-curb-services
