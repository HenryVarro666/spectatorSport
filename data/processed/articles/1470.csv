Intense fighting and shelling continued across different parts of Ukraine on Friday. Here's what you should know:

Impacted areas: Multiple explosions were heard at about 6:30 a.m. local time and smoke was seen rising in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, according to a CNN team on the ground. Mayor Andriy Sadovyi said the Russian missiles struck an aircraft repair plant, which is close to Lviv airport. Russia launched six missiles toward the city, but two of them were intercepted by air defense systems, according to the Ukrainian armed forces.

One person died and four others were injured as a fire broke out after the remains of a downed rocket hit the five-story residential building in the Podilskyi district of Kyiv on Friday, Ukraine's Emergency Service said.

At least two people have died and six were wounded after a missile strike in the city of Kramatorsk in eastern Ukraine, according to Pavlo Kyrylenko, the head of the Donetsk regional administration.

Russian losses: At least five Russian servicemen, including the commander of the Kostroma airborne forces, died in battle in Ukraine, Russian regional state TV network GTRK Kostroma reported Thursday.

Evacuations: Nine corridors to evacuate civilians from towns and cities badly hit by Russian attacks have been agreed for Friday, according to the Ukrainian government. For the second day running, one of the agreed corridors links the besieged southeastern city of Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia, which remains under Ukrainian control.

Biden-Xi call: A call between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden was underway Friday. Since the war began, China has tried to project a neutral stance. It has not condemned Russian actions, and has refused to label the attack an invasion. Chinese diplomats have criticized NATO expansion and accused the United States of fueling the conflict. But they have also called for a diplomatic solution.

Though not military allies, China and Russia have in recent years burnished their partnership in trade, technology and coordination of military exercises, while becoming increasingly vocal about what they view as Western interference into their domestic affairs — pushing back on US-led sanctions and often voting as a bloc in the United Nations.

Russia has asked China for military and economic support and Beijing has expressed some openness to this request, according to US intelligence and diplomacy officials. It is not yet clear whether China intends to provide Russia with that help, US officials familiar with the intelligence tell CNN — but according to the White House, Biden will lay out the potential ramifications of such an action during the call with Xi.",https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-18-22/h_c4d78b1f7a4419d70cb54130ba69e90b

Poland will table a proposal for peacekeeping and humanitarian aid missions for Ukraine, at the next Nato summit, Mateusz Morawiecki, Poland's prime minister, said on Friday.

The idea of a mission was first aired by Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of the ruling Law and Justice party and the deputy prime minister in charge of security, during a trip to Kyiv earlier this week.

Kaczynski accompanied Morawiecki, and the prime ministers of the Czech Republic and Slovenia, Petr Fiala and Janez Jansa, to Ukraine on a mission to show solidarity with the country.

Following the talks with Ukraine's leaders, Kaczynski proposed that peacekeeping and humanitarian missions should be prepared by Nato, or possibly other organisations. He added that the missions should be able to defend themselves.

On Friday, Morawiecki told reporters: ""The proposal will be formally presented at the next Nato summit, but Defence Minister Mariusz Blaszczak has already revealed them at a meeting with the defence ministers of Nato countries,"" said Morawiecki.

He also pointed out that a positive reaction to this proposal had been received from from Morten Bodskov, the Danish defence minister, who had said that ""the Danish government is ready to send troops to Ukraine as part of a peacekeeping mission if it can contribute to ending this bloody war.""

""We have decades of experience of this type of work and I definitely believe that Denmark can contribute and make a difference,"" added Bodskov.",https://www.thefirstnews.com/article/proposal-for-peacekeeping-mission-to-be-presented-at-next-nato-summit---pm-28888

Poland will formally propose a peacekeeping mission in Russia-invaded Ukraine at the next NATO summit, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki confirmed Friday, per Reuters.

The idea for an international mission was initially shared Tuesday, after leaders from Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovenia met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv, Reuters notes.

The officials, who arrived via train ""in a show of high-level backing"" for Zelensky, were briefed on the war and were the first foreign leaders to visit Kyiv since Russia's attack began.

""I think that it is necessary to have a peace mission — NATO, possibly some wider international structure — but a mission that will be able to defend itself, which will operate on Ukrainian territory,"" Deputy Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski said at a news conference. ""It will be a mission that will strive for peace, to give humanitarian aid, but at the same time it will also be protected by appropriate forces, armed forces,"" he added.

Kacynzski is seen as the main decision-maker in Poland, per Reuters.
