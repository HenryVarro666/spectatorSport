Age: 38

Occupation: 3D artist

From: Bila Tserkva, Ukraine

Current location: Prague, Czechia

Vadym left Ukraine with his wife Irina, their three sons and Irina’s grandfather on Feb. 28.

When did you know this was a war?

Around 4 a.m. on Feb. 24, I was woken up by the sound of an explosion. It shook our two-story house, and my wife Irina and our youngest son Anton, 2, who was sleeping with us that night, fell off the bed from the tremors. Three more explosions followed and this time they woke up our two other sons and my wife’s grandfather. We grabbed our emergency suitcases and drove to a village to stay with relatives. Irina started to stutter in the car and this condition stayed for weeks after. When we got to the village, we heard on TV the official government statement that Russia invaded Ukraine. It confirmed what we suspected since the first explosions that morning — if there were explosions in Bila Tserkva, which is a town quite far from the Russian border, it meant nothing good. We returned to Bila Tserkva to pack more, thinking we might have to leave the country.

Vaydm’s journey

All journeys have been simplified to reflect major stops along the way.

What was the moment you realized you had to leave Ukraine or your city?

We knew we had to leave on the third day of the war when we heard yet another blast around 3:30 am. The missile attacks didn’t stop, and we started to hear gun bursts. Irina could barely speak, and her hands were always shaking. We couldn’t calm down Anton. He started to bring us his clothes trying to explain that we should leave. “Here boom,” he said.

We discussed and decided to leave. Irina’s grandfather Leonid is 80 and he is paralyzed on the right side. We couldn’t rush him to a shelter when the sirens went off. Even then, that assumes there was a good one near us, but there were none. We weren’t safe there.

What did you pack?

We had packed our emergency suitcases in the beginning of the year and packed only the most important things — some clothes, documents, nonperishable food and medications. I bought gas in advance because I expected a shortage if something happened. We needed to be ready for everything.

We couldn’t calm down Anton. He started to bring us his clothes trying to explain that we should leave. “Here boom,” he said. Vadym Mykytiuk

What was the journey like?

We thought it would take us one day to get to the Polish border but because of the line of cars at the border it took us two. The cars moved very slowly — about 3 miles per hour. We were in the line for a whole day and tried not to sleep because if you fell asleep you lost your spot in the line. There were people who said they were in line for 3-4 days. When the line didn’t move for a long time, Irina walked further and saw that someone ahead in the line had fallen asleep. That was a cue for us that we could move around them in the line.

We crossed the Polish border without problems around 10:30 p.m. on February 28. We made a stop and volunteers offered us food and hot tea. After that, we drove about 600 miles without stopping to Czechia. After a stop for a couple of days, we made it to Prague, which is where we’re currently staying.

What is it like where you are now?

We’re currently staying in a house in Prague with two more refugee families. There are 13 of us here. We settled in comfortably. After we came here, Irina stopped stuttering and the kids calmed down and adjusted. The older sons are back to doing their Ukrainian school online; many schools haven’t shut down and are operating remotely now using online lesson plans they prepared during the pandemic. We want to sign them up for school in Czechia.

We’re receiving financial assistance from the Czech government — a little less than 12,000 Koruna or $550 a month for two adults and three kids. It’s not nearly enough. If my mom in the U.S. and a tourist from Denmark who stayed with us back in 2016 didn’t help us, we would have been struggling a lot. I’ve heard the amount of assistance recently increased but because of long lines we haven’t managed to get it yet.

Before everyone wakes up in the morning, I try to learn new skills online and I want to find a job soon. It’s not good to be a burden to the government. We want to start earning our own money and be able to start buying more groceries and things of first necessity. I want to start to help Ukraine financially.

What do you think about the U.S. and what is being done or should be done to help Ukraine?

The sky above Ukraine should be closed so there are no missile attacks killing civilians. Anyone who knows history knows that Russia won’t stop. If the U.S. and EU don’t make a decisive move to stop it, then the war will expand and touch other countries. It’s obvious; you don’t need a fortune-teller to tell you that.",https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/04/03/7-ukrainian-refugees-escaping-russias-war-00022175

Natalia and Olexander Tolmachov, dance teachers, studio owners, competition adjudicators from Mykolayiv. Currently evacuated to Assen, Netherlands:

The war started for our family and all Ukraine on February 24 at 4.30 in the morning. The first explosions were very close to our home and car alarms went o? right away and all the windows in our apartment were shaking. I could not believe the nightmare I was seeing. My heart was literally jumping out of my chest and the clutter in my head was ceaseless. My brain did not want to comprehend the reality. My husband went to get gas at 5.30am and I woke our 7-year- old daughter up and started packing some bags.

Our older son, Danil, who was 17 at that time and danced in Kyiv, called and asked in a shaken voice what was going on, because something just blew up next to him. The explosion was very strong and lots of glass from broken windows was all over the street next to the subway station close to my son’s apartment. In complete shock I told him it’s the war and we love him dearly, no matter what is going to happen next.

When my husband was at the gas station, an airplane flew right above his head and 10-15 minutes later a new set of explosions started very close to us. We ran out of our apartment and got into a long line to the ATM to get some money. The closer we were getting to the ATM, the less money we could get. There was an ambulance station next to our building and they were driving out every single minute with loud sirens. For a moment it seemed like our whole small town was full of these scary noises. We were able to get some money and get some food to bring to my elderly mom, who has trouble walking on her own and would not be able to survive by herself.

No one knew what to do next. Our apartment was on the 8th floor, and it was very scary to go back there. We got our dog and went to my aunt’s place. We spent most of the next five days and nights in the basement of a maternity hospital. We slept on chairs surrounded by women giving birth right before our eyes, under constant bombing.

On the 6th day early in the morning after an air raid alert, we again drove to the shelter. Our neighbor asked us for a ride. She wanted to get to the bus station. I asked her where she was going to go, for they will start bombing soon. She said she was tired of sleeping in the bathtub and didn’t care where to go, just to get away from here. We dropped her o? at the bus station and in that moment, we decided to get out of town as well. We hoped to get together with our son somewhere in western Ukraine. This hope and belief truly helped us at that moment.

In less than 5 minutes, we gathered some documents and necessities and started driving out towards Odessa. That was a great shock! Every checkpoint on our way out of town put me in a state of despair and brought tears to my eyes, but our soldiers were all very nice and respectful, and I am very grateful to them for that. There was lots and lots of tra?c on the road, tires, sand, and a constant fear that the next enemy plane would turn our cars into ash, while I had my 7 year old daughter sleeping by my side. I kept asking myself - why are we getting all this? I don’t remember how long it took us to drive 120 kilometers to Odessa, but it felt like forever. In Odessa we left our car parked next to the train station and went inside.

What we saw there is very hard to describe. It was like a horror movie. Tons of people: elderly, men, women, mothers with young children, pets, cages with birds… People were everywhere. They were standing, sitting, laying down in every single spot of space. We went to the ticket counter and when we asked for tickets to Ternopil we were told to run fast to the shelter as the bombing has started. All our documents, a small bag with necessities and our dog were still in our car. My husband went to get it and my daughter and I went to find shelter. When the air raid was over and we got out of shelter, we learned there is one train to Ternopil that you can buy tickets for and two evacuation trains. If we didn’t make it onto any of them, we would have to spend the night at the train station because the curfew in Odessa began at 5pm.

To this day I don’t know how we managed to make it onto that train. We were begging the train station worker, we were telling her this might be our only chance to meet with our underage son, she saw our little daughter, we were praying to God… but late at night we made it and were standing in a train vestibule! We got an upper berth for our daughter, my husband, our dog, and I. There were 15 people in a train compartment normally suitable for four. People were sitting and standing everywhere together with their pets. All windows were blocked, and all lights were dimmed. Of course, we had a constant fear of the train being bombed during our ride. At 5 o’clock in the morning the next day, we arrived in Ternopil. A volunteer named Natalia met us at the train station. She took us to her place and gave us some tea. For all those days from the beginning of this war we had not been eating and were barely drinking due to the state of shock that we were in. I decided to go to the store to get some food and realized I was simply terrified. Every single loud noise made our daughter ask us if we were being bombed. Natalia gave us a place to stay in her toy store, some toys for our daughter, and some blankets for us. Yes, we were sleeping on the floor, but at that time Ternopil was not being bombed and we were relatively safe. We were extremely worried about our son. He was riding from Kyiv with people we did not really know, and we are very grateful for them that they did not leave our child behind in this war. In the early morning of next day Danil was with us. He arrived during a curfew. Somehow soldiers let their car into the city. Despite having APCs under our window and Territorial Defense Forces checking paperwork, this was our small victory. Our family was together again. Our thoughts were with the friends and relatives that had been left behind, and our two cats that were now with my mom. We had to get going.

The next challenge - getting on the bus from Ternopil to Warsaw. 21 hours on the road. We had left everything behind - our big successful studio Harmoniya, all our students who are a part of our hearts forever, our home, our families and friends, everything we have ever had. We were left with nothing and now have to start from scratch.

I would like to say thank you to Jakub Rybitsky for organizing the pickup and hotel stay for us in Poland. Two days later we travelled to the Netherlands where we are staying now at the De Bonte Wever Hotel. We are completely taken care of and feel safe. We would like to say many thanks to Fred Bijster and his team for taking amazing care of our family and many other Ukrainian dancers! We will be forever grateful! It has been two weeks since we left the war, but all of us still see it in our sleep at night. Our daughter is now afraid of every airplane in the sky. She keeps constantly asking if we are sure there is no war here in Assen. She had been having a happy childhood – she was going to school, doing dance and art, and could never imagine her life could change in this way. Now, we spend most of our days reading news and worrying about our friends and relatives left at home.

The fear for the fate of our country is not becoming smaller. It breaks our souls apart. We all hope to wake up and realize this is just a nightmare and all of this has never happened. Many of our students are now refugees in diferent parts of the world, some of them are here with us in Assen. With those who are still in Ukraine we exchange messages constantly and every day starts with a standard text - How are you? - Still alive! Our car is now helping volunteers get people out of the war zone and get help to the people who decided to stay. We hope it will save some lives, because there is nothing more important than life.

Danil Tolmachov, International Latin dancer, Kyiv. Currently evacuated to Assen, Netherlands.

The war started for me at 5.20 in the morning. I woke up from the phone call. It was my friend telling me the war has started and three bombs were already dropped next to his house. I did not believe him at first and dropped the phone. I honestly thought it was a prank. But two minutes later lying in bed and looking at the window, I saw a red dot in the sky that was slowly moving towards me. The red light filled my room and then I heard an extremely loud sound of an explosion. I got up super fast. All of the cars outside had their alarms going o?. I ran to the next room to wake up my friend and together we sat for 5 minutes without any movement, scared to the point of trembling. We could not comprehend the fact that the war had started and couldn’t understand what to do. I went to my Instagram account and right away saw a message from my mom who was at home in Mykolayiv, saying that they love me and that the war has started. That message was sent an hour before and that was the last time they were online… At that moment I realized I might never see my family again.

I feel very lucky that our family was able to evacuate. I am very grateful to Fred Bijster for organizing this process and giving us an opportunity to stay at this beautiful hotel with extreme comfort. I would also like to thank Gerrit Wensink for helping us with transportation to Assen. To Katia Zakharo? for all her emotional and physical help through all these days. My Ukrainian teachers, Elena Martynyuk and Roman Kovgan that supported me in Poland, and that organize weekly zoom lectures for all Ukrainian dancers.

On a separate note I am also extremely proud of our Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for being a true world leader, for uniting Ukraine, and giving a great example of bravery. I truly believe in Ukraine. I believe my country is going to win, as good must always prevail. I am grateful for the support of the whole world going on protests. At the same time, I hope European countries understand this war is only the beginning, and I hope for more support to my country to prevent the war of a bigger scale.

Yevgeniy Borushko. International Latin Dancer. Blackpool under 21 Latin Champion. Stayed in Ukraine.

For me, as for many Ukrainians, the war started on February 24 at 5 in the morning. My friend woke me up saying “Zhenya, it seems like everything has started”. I did not believe him. I got up, opened the window, heard a couple of large blasts and realized he was right! For the first day, we were completely lost. I realized this is a real war the moment I was using scotch tape to protect the windows in my apartment, so that during the explosion they would not shatter into tons of tiny pieces. Symbolically, this was the same tape I have been using in UK and Blackpool this year - my lucky tape. That’s how we prepared ourselves for our first night. It seems a bit funny now, but it was that exact moment when I realized it is a real war. That was the point of no return.

One month later, I can only say the war is not over. And I wish people would talk about it more and more. I have a feeling everyone got used to the war happening in Ukraine. But that is something to not get used to. This is a real act of terrorism. I have heard that at this point we have 128 children killed and the number is just growing, and I am very afraid for our children.

Not that long ago I started organizing Zoom classes with world top coaches for all Ukrainian dancers and I see it really helps. When you see kids coming to the lecture from the places they stay in, wearing whatever they have, no dance shoes, some have air raid alarms in the background, and they run to the shelter and get back into the lecture it shows how strong they are and how much they want to develop and dance. I was telling these kids, you can lose everything, but no one can take away your favorite things from you. No one can take away your will, your soul, and your bright eyes, and I see it in our kids. That’s my biggest motivation. All our Ukrainian dancers, not just kids have a strong will to develop. They see a bright future. They see themselves competing and winning. That’s what they live by and that’s what they want. I am asking for all possible support from the world dance community. Ukrainian dancers are the strongest ones and the war clearly shows it!

I am currently in one of the Ukrainian villages helping people that gave me food and a place to stay. I have exchanged my dance shoes for rubber boots, and a trophy to a shovel. But I truly believe that there is always a place to be a champion, even in this kind of work…



For United States Amateur Ballroom Champions Oleksander Kalenyuk and Olena Ablitsova the war had started much earlier:

It’s 2014, Donetsk, we are sitting on the plane and getting ready to fly to our first Blackpool. Upon arrival at the airport where we had a connecting flight, we found out that our plane was the last one that left the airport since the shelling had begun, and after we did not return home ... at that moment when we were flying and could not answer our parents, and they see on the news that the airport was hit, we could not even imagine what thoughts our parents had in their heads ... if our plane had been a little later, then perhaps we would not have written this article… but May 24, 2014 we can call the second birthday

Today our parents are still in Ukraine, Olena's mother and little brother (9 years old) and Olena's grandmother were able to evacuate to Europe, all the other members of our families stayed in Ukraine. We really hope that soon the war will be over and we will be able to see and hug them.

(At the time this article was written, Olena’s parents have safely arrived in Germany and she was on her way to meet them.)

https://www.dancebeat.com/m-db-articles-en/item/2034-ukraine#sigProId041ca70ba7 View the embedded image gallery online at: Fred Bijster from the Netherlands began working closely with the famous De Bonte Wever hotel in Assen, has been welcoming refugees, providing a warm and cozy place to stay, with full room and board. I have asked Fred what moved him to become involved into this situation. Here is what he has to say:

“Over the years I've met many people with a Slavic identity and learnt a little bit about their culture and history. They deserve respect and have a history of the greatest su?ering you can imagine. Timothy Snyder wrote a book called ""The Bloodlands"" that illustrates that. It made a deep impression on me and made me aware of the e?ects of authoritarian regimes on normal folk. History also showed me that most people prefer to look the other way. I simply didn't want to do that. On the scale of what is happening, there is not much we can do, but every little bit helps. I'm also deeply impressed by the way the group we have in Assen is dealing with their current situation. Especially how the very young children (around 14-17 years of age) take care of their mothers, focus on their dancing and start to further educate themselves here. I spoke with a young girl, just 17 years of age, who was sitting down on the terrace and was busy learning English on Youtube. She said: ""I might need it"". This says it all.”

Gerrit Wensink, Dutch Open music director:

When I heard about the war in the Ukraine my thoughts immediately went to the people of the Ukraine and especially to the dancers who visited many times our competition in Assen, the Dutch Open. As a DJ in this tournament I know a lot of dancers and my heart was jumping over when I saw the news about the terrible pictures there. When I heard from Fred Bijster that he would bring the dancers in safety to the Bonte Wever I gave him my full collaboration to organize to get the people there.

I remember my first trip when I picked up a family from the station in Apeldoorn. They came with the train from Berlin. After the pickup we went first to our dancing school to give them

some food, and the possibility to go to a normal toilet, before we tooek the trip for 1 1/2 hours to Assen.

When I delivered the family, a father, mother, son and daughter to the Hotel they were happy to go to sleep because it was in the middle of the night. On my trip back to Apeldoorn I realized that it was also a good and warm feeling to help the family in this way.

I hope the war will over soon and that we never have to face such a demolition again anywhere in the world.

All of us would like to say so many thanks to Jacub Rybitsky from Poland, Michael Petr from Czech and Oregon State, Boyan Bojancyck from Poland, Michael and Yulia Malitowski from Poland, Gerrit Wensink from the Netherlands, Barbara McColl from UK, Donnie and Heidi Burns from USA, Riccardo Cocchi and Yulia Zagoruychenko from USA, Andra Vaidilaite from Canada and hundreds of dancers and dozens of dance organizations from Europe, Canada and the United States for organizing fundraising, transportation, stay, food service, legal process, and dance lessons and classes for Ukrainian kids.",https://www.dancebeat.com/m-db-articles-en/item/2034-ukraine

“Listen to the voice of Mariupol” is a series of stories of people who managed to flee from the besieged city of Mariupol. We continue the series with a conversation with Olia, who witnessed the airstrikes at the maternity hospital on March 9.

Olia was born in the Donetsk region, in the city of Druzhkivka. She moved to Mariupol when she was ten years old. Olia was nine months pregnant at the time of the Russian invasion of Mariupol. She spent four days in the basement before deciding to go to the maternity hospital shortly before her contractions began. The day after Olia’s baby daughter was born, the occupiers dropped bombs on the maternity hospital – where dozens of new mothers and pregnant women were staying – on the pretext that the Azov Battalion and other radicals had seized the hospital. As a result of the airstrike, three people were killed, including one child, and 17 were injured. Olia and her daughter were lucky to escape. — Until recently, we did not think there would be an attack on Ukraine. We thought all that was fake news. Because this is an abnormal situation that should not have happened in Ukraine. When it all started, we hoped that everything would be fine in three or four days’ time. I had a due date, I could have gone into labour any moment. So I couldn’t just get up and go, because my contractions might have started during the journey.

I got to the maternity hospital on the first of March. My father had sent me away because I’d been sitting in the basement for four days in a row, afraid to go out. The shelling continued. Dad had said, “Olia, what if your contractions start while you’re in the basement? We wouldn’t be able to take you to the hospital”, since there were already problems with transport in the city. On March 7, my contractions started, but nothing happened. The next day I asked for a Caesarean section. The only doctors at work that day were the ones on duty. Others were in areas more affected by the shelling. The head of the hospital was constantly at work: he was performing operations and helping women give birth day and night. He was barely sleeping at all. On the morning of the 9th, I was transferred to the general ward to rest after the operation. My bed was by the window. And I must have had a premonition: I started asking the nurses to take me to the corridor with no windows. But they just laughed at me: “Calm down, please, don’t start that – it’s not safe anywhere now, just lie down.”

I had a “cocoon” for the baby. I used it to cover the bed because I thought that if the glass flew out of the window, it would not touch my baby. I knelt down to change my daughter’s clothes because I couldn’t bend over. At one point, a towel fell out of my hands. And when I stooped to pick it up, the window flew over my head. The window, the third-floor ceiling, the wall – I remember all that clearly. And the only thing I managed to do was grab my baby and shield her with my body.

Then I jumped to my feet. The exit from the room was blocked. I started breaking down the door so that I could get out. The corridor was completely destroyed. Girls were running from all directions, their faces all covered in blood. Most likely, the shattered glass from the windows had flown straight into their faces. They all had babies in their arms. I rushed out into the corridor and started shouting to the doctors, “Save my baby!” Because I had just had a Caesarean section, I couldn’t stretch. So, half-bent, I hauled my baby into the basement to hide. It turned out that part of the basement had also been destroyed. At the time of the explosion, there were also refugees at the hospital, from different parts of the city. They had come here because the head of the maternity hospital was receiving everyone, he could not refuse help to anyone. A couple of minutes later, our soldiers arrived, made their way to our basement, and began rescuing women with children and pregnant women. We went outside and saw that the hospital courtyard was not there anymore. Everything had burned, cars were burning everywhere.

When I ran out of the maternity hospital, one of the soldiers helped me take my baby to a police car. He was crying, there were tears in his eyes. He kept saying, “How is it possible? It’s a maternity hospital, there are children.” I asked them to take me home. My parents ran out to meet me. They were shocked, they immediately took my baby from me. Fortunately, the child didn’t have the slightest scratch. I had wounds on my legs from the debris. My newborn baby and I went down to the basement again because the shelling continued. Although it was not in our area, I heard it. I spent all the following days, from the 9th to the 14th, in the basement with my baby, because I began to be afraid of all the loud noises: explosions and machine gun fire. When our neighbours found out that I had had a Caesarean section, they brought me antibiotics. Three pills. I also used Betadine for my stitches — that’s all. I had nothing else on hand, none of the things I needed to take care of myself after the operation. We periodically took the baby out of the basement for five to ten minutes, took her into the banya (sauna — tr.), which was heated, then brought her back to the basement. There was no heating in the building.

I don’t know anything about the other girls who were on my ward at the hospital, since I left my phone, as well as all my documents, in the maternity hospital. So they have either been destroyed by fire or are lying somewhere under the rubble. My passport, my driving licence, my registration documents, my marriage certificate, my wedding ring. I had taken it off before the operation because my fingers were swollen. I had money in my bag. Because when I was getting ready to go to the maternity hospital, I hoped that a humanitarian corridor would be established, so I packed the essentials in case I needed to leave immediately. But there was no humanitarian corridor. When I gave birth, the city had neither internet nor phone signal. The Mariupol doctors only recorded the birth of my daughter in a paper logbook. They didn’t add me to the database. Now I need to prove that my baby is mine, I need to get a DNA test, because during the shelling, I might have grabbed someone else’s child. I perfectly understand that in a legal sense, all this can happen in real life. ​​But in reality, I hold my baby in my arms and do not understand how I can get at least some documentation to confirm that she is mine.

On the fourteenth of March, a neighbour told my father that the checkpoint towards Melekino had been removed. People confirmed: “Yes, a lot of cars left today.” Dad rushed home and said, “Let’s decide whether or not to leave.” We understood that this was our chance. It could be the last and only chance. There might not be another. We got ready within about five minutes. I was driving, since I am the only one in our family who can drive. There were unexploded mines along the way. We went to the checkpoint, where there were two destroyed armoured personnel carriers. After that, the road was mined. So we drove through a field and prayed the whole way. We were afraid that there would be a plane and an airstrike.

In Melekino, there is a guesthouse called “Troianda”. Some kind people hosted us there. They offered us a room, heated it for the baby, gave us food and drinks. We immediately started calling our relatives who live outside of Mariupol to inform them that we were alive and well. We stayed in Melekino for one night, then we set off again. First, we reached Berdiansk, where we were stuck for four days looking for fuel. Only then we moved on, through Zaporizhzhia, to a village in the Ternopil region where our relatives were waiting for us. My stepmother’s daughter, who was fleeing with her family from Druzhkivka, was also evacuated there. So we were given a whole house, as well as basic supplies and everything we needed for the children. On the one hand, I am calm now because my baby is safe. She has already been sleeping well for two days in a row. For the first time in the two weeks of her life, she had a bath. It makes me feel better. I understand that I can give my child some comfort. On the other hand, the fear is still there. I don’t believe this will ever end.

I hate the Russian army. Because I have been deprived of my home. I have been deprived of my city. They have deprived my child of a normal childhood. I don’t know where to return with my family now. I still can’t figure out how they could do something like this. It seems to me that even during the Second World War, cities were not destroyed the way they have devastated Mariupol. Now 85% of the city has been destroyed. There is almost nothing left. Only a few districts have survived, but I don’t think they will remain intact for long.

Most of the residents still in Mariupol are aged 50 and over. They aren’t leaving, because they are afraid of looters. They say: “We’ve lived here all our lives, we earned a good living, and now if we leave our apartments, looters will come. And then, if this all ends, are we supposed to return to empty apartments?” Nobody knew this would happen, nobody bought a house in the west of Ukraine just in case. This is why many people are staying in Mariupol and enduring all this: medicine running out, corpses on the streets, the lack of food and water. These people have no other home. No other life. So they are holding on to the last few inches of hope. At the time of our conversation, on March 23, Olia was already in the Ternopil region with her family. Now she is looking for a lawyer to help her to complete the paperwork for her child and to recover all her lost passports and certificates.
