There was a concrete discussion today with the Mayor of Mariupol. We are coordinating and we will then negotiate with the Russians,"" Macron told reporters after an EU summit in Brussels. ""The quickest possible, we hope in the next few days. I will have a conversation with President Putin in the next 48 to 72 hours to finalize the details and modalities. It is urgent,"" added Macron.

Zelenskiy Says Russia Realizing Talks Are Necessary (7:10 a.m.)

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine’s military defense is forcing Russia’s leadership to realize that “talks are necessary,” after earlier bemoaning a stalemate amid ultimatums and demands he cede territory.

“The conversation must be meaningful. Ukrainian sovereignty must be guaranteed, Ukraine’s territorial integrity must be ensured,” Zelenskiy said in a video address late Friday. The Russian Defense Ministry said earlier in the evening that its forces, which have failed to take several major cities, would focus on taking control of the full eastern Donbas region.

In the past week, Ukraine set up 18 humanitarian corridors, allowing 37,606 people to flee from blockaded cities, Zelenskiy said. The situation in Mariupol, the southeastern port city that’s seen some of the most brutal fighting, remains “absolutely tragic,” he said, adding that the Russia military must bear responsibility for crimes against the Ukrainian people.

Ukraine Will Seek New Security Guarantees, Yermak Says (7 a.m.)

Ukraine will seek a new “structure of security guarantees” after the war, presidential adviser Andriy Yermak told the Atlantic Council in a video interview.

“Give the world the model that will prevent Russia from conducting an aggressive policy for many years, not only after the end of fighting on Ukraine territory,” he said.

Yermak reiterated that Ukraine won’t abandon any of its territory and urged western nations to grant more military aid, exchange intelligence data, and “close the sky” above Ukraine by providing anti-missile systems and fighter jets.

UN Women’s Body Condemns Invasion (5 a.m.)

The UN Commission on the Status of Women condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, saying it is “deeply concerned” for the safety of civilians, including women and girls.

EU Leaders Agree to Focus on Enforcing Sanctions (8:07 p.m.)

Leaders of European Union countries agreed at their two-day summit in Brussels to focus on enforcing sanctions against Russia in cooperation with global partners, the head of the bloc’s executive arm told reporters.

Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Says Russia Won’t Budge in Talks (7:18 p.m.)

Ukraine’s foreign minister bemoaned the state of talks between his country and Russia designed to end the month-old invasion. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said earlier Friday they were at a stalemate.

“Ukraine’s position is clear: ceasefire, security guarantees, no compromises on territorial integrity. But Russia sticks to ultimatums,” Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Twitter. “To stimulate a more constructive approach we need two things: more sanctions and more military aid for Ukraine.”

Russia has demanded territorial concessions and Ukraine’s neutrality. Ukraine has said it won’t negotiate under ultimatums, won’t trade its land but is open to discussing neutrality.

Europeans Strongly Back Sanctions Against Russia, Poll Shows (4:05 p.m.)

In the European Union, 42% of citizens support current sanctions against Russia and 43% think they don’t go far enough, according to a poll of 24,509 people in 24 of the bloc’s 27 members, plus Switzerland and Serbia, by Gallup International.

Slightly more than half of respondents, or 52%, are in favor of Ukraine joining the EU, and 21% are against. More than nine out of 10 surveyed said it is “important” or “very important” for their country to switch to renewable energy sources and cut reliance on Russia. The largest concerns of EU citizens from the invasion are inflation, that the conflict could expand into a world war or involve nuclear weapons, and that energy supplies may fail, according to the poll.

Russia Says Ukraine ‘Operation’ Focused on Donbas (2:49 p.m.)

After a month of fighting that’s yielded limited territorial gains, the Russian military said it’s focusing efforts on taking full control of Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, potentially a sign it’s backing away from hopes of taking larger swathes of the country or removing the government. Part of the region had already been under the control of Moscow-backed separatists.

“Our forces will focus on the main thing -- the complete liberation of Donbas,” Sergei Rudskoi, first deputy chief of the General Staff, said Friday, according to the Interfax news service. Saying the operation is “successful,” Rudskoi cast Russia’s failure to take major cities as deliberate, with the military aiming to pin down Ukrainian troops.

Rudskoi put military losses at 1,351 killed and 3,835 wounded, the first official accounting since March 2. Western officials say as many as 15,000 personnel have been killed.

Russian Shelling in Kharkiv (12:53 p.m.)

Mariupol’s city council said about 300 civilians were killed when a theater was struck by a Russian aerial bomb attack on March 16, according to a statement posted on Telegram. Russian forces have been accused of deliberately targeting the building and other locations that were known shelters for those fleeing the port city’s siege. Mariupol says more than 80% or residential housing has been destroyed.

The bombing has featured prominently in accusations, including by the U.S., that Russian forces have committed war crimes. Satellite imagery showed the building marked with large white letters spelling out the words “children” at the front and rear. Russia has denied deliberately attacking civilians. Zelenskiy said this week that almost 100,000 civilians are still trapped in Mariupol.

Lavrov Says West Seeks to Destroy Russia (11:31 a.m.)

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused the West of waging “hybrid war, a total war” through sanctions against his country. European leaders want to “destroy, strangle the Russian economy and Russia as a whole,” Lavrov told a meeting of the Gorchakov Public Diplomacy Fund in Moscow on Friday.

Bank of Russia Says Gold Reserves Stored Domestically (9:00 a.m.)

Russia’s central bank said all its gold reserves are stored domestically, according to a Q&A posting on its website about operating the financial system under sanctions.

The comments comes after the U.S. Treasury issued a notice that gold transactions with Russia are prohibited, and U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there are signs Russia is using the precious metal to escape sanctions.

Russia spent years building the fifth biggest stash of gold in the world, and it’s being targeted now because sales of it could shore up the ruble.

Russian Miner Says Unable to Sell Gold After Sanctions (9:10 a.m.)

Petropavlovsk said it’s urgently considering the implications of sanctions on Gazprombank that prohibit further sales of gold to it.

Meanwhile, oil swung between gains and losses, with West Texas Intermediate crude holding above $110 a barrel, as the U.S. and European Union looked set to announce plans to reduce the region’s reliance on Russian fossil fuels.

Final Russia-EU Rail Link Closes (8:30 a.m.)

Passenger train service between Helsinki and St. Petersburg will end Monday “for the time being,” Finland’s state railway company said. It was the final rail link left for passengers between Russia and the European Union.

The 1,300-kilometer (800-mile) border between the two countries can still be crossed by car. Tens of thousands of people have left Russia since the invasion of Ukraine, with many heading first to former Soviet states, the Middle East, and Turkey. The Helsinki rail connection was seen by many as the easiest way to get to Europe.

Zelenskiy Calls on Orban to Shun Russia (8:20 a.m.)

In his video-address to the EU on Thursday, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy criticized Hungary it for not showing full support when it comes to Ukraine’s membership in the bloc, sanctions on Russia, or transit of weapons through Hungarian territory.

Zelenskiy urged Prime Minister Viktor Orban to “once and for all” give his full support to Ukraine and shun Russia. “There is no time to hesitate,” he said. “It’s time to decide.”

Ukraine Pushes Russian Forces Further From Kyiv, U.K. Says (8:04 a.m.)

Counter-attacks have helped Ukraine reoccupy towns and defensive positions as far as 35 kilometers (22 miles) east of Kyiv, the U.K. defense ministry said in an intelligence update. Ukrainian forces are likely to continue to attempt to push Russian troops back along the northwest axis from Kyiv toward Hostomel airfield.

In the south, Russia is still attempting to circumvent Mykolaiv in a bid to drive west toward Odesa, the U.K. said. Progress is being slowed by Ukrainian resistance and “logistical issues.”

Russia’s defense ministry said in an update that it used Kalibr guided missiles to strike a fuel depot near Kyiv.

Chinese Traders Help Russia’s Rusal (8:10 a.m.)

United Co. Rusal International PJSC, the huge aluminum producer fighting blow-back from Russia’s war in Ukraine, is getting some help from traders in China to keep its smelters running.

Some 30,000 tons of alumina -- used to make aluminum metal -- have been loaded onto two vessels headed for Siberia after leaving China in recent weeks, said traders familiar with the matter. The action comes at a time of intense global scrutiny of China’s role in responding to Russia’s growing economic isolation.

China May Send Tech Hardware to Putin, Says EU (2:47 a.m.)

European Union officials suspect that China may be ready to supply semiconductors and other tech hardware to Russia as part of an effort to soften the impact of sanctions imposed over the invasion of Ukraine.

The EU is concerned that China is ready to help President Vladimir Putin’s government weather the economic penalties it has put in place along with the U.S., the U.K. and Japan with particular focus on the availability of high-tech components, according to two people with knowledge of the bloc’s internal assessments.

“We are going to launch a humanitarian operation in conjunction with Turkey and Greece to evacuate all those who wish to leave Mariupol,” Macron told reporters following a two-day European Council summit.

Macron gave few details but said the operation would take place “the earlier the better,” and would be conducted “in coordination” with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian authorities. The French leader also said he was in touch with the mayor of Mariupol.

Von der Leyen said four packages of sanctions imposed by the EU on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine were ""biting hard"", adding that all efforts should now be on enforcing them and preventing ""circumvention and evasion"". EU Council President Charles Michel concurred and said additional measures could be taken. Von der Leyen thanked Ukraine's neighbouring countries for taking in millions of refugees and pledged a package of €17 billion to help those countries cope with the influx. Meanwhile the EU is providing €2.5 billion until 2024 to help the regions most affected by food insecurity, von der Leyen said, as the war began to take its toll on food supply in Ukraine and globally.

Putin earlier compared recent Western criticism of Russia with efforts to ""cancel"" Rowling over her views on transgender issues.

The defence ministry said Russian-backed separatists now controlled 93% of Ukraine's Luhansk region and 54% of the Donetsk region - the two areas that jointly make up the Donbas. ""The main objectives of the first stage of the operation have generally been accomplished,"" Sergei Rudskoi, head of the Russian General Staff's Main Operational Directorate, said. ""The combat potential of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has been considerably reduced, which ... makes it possible to focus our core efforts on achieving the main goal, the liberation of Donbas."" The announcement has been interpreted as a possible move to more limited goals after Putin's forces ran into fierce Ukrainian resistance in the first month of the war. But Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said the ""special military operation"" would continue ""until all objectives are achieved"". Rudskoi also described as a ""big mistake"" the delivery of arms to Kyiv by Western countries. ""It prolongs the conflict, increases the number of victims and will have no influence on the outcome of the operation,"" he declared. He said that 1,351 Russian soldiers have died in Ukraine, and 3,825 have been wounded.

In the month since the war began, more than 3.6 million people have fled the war in Ukraine. Most of them have fled to neighbouring Poland, which has taken in over two million refugees.

Millions of Ukrainians are also internally displaced within the country as heavy fighting and shelling forces people to flee several cities.

More than half of Ukraine's child population is displaced, according to the UN Children's Fund, UNICEF, which called it a ""grim milestone"".

Macron: Aiming to talk to Putin in next 48-72 hours on Mariupol

French President Emmanuel Macron has said he is targeting more talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin within the next 48-72 hours regarding the situation in Ukraine and an initiative to help people leave the besieged city of Mariupol.

Macron said he was coordinating efforts with Greece and Türkiye and hoped to convince Russia to allow the evacuation. ""There was a concrete discussion today with the Mayor of Mariupol. We are coordinating and we will then negotiate with the Russians,"" Macron told reporters after an EU summit in Brussels.

The southeastern port of Mariupol, a city of 400,000 before the conflict, has been among the worst hit by the Russian bombardment.

Tens of thousands of people are still believed to be trapped with little access to food, power or heat, while the city around them has been reduced to ruins.

Türkiye's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has spoken by phone with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy. They discussed the situation on the ground in Ukraine and the stage reached in negotiations between Kiev and Moscow, Erdogan's office said.

Erdogan told Zelenskyy that he had emphasised at this week's NATO summit his support for Ukraine's territorial integrity and that he had conveyed in bilateral talks the ""effective"" diplomatic efforts that Türkiye has made, the statement said.

Zelenskyy said they also discussed ""the threat of the food crisis and ways to prevent it"" and added that he was grateful for Ankara's support.

European Union leaders have urged Russia to fully respect its obligations under international law and abide by a recent order of the International Court of Justice, which told Russia to withdraw from Ukraine.

""Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine grossly violates international law and is causing massive loss of life and injury to civilians,"" the leaders of the 27-nation EU said in a joint statement.

""Russia is directing attacks against the civilian population and is targeting civilian objects, including hospitals, medical facilities, schools and shelters. These war crimes must stop immediately,"" they said.

Macron: European Commission to have mandate to make common energy purchases

The European Commission will have a mandate to make common energy purchases in order to allow the European Union to get a better grip on its energy supplies and on tackling energy prices, French President Emmanuel Macron has said.

Macron also told a news conference in Brussels that there was a need to improve the disconnection between the price of electricity from the price of gas.

Energy prices have risen sharply in the wake of the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

Ukrainians fighting to retake Kherson, now 'contested' city

Ukrainian forces have launched a counter-offensive in Kherson, the country's only major city seized by Russian troops, and it is once again ""contested,"" a senior US defence official has said.

""The Ukrainians are trying to take Kherson back, and we would argue that Kherson is actually contested territory again,"" the Pentagon official told reporters.

""We can't corroborate exactly who is in control of Kherson but the point is, it doesn't appear to be as solidly in Russian control as it was before,"" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Biden compares Russian assault to Tiananmen Square

Biden spoke with US soldiers in Poland and with aid workers helping to deal with the massive refugee crisis. Earlier, he landed in the city of Rzeszow — around 80 kilometres (50 miles) in a straight line from the border with Ukraine.

Biden praised Ukrainians for showing ""backbone"" in their resistance, giving the example of ""a 30-year-old woman standing there in front of a tank with a rifle"". ""I mean, talk about what happened to Tiananmen Square. This is Tiananmen Square squared,"" he said.

You're in the midst of a fight between democracies and autocrats. What you're doing is consequential, really consequential President Joe Biden to US soldiers stationed in Poland

IAEA: Chernobyl staff have not been rotated in four days

Staff on duty at Chernobyl's Russian-held radioactive waste facilities have not been rotated in four days and Ukraine cannot say when that will change because of fighting in the town where many of them live, the UN nuclear watchdog has said.

""Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency today that there had been no rotation of technical staff at (Chernobyl) since 21 March and it did not know when it might next take place,"" the IAEA said in a statement.

Staff now on duty replaced a shift that was there for more than three weeks.

Pope leads global prayer for peace

Pope Francis has led the world's Catholic bishops in praying for peace between Russia and Ukraine, saying the world had forgotten the tragedies of the 20th century and was still menaced by nuclear war.

Francis presided at a service in St. Peter's Basilica in which he entrusted the protection of all humanity, ""especially Russia and Ukraine,"" to Mary, who Christians believe is the Mother of God and who can intercede with him in heaven. Both the Ukrainian and Russian ambassadors to the Vatican attended, sitting on separate sides of the aisle.

At about the same time, thousands of bishops in cathedrals and chapels around the world were reading the same prayer in local languages, resulting in one of the most precisely coordinated global Church event in living memory.

Macron: No reason to accept demands for rouble payments

French President Emmanuel Macron has said there is no reason for France to accept a demand from Russia to pay up in Russian roubles for Russian gas.

Russian President Vladimir Putin had said earlier this week that Russia will seek payment in roubles for gas sold to ""unfriendly"" countries, raising alarm about a possible gas crunch in Europe.

Speaking on national television, Governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said around 65,000 people had so far fled the city in private vehicles or on foot although official efforts to organise mass evacuations under temporary ceasefires have mostly failed.

Ukraine's top security official Oleksiy Danilov said: ""Mariupol is holding on, and no one is going to surrender Mariupol.""

Defence official: US sees Russia focusing on eastern Ukraine

The US assesses that Russia is prioritising eastern Ukraine's Donbass, as opposed to Kiev, in what could be an effort to build leverage in negotiations and cut off Ukrainian forces in the east from the rest of the country, a senior US defence official has said.

Russia said earlier on Friday that the first phase of its military operation was mostly complete and it would focus on completely ""liberating"" Ukraine's breakaway eastern Donbass region.

The US defence official also said Russia was looking to send reinforcements from Georgia.

Ukrainian officials say a Russian air strike on a Mariupol theatre sheltering civilians left hundreds dead last week, prompting authorities in Kiev to call it “the war’s deadliest known attack on civilians yet”.

Russia: First phase of operation mostly complete

Russia has said the first phase of its Ukraine operation is mostly complete and that it would focus on completely ""liberating"" eastern Ukraine's Donbass region.

The announcement appeared to indicate Russia may be switching to more limited goals after running into fierce resistance.

The defence ministry said Russian-backed separatists now controlled 93 percent of Ukraine's Luhansk region and 54 percent of the Donetsk region — the two areas that jointly make up the Donbass.

The combat potential of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has been considerably reduced, which...makes it possible to focus our core efforts on achieving the main goal, the liberation of Donbass Sergei Rudskoi, head of the Russian General Staff's Main Operational Direct

Moscow, Kiev making little progress on key issues

Russia and Ukraine are coming closer to an understanding on secondary issues at peace talks but there has been limited progress on the key questions, Moscow's negotiator Vladimir Medinsky has said.

""On minor issues, positions are drawing closer now, but on major political issues we are actually marking time,"" Medinsky told reporters, Russian news agencies reported.

He said Russia is seeking a comprehensive deal on a whole range of issues, without which an agreement is unlikely.

Meanwhile, Ukraine said the ""negotiation process is very difficult"" and vowed not to back down on its demands. ""We insist, first of all, on a ceasefire, security guarantees, and territorial integrity of Ukraine,"" Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said.

UN: Dozens of Ukrainian officials, journalists detained

Dozens of Ukrainian officials, journalists and activists have been detained or forcibly disappeared by Russian forces, the UN has said, warning that some cases resembled ""hostage-taking"".

The United Nations rights office said it had documented the arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance of 22 local Ukrainian officials, 13 of whom had subsequently been released.

""This does seem to be a pattern that is occurring in areas that are occupied by the Russian Federation,"" said Matilda Bogner, who is the UN rights office's representative in Ukraine. ""Forces of the Russian Federation are going specifically to detain, and do not inform relatives and others where they are taking people.""

Neutral Swiss adopt more EU sanctions against Russia

Russia issues fresh warning over rouble row

Russia's foreign ministry has warned of global bankruptcies should countries refuse to pay for its gas exports in roubles, the RIA news agency has reported.

The ministry also said a Russian exit from the World Trade Organization (WTO) would be counter-productive.

France summons Russian envoy over embassy Twitter cartoon

Russia's ambassador to France has been summoned to the French Foreign Ministry over an earlier embassy Twitter post that Paris deemed unacceptable, the foreign ministry has said.

""These posts are unacceptable. We made that clear today to the Russian Ambassador,"" the ministry said in a statement sent to Reuters news agency.

""We are trying to maintain a demanding channel of dialogue with Russia and these actions are completely inappropriate.""

Russian ambassador sues Italian daily over Putin article

The Russian ambassador to Italy, Sergey Razov, has said he is suing Italian newspaper La Stampa over an article that had raised the possibility of killing President Vladimir Putin.

""Needless to say that this goes against the rules of journalism and morality,"" Razov told reporters in front of the prosecutor's office in Rome after he had deposited the suit.

China's Sinopec 'pauses' Russia projects

China's state-run Sinopec Group has suspended talks for a major petrochemical investment and a gas marketing venture in Russia, sources told Reuters news agency.

The move by Asia's biggest oil refiner to hit the brakes on a potentially half-billion-dollar investment in a gas chemical plant and a venture to market Russian gas in China highlights the risks, even to Russia's most important diplomatic partner, of unexpectedly heavy Western-led sanctions.

Yellen: US sanctions on China not necessary or appropriate

US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said sanctions against China are ""not necessary or appropriate"" since its support for Russia following the attacks on Ukraine was still unclear.

""I don't think that that's necessary or appropriate at this point,"" Yellen said in an interview with CNBC, adding that ""senior administration officials are talking privately quietly with China to make sure that they understand our position.""

She noted Washington ""would be very concerned if they were to supply weapons to Russia. Or to try to evade the sanctions that we've put in place on the Russian financial system and the central bank. We don't see that happening at this point.""

Kremlin: Biden diverting attention on chemical weapons issue

The Kremlin has accused US President Joe Biden of seeking to divert attention from his country's chemical and biological weapons programme, after he said Russia could use such weapons in Ukraine.

US, EU announce new partnership to undercut Russian energy



The United States and European Union have announced a new partnership to reduce the continent's reliance on Russian energy, a step top officials characterised as the start of a years-long initiative to further isolate Moscow after its offensive on Ukraine.

US President Joe Biden asserted that Russian President Vladimir Putin uses energy to “coerce and manipulate his neighbours” and uses the profits from its sale to “drive his war machine.”

Biden said the partnership he announced jointly with a top European Union official will turn that dynamic on its head by reducing Europe's dependence on Russian energy sources, as well as the continent's demand for gas overall.

US President Joe Biden will travel to a town near the Polish-Ukrainian border, trying to signal Western resolve against a Russian offensive that has entered into its second month.

Air Force One will jet into the eastern Polish town of Rzeszow – bringing the US president less than 80 kilometres (50 miles) from a nation still struggling to repel Russian attacks.

The trip is designed to underscore Washington's willingness to defend NATO allies, as fears rise that the month-old conflict in Ukraine could spill westward sparking what the US president has called ""World War III.""

Biden plans gas shipments to Europe to cut Russian leverage

Biden is expected to announce increased shipments of liquefied natural gas to Europe, part of a long-term initiative to wean the continent off Russian energy after the offensive in Ukraine.

He plans to discuss the issue with Ursula von der Leyen, head of the European Union’s executive arm, shortly before leaving for Poland, the final leg of his four-day trip.

Earlier this week, Von der Leyen said ""we are aiming at having a commitment for additional supplies for the next two winters.” And Jake Sullivan, Biden’s national security adviser, recently told reporters that the administration wants to quickly “surge” gas to Europe.

Zelenskyy: Over 2,000 Ukrainian children abducted

Ukraine’s president said that more than 2,000 children have been kidnapped since the start of Russia’s offensive against his country.

""We do not know the whereabouts of our children,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy, speaking at the European Council summit, which he attended virtually.

Zelenskyy also accused Russian forces of firing on humanitarian aid convoys and targeting women and children in evacuation corridors.

Russia more of a burden to China after Ukraine conflict - Pentagon official

Russia's attack on Ukraine has made it more of a strategic burden on China, a senior Pentagon official said.

""I do think that there's a degree to which what Putin has done in Ukraine makes Russia much more of a strategic burden for Beijing than it was six weeks ago or six months ago,"" Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl said.

In February, China and Russia declared a ""no limits"" partnership, backing each other over standoffs on Ukraine and Taiwan with a promise to collaborate more against the West.

Russia claims US president's son involved in financing Ukrainian biolabs

Zelenskyy asks EU leaders for quick membership

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has thanked EU leaders for working together to support Ukraine and impose sanctions on Russia, including Germany's decision to block Russia from delivering natural gas to Europe through the new Nord Stream 2 pipeline.

But he lamented that these steps weren't taken earlier, saying there was a chance Russia would have thought twice about its offensive. He then appealed to the EU leaders, who had gathered in Brussels, to move quickly on Ukraine's application to join the bloc.

He then listed the 27 member countries, noting those he said were ""for us."" He appealed to Germany and particularly to Hungary not to block Ukraine's bid. ""Listen, Viktor, do you know what is happening in Mariupol?"" Zelenskyy said, addressing Hungarian President Viktor Orban. ""I want to be open once and for all — you should decide for yourself, who you are for.""

Orban is widely considered to be Russian President Vladimir Putin's closest ally among EU leaders.

Zelenskyy: Ukraine held back all main directions of Russian attacks

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has marked one month since the beginning of the Russian offensive in an optimistic air, smiling throughout a short video addressed to the Ukrainian people.

Zelenskyy quipped that Russia would have not gone into Ukraine had it known what was waiting for it as the Ukrainian people have been able to stall or hold back most Russian assaults across the frontline.

""The 30th day. If Russia knew such was waiting for it here, I am sure it would have been afraid to come here. In this month we have held back all the main directions of the Russian attacks.""

EU leaders dismiss Putin's rouble payments threat

President Vladimir Putin's threat to have ""unfriendly"" countries pay for Russian natural gas exports only in roubles from now on has got the not-so-friendly treatment from European Union nations.

Several EU leaders have come out saying it would be a gross violation of their contracts. From German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, they said they would not meet such demands.

The Russian threat is potent since the EU imports 90 percent of the natural gas used to generate electricity, heat homes and supply industry, with Russia supplying almost 40 percent of EU gas.

France intends to launch an international rescue operation in the devastated Ukrainian city of Mariupol, President Emmanuel Macron said Friday.

The ""exceptional humanitarian operation"" would begin within ""the next few days,"" Macron said, adding that he would finalize the details over the next 48 hours in a call with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, Le Monde reported.

Around 100,000 people remain trapped in the port city, which has been bombed and besieged by Russian forces for weeks now. On Friday, local authorities said some 300 people were killed last week after Russia bombed a theater that was being used as a shelter. The United Nations said it has also received evidence of mass graves in Mariupol, with one containing 200 corpses.

Macron said the mission to evacuate the city's remaining inhabitants would be conducted with the help of Turkey and Greece. All three nations are members of NATO.

French President Emmanuel Macron said on Friday that he was hoping to have more talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin ""in the coming hours"" regarding the situation in Ukraine and any plans to help people leave Mariupol.

The southeastern port of Mariupol, a city of 400,000 before the war, has been among the worst hit by the Russian bombardment. Tens of thousands of people are still believed to be trapped with little access to food, power or heat, while the city around them has been reduced to ruins.

Moscow signalled on Friday it was scaling back its ambitions in Ukraine to focus on territory claimed by Russian-backed separatists as Ukrainian forces went on the offensive to recapture towns on the outskirts of the capital Kyiv.
