On Saturday, Zelenskyy said that a total of 1,300 soldiers were killed by Russia. This is the first time he President mentioned Ukraine's estimated military casualties, The Kyiv Independent reported. Notably, Ukraine's armed forces estimate Russian casualties to be over 12,000.

Meanwhile, western countries have imposed comprehensive sanctions on Moscow. On February 24, Russia launched a military operation in Ukraine after the Donetsk and Luhansk people's republic requested help in defending themselves.

The Russian Defense Ministry said the special operation is targeting Ukrainian military infrastructure only and the civilian population is not in danger. The West has denied these claims by the Russians and in response, Western nations have imposed comprehensive sanctions on Moscow. In addition, they introduced sanctions on Belarus for supporting Russia's operation in Ukraine.

Despite the glimmer of hope offered up by Zelensky's comments on the progress of negotiations, the Ukraine president has remained steadfast in his condemnation of Vladimir Putin and in detailing his country's unwillingness to surrender.

In his latest address, Zelensky said that Russia may only occupy the capital of Kyiv if it ""razes it to the ground"".

""We know 100% that we will win,"" he said. ""And 100% we don't know when.

""Our diplomats are discussing details with the Russian federation and I hope that we will have a settlement process, a peace process, to end the war.

""There should be a ceasefire. If there are tens of thousands of people whom Russia is now mobilising and if they come here with hundreds and thousands of tanks; they will enter Kyiv, we understand that.

""If they do carpet bombings and if they decide to erase the historical memory of this whole region, if they destroy all of us, [only then] they will enter Kyiv.""

In his previous address, Zelensky stated that Russian forces have ""transitioned into a new state of terror"" and accused his enemies of trying to ""physically liquidate"" Ukrainian authority figures.

""The kidnapping of Melitopol's mayor isn't just a crime against an individual person or a specific society or against Ukraine,"" he said.

""It's a crime against democracy as a whole. I assure you 100% of people in all democratic countries will learn about this.

""And the actions of the Russian invaders will be equated to the actions of ISIS terrorists.""

Following a 75- minute phone call between Macron, Scholz, and Vladimir Putin on Saturday, Sky News has quoted a French presidency official who says that Putin ""did not appear ready to end the war"".

UKRAINE-RUSSIA CONFLICT: FULL COVERAGE

Meanwhile, Russia on Wednesday said that it was not trying to overthrow the regime of Volodymyr Zelensky in Ukraine, AFP reported. Russia also said that negotiations with Ukrainian officials to resolve the conflict were making headway.

During a press briefing on Wednesday on the three rounds of talks with Kyiv, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said, ""Some progress has been made"".

The development comes after President Zelensky said he was no longer pressing for NATO membership for Ukraine, a delicate issue that was one of Russia's stated reasons for invading its pro-Western neighbour.

In another remark aimed at placating Moscow, Zelensky said he was open to ""compromise"" on the status of two breakaway pro-Russian territories that President Vladimir Putin recognised as independent just before invading Ukraine on February 24.

After agreeing to a ceasefire for two consecutive days, now Russia and Ukraine have agreed on day-long evacuation corridors.

According to news agency AFP, both countries have agreed on providing humanitarian corridors for an entire day. This comes after at least 10 people were killed in a Russian military attack in the eastern Ukrainian town of Severodonestk.

On the other hand, Ukraine's youngest Member of Parliament, Sviatoslav Yurash, lauded India for the humanitarian steps undertaken to assist those affected by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Sviatoslav Yurash also said India must reconsider its strategic partnership with Russia and punish the country for the ""misdeeds"" of Russian President Vladimir Putin.",https://news.abplive.com/news/world/russian-ukraine-war-live-updates-day-15-ukraine-crisis-indian-students-kyiv-live-updates-belarus-peace-talks-humanitarian-situation-in-ukraine-1518062

According to the latest UK Defence Intelligence report, the Russian troops are now about 25km from the Ukrainian capital.

From their current position, they have been firing artillery towards residential areas in the city. Ukrainian media reported that two oil depots on the outskirts were both his this morning, one of which is located in the Vasylkiv, which is also the location of a large airbase.

The same intelligence report suggested Russian forces could launch an offensive on Kyiv within the next few days.

Elsewhere, Russian forces have continued their bombardment of other cities.

Ukrainian officials said that seven civilians were killed when Russian forces opened fire upon an evacuation convoy leaving Kyiv.

The cities of Kharkiv, Cherniv and Sumy remain surrounded by Russian forces, as Ukrainian officials desperately attempted to establish humanitarian corridors.

Ukraine also said it expected a new wave of attacks on the country's second city Kharkiv and Donbass in the east, where Russian-backed separatists have expanded their control.

Russia also appears to be widening the scope of its attacks, given strikes are reported to have hit airfields in Lutsk, Ivano-Frankivsh - both of which are in the east of the country, and far from where fighting has been concentrated thus far.

In the southern port city of Mariupol, which has been under near-constant attack over the last two weeks, a ceasefire and agreed humanitarian corridor is holding, at least for now, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

However, the situation on the ground in the city is reported to be grim.

In a statement, the UN Humanitarian Office said there were ‚Äúreports of looting and violent confrontations among civilians over what little basic supplies remain in the city‚Äù with ""medicines for life-threatening illnesses are quickly running out, hospitals are only partially functioning, and the food and water are in short supply.""

At least 1,582 civilians in Mariupol have been killed as a result of Russian shelling and a 12-day blockade, the city council said in an online statement on Friday.

‚ÄúThey are bombing it (Mariupol) 24 hours a day, launching missiles. It is hatred. They kill children,‚Äù Mr Zelenskyy said during a video address.

Meanwhile, in what is likely to raise fears of a potential escalation in the conflict, a senior Russian diplomat has warned that from now on, Russian forces will consider arms shipments to Ukraine as ‚Äúlegitimate targets‚Äù for attacks.

Mr Ryabkov reportedly said that Russia had made its position clear to the United States and others.

He said that Russia ‚Äúwarned the US that pumping weapons from a number of countries it orchestrates isn‚Äôt just a dangerous move, it‚Äôs an action that makes those convoys legitimate targets‚Äù.

Denouncing US sanctions against Moscow, he also said they were an ‚Äúunprecedented attempt to deal a serious blow to various sectors of the Russian economy‚Äù.

At a news briefing this afternoon, President Zelenskyy said any negotiations between Russia and Ukraine must begin with a ceasefire. He also accused the West of being insufficiently involved in peace talks to date.

At the same briefing, Mr Zelenskyy said that 1,300 Ukrainian troops had been killed since the Russian invasion began on February 24.

He also claimed that between 500 and 600 Russian troops surrendered to Ukrainian forces on Friday. Both figures are yet to be independently verified.

Also this afternoon, Reuters reported that French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin by phone, and urged him to call an immediate ceasefire.
