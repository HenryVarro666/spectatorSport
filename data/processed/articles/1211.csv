In an emotional speech in the middle of the night, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said it would be the “end for everyone, the end for Europe” if there was an explosion at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.

He added: “Only urgent action by Europe can stop the Russian troops. Do not allow the death of Europe from a catastrophe at a nuclear power station.”

Reports claim firefights cannot get near the flames because they are “being shot at” by Russian troops.

Ukraine’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba added the Russian army was “firing from all sides” upon the nuclear plant.

In a tweet earlier this morning, he warned if the nuclear plant blows up, “it will be 10 times larger than Chornobyl” – the world’s worst nuclear disaster.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was made aware of reports of shelling at the nuclear power plant, however, it was informed the fire has not affected essential equipment and plant personnel are taking mitigatory actions.

The IAEA has put its Incident and Emergency Centre “in full 24/7 response mode” due to the serious situation in Ukraine.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about the “gravely concerning” situation in the early hours of the morning.

He said he will seek an emergency UN Security Council meeting and raise the issue immediately with Russia and close partners.

Mr Johnson tweeted: “Russia must immediately cease its attack on the power station and allow unfettered access for emergency services to the plant.”

UK calls for UNSC meeting over situation at Zaporizhzhia NPP

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has held a phone conversation with Volodymyr Zelensky, vowing to call an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council within the next several hours over the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (NPP), the Downing Street said.

""The Prime Minister spoke to Ukrainian President Zelenskyy in the early hours of this morning about the gravely concerning situation at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station. Both leaders agreed that Russia must immediately cease its attack on the power station and allow unfettered access for emergency services to the plant,"" the Downing Street said in a statement.

""The Prime Minister said he would be seeking an emergency UN Security Council meeting in the coming hours, and that the UK would raise this issue immediately with Russia and close partners. Both leaders agreed a ceasefire was crucial,"" the statement added.

Russian efforts to prevent Ukraine from acquiring nuclear weapons

In early March, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov announced that Russia is taking all measures to prevent Ukraine from acquiring nuclear weapons.

On February 26, the third day after the beginning of Russia's special operation in Ukraine, the Russian army published the first scenes from inside the Chernobyl nuclear plant, located in northern Ukraine.

The Russian soldiers secured and protected the station, carrying out searches for mines or any threat that might endanger the safety of the station.

On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the launch of a special military operation in Ukraine, stressing that ""the totality of events and analysis of information shows that a confrontation between Russia and nationalist forces in Ukraine is inevitable... it is a matter of time."" He pointed out that ""Russia will not allow Ukraine to acquire nuclear weapons.""

On the same day, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said Moscow's military operation in Ukraine is not a beginning of a war, but rather an attempt at curbing a global one.

""First of all, it is not a beginning of a war. It is very important. Our desire is to prevent the developments that could escalate into a global war. Second of all, it is the end of a war,"" Zakharova told NTV, a Russian broadcaster.

Budapest Memorandum

Before the start of the Russian military operation, on the 20th of last month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced at the Munich Security Conference that he would start consultations within the framework of reconsidering the Budapest Memorandum.

Zelensky told the Munich Security Conference he ""instructed the Foreign Ministry to convene a summit of the countries - signatories to the Budapest Memorandum. If it fails to take place or refuses to give Ukraine security guarantees, Kiev will recognize it as well as the clauses signed in 1994 as null and void.""

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also spoke to Zelenskyy regarding Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and condemned Russia.

“DPM @cafreeland and I just spoke with President @ZelenskyyUa about the horrific attacks at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. These unacceptable attacks by Russia must cease immediately,” tweeted Trudeau.

Meanwhile, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said that the Russian army has opened fire on Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (NPP).

“Russian army has opened fire on Zaporizhzhia NPP. No state except Russia has ever opened fire at nuclear power units. For the first time in human history, a terrorist state has resorted to nuclear terror. Only immediate European action can stop Russian troops,” tweeted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine.

“Russian army is firing from all sides upon Zaporizhzhia NPP, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Fire has already broken out. If it blows up, it will be 10 times larger than Chornobyl! Russians must IMMEDIATELY cease the fire, allow firefighters, establish a security zone!,” tweeted Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba,

Ukraine’s nuclear regulator told the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) there is “no change reported in radiation levels at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant site,” the IAEA tweeted on Friday.

Ukrainian officials said early Friday a fire had broken out at the nuclear plant as Russian forces attacked “from all sides,” with firefighters unable to reach the site.

The Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Mariano Grossi, has spoken with Ukraine’s Prime Minister and the country’s nuclear regulator about the reported fire at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, the IAEA said on Twitter early Friday.

Grossi “appeals for halt of use of force and warns of severe danger if reactors hit,” the tweet added.

Earlier on Friday — before the fire broke out — the IAEA released a statement warning that Russian troops were approaching the area and any fighting near the plant could be disastrous. (ANI)

The Ukrainian President Zelenskyy called Russia's advances ""nuclear terror"".







Zaporizhzhia, the nuclear power plant under attack



This close escape from a nuclear disaster has caused global concerns and reminded Ukrainians of the Chernobyl disaster of 1986 which caused radioactive waste to be released into the environment leading to as many as 93,000 extra cancer deaths globally.



Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (NPP) in Energodar, 500 km south of Kyiv, has six reactors, one of which caught fire due to the Russian attack. The Zaporizhzhia NPP generates 25 per cent of Ukraine's electricity.



The power units are not designed to be hit by bombs or projectiles. As informed by Dmytro Humenyuk, State Scientific and Technical Center for Nuclear and Radiation Safety, to Hromadske, Ukraine's media house, if the reactor is seriously damaged and nuclear fuel exposed, the resulting catastrophe would be as bad as Chernobyl and if more than one reactor is hit, the result would be even more horrific.



A recent statement by Greenpeace, an international non-profit, warned that the military invasion of Ukraine poses an unprecedented nuclear threat, with the country’s 15 commercial nuclear reactors, at risk of catastrophic damage that could render vast areas of the European continent, including Russia, uninhabitable for decades.



The scale of the nuclear threat at Zaporizhzhia can be discerned by turning back to history. The 1986 Chernobyl disaster, the world's worst nuclear accident, was such that it contaminated the local vegetation and water supply in the local region for decades. Radioactive particles from an estimated five tonnes of the reactor’s fuel were carried into the air during the 1986 explosion and fire, spreading contamination around Europe.

The Chernobyl plant hasn’t produced electricity in more than two decades, and much of the equipment has been removed. Mariana Budjeryn, a Ukrainian expert on nuclear energy at Harvard University’s Belfer Center, pointed out that “There are contingencies but I doubt that these power plants have prepared for a full-scale invasion. In the middle of a large-scale conflict, there’s a myriad of things that could happen, for which normal, even very robust, safety procedures at a nuclear power plant would be insufficient, Budjeryn said speaking to The Guardian.



In all of history, only Chernobyl and Fukushima nuclear disasters have been designated a ""level 7"" nuclear accident, a classification used by the IAEA to refer to major events with widespread health and environmental effects. Although, a disaster was averted, the continued Russian bombardment of nuclear sites makes the prospect of catastrophe likely.



IAEA urged Russia to let Ukraine control its nuclear facilities



IAIEA, the UN nuclear watchdog's Board of Governors backed a resolution on Thursday that ""deplores"" Russia's invasion of Ukraine and urges it to let Ukraine control all its nuclear facilities.

Russia, which, with China, voted against the resolution, said it was based on ""politically motivated lies and mistakes"". The resolution was passed at an emergency meeting of the 35-nation Board called by Canada and Poland on Ukraine's behalf.



Director General, IAEA, Rafael Grossi, asked Moscow to ""immediately cease all actions against, and at, the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant and any other nuclear facility in Ukraine, in order for the competent Ukrainian authorities to preserve or promptly regain full control"".



I'm deeply concerned with situation at #Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. Spoke with #Ukraine PM Denys Shmygal; @IAEAorg's monitoring and in close contact with #Ukraine's nuclear regulator and operator. I appeal to parties to refrain from actions that can put NPPs in danger. — Rafael MarianoGrossi (@rafaelmgrossi) March 4, 2022





Three days before the attack, Grossi had said that there were on-going and active conversations happening with both sides in Ukraine about how the IAEA could assist. He said: ""Ukraine is a member state of the IAEA, and they are entitled to, and expect to get assistance when there is a problem, in this case related to the safety of their facilities. Obviously in the present circumstances, delivering assistance is not a straightforward or easy process.

Ukraine had in late February called on the IAEA to intervene to prevent occupying forces in the 30 kilometre zone around nuclear power plants.



Furthermore, the White House, following the attack on the NPP, said in a series of tweets that Biden ""joined President Zelenskyy in urging Russia to cease its military activities in the area and allow firefighters and emergency responders to access the site.""



Further, the US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm tweeted that she had spoken with her Ukrainian counterpart and said that the site's reactors are protected by ""robust containment structures"" and ""are being safely shut down.""

A fire at the Zaporitzhzhia nuclear power station in Ukraine, which broke out in a training building outside the plant's perimeter following an attack by Russian troops, has been put out, Ukraine's state emergency service said Friday.

Earlier, an official in Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's office said the reactors had not been damaged and radiation levels were normal. The official spoke on condition of anonymity due to not being authorized to speak publicly.

The plant's director also told Ukraine 24 television that radiation safety had been secured at the site.

The fire at the plant, the largest of its kind in Europe, prompted telephone calls between Zelensky and the leaders of the United States, Britain, European Union and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) about the possibility of a nuclear disaster.

""If there is an explosion — that's the end for everyone. The end for Europe. The evacuation of Europe,"" he said in an emotional speech in the middle of the night.

Leading nuclear authorities were concerned — but not panicked — about the damage to the power station. The U.S. Department of Energy activated its nuclear incident response team as a precaution.

Zelensky also spoke with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland about the nuclear plant.

The IAEA reported it had been informed by Ukraine's regulator that there was no change in radiation levels at the plant. It later said in a tweet that the fire had not affected ""essential"" equipment, but said its Incident and Emergency Centre had been put into what it called a 24/7 response mode.

Earlier, Russian forces shelled the plant in the battle for control of the crucial energy-producing city of Enerhodar, and the power station was on fire.

Plant spokesperson Andriy Tuz told Ukrainian television that shells were falling directly on the Zaporizhzhia plant and had set fire to one of the facility's six reactors. That reactor is under renovation and not operating, but there is nuclear fuel inside, he said.

Firefighters could not get near the fire because they were being shot at, Tuz said.

Ukraine's foreign minister warned that if the plant explodes, it will be 10 times worse than the 1986 Chornobyl disaster, when a reactor went into meltdown and sent nearly 10 tonnes of radioactive material into the atmosphere and surrounding regions about 100 kilometres north of Kyiv. Two workers were killed immediately and another 30 died within weeks from radiation exposure.

A live-streamed security camera linked from the homepage of the nuclear power plant showed what appeared to be armoured vehicles rolling into the facility's parking lot and shining spotlights on the building where the camera was mounted. There are then what appear to be bright muzzle flashes from vehicles and then nearly simultaneous explosions in the surrounding buildings.

Enerhodar is a city on the Dnieper River.

2nd round of talks

The fighting at Enerhodar came as another round of talks between the two sides yielded a tentative agreement to set up safe corridors to evacuate citizens and deliver humanitarian aid.

While the huge Russian armoured column threatening Kyiv appeared bogged down outside the capital, Putin's forces have brought their superior firepower to bear over the past few days, launching hundreds of missiles and artillery attacks on cities and other sites around the country and making significant gains in the south.

The mayor of Enerhodar said Ukrainian forces were battling Russian troops on the city's outskirts. Video showed flames and black smoke rising above the city of more than 50,000, with people streaming past wrecked cars, just a day after the UN atomic watchdog agency expressed grave concern that the fighting could cause accidental damage to Ukraine's 15 nuclear reactors.

Mayor Dmytro Orlov and the Ukrainian state atomic energy company had earlier reported that a Russian military column was heading toward the nuclear plant. Loud shots and rocket fire were heard late Thursday.

The Pentagon set up a direct communication link to Russia's Ministry of Defence earlier this week to avoid the possibility of a miscalculation sparking conflict between Moscow and Washington, according to a U.S. defence official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the link had not been announced.

Ukrainian leaders called on the people to defend their homeland by cutting down trees, erecting barricades in the cities and attacking enemy columns from the rear. In recent days, authorities have issued weapons to civilians and taught them how to make Molotov cocktails.

""Total resistance. … This is our Ukrainian trump card, and this is what we can do best in the world,"" Oleksiy Arestovich, an aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, said in a video message, recalling guerrilla actions in Nazi-occupied Ukraine during the Second World War.

Civilians flee fighting

The two sides said that they tentatively agreed to allow cease-fires in areas designated as safe corridors, and that they would seek to work out the necessary details quickly. A Zelensky adviser also said a third round of talks will be held early next week.

More than one million people have fled Ukraine following Russia's invasion, the swiftest refugee exodus this century, the United Nations refugee agency said, as Russian forces continued their push for control of key cities.

""Hour by hour, minute by minute, more people are fleeing the terrifying reality of violence,"" UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said in a statement. ""Countless have been displaced inside the country.""

""While the scale and scope of displacement is not yet clear, we do expect that more than 10 million people may flee their homes if violence continues, including four million people who may cross borders to neighbouring countries,"" according to spokesperson Stephane Dujarric.

""It's been so fast and so shocking,"" Danny Glenwright, head of charitable organization Save the Children Canada, said of the mass movement of Ukrainians out of the country.

""Imagine, one day you've got your kids in school, and there's structure in their lives,"" he said. ""The next day, they wake up, and they have to flee with really very little, over long distances in freezing conditions.""

UNICEF, the United Nations children's agency, has said that within Ukraine, 7.5 million children are at ""heightened risk"" as the conflict escalates.

In a statement earlier this week, UNICEF executive director Catherine Russell said that access issues on the ground and ""rapidly changing front lines"" have made it difficult to deliver critical supplies and services.

The mass evacuation could be seen in Kharkiv, a city of about 1.5 million people where residents desperate to escape falling shells and bombs crowded the city's train station and pressed onto trains, not always knowing where they were headed.

Families with children fled via muddy and snowy roads in the eastern region of Donetsk, while military strikes on the village of Yakovlivka near the eastern city of Kharkiv destroyed 30 homes, leaving three people dead and seven wounded, according to emergency authorities.

Halyna Yanchenko, a Ukrainian member of parliament, told CBC News Network Thursday that a Russian missile recently hit a couple of blocks from her home on the outskirts of Kyiv.

Yanchenko, who is still in the capital region, sent her children away to the western part of the country — and even still, she says, she doesn't know if they will be safe.

She called the fight against Russia a ""matter of survival"" and said civilians are being killed in the Russian attacks. The UN human rights office said on Thursday that it had confirmed 249 civilians have been killed and 553 injured in the first week of the conflict, with the toll having risen overnight from 227 deaths and 525 injured reported a day ago.

The situation in Ukraine's capital Kyiv is ""difficult but under control,"" Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Thursday. Klitschko said there were no casualties overnight and that nighttime explosions were Ukrainian air defences striking down incoming Russian missiles. He said a heating system site damaged by Russian shelling on Wednesday would be fixed during the day.

On the far edges of Kyiv, volunteers well into their 60s manned a checkpoint to try to block the Russian advance. ""In my old age, I had to take up arms,"" said Andrey Goncharuk, 68. He said the fighters needed more weapons, but ""we'll kill the enemy and take their weapons.""

In Kherson, the Russians announced the capture of the southern city of Kherson, and local Ukrainian officials confirmed that forces have taken over local government headquarters in the vital Black Sea port of 280,000. But the U.S. believes that Russian forces have not yet taken over the city.



A senior U.S. defence official said Thursday the city could be used as part of a strategy for potentially moving to Mykolaiv and then onto Odesa.



Britain's defence secretary said it was possible the Russians had taken over, though that was not yet verified. If Kherson were to be captured, it would be the first significant urban centre to fall into the hands of Russian troops.

From Kherson, Russian troops appeared to roll toward Mykolaiv, another major Black Sea port and shipbuilding centre to the west along the coast. The regional governor, Vitaliy Kim, said that big convoys of Russian troops are advancing on the city but said that they will likely need to regroup before trying to take it over.

Lavrov acknowledges civilian deaths

In a statement, the UN human rights office said most of the civilian casualties so far were caused by ""the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems.""

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov voiced regret for civilian casualties, insisting that the military is only using precision weapons against military targets, despite abundant evidence of shelling of homes, schools and hospitals. However, he tacitly acknowledged that some Russian strikes could have killed civilians, saying that ""any military action is fraught with casualties, and not just among the military but also civilians.""

Russia reported its military casualties Wednesday for the first time in the war, saying nearly 500 of its troops had been killed and almost 1,600 wounded.

Ukraine did not disclose its own military losses. A Facebook post from Ukrainian military officials said that Russia's forces had suffered some 9,000 casualties in the fighting. It did not clarify if that figure included both killed and wounded soldiers.

Putin himself said in remarks Thursday that the Russians were using ""only precision weapons to exclusively destroy military infrastructure"" and blamed reports that say otherwise on an ""anti-Russian disinformation campaign.""

In a call with Emmanuel Macron in which the French president asked him to halt the attack on Ukraine, Putin said he was determined to press on with the invasion ""until the end,"" according to Macron's office.

In a video address to the nation early Thursday, Zelensky praised his country's resistance.

""We are a people who in a week have destroyed the plans of the enemy,"" the president said. ""They will have no peace here. They will have no food. They will have here not one quiet moment.""

""These are not warriors of a superpower,"" he said of the Russian forces on the ground. ""These are confused children who have been used.""

ICC team heads to region

An advance team left the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague for ""the Ukraine region"" on Thursday to start investigating possible war crimes, its top prosecutor told Reuters in an interview. Their departure came hours after prosecutor Karim Khan said he would start collecting evidence as part of a formal investigation launched after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine that began on Feb. 24.

Neither Russia nor Ukraine are members of the ICC, and Moscow does not recognize the court, which was established in 1997 by the Rome Statute and opened in The Hague in 2002.

Though not a member of the ICC, Ukraine signed a declaration in 2014 giving the court jurisdiction over alleged grave crimes committed on its territory from 2014 onward regardless of the nationality of the perpetrators.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ukraine-russia-invasion-march3-2022-1.6371091
