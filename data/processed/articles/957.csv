According to him, the occupiers stationed their artillery in Boromlyany community and from there continue to fire on Trostyanets community. In the evening of March 23, a large fire broke out at one of the enterprises, which continues to this day - due to constant shelling and fighting, rescuers cannot get to put out the fire.



Zhyvytskyy added that neither the communal services nor the energy sector are fully operational in the Trostyanets community - the community is still without electricity.

Also there are still shelling of the settlements of Lebedyn and Krasnopil communities, the southern part of the suburbs of Sumy.

However, despite all this, according to Zhyvytskyy, the region is trying to provide humanitarian aid, deliver bread, restore markets and partially transport (for example, in the city of Romny), deliver a little medicine and fuel.

Britain is to provide 6,000 new defensive missiles and £25m for the Ukrainian armed forces in a bid to help push back the Russian invasion.

It comes as Mr Johnson is set to meet with Nato leaders at a summit in Brussels on Thursday, with the focus of discussions on how to bring an end to the conflict.

Mr Johnson has promised to use the meeting to push for extra support for Ukraine's military. Other issues on the agenda include humanitarian assistance for Ukrainian refugees, and sanctions on Russia.

Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky is also expected to speak to leaders at the gathering. Mr Johnson also spoke to Mr Zelensky on Wednesday afternoon ahead of the summit.

Kicking off the meeting on Wednesday Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance was “concerned” over Russia potentially using chemical weapons in the country.

And he said Mr Putin's government “must stop its nuclear sabre-rattling”, branding the approach “dangerous and it is irresponsible”.

“Russia must understand that it can never win a nuclear war,” Mr Stoltenberg added on the eve of the summit – a major gathering which EU officials in Brussels are describing as an “extravaganza”.

But Mr Johnson faces an apparent snub as he arrives in the city, facing exclusion from the second part of the gathering of world leaders.

US president Joe Biden has been invited join the 27 EU presidents and prime ministers for a European Council meeting in the same city on the same day, where discussions about the conflict are expected to continue following the Nato summit.

But despite reports that Mr Johnson wanted to attend the second meeting, he was not invited and will miss the second part of day's proceedings.

The lack of an invitation raised speculation that the prime minister's comments over the weekend, comparing the war in Ukraine to Brexit, played a role in the snub.

Those words sparked fury in Brussels and other EU capitals, with former council president Donald Tusk branding them “offensive” to Ukrainians, British people, and even “common sense”.

Officials in Brussels are however downplaying any link between what Mr Johnson said and the lack of an invitation.

A senior EU official noted that European Council president Charles Michel had had “a long phone call with Prime Minister Johnson on Monday” and that this took place after Mr Johnson's remarks.

The official said Mr Johnson would have another opportunity to meet EU chiefs at a meeting of G7 leaders.

“The feeling was that we invite the president of the United States to the European Council, but we are not repeating the formats that we have had around the day,” the official added.

Britain was automatically allowed to attend the European Council as a member of the EU, but no longer has a seat on the body, which meets four times a year in the Belgian capital.

Speaking ahead of his attendance at the Nato leg of the gathering, Mr Johnson said: “Vladimir Putin is already failing in Ukraine. The Ukrainian people have shown themselves to be extraordinarily brave and tenacious in defending their homeland, in the face of an unprovoked onslaught.

“But we cannot and will not stand by while Russia grinds Ukraine’s towns and cities into dust. The United Kingdom will work with our allies to step up military and economic support to Ukraine, strengthening their defences as they turn the tide in this fight.

“One month into this crisis, the international community faces a choice. We can keep the flame of freedom alive in Ukraine, or risk it being snuffed out across Europe and the world.”

A Downing Street spokesperson confirmed Mr Johnson had spoken to Mr Zelensky and said he was updated on the latest developments on the ground.

“The prime minister reiterated his admiration for the bravery of the Ukrainian armed forces and their success in repulsing Russia’s onslaught,” the spokesperson said.

“He said the bombardment of civilian areas, including the siege of Mariupol, is unconscionable and demands a response from the international community.

“The prime minister set out his intention to use tomorrow’s G7 and Nato meetings to increase the pressure on Vladimir Putin’s regime and work with partners to substantively increase defensive lethal aid to Ukraine. Leaders would look to address Ukraine’s requests and ensure President Zelensky is in the strongest possible position in ongoing peace talks.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-ukraine-summit-nato-arms-b2042466.html
5,39192e79-054a-4964-9b49-3eeb50c3c34b,[],2022-03-23 14:19:50+00:00,"The general secretary of Nato has told Vladimir Putin to stop ""nuclear sabre-rattling"" and said the alliance has concerns that weapons of mass destruction could be used in Ukraine.

Speaking to reporters on Wednesday ahead of a Nato leaders' summit in Brussels Jens Stoltenberg said Russia could not ""win a nuclear war"".

His comments come after Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia could use nuclear weapons in defined circumstances and in the case of an ""existential threat for our country"".

Last month Mr Putin ordered Russia's nuclear forces on high alert – while UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres warned last week that “the prospect of nuclear conflict, once unthinkable, is now back within the realm of possibility”.

Mr Stoltenberg, the face of the military alliance, told reporters that Russia “must stop its nuclear sabre-rattling”, branding the approach “dangerous and it is irresponsible”.

""Russia must understand that it can never win a nuclear war,"" he added on the eve of the meeting, whose attendees will include Joe Biden and Boris Johnson.

But in a news conference kicking off the meeting Mr Stoltenberg reiterated the alliance's position that it would not deploy soldiers to Ukraine.

""Nato is not part of the conflict ... it provides support to Ukraine but isn't part of the conflict,"" he said.

""Nato will not send the troops into Ukraine... It is extremely important to provide support to Ukraine and we are stepping up. But at the same time it is also extremely important to prevent this conflict becoming a full-fledged war between NATO and Russia.""

There is little sign of an immediate threat of nuclear weapons being used in Ukraine, where Russian forces have encountered stiffer resistance than expected from dug-in Ukrainian troops.

But Mr Stoltenberg noted that Russia had apparently facilitated the use of chemical weapons in Syria and elsewhere.

""Russia has used chemical agents before against their own opposition and also on Nato ally territory in Salisbury,"" he said.

""And Russia was of course, part of the use of chemical weapons in Syria. They facilitated and supported the Assad regime, which has actually used chemical weapons several times.

""So we are concerned and that's also reason why we are ready and we'll address tomorrow ways to provide support to Ukraine to protect themselves.""

The secretary general on Wednesday also called on China to condemn Russia's invasion, claiming that the east Asian country's government had spread misinformation about the situation on the ground and about Nato itself.

Boris Johnson is to arrive at the top-level meeting in the Belgian capital on Thursday morning. Later on Thursday European leaders will then attend an EU European Council summit – bringing Joe Biden with them as a guest. Mr Johnson has not been invited and is expected to return home after the first meeting.

At the Nato meeting leaders are expected to discuss how to seek an end to the conflict in Ukraine. Leaders are under pressure to make announcements about new sanctions on Russia, as well as more humanitarian assistance for refugees and extra support for Ukraine’s military. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy is expected to speak to leaders.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/russia-nuclear-putin-ukraine-nato-b2042251.html
