Good afternoon.

We have just finished an extraordinary summit of NATO leaders to address the biggest threat to our security in a generation:

President Putin’s war against Ukraine.

The people of Ukraine are resisting with courage and determination.

Fighting for their freedom and for their future.

We stand with them.

President Zelensky addressed us with an impassioned message.

Thanking NATO Allies for the significant support we are providing.

And stressing the vital importance of even more military assistance.

Today, NATO leaders agreed that we must and will provide further support to Ukraine.

We will continue to impose unprecedented costs on Russia.

And we will reinforce Allied deterrence and defence.

Leaders approved our four new NATO battlegroups.

In Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia.

These are in addition to the four already in the Baltic countries and Poland.

So we have eight multinational NATO battlegroups now.

From the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea.

Across Europe, there are one hundred thousand US troops supporting NATO efforts.

And European Allies and Canada have also stepped up.

We have 40,000 forces under direct NATO command, mostly in the eastern part of the Alliance.

Backed by major air and naval power.

Including an unprecedented five carrier strike groups from the High North to the Mediterranean.

Today, NATO leaders agreed to reset our deterrence and defence for the longer-term.

To face a new security reality.

On land, we will have substantially more forces in the eastern part of the Alliance, at higher readiness.

With more prepositioned equipment and supplies.

In the air, we will deploy more jets.

And strengthen our integrated air and missile defence.

At sea, we will have carrier strike groups, submarines and significant numbers of combat ships on a persistent basis.

We will also strengthen our cyber defences.

And enhance our exercises, focusing on collective defence and interoperability.

I expect we will decide on the details at our next Summit in Madrid in June.

Today, Allied leaders also agreed to provide further support to Ukraine.

Helping to uphold their fundamental right to self-defence.

Allies are also equipping Ukraine with significant military supplies.

Including anti-tank and air defence systems, and drones.

Which are proving highly effective.

As well as substantial financial and humanitarian aid.

Today, we agreed to do more.

Including cybersecurity assistance.

And equipment to help Ukraine protect against biological, chemical, radiological, and nuclear threats.

This could include detection, protection, and medical supplies, as well as training for decontamination and crisis management.

We are determined to do all we can to support Ukraine.

And I welcome the concrete offers of assistance made by Allies today.

At the same time, we have a responsibility to ensure the conflict does not escalate further. Because this would be even more dangerous and more devastating.

Allies agreed that we must also increase our support for other partners at risk from Russian threats and interference.

Including Georgia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Working together, and with the European Union, we must help them uphold their sovereignty and strengthen their resilience.

We also addressed Beijing’s role in the crisis.

Today, Allied leaders called on China to refrain from supporting Russia’s war effort.

China must not provide economic or military support for the Russian invasion.

Instead, Beijing should use its significant influence on Russia.

And promote an immediate, peaceful resolution.

Allies also agreed that Belarus must stop acting as an accomplice to Putin’s invasion.

At today’s meeting, leaders reaffirmed our strong commitment to NATO’s Open Door policy, under Article 10 of the Washington Treaty.

NATO enlargement has been an historic success.

Spreading democracy, freedom, and prosperity across Europe.

One month since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, NATO’s security environment has fundamentally changed.

For the long haul.

And we are responding.

But security does not come for free.

And doing more will cost more.

So NATO leaders agreed to redouble efforts to meet the Defence Investment Pledge we made in 2014.

Allies will submit additional plans on how to meet the pledge in time for the Madrid Summit in June.

And I welcome that a number of Allies today announced plans for significant increases in defence spending.

At this dangerous time, transatlantic unity and solidarity are vital.

Europe and North America are standing, and will continue to stand, strong together in NATO.

With that, I am ready to take your questions.

Natasha Bertrand (CNN): Hi, Mr Secretary General, thank you. President Zelensky in his address to NATO accused Russia of deploying phosphorus munitions. I am wondering whether NATO has seen evidence of that and what your response is or would be? And then I am wondering, did you discuss during this meeting a permanent basing of forces in any of these countries such as the Baltics and abandoning the NATO-Russia Founding Act?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: So we are resetting NATO’s deterrence and defence for the long term, with more troops, with more air assets and more maritime capabilities. We have already increased our presence in the east and today we decided on four new battlegroups. The leaders agreed to task our military commanders to provide options for a long-term reset of our presence, of our military posture in the eastern part of the Alliance and across the whole Alliance. Details will be then decided at our summit in June but that comes on top for what we have already done. So this is long term, we are prepared for long haul because we can already today say that the Russian invasion, President Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has changed our security environment for the long term. It is a new reality. It is a new normal and NATO is responding for the long term. We have seen very credible reports about the use of use of military force against civilians. Of course, this is a great concern for all NATO Allies.

NBC: Secretary General thank you for taking my question. How do you believe NATO will respond if China begins to support Russia economically and perhaps with military supplies? And also do you believe that there is a role to play for NATO when it comes to alleviating energy costs? And I'm talking about speaking directly to Saudi Arabia and other OPEC producers. Thank you.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: So NATO Allies are coordinating their efforts when it comes to also energy security. It was also addressed in the meeting today to step up supplies, to diversify sources of supply and also to reduce dependence on supplies from Russia and later today, I will also participate in the G7 meeting. In different frameworks, G7, working with the EU, there are different formats where NATO Allies address the need to strengthen energy security and reduce dependence on Russian oil and gas. Our message to China is that they should join the rest of the world and clearly condemn the brutal war against Ukraine and not support Russia and neither with economic support or with military support.

Irina Somer (Interfax Ukraine): I would like to ask you if Polish leadership put at the table today for discussion, the proposal to send peacekeeping mission to Ukraine and if yes what kind of discussion it was? And is there some conclusion? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: We discussed a wide range of issues and the message is that we have to stand united and also that we need to provide support to Ukraine. At the same time, we have a responsibility to ensure that this conflict does not become a full-fledged war between NATO and Russia. And that is also the reason why Allies have declared that we will not deploy troops on the ground in in Ukraine because the only way to do that is to be prepared to engage in full conflict with Russian troops.

Henry Foy (Financial Times): Thank you very much, Secretary General. Congratulations on your annual extension. You said in the statement that Allies agree to ‘enhance preparedness and readiness for chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats’. Is that based on credible intelligence that those threats could be imminent, and how does the Alliance strengthen its protection against those threats? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: So we are concerned, partly because we see the rhetoric and we see that Russia is trying to create some kind of pretext accusing Ukraine, United States, NATO Allies [of] preparing to use chemical and biological weapons. And we have seen before that this way of accusing others is actually a way to create a pretext for doing the same themselves. And of course, accusations against Ukraine and NATO Allies are absolutely false. Any use of chemical weapons will totally change the nature of the conflict. It will be a blatant violation of international law and it will have widespread consequences and, of course, be extremely dangerous. It will affect the people in Ukraine. But there's also a risk that it will have a direct effect on people living in NATO countries, because we can see contamination, we can see the spread of chemical agents or biological weapons into our countries. We also know that Russia has used chemical agents against its own opposition, and they have used it on NATO territory, in Salisbury, before. And we also know that Russia has facilitated, supported, the Assad regime in Syria when they used chemical weapons against their own population.

So this just highlights the importance of ending this war immediately because this is a dangerous situation and therefore we impose the sanctions, and therefore we support Ukraine. Allies agreed to supply equipment to help Ukraine protect against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats. This could include detection equipment, protection and medical support, as well as training for decontamination and crisis management. We are also enhancing Allies’ preparedness and readiness for chemical and biological and nuclear threats. Our top military commander, General Wolters, has activated NATO's chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defence elements, and Allies are deploying additional chemical and biological and nuclear defences to reinforce our existing and new battlegroups. So we are taking measures both to support Ukraine, and also to defend ourselves.

James Bays (Al Jazeera): President Zelensky, when he addressed… you recall the fact he first spoke to you a month ago, and he says he didn't get clear answers. So this time he asked you specifically for 1% of all your tanks, for 1% of all your aircraft, for multi-launch rocket systems, anti-ship weapons and means of air defence – a very specific list. What is your clear answer?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: We all listened very carefully to President Zelensky. And many of the leaders in the room have had contacts with him over these weeks. I also spoke with him and the Ukrainian defence minister participated in our defence ministerial meeting last week. We listened carefully. And of course, we took note of his very compassionate message to all NATO Allies.

NATO Allies provide significant support to Ukraine. And we provide also lethal weapons, advanced systems, and also systems that help them to shoot down planes and attack battle tanks with anti-tank weapons, and many other types of systems including drones. I will not go into the details of the exact type of systems we are deploying. There is close contact between NATO Allies and Ukraine. But what I can say is that Allies do what they can to support Ukraine with weapons so Ukraine can defend themselves. Self-defence is a right enshrined in the UN Charter.

At the same time, we have a responsibility to prevent this conflict from becoming a full-fledged war in Europe, involving not only Ukraine and Russia, but NATO Allies and Russia. That will be more dangerous and more devastating. And I think we have to be honest about that, and that's exactly what we have been in our meeting today, and also what I say to you in the press conference now.

James Bays (Al Jazeera): So again, no clear answer?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: Well, what we do is that we are delivering a lot of equipment, and that is an answer. But I will not go into the details. I don't think that's wise for operational reasons if I listed exactly what and when and how we are delivering essential equipment to Ukraine. NATO Allies have stepped up and it is essential for the progress they have been able to make in the fight against the invading Russian forces.

NATO Spokesperson Oana Lungescu: Thank you very much, colleagues. I know there are many questions. I'm afraid the Secretary General needs to go to the G7 meeting, but there will be other briefings throughout the day. Thank you so much.",https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_193613.htm

Ukraine has updated its extensive wishlist of additional military assistance from the US government in the past several days to include hundreds more anti-aircraft and anti-tank missiles than previously requested, according to a document provided to CNN that details the items needed.

The Ukrainians have submitted similar lists in recent weeks, but a recent request provided to US lawmakers appears to reflect a growing need for American-made Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and Javelin anti-tank missiles — with Ukraine saying it urgently needs 500 of each, daily.

In both cases, Ukraine is asking for hundreds more missiles than were included in a similar list recently provided to US lawmakers, according to a source with knowledge of both requests.

The new list comes as the Ukrainians have claimed they face potential weapons shortages amid an ongoing Russian assault – prompting some pushback from US and NATO officials who stress that more military aid is already going into the country.

By March 7, less than two weeks into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the US and other NATO members had sent about 17,000 anti-tank missiles and 2,000 anti-aircraft missiles into Ukraine.

Since then, NATO countries, including the US, have kept the pipeline of weapons and equipment flowing, even as Russia has threatened to target the shipments.

The last of a US $350 million security assistance packaged approved in late-February arrived in Ukraine within the last few days, a senior defense official said, while the next two packages totaling $1 billion have already started to arrive.

US President Joe Biden said Thursday that “armor systems, ammunition and our weapons are flowing into Ukraine as I speak.” The defense official said it would be “multiple flights over many days” to get the equipment to Eastern Europe before it enters Ukraine at multiple land border crossings.

Meanwhile, on Wednesday, the United Kingdom announced they would ship 6,000 more missiles, including anti-tank and high explosive weapons, to Ukraine, along with about $33 million in financial backing for the Ukrainian military.

The list provided to CNN details several other urgent needs, including: jets, attack helicopters and anti-aircraft systems like the S-300.

Two types of Russian-made jets are listed in the document, including one designed to provide close air support for troops on the ground. Ukraine has asked for 36 of each aircraft, according to the list provided to CNN.

Some lawmakers in Congress believe the US should provide Ukraine with the weapons they’re requesting as quickly as possible.

Sen. Jacky Rosen, a Democrat from Nevada, visited Poland and Germany last weekend to meet with civil society organizations helping Ukrainian refugees who’ve arrived in those countries as well as US troops stationed abroad helping with humanitarian efforts.

Rosen said her biggest takeaway from the trip was the “sense of urgency,” on the ground.

“They need all the tools to not just survive the war, but to win the war, so whether we provide them air to ground missiles, drones, all the military support,” Rosen told CNN.",https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-24-22/h_773d1f1f28a477ab45b585e5fa37dcc5

In 30 days of war, Russia has fired more than 1,250 missiles into Ukraine, and it has increased sorties near Kyiv to around 300 a day, U.S. Defense officials said Friday.

“It is possible that Russia was surprised by the level of resistance from Ukrainian forces.” From a report by Lauren Kahn, an expert with the Council on Foreign Relations

Ukraine’s Air Force continues to persevere, with an estimated 55 fighter jets remaining in its fleet, the New York Times reported earlier this week.

Fighter jets and air defense systems aren’t the only assets in use, however. Combat drones are proving to be a type of force multiplier in Ukraine and the result could alter the calculus of future warfare, observers tell FLYING.

The issue of air power over Ukraine remained center stage this week as NATO heads of state gathered in Brussels to discuss their further support of the country aimed at upholding its right to self-defense against Russia’s invasion.

“Allies are also equipping Ukraine with significant military supplies, including anti-tank and air defense systems, and drones, which are proving highly effective, as well as substantial financial and humanitarian aid,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Thursday.

Drones In Ukraine

Tactical armed unmanned aerial vehicles, such as the Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 drone, are playing a critical role in Ukraine’s fight against invading Russian forces.

“One of the ways they are delivering close air support or actual fire in depth is through the Turkish TB2 UAVs, which are delivering munitions onto their artillery and indeed their supply lines, which are incredibly important in order to slow down or block the Russian advance,” British Defense Minister Ben Wallace told members of Parliament in early March, the Washington Post reported.

At the onset of the war, Ukraine had at least a dozen of the TB2 systems it purchased in 2019, with reports suggesting it could have up to around 48 total, according to a report by Lauren Kahn, an expert with the Council on Foreign Relations.

The TB2 combat drones are capable of carrying up to four laser-guided munitions that have a reputation for being effective against ground-based targets, such as Russian tanks and mobile air defense systems. The drones have a flight range of up to around 186 miles, and can fly up to 27 hours and at a maximum altitude of 25,000 feet. Taking off, landing, and flight control are all fully automated.

Fast Facts: TB2 Drone

Wingspan About 39 Feet Payload Capacity About 330 lbs. Endurance 27 hours Operational Altitude 18,000 to 25,000 feet Travel Speed 80 to 138 mph (70 to 120 knots) Maximum Takeoff Weight About 1,500 lbs.

“I’d call it the Toyota Corolla of drones….It doesn’t do everything that your high-end sports car does, but it does 80 percent of that, right?” Aaron Stein, director of research at the Foreign Policy Research Institute told The Associated Press earlier this month in describing the TB2. “So even for a high-end military, like the U.S., the basic concept of using an attritable, cheap platform to strike a superior force has inherent value.”

In late February, in the opening days of the war, Ukrainian military officials released video of a TB2 strike on a Russian surface-to-air system.

“Russia has so far been unable to achieve air superiority over all of Ukraine, including its drones,” Kahn said. “Why Russia has been unable [or hesitant] to ground Ukraine’s Bayraktar TB2 force—despite having the capability, the opportunity at the start of the war, and familiarity with the UAVs—remains unclear. It is possible that Russia was surprised by the level of resistance from Ukrainian forces.”

Battlefield Benefits

The slower speeds and lower altitudes provide unique combat utility in an urban battlefield, such as Ukraine.

Drones allow assessment of a defined region at a chosen place in time, which is a fundamentally different capability than “ripping along at just under the speed of sound” in a fighter aircraft, said Doug Birkey, executive director of the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies.

“If you’re walking around thinking you could get hit at any moment in time, that is going to wear you down psychologically.” Doug Birkey, executive director, Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies

And while fighters typically fly higher to mitigate the risk of surface-to-air missiles, drones provide an opportunity to gain wisdom over a battlefield, where patterns of life and the operational environment may be studied, he said.

“You can choose the best time to engage to get the best effect that you want, while also minimizing negative effects, like collateral damage, or, or getting shot down yourself,” Birkey said.

“What’s new now, though, is that it has been proliferated and used by actors far further down the food chain in terms of military powers,” Birkey said. “It is impressive that [the Ukrainian military has] been able, with effectively pretty minimal training and not a lot of spool-up time, to become very proficient with it.”

Russia has not countered Ukrainian drones as expected, which has opened the door to other potential impacts for Russian troops.

Drones “make them have to think about constantly being at risk for attack in ways they would not have to think about otherwise,” he said. “That has a very definite cost in terms of planning, risk factoring and just general stress on the forces. If you’re walking around thinking you could get hit at any moment in time, that is going to wear you down psychologically,” Birkey said.

“[Russia] could be using their air defenses much more prudently against these systems,” Birkey added. “They’re very low tech, radars can easily see them. It’s all kind of part of the confusion as to why that isn’t happening.”

Closing the Skies

Just as Russia’s air campaign continues to stutter, Ukrainian officials continue the push for NATO support to “close the skies” over the country. In a video address to heads of state gathered for the emergency NATO Summit in Brussels, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky made another appeal for fighter jets Thursday.

“Ukraine asked for your planes, so that we do not lose so many people,” Zelensky said. “And you have thousands of fighter jets! But we haven’t been given any yet.”

The Biden administration, as well as other members of NATO, have turned cold on the proposal of supplying Ukraine’s military with fighter jets, such as Poland’s offer to transfer its fleet of MiG-29 jets, out of fear of triggering an escalation with Russia.

“The United States is not putting a veto on people giving the Ukrainians aircraft,” a senior Department of Defense official said Friday. “[I]f another sovereign nation wants to do that, we respect that decision. We did not want the aircraft transferred to us for further transfer to Ukraine.”

Last week, President Biden announced the U.S. would be sending the country $800 million in military aid, increasing the amount sent from the U.S. this week alone to more than $1 billion. Bundled into the Biden administration’s aid package for Ukraine are 100 Switchblade tactical unmanned aerial drones.

The precision, single-use Switchblade drones are “kamikaze” munitions that weigh about 5 pounds and are launched from a tube like a mortar. The drones are a hybrid weapon, or “a kind of piloted missile that can also be a scout,” said an article in Popular Science.

The short-range piloted missiles are launched from a tube like a mortar and come in two sizes: the Switchblade 300 is nearly 6 pounds, while the Switchblade 600 weighs in around 120 pounds. They’re considered “loitering munitions,” and can change course mid-flight.

If Switchblades are successful, however, they don’t fly back.

Fast Facts: Switchblade 300 Drones

Range About 6 miles Endurance 15 minutes Operational Altitude Below 500 feet Travel Speed 63 mph (55 knots) cruise, 100 mph (87 knots) dash Weight About 5.5 lbs.

Fast Facts: Switchblade 600 Drones

Range About 25 miles Endurance 40+ minutes Operational Altitude Below 650 feet Travel Speed 70 mph (61 knots) cruise, 115 mph (100 knots) dash Weight About 120 lbs.

Lessons Learned

Uncrewed or remotely crewed systems bolster intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), extend reach into contested spaces, while offering the potential to stay in the air longer and with lower costs, said Rose Butchart, an associate fellow in the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ (CSIS) Defense-Industrial Initiatives Group. “I think we’re seeing a lot of that in Ukraine, although certainly not all of it,” she said.

While Ukraine has made some very effective use of remotely crewed systems, the TB2 travels at about 80 mph, and has about an 18,000-foot ceiling. The smaller 6-pound Switchblade has a range of about six miles, can stay in the air about 15 minutes and has a cruising speed average of about 63 mph, with the ability to dash at about 100 mph.

“That does create some tradeoffs where if you put a craft into a space, you are likely to lose that craft,” Butchart said. “Of course, the most important thing is keeping the warfighter safe, and with a remotely crewed system, you don’t have that danger. But, it does create some strategic trade-offs in how you employ that craft.”

Even cheaper systems are playing an important role, according to Gregory Sanders, a defense industry expert at the CSIS.

“With drones, it looks like the lower end of systems—you know, things that are maybe six digits in cost—might actually have a relevant effect here, in a way that could potentially be transformative,” Sanders said.

They’re proving to be a very affordable way to change the battlefield dynamic, though not necessarily bringing victory, Sanders said.

“It’s a bit ghoulish, but real-world examples of use of these systems in a highly contested environment is vitally important for understanding how technology and force use and doctrine should change,” Sanders said.

‘Still Need More’

Despite the successes of combat drones in Ukraine, “they still need more,” from fighter jets to UAVs packing a bigger punch, Birkey said.

Larger drones, like the U.S. Army’s General Atomics MQ-1 Gray Eagle unmanned aircraft systems and the U.S. Air Force’s variant, the MQ-1 Predator, could provide armed ISR capabilities with added features of automatic take off and landing. The MQ-9 Reaper, with its 66-foot wingspan and its ability to carry a 3,750-pound payload, could also be a game changer.

“The effect they could yield is pretty substantial,” Birkey said. “It would be a big force multiplier.”

Even with the range of sizes and capabilities, combat drones are changing the nature of warfare.

“It’s just really the power of having what we call a sensor shooter tied to operators that are looking at it in real time. You just can’t underestimate how important that is,” Birkey said. “The fact is that proliferating will increasingly change the types of military campaigns we see executed, because it is such a powerful tool.”

It’s a capability the U.S. has exhibited for years, and now kind of takes for granted,” he said.

“The impact of these RPAS [remotely piloted aircraft], these drones, will definitely see a lot of countries seek them aggressively because the power is clear, and they are attainable and executable within a limited budget,” Birkey said.",https://www.flyingmag.com/tactical-combat-drones-play-a-role-in-ukraine-air-defense/

Brussels (AFP) – President Volodymyr Zelensky pressed a NATO summit Thursday to flood weapons into Ukraine and Western allies responded with new sanctions against Russia, promises of military aid, and discussion of expelling Moscow from the international G20 body.

As battles raged across Ukraine, with television footage showing a large Russian warship ablaze at dockside near the southern city of Mariupol, Zelensky addressed the emergency NATO summit and a G7 leaders' meeting by video link.

He said the West should provide ""all the weapons we need"" to ""prevent the deaths of Ukrainians from Russian strikes, from Russian occupation.""

Kicking off a day of intense diplomacy, US President Joe Biden made clear that the Western alliance was listening.

""NATO has never been more united,"" Biden said.

Biden noted that under his presidency the United States has pledged $2 billion in weapons to Ukraine. He announced a new commitment to ""more than $1 billion in humanitarian assistance,"" as well as promising to welcome 100,000 of the nearly 3.7 million refugees fleeing the country.

After the United States announced new sanctions, including targeting Russian politicians, Biden said the West was in it for the long haul, intent on ""increasing the pain"" on Moscow.

Biden intensified the effort to ostracize Putin's Russia with a call to exclude Moscow from the G20.

""That was raised today,"" Biden told reporters, adding that if the group of 20 countries does not agree, then he would press for Ukraine to be allowed to join.

In his address, Zelensky said that Russia was using phosphorus bombs, which cause severe burns, conducting indiscriminate shelling of civilians, and could resort to ""full-scale use"" of chemical weapons.

Ukraine has already lived through ""a month of heroic resistance. A month of the darkest suffering,"" he said. ""To save people and our cities, Ukraine needs military assistance without restrictions.""

'Barbarism'

On the ground, long-range Russian strikes on the eastern city of Kharkiv killed at least six civilians and wounded more than a dozen, Ukrainian authorities said.

At least four people including two children were killed in strikes elsewhere in the east, Lugansk governor Sergiy Gayday said, accusing Russian forces of using phosphorus on the village of Rubizhne.

Britain's ITV network showed footage of the incendiary weapons dropping in a white haze overnight on the commuter town of Irpin near Kyiv.

The scale of civilian suffering was underscored when the UN said more than half of the country's children have been driven from their homes by Russian bombardment.

Ukrainian forces claimed to be pushing Russian troops back in some areas around Kyiv. They also claimed success in attacking one of the navy vessels used to bring Russian forces in from the Black Sea.

Video footage showed a ship in a ball of fire and smoke, with other vessels that had been nearby heading away from the inferno.

- NATO reinforces eastern flank -

Zelensky wants NATO to help Ukraine go on the offensive with more advanced fighter jets, missile defense systems, tanks, armored vehicles and anti-ship missiles.

NATO members have supplied a steady stream of weapons including anti-tank rockets, which have helped to stall Russia's advance. But these are seen as essentially defensive.

Zelensky made an impassioned plea for citizens to pour onto streets and squares in global protest against Russia's invasion STR UKRAINIAN PRESIDENTIAL PRESS SERVICE/AFP

The United States has so far ruled out sending airplanes or other large weapons systems to Ukraine. Biden says he does not want to cross a line into what he says could become ""World War 3"" pitting nuclear-armed Russia against NATO.

However, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg announced new deployments to eastern flank members Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Bulgaria, as well as bolstering chemical and nuclear defenses in case Russia expands its attack beyond Ukraine.

Biden said that NATO unity showed ""Putin is getting exactly the opposite of what he intended.""

'Grim milestone'

Zelensky's appeal to NATO came one month to the day after Russian tanks rolled over the border, acting on Putin's plan to force pro-Western Ukraine back into Moscow's orbit.

Since then, thousands of civilians, as well as thousands of soldiers from the two sides, are believed to have been killed. More than 10 million Ukrainians have fled their homes.

And the month of war has displaced 4.3 million children -– more than half of Ukraine's estimated child population of 7.5 million.

""This is a grim milestone that could have lasting consequences for generations to come,"" Unicef chief Catherine Russell said.

UN figures show that nearly 3.7 million Ukrainians have fled abroad, and more are now displaced inside Ukraine after harrowing journeys out of cities like Mariupol.

Ukrainians are fighting back successfully but pleading for more help ahead of a major NATO summit Sergey BOBOK AFP

In the besieged southern port, Zelensky says nearly 100,000 people are trapped without food, water or power and enduring fierce shelling by Russian forces.

The city is a treasured prize for Russia as it would enable a land-bridge between Russian-annexed Crimea and regions already controled by Russian proxy forces in eastern Ukraine.

Intense fighting has made the city all but inaccessible.

Ramzan Kadyrov, the warlord leader of Russia's Chechnya region, claimed on Thursday that his forces had taken control of city hall there.

Meanwhile, in Zhytomyr, a garrison town west of Kyiv, a Russian strike flattened the school where Vasiliy Kravchuk's six-year-old son was meant to start next year.

Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky meanwhile continues to lead from the streets of the capital, rallying the international community for support, as his people stage a street-level fightback against Russia’s armed forces.

At the country’s western border, an estimated 3 million people have fled for neighbouring Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and Moldova, creating a major humanitarian crisis.

US president Joe Biden, UK prime minister Boris Johnson and UN secretary general Antonio Guterres have joined other global powers in condemning Moscow’s “unprovoked and unjustified” attack and promised to hold it “accountable”.

Tough economic sanctions have been issued by the allies against Russian banks, businesses, politicians and oligarchs as western corporations withdraw the country, its sports stars are banned from international competitions and Mr Putin finds himself presiding over a pariah state on the world stage.

Nato continues to extend diplomatic support, aid and weapons to Ukraine but refuses to impose a no-fly zone over the country for fear of being drawn into a much larger war over Eastern Europe, leaving the country in a lonely fight to retain its independence.

Although Russia’s military is significantly larger than Ukraine’s in every area, President Zelensky’s forces still pose a threat and at the very least can mount a defence against Russia’s ongoing invasion as the world has seen in recent days.

Here’s a look at the combatant’s comparative capabilities.

How big is Ukraine’s air force?

According to the Flight International 2022 World Air Forces database, Ukraine’s Air Force has 210 military aircraft including 98 combat aircraft.

These consist of Soviet-made MiG-29s and three types of Sukhoi jets.

However, Russia has a significantly larger military air force with active aircraft totalling 3,863, according to Flight International’s database, with almost 15 times more combat planes than Ukraine.

Despite its smaller arsenal, Ukraine’s ministry of defence have reported that, as of 1 March, it has downed 29 Russian aircraft, 29 helicopters and seven air defence units.

How big is Russia’s army?

Since 2014-15, Ukraine has tripled its defence budget in an attempt to improve its military and also comply with standards demanded to join Nato as an entry requirement.

The increased investment has helped Ukraine’s army measure up to Russia, although it currently has just 125,600 soldiers compared to Russia’s 280,000.

In terms of total military personnel, Russia’s 900,000 active men and women trumps Ukraine’s 196,600.

Ukraine also has 900,000 reserve personnel – those who have received military training in the last five years – compared with Russia's 2 million.

They have more than three times the amount of artillery, six times the number of tanks and almost seven times more armoured vehicles than the Ukrainians.

The Russian navy operates 74 warships and 51 submarines, compared with Ukraine's two warships.

Military analysts say Ukraine's anti-aircraft and anti-missile defences are weak, leaving it highly vulnerable to Russian strikes on its critical infrastructure.

They say Russia would also seek to use its superiority in electronic warfare to paralyse its adversary's command and control and cut off communications with units in the field.

What weapons does Ukraine have?

Several western nations have come to the aid of Ukraine to bolster its military defences.

The US has provided more than $2.5bn (£1.87bn) in military aid since 2014, including Javelin anti-tank missiles, coastal patrol boats, Humvees, sniper rifles, reconnaissance drones, radar systems, night vision and radio equipment.

Turkey has sold Kyiv several batches of Bayraktar TB2 drones while Britain supplied Ukraine with a reported 2,000 short-range anti-tank missiles in January and sent British Army specialists to deliver training.

Here’s a list of some of the weapons Ukraine has and what they do.

Javelin anti-tank guided missiles

What are they for: The anti-tank missiles use infrared systems to lock their targets meaning troops don’t need to aim.

The missile is capable of flying up to 490ft into the air before connecting with a target.

Next Generation Light Anti-tank Weapon

What are they for: This weapon is another anti-tank missile, of which the UK has donated 2,000 units to Ukraine.

It’s capable of flying at speeds of 440 miles per hour using an inertial navigation system to fly to a target vehicle.

Stinger missiles

What are they for: Latvia and Lithuania have donated stinger missiles which is a Man-Portable-Air-Defense System (MANPADS) that uses infrared homing technology to search and strike flying targets.

It’s been used by Ukrainian forces to bring down Russian aircraft.

Bayraktar TB2 drones

What are they for: The drones supplied by Turkey and is capable of 24-hour flights at an altitude of 24,000 feet (7,300 metres) and carrying a payload of 330 lbs (150kg).

It is capable of carrying out aerial strikes against tanks and bunkers, with a maximum altitude of five miles to avoid enemy machine guns.

The drone can also navigate even if it loses GPS signal, however, it’s unclear whether they’ve been used in Ukraine yet.

Is Ukraine running out of weapons?

While up-to-date information from the frontline can be hard to substantiate, reports suggest Ukraine may be running out of the weapons.

President Zelensky has called for more supplies from Western nations to help it sustain its resistance against Russia’s advance.

Western officials have been quoted as saying that Kyiv’s troops are “expending a lot of ordnance” and Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, is understood to have warned privately last week the country had “two weeks” until it ran out of anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles – a situation which has not yet been resolved by military shipments from Europe and the US.

As Russia ramps up its air campaign on Ukraine, U.S. and Ukrainian leaders met in Warsaw to find ways to fight back Russian aggression.

Ukraine’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba tweeted a photo on March 26 of U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III meeting with himself and other Ukrainian leaders. “This special 2+2 format allows us to seek practical decisions in both political and defense spheres in order to fortify Ukraine’s ability to fight back Russian aggression,” he said.

The meeting comes after President Joe Biden called a NATO leaders summit, followed by meetings with European and G-7 counterparts, to unite allies and partners in the ongoing sanctions against Russian leaders.

The Pentagon said March 25 that Russia had dug into defensive positions around Kyiv, instead focusing its land and air effort on “liberating” the Donbas region. But Ukraine may have taken back Kherson from Russia and the Ukrainian Navy blew up a re-supply ship at the port of Berdyansk on the Sea of Azov.

Ukraine’s recent moves could drive a wedge in Russia’s effort to lockdown the eastern region of the country, home to a large minority of Russian speakers. Russia has surrounded the port city of Mariupol for days, a missing link that would connect occupied Donbas with Crimea. For weeks, Defense Department officials have pointed to a perceived effort by Russia to lock down the south and pin down Ukrainian forces in the Joint Forces Operation area, where they have operated since Russia invaded in 2014.

“The Donbas is really where they’re … focused right now, on the ground and in the air,” a senior defense official told reporters March 25.

“They have tried to make up for the fact that they haven’t been able to move well on the ground by the increasing use of airstrikes, and missile strikes, and artillery strikes on population centers,” the official added. “They don’t appear to want to pursue Kyiv as aggressively, or frankly, at all.”

Moscow has fired more than 1,250 missiles into Ukraine, and despite reporting about high fail rates for its air-launched cruise missiles and a depleting missile inventory, DOD assesses that Russia still has over half its fire power.

Russia claimed March 25 that its first wartime objective has been achieved.

“The combat potential of the armed forces of Ukraine has been considerably reduced, which makes it possible to focus our core efforts on achieving the main goal—the liberation of Donbass,” Sergei Rudskoi, head of the Russian General Staff’s Main Operational Directorate, said in a statement.

The Defense Department rated Russia’s combat power as 85 to 90 percent of its pre-positioned strength. Recent DOD assessments of Ukraine’s combat power were estimated at 90 percent, based on constant replenishment from Western partners.

The defense official said parts of the $800 million defense package signed by President Joe Biden March 16 have started arriving in Ukraine, with additional shipments of anti-tank Javelins and anti-aircraft Stingers arriving in Europe in the coming days.

“Another flight arrived in the region today,” the defense official said in response to a question from Air Force Magazine.

Long-range air defense systems promised by Biden in a public address following Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s speech to Congress have yet to arrive. Likewise, after the U.S. rejected an offer by Poland March 8 to help transfer MiG-29s, the official clarified that “the United States is not putting a veto on people giving the Ukrainians aircraft.”

Even without the SAMS and aircraft it says it needs, Ukraine is still holding off the Russian advance.

Ukraine appears to be making headway in the south of the country, where Russian forces moving north from Crimea made their strongest advance and took the city of Kherson early in the month-long war.

“Kherson is actually contested territory again,” the official said.

Losing Kherson would split Russian forces and hinder an attack on Odesa. Russia also suffered a blow in another city it controls in the south, the port city of Berdyansk, where a Russian warship that had been resupplying troops was blown up pier side by the Ukrainian Navy.

DOD asserted that the Russian aim in the east could be motivated by an effort to consolidate gains, unless they are undone.

“They are putting their priorities and their effort in the east of Ukraine. And that’s where still, there remains a lot of heavy fighting,” the official said. “We think they are trying to … secure some sort of more substantial gains there as a potential negotiating tactic at the table.”",https://www.airforcemag.com/us-ukrainian-leaders-meet-in-warsaw-as-russia-ramps-up-air-attacks-on-ukraine/

Boris Johnson will tell world leaders at the Nato summit on Thursday that the conflict is entering a new phase of aggression and humanitarian catastrophe with the siege of Mariupol and the indiscriminate attacks on civilians.

Western officials have said that both the Ukrainians and the Russians are running short of weapons as the conflict grinds on due to Ukrainian defence that was far better than expected – and that they had anticipated they would be supporting a smaller Ukrainian insurgency by this stage.

Ahead of the summit, Johnson said the UK would provide 6,000 new defensive missiles, including high-explosive weapons, and £25m from Foreign Office funds to help Ukraine pay its military and police forces. Not all of the missiles are expected to be next-generation light anti-tank weapons (NLAWs) – of which the UK has already provided more than 4,200. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, was filmed saying that the UK would send more missiles but was “running out of our own” on a prank call last week.

The additional weaponry means that the UK has now provided more than 10,000 missiles. It will be supplying Starstreak high-velocity anti-air missiles to help Ukrainians defend themselves against aerial bombings, as well as body armour, helmets and combat boots. But No 10 said it was hoped that international partners would also send weapons needed for longer-range targeting and intelligence.

Johnson also pledged new cash to counter Russian disinformation as well as support and funding for the International Criminal Court investigation into possible war crimes committed by the Kremlin and invading forces.

The talks with Nato and G7 leaders, which will be followed by a European Council meeting to which Johnson has not been invited, mark one month since the Russian invasion.

“Vladimir Putin is already failing in Ukraine,” Johnson said in a statement ahead of the summit in Brussels. “The Ukrainian people have shown themselves to be extraordinarily brave and tenacious in defending their homeland, in the face of an unprovoked onslaught. But we cannot and will not stand by while Russia grinds Ukraine’s towns and cities into dust.

“The United Kingdom will work with our allies to step up military and economic support to Ukraine, strengthening their defences as they turn the tide in this fight. One month into this crisis, the international community faces a choice. We can keep the flame of freedom alive in Ukraine, or risk it being snuffed out across Europe and the world.”

No 10 said that 4 million items of medical equipment and 500 mobile generators will also be sent to Ukraine.

The UK will also assign soldiers with expertise in intelligence gathering to the ICC investigation, as well as an additional £1m in funding after a meeting of justice and foreign affairs ministers with justice secretary Dominic Raab at The Hague.

“President Putin and his commanders should know that they will be held to account for their actions, and risk ending up spending the rest of their days behind bars,” Raab said at the meeting’s conclusion.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/uk-doubles-number-of-missiles-sent-to-ukraine-ahead-of-nato-summit
