With the city in ruins, residents who risked everything to escape can now tell their stories

When Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine exactly four weeks ago, all eyes were on the capital, Kyiv, as Russian forces advanced from all directions. But the Russian army had other objectives too, and taking the southern port city of Mariupol was high among them. If they could do this, they would be able to join up Russian-held Crimea with the Russian-held areas of eastern Ukraine and create a land corridor to Russia itself.

As Isobel Koshiw tells Hannah Moore, the story of Mariupol in the past month has been one of siege, bombardment and almost unimaginable hardship. Residents tell of having to drink water from their radiators and cook over fires in the street, as electricity, gas and water supplies have all been cut off. And with the internet and phone lines down, the city has become not only unreachable but also uncontactable, for the most part.

Days ago, Russian forces gave Mariupol an ultimatum: surrender to us or face the consequences. The vastly outnumbered Ukrainian forces defending Mariupol ignored the threat, and what is left of the city still flies the Ukrainian flag for now.",https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2022/mar/24/the-siege-of-mariupol-podcast

3,d773c0e2-c757-45af-835d-ccd8efa117f3,"['Jon Henley', 'Julian Borger']",2022-04-13,"More than 1,000 Ukrainian marines defending the besieged city of Mariupol have surrendered and the port has been captured, Moscow has said, as the presidents of four countries bordering Russia arrived in Kyiv in a show of support for Ukraine.

In one of the most critical battles of the war, Russia’s defence ministry said that on Wednesday 1,026 soldiers from Ukraine’s 36th Marine Brigade, including 162 officers, had “voluntarily laid down their arms” near the city’s Ilyich iron and steelworks.

It later said Mariupol’s “trade sea port” was under full control of Russian forces.

There was no independent confirmation of the claims. Ukraine’s defence ministry said it had no information about the surrender and the Ukrainian military command said only that Russian forces were attacking the Azovstal industrial area and the port.

The Chechen leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, who says his forces are playing a major role in the battle, urged the last Ukrainians holed up in Azovstal to surrender. The 26th Marine Brigade had said on Monday that it was preparing for a final battle in Mariupol.

The city, the main target yet to be brought under Russian control in the eastern Donbas region, has been encircled and largely reduced to rubble during Moscow’s seven-week invasion. The city’s mayor has said 21,000 civilians have died and more than 100,000 remain there awaiting evacuation.

Its capture would be the first fall of a major Ukrainian city and would help Russia secure a land passage between the self-proclaimed republics in Donetsk and Luhansk in Donbas and Crimea, which Moscow occupied and annexed in 2014.

Joe Biden announced $800m in new US military aid to Ukraine on Wednesday. He said this would include artillery, armoured personnel carriers and helicopters. Biden added it would “contain many of the highly effective weapons systems we have already provided and new capabilities tailored to the wider assault we expect Russia to launch in eastern Ukraine”.

The Polish and Baltic presidents headed to the Ukrainian capital by train on Wednesday to show support for the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and his embattled troops in what the Polish presidential adviser Jakub Kumoch called “this decisive moment for the country”.

The Polish president, Andrzej Duda, Estonia’s Alar Karis, Gitanas Nausėda of Lithuania and Latvia’s Egils Levits met in the Polish city of Rzeszów near the Ukrainian border. “Heading to Kyiv with a strong message of political support and military assistance,” Nausėda tweeted from the station.

The programme of the visit by the leaders of four Nato member states – who fear they may face Russian attacks if Ukraine falls – was not disclosed for security reasons but local media reported that the heads of state visited Borodianka, near Kyiv.

Nausėda said the town was “permeated with pain and suffering” after “civilian Ukrainians were murdered and tortured there, and residential homes and other civilian infrastructure were bombed”.

He said it was “hard to believe that such war atrocities could be perpetrated in 21st-century Europe, but that is the reality. This is a war we must win.”

It came as Ukrainian forces claimed to have damaged a Russian warship carrying 510 crew in the Black Sea with missile strikes on Wednesday. “Neptune missiles guarding the Black Sea caused very serious damage to the Russian ship,” Maksym Marchenko, the governor of Odessa, wrote on Telegram.

The visit followed Kyiv’s reported refusal to meet the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who visited Poland on Tuesday and said he had planned to go on to Ukraine but “was not wanted”. The former foreign minister is facing heavy criticism for his past policy of rapprochement towards Moscow.

On Wednesday, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said it was “confusing” that Steinmeier had not been received in Kyiv. Ukraine’s ambassador to Germany said the government would be glad to welcome Scholz, but diplomats said the snub to Steinmeier may make that more difficult.

The French president, Emmanuel Macron, declined on Wednesday to repeat Biden’s accusation that Russia was carrying out “genocide” against Ukrainians, warning that verbal escalations would not help end the war.

The US president said on Tuesday it had “become clearer and clearer that Putin is just trying to wipe out the idea of even being able to be a Ukrainian”. Macron said it was important for leaders to be careful with language.

“I would say that Russia unilaterally unleashed the most brutal war, that it is now established that war crimes were committed by the Russian army and that it is now necessary to find those responsible and make them face justice,” he said.

After visiting Bucha – the site of mass killings of Ukrainian civilians – Duda told a news conference: “This is not war, this is terrorism.” The Polish leader said that the perpetrators and those who had given orders had to be brought to justice.

Zelenskiy told Estonian MPs on Wednesday, without providing evidence, that Russia was using phosphorus bombs in Ukraine. Ukrainian forces in Mariupol said a drone had dropped a poisonous substance on the city, but there has been no independent confirmation that Russia used banned chemical weapons.

While Russian troops have largely withdrawn from around Ukraine’s capital in the face of stiff resistance and logistical problems, western officials and analysts say the invasion force is gearing up for a major offensive in the east.

Military experts say local support, logistics, the terrain in the region and the appointment by Moscow of a new senior general, Aleksandr Dvornikov, could improve the performance of a force that Britain’s defence ministry said on Wednesday had so far been “hampered by an inability to cohere and coordinate”.

Ukraine’s armed forces command said Russian forces were fully ready for a fresh assault in the eastern Donetsk and southern Kherson regions. “In the Donetsk and Tavria [Kherson] directions, according to available information, the enemy is ready for offensive actions,” the armed forces said in a Facebook post.

The Russian retreat from around Kyiv has led to the discovery of large numbers of apparently massacred civilians, drawing international condemnation and calls for a war crimes investigation. The Kyiv district police chief said on Wednesday that 720 bodies had been found around the capital, and more than 200 people were missing.

An expert report commissioned by the Vienna-based OSCE security and human rights organisation published on Wednesday found “clear patterns of (international humanitarian law) violations by the Russian forces in their conduct of hostilities”.

It said there had also been also violations by Ukraine, but concluded those committed by Russia were “by far larger in scale and nature”. Ukraine has previously acknowledged there could be “isolated incidents” of violations and said it would investigate.

Moscow, however, has rejected all allegations of atrocities and Vladimir Putin dismissed the reports as “fakes”. The Russian president said on Tuesday that Moscow would “rhythmically and calmly” continue its operation, which the UN says has so far driven more than 10 million Ukrainians from their homes, more than 4.6 million of whom have fled abroad.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/13/more-than-1000-ukraine-marines-have-surrendered-in-mariupol-says-russia

Enlarge this image toggle caption Evgeniy Maloletka/AP Evgeniy Maloletka/AP

The southeast Ukraine city of Mariupol has been battered by Russian airstrikes in recent weeks. Among the buildings hit have been a maternity hospital, a theater and an arts school. At least 2,000 civilians have died and some 80% of homes have been destroyed, according to city officials. Some 7,000 people were evacuated by convoy from Mariupol on Tuesday.

The result is a harrowing humanitarian crisis as Ukrainians shelter in basements, and safe passage out of the city for civilians is limited and sporadic.

Why is this city so important? There are several reasons — for the Russian military and for the people of Ukraine.

For Russia, Mariupol is a major port city in a key location

1. The city is in a strategic place militarily.

Mariupol is located between Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, and the region of Eastern Ukraine called Donbas, much of which was already controlled by Russian-backed separatists.

Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized the ""independence"" of two enclaves there prior to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Those are the two areas — so-called Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics — that have faced Russian aggression since 2014.

""Mariupol is right in between them. So taking Mariupol is part of the campaign in the south and the southeast to connect the Russian-held areas, essentially,"" Rita Konaev, an expert on the Russian military at Georgetown University, tells NPR.

By controlling Mariupol, Russia could potentially create a land bridge to Crimea and control the entire north shore of the Sea of Azov.

Russia hopes to hem in Ukrainian forces in the east and southeast of the country, a senior U.S. defense official said in a call with reporters on Tuesday. This could prevent the Ukrainian troops there from going to help in other parts of the country, particularly Kyiv, the official said.

2. As a port city, Mariupol is important economically.

Mariupol has long been an important industrial port city. In peacetime, it is a major site for exporting Ukrainian steel and grain.

That status has already been altered by war, says Liam Collins, a retired colonel with U.S. Army Special Forces who has trained Ukrainian forces. With Mariupol under siege, it's not able to currently produce for the war effort, he tells NPR.

The major impact would come if a negotiated settlement partitions off part of Ukraine, says Collins: ""Ukraine's not going to want to do that after 2014 and 2015 [when Russia essentially took part of Eastern Ukraine], but it's always a possibility.""

If Russia effectively cuts off Mariupol for the long term, and with it access to the Sea of Azov, it will damage Ukraine's finances and economic sustainability, hindering the country's ability to sell and ship its products.

""It's part of a broader effort to effectively cut Ukraine off from access to the sea, which is a really important part of Ukrainian economy and trade,"" Konaev says.

3. Taking Mariupol would be a boon to Russian morale.

If Russia succeeds in controlling Mariupol, it would be a major morale boost for Russia.

That's because, according to Konaev, the campaign in Ukraine ""has not been going in any way that Russia has imagined and they've encountered significant military challenges. And they haven't had a real victory since they've taken Kherson, which is nearby, and even there, it remains contested.""

""So at this point, they feel that it is effectively necessary to take Mariupol in order to maintain morale and keep the campaign going,"" Konaev says.

Collins says capturing Mariupol would be notable for Russia — it not only ""shows that you're having success, but it shows that you control a larger city.""

There's also the possibility that Russian President Vladimir Putin could capitalize on taking Mariupol with specific propaganda. The Azov Regiment, a unit with neo-Nazi origins that has been folded into Ukraine's National Guard, is present in Mariupol. Because Putin has repeatedly and incorrectly framed his invasion of Ukraine as a denazification effort, winning Mariupol could provide new fodder for his false narrative.

4. If negotiations happen, new boundaries could be drawn.

At some point down the road, there could be negotiations — perhaps to achieve a cease-fire — in which new boundary lines are drawn.

Which areas are held by Russian forces could shape where a theoretical new line could be drawn. And if Mariupol falls to Russia, new lines could mean that it ends up as part of a Donbas that is controlled by Russia or as an independent republic, recognized by Russia.

But this isn't a war that Russia will win by conquering a certain amount of territory, Collins says. ""There are no winners in this. It's war. Both nations are going to lose regardless of the outcome. It's just a matter of which one loses more.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Evgeniy Maloletka/AP Evgeniy Maloletka/AP

For Ukraine, Mariupol has been inspiring — and losing it could make the war effort harder.

1. The Ukrainian army's resistance there has been a fuel for the Ukrainian people.

The Russian bombs have been terrifying and brutal for the people of Mariupol. And the grit that the city's residents have shown has been a source of inspiration to other Ukrainians. ""Right now Mariupol is this legendary stronghold of resistance,"" says Konaev, ""and I think it's fueling resistance everywhere else.""

If Ukraine's military is able to hold on to Mariupol, it could set the tone for the rest of the country.

""That would just really amplify that David and Goliath story and could feel like a turning point,"" she says. While that might not be the decisive factor in a protracted campaign, she says it could be important in shaping the narrative around the war.

2. The humanitarian disaster could get worse if Russia takes the city.

Losing Mariupol to Russia would likely add further misery and devastation for the city's residents.

The city had already become home to many internally displaced Ukrainians who fled the fighting in Donetsk and Luhansk in 2014. ""That secondary displacement is very difficult on people,"" says Konaev.

More than 41,000 people have fled the city in recent days, according to Mariupol city officials. But humanitarian corridors remain tenuous, and safe passage is far from certain.

3. It's not clear what Russia ""owning"" Mariupol would look like.

What would it look like for Russian troops to take — and control — Mariupol? It's likely, says Collins, that low-grade fighting would continue for a long time.

""Even if Russia gets to the point of so-called 'owning' it,"" says Collins, ""they most likely will come under significant attack from the various volunteers that are in the city.""

But Konaev doesn't think Russia needs to physically occupy Mariupol and other cities to achieve its aims.

""I don't think that they intend to occupy these cities,"" she says. ""I think they intend to make some of them unlivable, so they can declare victory. And then use that as leverage to get whatever they want in the negotiations.""",https://www.npr.org/2022/03/23/1088113318/what-mariupol-means-ukraine-russia-military-campaign
6,d773c0e2-c757-45af-835d-ccd8efa117f3,['Cbc Radio'],,"The Ukrainian port city of Mariupol has been under siege from Russian forces for more than three weeks, while its symbolic and strategic value to both sides hangs in the balance.

The city has suffered weeks of intense bombing, with electricity and communication lines cut off, and food and water running low. From a pre-invasion population of 430,000, roughly 100,000 remain. In their last update a week ago, Mariupol officials said at least 2,300 people have died in the siege , but added that the true toll is probably much higher.

Despite the devastation, on Monday Ukraine rejected Russian demands that fighters surrender the city, in exchange for safe passage.

The Current's Matt Galloway spoke to Aurel Braun, a professor of international relations and political science at the University of Toronto, about what control of the city would mean for the wider war.

Mariupol is a small city in northeastern Ukraine, on the coastline of the Black Sea. Why is that important, that detail?

It is important both to Ukraine and to Russia for, as you mentioned, strategic reasons. There's great symbolism as well. And if you look at the reasons for each country, in the case of Ukraine, they are looking at a kind of epic resistance.

Today, it's one month since the Russian invasion of Ukraine — and the city's holding. The demands for surrender that [Russian President] Vladimir Putin made have been rejected. The fighting goes on even though one human rights organization described Mariupol as ""a freezing hellscape riddled with dead bodies and destroyed buildings.""

So in a sense, this is a test. This is where the Ukrainian government and the Ukraine people may look upon Mariupol as a kind of Stalingrad, where they made the stand against the overwhelming odds, against naked aggression. And even if the city's eventually occupied, that resistance would be viewed as something that is truly epic.

What about for the Russians? Strategically, we'll talk about that first: what significance does the city hold for Russia?

The Russians would like to have a land bridge. They have made progress in the south of Ukraine. They have come in through Crimea, and they're trying to link up with the separatist regions, which are controlled by Russia, the eastern Donbas, Luhansk and Donetsk. And Mariupol is surrounded, and it is a kind of obstacle to having that kind of contiguity.

It is also a kind of test of will. Vladimir Putin wants to show that there is no brutality that he's not going to use. In fact, [Prime Minister] Boris Johnson of Britain said that Vladimir Putin has crossed into barbarism. And if you look at what's happening on the ground in Mariupol, that's what it is. It is trying to send a message to the rest of Ukraine: ""This is what's going to happen to you. We, Russia, the Kremlin, are not restrained by international law or by any sense of morality. Surrender is the only way you can save yourself."" That is the message.

Also, they are looking at the fact that some of the defenders belong to the Azov Battalion or sometimes called the Azov Regiment. And some of those people have been associated, there have been individuals with really sordid connections, neo-Nazis. And if the Russians can capture some of those, they can put them on exhibit and say, ""You see, this is the fight against neo-Nazism."" And let's not forget that from the very beginning, Vladimir Putin claimed that this is a fight, that for Russia, is one over an existential threat.

In a sense, it's a replay of the Great Patriotic War. The fight against Nazism, that the government of Ukraine is made up of a group of drug-addicted neo-Nazis, and if you can find examples of that, you can smear all of Ukraine with that label.

So there's a propaganda piece to that as well?

Absolutely.

In some ways, Mariupol was an obstacle in the 2014 [occupation] by Russia into Crimea.

Yes. This is a fairly substantial city. It's not a huge city, but over 400,000 people. It has very large industries, metal and chemical industries; [it is] a rather polluted city. But it was economically important to Ukraine. And in terms of connections over contiguity, it is a kind of obstacle to Russian military plans. And it's almost as if the Russians cannot admit that they have been failing, because in many ways the Russian invasion has been failing.

This was not the expectation that Russia had. Vladimir Putin and his supporters in the military, and the secret services expected that by now, Vladimir Putin would be holding a parade in Kyiv. A victory parade that they would be welcomed by the local population, or they could cow the local population into accepting Russian rule. So this act of defiance is this kind of combination of strategic concern, of symbolism, of history in the making.

And so if Ukraine were to hold back Russia again in Mariupol, I mean that also would be a symbolic, as you say, victory for Ukraine, for the Ukrainian forces?

Absolutely, it sends a message. And it's interesting that Russia wanted the formal surrender because that would have been this combination of symbolism, of humiliation, of sending the message to the rest of Ukraine that you are helpless, and you are hopeless and there's no point in fighting on.

As the Russia-Ukraine war enters its fourth week, the majority of the population of Mariupol remain trapped in the besieged city, under near-constant bombardment, cut off from electricity, heating and phone coverage, and with food, water and medications fast running out. Earth-shattering shelling and aerial bombardments have directly damaged countless apartment buildings and blown out the windows in many more.

Safety is almost impossible to find, as it appears civilians may be being targeted deliberately. Since the bombardment of Mariupol began on February 24, Ukrainian officials estimate that 2,500 people have been killed and many more wounded.

With night-time temperatures below zero and heating systems no longer functioning, the temperature inside people’s flats and in their basements is now the same as outside – freezing.

The Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders, MSF) team in the city and their families have also been sheltering for hours on end in the office basement, the fear palpable in their voices when we’re able to contact them.

In the few hours a day when the bombing stops, the struggle to survive overcomes the fear and those who can, emerge from underground to try to find what little food, medicine and care remains in the city, to cut firewood, and collect water from streams, springs or melted snow.

MSF teams have made a few trips out to assess the situation, to donate the remaining medical supplies they have and to offer help and care to those in need.

There are many vulnerable people unable or unwilling to leave their homes. The situation is especially dire for the elderly and those with disabilities who are dependent on others for help and care, including to find food, water and wood to make fires. The reports we received from our trapped staff are hard to listen to.

For weeks, almost no one has been able to get into, or out of, the city, and that includes aid workers and others trying to bring in basic supplies.

The siege has effectively entrapped the population. They have been denied the right to flee to safety and are cut off from access to basic necessities needed for survival.

After Deraa, Darayya, Raqqa, Kabul, Sarajevo and so many other conflicts, it is now Mariupol’s turn. Several attempts to create a safe passage for those trapped inside Mariupol fell through before authorities reported that thousands of people (including some MSF staff and their families) were able to leave the city under shelling through a one-off safe passage on March 14.

Every conflict is unique but MSF has learned firsthand that one-off safe passage is not enough. While it may be helpful for those willing or able to leave, provided that so-called humanitarian corridors are not targeted of course, what happens to civilians unable or unwilling to leave is a major concern.

Among those are medical staff choosing to remain to take care of the sick and wounded. Such passages depend on the goodwill of all the parties to the conflict, which is clearly in short supply. Furthermore, provision of these passages cannot, and must not, absolve all involved of their responsibilities to afford protection to the hundreds of thousands who remain trapped inside the besieged city.

Regardless of temporary truces, international law requires all belligerents to make every effort to spare all civilians at all times. MSF and other humanitarian organisations are ready to provide much-needed supplies and support to Mariupol but we urgently need assurances from all parties that our teams will be permitted safe passage. So while we are busy assisting in other areas of Ukraine, with Mariupol, we are left feeling helpless, watching the catastrophic destruction and tragic loss of lives while repeatedly calling for the safety of civilians and respect of international humanitarian law. But once again, we call on all parties with the power to make this happen, to ensure it does while there are still people to save in Mariupol.

Her brother died immediately when a land mine exploded by the car. Her 14-year-old nephew survived just long enough to cry for help as he burned in the wreck. For 19 days this month Anastasiia lost contact with her family after their Ukrainian city was severed from the outside world, deprived of food, water, medicine, heat and mobile communications. Finally she was getting news of them again.

But on what should have been a day of relief — the day her family drove out of Mariupol — the nightmare had only deepened.

“Your dad’s fingers are moving; that’s a really good sign,” her former sister-in-law told Anastasiia from a Russian-controlled hospital in eastern Ukraine, speaking about six hours after she watched her son and ex-husband die. Six thousand miles away in Florida, Anastasiia sobbed and wondered what would happen to those who survived.

“Are they going to be kept in Russia forever? Are they captives?” the 39-year-old asked in an interview this week, speaking in Ukrainian while a friend translated. She requested that The Post not use her last name or her family’s names because she worries about relatives’ safety in Russian territory.

“I never wish anyone — anywhere, ever — a day like today,” said Anastasiia, who moved to the United States with her husband nine months ago.

The Post has not spoken to her surviving relatives. Anastasiia shared images of messages and call logs with her mother and a Ukrainian friend that corroborated her account.

Like so many others, Anastasiia has watched the war in horror from afar, struggling for the most basic information. Like millions of Ukrainians, her family faced awful choices: Staying in key cities like Mariupol was dangerous, but so was leaving. Ukrainian officials have repeatedly accused Russian forces of violating cease-fires meant to allow safe passage through “humanitarian corridors,” while a leader at the International Committee of the Red Cross warned recently that a path out of Mariupol appeared to have land mines.

Drone video shared by Ukraine’s far-right Azov Battalion on March 23 showed widespread damage to a residential neighborhood in the besieged city of Mariupol. (Video: Azov Battalion via Telegram)

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video address Tuesday that about 100,000 people remain in Mariupol under “inhumane conditions,” a fraction of the more than 400,000 who once lived there. Ukrainian leaders say thousands flee the city each day as Russia’s weeks-long siege gives way to street fighting and, according to the Pentagon, shelling from the sea.

It’s the place where Anastasiia was born, where she lived “24 beautiful years” and loved to spend time by the water. Now it was on the news every day — a strategic target for Russia, a “humanitarian catastrophe” for those trapped in the blockade. Strikes hit a maternity hospital, an art school, and a theater-turned-mass-shelter where the word “children” was written large enough to show up on satellite images.

On March 9 — the day of the hospital strike — Anastasiia learned her brother was alive by spotting him in a video online. He seemed to be on a road near the medical center, she said, and wondered aloud: “Is this really a bomb?”

“People couldn’t believe that that happened,” Anastasiia said. “The people were just in shock.”

A cousin near Kyiv was able to make contact with their relatives in Mariupol. She heard her family was boiling snow for water and spending freezing nights without heat. But still, they were out of reach.

Then, last week she got a message from her mother’s account on Telegram, telling her what she already knew: Mariupol was destroyed.

Her mom was typing unusually fast. Anastasiia had a hunch. “Timur?” she asked.

Behind the keyboard was her nephew, a bright teenager who dreamed of becoming a programmer or a graphic designer. He had found some Internet service on the ninth floor and said the family was okay.

Early one morning this week, Anastasiia sat awake in Boca Raton, Fla., waiting for news as her family attempted to evacuate west. She asked a friend in the western city of Lviv to call her mother for updates, hoping someone located in Ukraine would have better luck getting through.

The friend called shortly after 5 a.m. while running to a bomb shelter and gave a quick, cryptic warning: “You’ll have to hold yourself together.” He had overheard an explosion. At 5:38 a.m., Anastasiia said, her mother called — but she was sobbing, speaking to someone else. It seemed like an accidental dial.

“Can you help him?” Anastasiia says her mother cried. “Can you save him?”

It took several hours to learn what happened.

Anastasiia said her surviving family recounted trying to push the car when it got stuck; another vehicle tried to go around, driving slightly off the road, setting off a mine. The blast sent one car flying into the other, and Timur and his father, 41-year-old Dmitry, were pinned as a fire raged. Russian soldiers took the others to the hospital in Russian-controlled territory, Anastasiia said.

Anastasiia said she is grateful to the doctors treating her family but angry at Russia. “They’re destroying our nation. They mine our fields. They kill our people,” she said. “They’re not saving us.”

She said it was not clear what will happen when her family’s treatment ends.

One person was physically unharmed in the mine explosion: Anastasiia’s mother. But Anastasiia said she sounds “like a different person” on the phone. “Her son and her grandson became char in front of her eyes,” Anastasiia said.

Her friend in Florida, Vera de Chalambert, struggled to speak after translating the mother’s ordeal.

“I don’t even know what to say,” de Chalambert said.

She also has family in Ukraine, and so far they have stayed in Kyiv as Russian forces close in. It’s a dangerous place — early this week a missile turned much of a shopping mall to debris, killing at least eight people. But “where am I going on go?” her father’s cousin in the capital asked her.

Under constant fire, the port city on the Sea of Azov has become a symbol of resistance to the Russian army and of humanitarian disaster. The destruction of a hospital treating children and pregnant women and the bombing of a theater where civilians had taken shelter shocked the world. The EU said that Russia had committed a ""massive war crime.""

DW spoke to people who were able to escape the city and find safety in Ukrainian-controlled territory.

'Bodies all over the city'

Mykola Osychenko, the head of Mariupol Television, left the city with his family and neighbors. They lived near the hospital that was bombed on March 9.

The clinic is 500 meters (about 550 yards) away from my building. When the plane dropped the bomb, I thought that it had hit our building because the explosion was so powerful. But it was the children's hospital with a maternity ward on the third floor. The day before the attack, my 60-year-old injured neighbor had been released from the very same hospital. He had ended up there because there was no space elsewhere. Russian media said that there were neither children nor women and that it was the headquarters of a battalion, but, in reality, there were many women and children.

The temperature in our building was the same as outside: minus 6 or 7 [degrees Celsius] (21 to 19 degrees Fahrenheit). We all slept in the basement in a separate room. That was the warmest place because it could be sealed off. There were mattresses and cushions on the ground. We put the children on them. They slept and spent all day there. The little ones lay down with their mothers, the grandparents slept while sitting on chairs against the wall. Those of us who are middle-aged simply slept on the stairs.

This children's hospital was damaged by shelling on March 9

Before we left Mariupol, we gave our water supplies to those who were already in cars and to people who were staying behind. We also left them the remaining food that we had because it is impossible to get any more now. The warehouses have been destroyed and plundered, the shops too.

Before we left, we were cooking food over a fire outside in front of the building, but we did not have enough dry wood. People used the window frames and building material from schools that had been bombed as firewood. But it was dangerous to collect it as a bomb could hit anytime, which also happened. People were torn to pieces.

At the beginning, people tried to get water from the wells, which still exist in some places. But they also had to get there under fire and wait in a queue for a long time. People also used water from the heating systems of destroyed buildings even though it should not be drunk. But they boiled it and drank it. One night, it snowed. We were overjoyed like children. Everyone in our block collected it in buckets as long as it was calm, and we built up a supply of melted water.

As we were leaving the city, we did not see one intact building ­— there were shattered windows and destroyed walls between apartments everywhere. Some of the buildings had no top floor left at all. There were corpses everywhere, women, men and children. We tried to distract our children in the car so that they would not see. It is simply terrible.

'My heart is broken into three pieces'

Natalia Koryagina, a medical assistant, left Mariupol on March 14.

I made my way from the left bank of the Kalmius River in Mariupol to a building in the city center with just a backpack because there was less firing at the time. My mother, who is 79, didn't want to come with me. Neither my tears nor my warnings could make her change her mind. Just an hour after I left our building, a school and two nearby buildings were hit. At our neighbors', all the windows shattered but my mother's ones did not break. Later, the electricity and water were turned off, and I told my mother that I would come and get her the next day, and this time she agreed.

My colleagues and their families were already staying in the building in the center because their homes were in dangerous parts of the city. There were 16 of us, including six children. We set up beds in the basement, with mats and air mattresses. There were frequent air raid sirens and we spent most of the day in the basement. The next day, I couldn't get to the left bank of the city. We tried for over four hours to call a taxi. The answer was: ""There is no gas, nobody is going to the left bank."" I begged and offered a lot of money but to no avail. None of my acquaintances were able to help me to get my mother. Then I called her. She calmed me down. She said that she had water and food and that the war wouldn't last forever. She said that she would manage. That is the last I heard of her.

Natalya Koryagina stayed in this building before leaving Mariupol

My husband is in the army and is defending our country. The first few days, I had no contact with him. My son is in Kharkiv. My heart is broken in three pieces. But life goes on. As the siege tightened around our city, our electricity, water and gas were switched off. We could still get a certain amount of food at the market. The stores already closed a long time ago and were plundered since there was no electricity and they had come under fire. We had to cook our food in fires outside. Firewood was collected all over the district, which was under fire.

Then our building was fired at from all sides. All the windows and the roof were destroyed. The building shook so much that we thought it would collapse. But the basement held out. The temperature was 1 to 2 degrees [Celsius] on the ground floor. It was 4 to 5 degrees in the basement. But the worst was the lack of water. It snowed twice so we were able to fill two bathtubs with snow. We were lucky.

There was no cell phone reception in the building, only 900 meters away from us. We found out about a corridor for private cars and decided to leave. When we were loading our cars, there were repeated blasts and metal shards flew against the fence. We left Mariupol at 12 o'clock, we saw ruins and fires everywhere. We arrived in Berdyansk at about 9 p.m. and spent the night in a school. There were children in many of the cars of the convoy. Everybody was driving carefully because there was unexploded ordnance everywhere. There were Russian checkpoints on all the roads going in and out of towns, over 30 of them. There was a huge traffic jam in front of a bridge that had been blown up near Zaporizhzhia. The detour was via a narrow road. We were able to get through, but an hour later another convoy was fired at and there were casualties. We arrived in the city of Dnipro at around 7 p.m.

'It is simply hell'

Oleksandr Skorobohatko, who works for an international humanitarian organization, left Mariupol on March 15.

By the beginning of March, it was clear that the whole city was facing a humanitarian catastrophe. When there was no more food and medicine coming in, people started to panic. I had only heard about humanitarian disasters in theory before. I have never worked for a foreign mission and had never been confronted with such problems.

My sister and I stayed with relatives. We slept on the floor in the hallway where we felt safer. Somehow, we adjusted to the shelling, to the lack of food. The neighboring building had already been destroyed. We spent a lot of time with the neighbors and lit fires to cook.

It took a long time for the humanitarian corridor to be set up. People did not have much hope and convinced each other that it was safer to stay in the city. When we heard on the radio that 500 cars had already reached Zaporizhzhia, we could not believe it at first. But the next day, an acquaintance came and told us there would be another convoy of cars. We immediately got into the car. We intuitively took side streets. By the time we were five or 10 kilometers [eight to 16 miles] away from the city, it finally got quiet.

These men dig a grave in an open space as there are reportedly corpses everywhere

There were checkpoints, controls, endless queues everywhere. Only when we arrived in Zaporizhzhia did we realize that we had finally managed to leave Mariupol. I kind of felt guilty for not warning friends and family with their children in advance. So, I decided to go and get them.

We went through all the checkpoints again. At the last one before Mariupol, the soldiers of the so-called ""People's Republic of Donetsk"" just took the car from me. I had to come back on foot. I was able to sleep and eat in the next village. In the morning, some good people brought me with them to Zaporizhzhia. I will remember this all my life, as well as all the dead.

Many volunteers are managing to get to Mariupol at the moment. We exchange information. But nobody can guarantee anyone's safety, on the contrary, there are warnings that one might not come back alive. Nonetheless, I'm still looking for ways to get my relatives at least to the next safe village.

It is simply hell.
