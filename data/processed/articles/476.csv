James Whitney Hill, often called Jimmy or Jim by friends, died when Russian troops launched heavy artillery attacks on unarmed civilians, according to multiple reports.

Mr Hill’s identity was confirmed by Anton Gerashenko, an adviser at the Ukrainian Interior Ministry, as well as his family.

He had travelled with his Ukrainian partner Ira to Chernihiv in December so that she could receive treatment for multiple sclerosis, friends of Mr Hill told an Idaho broadcaster this month. They were trapped in a hospital in the city.

His sister, Katya Hill, told CNN that her brother was killed after going out to buy food as the Russian bombardment of the city intensified.

“As things were deteriorating in the city ... my brother was the one that was going out to the store to bring back what food he could find,” she said.

Another sister, Cheryl Hill Gordon, said in a Facebook post Mr Hill was waiting in a bread line with several others when they were targeted Russian gunfire.

Mr Hill documented his experience in a string of haunting Facebook posts, writing that his wife had been admitted to the intensive care unit and they wanted to leave but were unable to find safe passage.

“We could try a breakout tomorrow but Ira’s mom doesn’t want to,” he wrote on Facebook on Monday. “Each day people are killed trying to escape. But bombs falling here at night. Risk either way … I only have wifi a few hours a day. We have enough food for a few days.”

“Intense bombing. still alive,” he added a day later.

Mr Hill was found dead with his passport, which stated that he was from Minnesota, The Wall Street Journal reported.

The State Department confirmed the death of an American on Thursday.

“We offer our sincerest to the family on their loss,” a spokesperson said. “Out of respect to the family during this difficult time, we have no further comment.”

His sister, Cheryl Hill Gordon, said her brother had been teaching throughout Europe, mostly in Ukraine, for the last 25 years, The Journal reported.

His Facebook page said he taught at Taras Shevchenko National University in Kyiv. Ms Hill said he had two children and loved baseball and fishing.

Ms Hill said her brother had been home for Christmas but had returned to Ukraine to help Ira get treatment.

“We want to take a family with children out with us. It’s not safe here. But it’s not safe,” Mr Hill wrote on 13 March.

The Journal identified Mr Hill’s partner as Iryna Teslenko, but he called her Ira, noting in a social media post that she was too weak to travel.

“Not allowed to take photos. Spies throughout city. Bombing has intensified, no way out,” he added on 15 March.

“Intense bombing! Still alive. Limited food. Room very cold. Ira in intensive care,” he wrote.

Sibling Katya Hill said her brother only left Ira to look for food. She said she last spoke to him on 5 March.

“When the bombing increased, the men in the hospital were asked if they wanted a gun. And Jim said, ‘No, I’m not carrying a gun.’ And he said, ‘But if you give me a fishing rod and some bait, I’ll try to catch some fish.’ They did not get his joke,” she said.

“My brother had the sense of humor in the family, and he retained his humor, except for the last couple of days that we were in contact. I think he was realizing how bad it was getting,” she added.

“He just was not going to leave Ira,” she told The Journal. “He would never abandon her.”

Katya Hill said that as food and other basic necessities grew more and more scarce, he kept a stash of chocolate with him in the hospital and handed it out “whenever somebody was depressed, or just needed a little encouragement”.

At least 53 civilians have been killed in the frontline city of Chernihiv on Wednesday, Ukraine’s UN ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya told a Thursday meeting of the UN Security Council.

Russian Ambassador Vasily Nebenzya denied claims that Russian forces targeted a bread line in Chernihiv, as well as reports of strikes on a maternity ward and theatre in Mariupol.

“There are no Russian military in Chernihiv,” he said. “I think this is the consequences of just distributing weapons to whoever wants to have them in Ukraine.”

His false denial comes as Russia continues to baselessly claim its forces are not targeting civilians in what they call a “special operation” in Ukraine.

According to the news outlet Ukrainian Public Broadcaster News, Russian troops on Thursday morning fired at civilians who were on the street in a residential district in Chernihiv, which is north of Kyiv.

The exact number of those killed in the shelling has not been confirmed, but among them was a US citizen, which police in the area said was a Minnesota native who was born in 1954.

A witness of the shelling told the news outlet that the citizens were standing in line for water before the shelling.

CNN reporter and former CBS News reporter Kylie Atwood confirmed that the person killed was James Whitney Hill, from Minnesota. Atwood said that the New York Times confirmed he had traveled to Chernihiv in Dec. for his Ukrainian partner to get treatment for multiple sclerosis.

James “Jimmy” Hill was in the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv helping care for his lifelong partner, who was severely ill with multiple sclerosis, when he was killed.

“He was a hero, and he was there for a noble reason,” Katya Hill, Jimmy’s sister said.

Hill said the last few days have been more difficult than expected. While learning about the death of her brother was devastating, finding out it was a bomb made it worse.

“A group of 10 other people were killed by that bomb, and the condition of his body … is rather unthinkable,” Hill said.

She and other family members have been in touch with the U.S. embassy for Ukraine — now located in Poland — which told them Jimmy’s body is in Kiev.

Hill says what happens next isn’t as clear as they’d like — and the process thus far has been frustrating. One of the frustrations is with the U.S. State Department not allowing Hill, who lives in Pennsylvania, to be the family’s point person for these affairs. The federal agency told the family that the point person has to be Jimmy’s son, who lives in California.

The family has also been in touch with U.S. senators Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith — Senator Smith’s office sent 5 EYEWITNESS NEWS the following:

The death of Jimmy Hill is horrible news and my thoughts are with Jimmy and his family in Minnesota. Senator Klobuchar and I are working with the State Department to do everything we can to help. This terrible situation is challenging given the active war zone.

“We just want to be able to have our brother’s body be able to be treated and cut through the red tape,” Hill added about the work to get him home.

A GoFundMe was created by Hill to help with bringing Jimmy’s remains back to the United States, providing medical and essential support for Jimmy’s partner and supporting refugees.

“My brother’s last conversation with me was his wish to bring families to his property, in Idaho, as a safe haven and a little Ukraine,” Hill said. “We want to honor that wish.”",https://kstp.com/kstp-news/family-working-to-bring-remains-home-of-minnesota-native-killed-in-ukraine/
