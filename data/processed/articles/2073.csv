The latest example of Russia‚Äôs poor tactics appeared recently when the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense released a video on March 11, showcasing a column of Russian tanks being ambushed about 35km from Kyiv and were forced to retreat.

It appears that President Putin has had enough of the ‚Äòmocking‚Äô with images and videos of Russian tanks, air defenses, artillery columns and convoys being destroyed by drones and artillery fire by the Ukrainian forces.

It appears that Putin may have finally decided to turn these tactics against the Ukrainian forces and give them a taste of their own medicine.

The Russian Ministry of Defense has released a video on March 12, likely taken by an Orlan-10 UAV, showing Krasnopol laser-guided artillery strikes in Kyiv Oblast.

Orlan-10 is a medium-range, multi-purpose unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) developed by the Russian firm Special Technology Center LLC in St Petersburg.

While this is not the first time Orlan-10 has been used by the Russian armed forces in Ukraine, the latest images from Ukrainian sources also show the remains of what appears to be a Russian-made ‚Äòkamikaze‚Äô suicide drone that fell over the Ukrainian capital.

Ukrainian sources have claimed that this drone ‚Äúcontained a kilogram of explosives (plastids) with metal balls‚Äù and fell over the roof of a building in Podil neighborhood in Kiev and set the roof on fire. The accompanying photos also show clouds of smoke emerging out of a roof on a building.

The drone featured in the images looks like a KYB ‚Äúkamikaze‚Äù UAV which is developed by ZALA Aero Group, a Russian company that specializes in the manufacture of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). It is the subsidiary of Kalashnikov Group, famous for developing the world‚Äôs most iconic weapon, the AK-47 Assault Rifle.

If true, this could be the first documented instance of Russian forces deploying loitering munitions to Ukraine.

The KUB-UAV, is intended to be affordable, simple, and easy to operate that can be used for reconnaissance and attack purposes. As per the company claims, it has an endurance of 30 minutes, speeds of 80-130km/h (48-78mph) and can it carry a payload of 3kg (6.6-pound).

The drone has been used by Russian forces in Syria for striking terrorist targets in Idlib, northern Syria according to reports by Russian state-owned news agencies Novosti and Russia Today.

Responding to reports, Colonel Mustafa Bakour, the official spokesman for the Jaish al-Izza, a rebel group in Idlib, told the NewArab that the Russian forces had tested kamikaze drones in Hama, Syria as early as 2016, which he claimed targeted hospitals and rebel mountain bases.

The KYB drone was first exhibited at the international defense exhibition IDEX 2019 in Abu Dhabi, UAE. In late January, Kalashnikov Group announced that it will commence exports of the KUB loitering munition in cooperation with Rosoboronexport.

These mini-drones can be equipped with cameras and can loiter in the air while relaying enemy positions to the troops on the ground. When the commanders see an appropriate target to hit, they can move the drone to dive onto the target and detonate the warhead on it.

The warheads of loitering munitions are small, having explosive power like a grenade or less which may not be used against hard targets like armored vehicles or tanks but they can hit the enemy on the other side of a hill shielded from observation or fire by terrain, like mortars in defiladed positions, or fly into windows to take out enemy positions during urban combat.

Also, there is another way of fielding loitering munitions and that is, as a countermeasure to sophisticated enemy UAVs like the Turkish-made TB2 Bayraktar.

‚ÄúThe Russians are developing the KUB to use it as an aerial minefield and have proposed that against [Bayraktar] TB2s (as low and slow flying UAVs), they could launch a dozen KUB drones given their swarm capabilities to first identify a Bayraktar and then attack it,‚Äù Samuel Bendett, an advisor with the Strategy, Policy, Plans and Programs the US-based Centre for a New American Security, told Shephard Media on February 11.

In 2020, Russian-backed forces in Libya, Syria and the Nagorno-Karabakh region suffered heavy losses due to strikes performed by TB2 Bayraktar drones, and Israeli loitering munitions. These battlefield outcomes were probably eye-openers for the Russian military planners.

ZALA Aero has also been developing a more advanced successor of the KYB UAV, known as the ‚ÄòLancet‚Äô which has three variants Lancet ‚Äì 1, 2 & 3. Lancet has also been reportedly tested on the Syrian battlefield.",https://eurasiantimes.com/russian-suicide-drones-blasting-ukrainian-positions-appear-online/

Following the recovery of the Aero Kub from the city centre, military analysts have not ruled out that the drones could be used in an assassination attempt on Mr Zelenskyy, as they are designed to hit static targets.

The small drone, known as a loitering munition that has a maximum reach of 40 kilometres, is difficult to detect and carries a one-kilogram explosive packed with deadly metal ball bearings.

The drone came down on a house in Kyiv‚Äôs historic Podil district, close to government buildings and embassies, suggesting the Russians may have been hunting for a specific target.

The drone has a speed of up to 130kph and carries a 3kg payload, including the camera and bomb. It has reportedly proved successful when used by the Russian military to attack insurgents in Idlib, Syria.

While there is a possibility the Aero Kub could be used for targeted assassinations, these would probably be done by more sophisticated missiles, said Sam Cranny-Evans, an expert on the Russian military at the Rusi think tank.

‚ÄúPotentially, if they can find President Zelenskyy, they could be used against him but I'd have thought if that was really their goal, then they would use a cruise missile,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThe drone is controlled through video transmitted back in real time so it will depend on the capability of the operator and the manoeuvrability of the drone to get on target.‚Äù

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy speaks in a street of Kyiv. AFP

The drone‚Äôs appearance suggests that some Russian forces are close enough to the capital to launch smaller UAVs, or unmanned aerial vehicles, he added.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs got a fairly short duration of 30 minutes which suggests that whoever launched it must have been close.‚Äù

The Aero Kub, built by the Kalashnikov Group known for its AK-47 rifle, is designed to be cheaper and more straightforward to use, both in attack and surveillance roles.

The drone, which only became operational in the last year, can scout positions but if the operator sees an attack opportunity, it can perform a vertical dive on to a stationary target, detonating a device with the explosive power of a large hand grenade, which experts say could even penetrate armour

Kalashnikov claims the UAV can remain in the sky for up to six hours and its 1.2-metre length makes it difficult for air defence systems to find. Other analysts say the $160,000 drone can only fly for up to 30 minutes with a range of 7km.

It has also been suggested that due to poor pre-invasion preparation, the Russians do not have their more sophisticated UAVs on hand, so the Aero Kub might have only been being used for surveillance.

‚ÄúThey don't have their normal reconnaissance means handy so they could be using what they have available to just get a picture of what's going on,‚Äù said Mr Cranny-Evans.

Jeremy Binnie, a drone expert at Jane's Defence Weekly, suggested that it might have been looking for stationary vehicles or been out on reconnaissance.

‚ÄúIt is relatively short range and carries a fairly small warhead and is GNSS [Global Navigation Satellite System] guided,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThat means it can only be used against static targets, which makes it inappropriate for assassinations as you would have to be sure the target remained in exactly the same place.‚Äù

He added the Aero Kub was also ‚Äúvery similar‚Äù to a suicide drone developed by Iran.",https://www.thenationalnews.com/world/uk-news/2022/03/14/russias-kub-bla-kamikaze-drone-intercepted-in-ukraine/

Military weapons have become much more technologically sophisticated than in any other historical period in the era of AI. Russia‚Äôs military will be no exception, as its invasion of Ukraine intensifies. Russia is among the world‚Äôs largest defenses, with World Bank calculations putting it at $62 billion in 2020, trailing only the United States and China. All three countries have been developing a variety of AI units and weaponry. As the Russia-Ukraine conflict deepens, numerous western analysts have mocked the Russian armed forces for their inadequate combat tactics over a ‚Äúmuch smaller‚Äù Ukraine.

Russia‚Äôs incursion of Ukraine, now in its third week, is evolving over time as new weapons and equipment are employed. While Russia‚Äôs deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles seems to have been fairly low, this is evolving. Russia is now sharing UAV videos from the front lines, similar to what it conducted in Syria.

In Kyiv, a ZALA KYB hovering missile was shot down. This is the first instance of lingering explosives being utilized in combat. These technologies have shown to be crucial in recent conflicts and are exceedingly difficult to challenge consistently. When fitted with a visual package, the ZALA KYB is a form of hovering weapon that would be especially effective for attacking stationary easy targets or objectives of occasion and reconnaissance ahead of enemy forces.

Due to the obvious nation‚Äôs lengthy war with Military rebels in eastern Ukraine, some in Ukraine‚Äôs drone sector have already used their knowledge in battle areas. Monnik‚Äôs company, DroneSec, has monitored many cases of both sides of the war equipping tiny drones with weapons in the last year. One thing Ukrainians have discovered is that tiny quad drones, like those offered in supermarkets, are rarely successful at delivering lethal warheads to a target.

Although this is not the first incident in which Russian armed forces have deployed the Orlan-10 in Ukraine, new photographs from Ukrainian reports suggest the remnants of what seems to be a Russian-made ‚Äòkamikaze‚Äô suicide UAV that landed over the Ukrainian capital. According to Ukrainian officials, this drone ‚Äúcarried a kilogram of explosives with metal ball bearings‚Äù and dropped over the top of a tall building in Kyiv‚Äôs Podil area, setting the roof on fire.

What are suicide drones?

This weaponry is based on a very simple premise: slow down a missile attack to improve its accuracy. They work semi-autonomously and can circle around a target and wait for the best moment to attack.

Lotering munitions (known as scouting munitions or, colloquially, suicide drones) are devices capable of remaining in position over a target area, performing reconnaissance and providing data or images for in-flight target assignment. the specialized website Infodefensa. ‚ÄúThis type of system allows the attack to be carried out at the right time or to abort the mission in case the target is not detected.‚Äù

How do they work?

- Advertisement - There are suicide drones controlled by a human operator with a tablet, while others work autonomously, locating and destroying the target assigned to them. They can reach their goal autonomously based on coordinates or by identifying the image they have been instructed to search for.

These types of weapons can be used day or night and are capable of escaping radar detection and anti-aircraft defense systems. They cost about $6,000 compared to $150,000 for, say, a Hellfire missile launched by a Predator drone. In this case, the drone does not fire any missile but the device is the missile itself.

According to Ukrainian networks, the drone was loaded with shrapnel to inflict maximum damage.
