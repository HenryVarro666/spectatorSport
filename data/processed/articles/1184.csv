The aircraft that flew over Romania, a NATO member bordering Ukraine, were not engaged in combat operations — even if they do serve as a show of force in the face of Russian aggression. The bombers were taking part in close air support and integration mission training, said the U.S. Air Forces in Europe.

After taking off from RAF Fairford, a Royal Air Force base in England, the bombers headed to Germany, where they exercised alongside U.S. and German joint terminal attack controllers, and then completed the training operation in conjunction with Romania.

“BTF rotations give us a critical opportunity to integrate and train with our allies and partners, especially during this difficult time,” said Gen. Jeff Harrigian, commander of U.S. Air Forces in Europe — Air Forces Africa and NATO’s Allied Air Command. “Training together ensures the defensive power of NATO remains unmatched.”

The CivMilAir Twitter account tracked what it said was a pair of B-52H bombers in Romanian airspace before they headed back to Hungary.

Where's Wally or Waldo for you guys across the pond... Spot the B52? 🙄

The Stratofortress is ""a long-range, heavy bomber that can perform a variety of missions. The bomber is capable of flying at high subsonic speeds at altitudes of up to 50,000 feet. It can carry nuclear or precision guided conventional ordnance with worldwide precision navigation capability,"" according to the Air Force.

As Russia's invasion of Ukraine entered its second week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky raged at NATO for refusing to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine, where Russian forces have yet to gain air superiority in the face of fierce resistance, over trepidation that NATO forces would be forced to shoot down Russian planes violating the ban. Ukraine is not a member of NATO.

“By refusing to establish a no-fly zone, today NATO leaders gave the ‘green light’ for further bombing of Ukrainian cities and villages,” Zelensky said Friday, according to a translation. “All the people who will die from this day will also die because of you, because of your weakness, because of your disunity.”

The invasion began last week with Russian President Vladimir Putin announcing a ""special military operation"" that he said was aimed at the “demilitarization and denazification” of Ukraine, not its occupation. Putin also warned other countries that any attempt to interfere would lead to ""consequences you have never seen.""

Although Russia's forces greatly outnumber Ukraine's, progress with the assault has been slower than Moscow expected, according to Western intelligence assessments. Putin placed his nuclear forces on high alert Sunday, citing ""aggressive statements"" by NATO and Western sanctions.

Countries around the world, including the United States, have condemned Moscow's invasion and have unleashed a wave of new sanctions on Russia. Although they aren't sending troops to fight for Ukraine, over the past couple of days, President Joe Biden and other world leaders have authorized tens of millions of dollars in additional military support for Ukrainian forces.

The U.S. and Russia have also established a so-called deconfliction line, which Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told Fox News is not so much in response to Putin placing his nuclear forces on high alert Sunday but rather the ""degree to which Ukrainian airspace became contested over the last several days.""

""The Ukrainians are flying their aircraft. They're launching missiles. They're defending themselves. But the Russians have aircraft and missile systems as well inside Ukrainian airspace,"" Kirby said. ""Most of the airstrikes that we’re seeing on these population centers are actually being launched from inside Ukraine. So that buttresses up right up against the airspace of NATO nations, particularly on NATO's eastern flank. That really was what made us feel that this is the right thing to do. A deconfliction channel was important for that purpose.""",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/us-bombers-fly-over-nato-territory-neighboring-ukraine

6,47b3de2a-a399-4e46-95e8-d502000d6515,['Tnn'],,"MUMBAI: Two Air India Express flights, one from the Romanian capital Bucharest and the other from the Hungarian capital Budapest, carrying a total of 369 Indian evacuees from Ukraine landed into Mumbai on Friday.The earlier flights landed into Mumbai from Bucharest and largely carried Indians from cities such as Vinnytsia, Ivano-Frankivsk, Ternopil and Chernivtsi in western and central Ukraine. The latest flight had many students from the Ukranian capital of Kyiv , that is being pummelled by Russia since February 24.“The first few days, we stayed put in bunkers, but with the situation getting worse by the day, on February 28 we decided to risk it and travel to the border,” said Abhisurya Sahu (23), an Indian student from Kyiv, who travelled on AIX flight. “From Kyiv station we managed to board a train to western Ukraine and from there reached the Hungarian border,” she said. “I’ve barely slept in the past one week. The bunkers aren’t heated, it’s freezing cold at night and then there was the shelling. When we left Kyiv, the one thought we had was whether we would survive the journey,” she said. Many from her Kyiv travel group of friends are currently in Hungary, awaiting flights to get home.Indian student Aastha Sahu, who landed in Delhi on February 27 from Bucharest, was at the Mumbai airport to receive her friends who landed this morning. “They were stranded at the Ukraine-Poland border on February 27, they couldn’t cross over. After waiting for one full day, they left for Uzhhorod in western Ukraine and eventually entered Hungary yesterday,” she said.A Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) spokesperson said that the youngest returnee from the war zone so far was a baby boy all of 25-days-old. The infant along with his parents, both studying in Ukraine, landed in Mumbai on Thursday’s Air India Express flight from Bucharest. “However, his entry wasn’t that smooth for he lacked an essential thing—a passport,” said MIAL. Kuntart Makwana (28), the father said, “How do we go about getting a passport where things are so volatile, when you have bullets and missiles flying all over the place. We managed to get on board the flight but when we arrived, we found that this was a problem.”Under ‘Operation Ganga’ a total of 18 special flights flew into India on Friday from Ukraine’s neighbouring countries, which included 14 civilian flights and 3 C-17 IAF flights, said the Indian government. “While civilian flights carried 3142 persons, C-17 flights evacuated 630 passengers. So far, over 9,364 Indians have been evacuated by 43 special civilian flights and seven flights of C-17 have so far evacuated 1,428 and taken 9.7 tonnes of relief material. Among the day’s civilian flights were four from Bucharest, two from Kosice, four from Budapest, three from Rzeszow and two from Suceava, while IAF flew two flights from Bucharest and one from Budapest.On Saturday, 11 special civilian flights are expected to bring back over 2,200 Indians, with 10 landing in New Delhi and one in Mumbai.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/369-indians-from-ukraine-fly-in-on-2-flights-from-romania-hungary/articleshow/90003299.cms
