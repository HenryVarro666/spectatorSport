""I saw a line of thousands of people standing quietly and calmly waiting for their opportunity to board a train to flee this conflict to safety,"" he said.

""The true victims of war are people that have nothing to do with the conflict and whose lives are turned upside down by war after they cross a frontier from their homeland, have suddenly lost everything that relates to their existence,"" he continued.

""While looking into the eyes of a multitude of Ukrainian refugees that had suddenly just crossed over the border from Ukraine to Poland, what I saw was pride, dignity, courage. And surprisingly, an amazing degree of resilience,"" he told CNN.

Turnley said many of the individuals departing are women and children, as men under the age of 60 have been banned from leaving the country.

""They've been separated from their husbands, their fathers, their young men, and they have no idea when they may return home,"" he told CNN.

Even in these dire circumstances, the photographer said he also saw many examples of humanity.

""A constant in the midst of the plight of a refugee crisis is that people have a tremendous need for each other. Often the only thing that is clear in their lives, is the notion of love and affection,"" he told CNN. ""I've witnessed this incredible exodus of humanity out of Ukraine.""

""You see often gestures of people holding hands, hugging each other, standing very close to each other,"" he said.

""The only bright lights that I am seeing are these gestures of love and affection that I see families showing towards each other as they wait for a destiny that is so unknown,"" he continued.

The photographer said he was especially struck by how these events would impact future generations.

""One sees a multitude of very young children, and it has occurred to me that this is a moment that they will never completely remember and at the same time, it's a moment that they will certainly never forget,"" Turnley continued.

The UN High Commissioner for Refugees said Friday that the number of people who have fled from Ukraine has now hit 2.5 million.

Born two months premature to American parents, the twins were moved from Kyiv to Poland in a rescue evacuation on Monday.

On the day Russia invaded Ukraine, Max and his wife drove from their home in Germany to Poland, and then crossed the border into Ukraine. With fear, they moved in the opposite direction of the long line of cars that intended to flee the country and that was snarling the roads for miles.

Traveling diagonally across the country on Feb. 24, they encountered unmistakable signs of possible violence to come, from dozens of Ukrainian military checkpoints, tanks patrolling the roads and sandbags piled high on the street.

Not venturing to the country would have broken the couple’s decade-old dream to have a family. Their Ukrainian surrogate mother was soon expected to give birth to their twin daughters.

“Just our children not being with us was something we couldn’t live with,” Max said.

Now when his daughters smile at him, the war fades away. They were born prematurely on March 4. But he knows that any day, war could be coming closer to his family. Air raid sirens sound day and night, and much of the twins’ first days in the world have been spent in the hospital’s underground shelter.

Max said he didn’t know if, when and how his new family of four would be able to return home to safety. He spoke on the condition that his last name not be used because many of his relatives did not know he and his wife had turned to surrogacy.

The Russian war in Ukraine has devastated cities and killed more than 500 Ukrainian civilians, with no end to the fighting in sight. The war has also engulfed the lives of foreign couples seeking to become parents. Nearly every day, Ukrainian surrogates give birth to the children of foreign couples, and these parents are struggling to evacuate their children or even meet them for the first time.

Commercial surrogacy is legal in Ukraine for heterosexual married couples who are medically unable to have children or who have unsuccessfully tried to become pregnant several times using in vitro fertilization. The country’s favorable laws — biological parents are listed on the baby’s birth certificate — and affordable prices, generally around $40,000, have attracted many aspiring parents.

Most parents visit Kyiv, the capital, once before their child’s birth, to visit agencies, potentially undergo in vitro fertilization and sign a surrogacy contract. Then, the process of a surrogate becoming pregnant may take multiple attempts over years.

At least a dozen companies offer surrogacy in Ukraine, and BioTexCom, one of the leading agencies in Kyiv, estimates that it arranges at least a thousand births each year. The agency had expected to have 100 babies born by month’s end. Many of these newborns will be born in Kyiv, where fighting has neared hospitals, far from the parents who wait anxiously from outside Ukraine’s borders to take them home.

Sam Everingham, the founder of Growing Families, a nonprofit based in Australia that supports people navigating surrogacy, said that he had heard from about 90 panicked couples with newborns or babies soon expected in Ukraine. Surrogacy agencies, many of them based in Kyiv, once courted parents with images of chubby-cheeked babies and sonograms. Now, the agencies’ social media pages are filled with grim updates of the staff members’ upended lives and their attempts to keep surrogates and newborns safe in bleak shelters.

Some agencies, like New Hope Surrogacy, have relocated pregnant surrogates to safer regions of the country, or outside of it altogether. However, if these women give birth in neighboring countries with different laws about paid surrogacy, the biological parents’ rights could be jeopardized.

The number of stranded babies is growing. Denis Herman, BioTexCom’s legal adviser, said the agency was caring for 30 newborns, most of them in Kyiv.

“We have a lot of babies born during this time,” Mr. Herman said. “We cannot stop this process. We have to find some ways to deal with it.”

BioTexCom believes that the babies are safer in the bomb shelters in Kyiv than being transferred in haste, Mr. Herman said.

Mr. Everingham has heard about “an ongoing flow” of parents traveling into Ukraine despite the risk.

Televised scenes of Russian strikes have terrified parents, including a new Canadian father who spoke on the condition of anonymity because his religion forbade surrogacy. His son was born in Kyiv shortly before the war began. He and his wife are in Turkey, trying to figure out a plan to extract their son, mired by deep stress and depression as they follow the news.

“I don’t know what to do and where to go,” said the 41-year-old man, who lives in Toronto. “The joy of our child has taken over by the fear we might never get to hold him and lose him forever.”

The parents who have managed to extract their children through a combination of luck, connections and timing, say they feel immense responsibility to help evacuate their surrogates and others left behind in Ukraine.

Sasha Spektor, who lives in Chicago with his partner, Irma Nuñez, met his twin boys, Lenny and Moishe, for the first time on Tuesday. His sons had just traveled from Kyiv to Poland, a journey that took about 18 hours.

They were born two months prematurely in Kyiv at the beginning of war, on Feb. 25. The couple, their friends and supporters made hundreds of calls to locate resources in Kyiv, like baby formula and medical equipment, and to find the twins a way out of the war zone. The couple previously told their story of bringing their sons to safety to The Washington Post and NPR.

Eventually, they were able to secure an evacuation with the help of a volunteer Ukrainian ambulance crew and Project Dynamo, a nonprofit based in Tampa, Fla., conducting rescue missions out of Ukraine.

Meeting their sons was amazing, the new father said, adding that they were so gentle, and so tiny.

Their surrogate, Katya, crossed into Poland with the twins and another baby and its parents. Several days later, she returned to Ukraine, to reunite with her 6-year-old son in Lviv with the hopes of fleeing the country together.

“There are other people I feel responsible for,” Mr. Spektor said. “It was just as hard for me to part with her and just let her go back into Ukraine. She is one of us.”",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/03/11/world/ukraine-russia-news

LVIV, Ukraine — Russian forces stepped up their campaign of bombardments aimed at devastating Ukraine’s cities and towns on Saturday, as the White House announced it was sending an additional $200 million in arms and equipment to help Ukraine, defying Moscow.

Soldiers fought street-by-street battles in a leafy suburb of Kyiv, the nation’s capital, and some residents wept as they dragged belongings across a destroyed bridge, trying to escape the violence. Russian forces detained the mayor of a captured city, an act that prompted hundreds of outraged residents to pour into the streets in protest.

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine accused Moscow of terrorizing the country in an attempt to break the will of the people. “A war of annihilation,” he called it.

He said an estimated 1,300 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed in the war, the first time the government had offered the number of its own soldiers killed.

Mr. Zelensky denounced what he called the kidnapping of the mayor — who had refused to cooperate with Russian troops after they seized his city — as “a new stage of terror, when they are trying to physically eliminate representatives of the legitimate local Ukrainian authorities.”

Russian forces have not achieved a major military victory since the first days of the invasion more than two weeks ago, and the assaults reinforced Moscow’s strategic turn toward increasingly indiscriminate shelling of civilian targets.

The American announcement of more arms for Ukraine’s military, including missiles for taking out warplanes and tanks, came just hours after Russia warned that convoys used for the “thoughtless transfer” of weapons to Ukraine would be “legitimate targets” for Russian forces.

Unable to mount a quick takeover of the country by air, land and sea, Russian troops have deployed missiles, rockets and bombs to destroy apartment buildings, schools, factories and hospitals, increasing civilian carnage and suffering, and leading more than 2.5 million people to flee the country.

The suffering has been particularly devastating in the besieged city of Mariupol, which is experiencing “the worst humanitarian catastrophe on the planet,” according to Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba.

At least 1,582 civilians have died since the Russian siege of Mariupol began 12 days ago, he said, and residents are struggling to survive and have been forced to bury the dead in mass graves.

“There is no drinking water and any medication for more than one week, maybe even 10 days,” a staff member who works for Doctors Without Borders in Mariupol said in an audio recording released by the organization on Saturday.

“We saw people who died because of lack of medication, and there are a lot of such people inside Mariupol,” the staff member said.

During a 90-minute call with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany and President Emmanuel Macron of France urged Mr. Putin to accept an immediate cease-fire, according to the French government, which described the talks as “frank” and “difficult.”

France said that Mr. Putin showed no willingness to stop the war, and said he “placed the responsibility for the conflict on Ukraine” and sounded “determined to attain his objectives.”

In its summary of the call, the Kremlin said Mr. Putin had discussed “several matters relating to agreements being drafted to meet the well-known Russian demands,” but did not specify those demands.

In the coming weeks, NATO, which has vowed to defend allied countries from any incursion by Russian forces, plans to gather 30,000 troops from 25 countries in Europe and North America in Norway to conduct live-fire drills and other cold-weather military exercises.

The exercises, which Norway hosts biannually, were announced more than eight months ago, NATO said, and are not linked to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which NATO said it was responding to with “preventive, proportionate and non-escalatory measures.”

But the training has taken on greater significance as Russia steps up its bombardment of Ukrainian population centers.

Around Kyiv, the capital, Russian forces have advanced into the suburbs but have been slowed by Ukrainian troops that have counterattacked with ambushes on armored columns. On Saturday, artillery fire intensified around Kyiv, with a low rumble heard in most parts of the city.

By Saturday, there were no indications of further efforts by the Russian army to move armored columns closer to the capital. Instead, soldiers appeared to be fighting for control of the towns along the highways that encircle it.

In Irpin, about three miles from Kyiv city limits, Ukrainian and Russian soldiers were fighting a street-by-street battle on Saturday, turning what was a quiet suburb just two weeks ago into a suburban battleground.

“We are trying to push them back but we don’t control the town,” said Vitaly, a Ukrainian soldier who asked that his last name not be published for security reasons.

He had taken up a position outside what would once have been an unlikely spot for combat: a gas station mini-market, its windows blown out by shelling, on the city’s western edge. Irpin is his hometown, and he joined the volunteer forces called the Territorial Defense Forces to try to protect it just two weeks ago.

He described Irpin’s Unity Street as Ukrainian-controlled; Central Street as a no-man’s land, exposed to both Ukrainian and Russian forces; and University Street as taken by Russian forces.

But the situation was fluid. Ukrainian soldiers had a “little island” around a shopping center near the city center, he said, but otherwise it wasn’t always clear who was where.

In the southern city of Mykolaiv, residents awoke on Saturday morning to the sounds of a fierce battle hours after Russian shells hit several civilian areas, damaging a cancer hospital and sending residents fleeing into bomb shelters.

The early-morning fight was concentrated in the north of the city, said Col. Sviatoslav Stetsenko of the Ukrainian Army’s 59th Brigade, who was stationed near the front lines.

“They are changing their tactics,” Vitaliy Kim, the governor of the Mykolaiv region, said. “They are deploying in the villages and lodging in village schools and homes. We cannot shoot back. There are no rules now. We will have to be more brutal with them.”

For nearly two weeks, Russian forces have been trying to surround Mykolaiv and cross the Southern Buh River, which flows through the city and is a natural defense against a Russian push toward the west and Odessa, the Black Sea port that appears to be a prime Russian objective.

Russian forces had not crossed the river as of Saturday morning, Colonel Stetsenko said, but “they are continuing to shell Mykolaiv.”

In Melitopol, Russian troops on Friday forced a hood over the mayor’s head and dragged him from a government building, according to Ukrainian officials, prompting hundreds of residents to demonstrate in the streets.

“Return the mayor!” the protesters shouted, according to witnesses and videos. “Free the mayor!”

But nearly as soon as the demonstrators gathered, Russian military personnel moved to shut them down, arresting a woman who they said had organized the protest, according to two witnesses and the woman’s Facebook account.

The episode was part of what Ukrainian officials said was an escalating pattern of intimidation and repression. It also illustrated a problem that Russia is likely to face even if it manages to pummel cities and towns into submission: In at least some of the few cities and towns that Russia has managed to seize — mostly in the south and east — they are facing popular unrest and revolt.

Mr. Zelensky sought to tap into public rage in an address to the nation overnight.

“The whole country saw that Melitopol did not surrender to the invaders,” he said. “Just as Kherson, Berdyansk and other cities where Russian troops managed to enter didn’t.” He said that popular resistance “will not be changed by putting pressure on mayors or kidnapping mayors.”

Melitopol’s mayor, Ivan Fyodorov, had remained stubbornly defiant even after Russian soldiers took over the city after a fierce assault on the first day of the invasion. “We are not cooperating with the Russians in any way,” he had said.

Last weekend, with Mr. Fyodorov’s encouragement, people waving Ukrainian flags took to the streets of Melitopol and other occupied cities. For the most part, Russian soldiers stood aside, even as protesters commandeered a Russian armored vehicle in one town and drove it through the streets.

While the protests in Melitopol were quickly put down, the Ukrainian government renewed efforts to bring aid to Mariupol, dispatching dozens of buses with food and medicine, Ukrainian officials said.

Similar relief efforts had failed in recent days as fighting raged around the city and land mines pocked roads in the area. In an overnight address, Mr. Zelensky said that the inability to bring aid to the city showed that Russian troops “continue to torture our people, our Mariupol residents.”

Still, he said, “We will try again.”

Day 15 of the Russian Invasion: The West Condemns the Attack on Children's Hospital in Mariupol

This morning, explosions were reported in cities across Ukraine. Local media reported explosions in Lutsk in the northwest, as well as in the Dnieper - an inner-city located on the Dnieper River and a major fortress in central-eastern Ukraine.

Three air strikes were carried out early this morning in Dnipro, Reuters reported. According to state emergency services, one person was killed and one injured. The strikes were in areas near a kindergarten and an apartment building.

In the city of Lutsk, the strike was aimed at an airport, the BBC reported, citing information from locals in the area, which was confirmed by the mayor.

There is also information that a factory in the city was hit, where the engines of certain fighters can be repaired.

None of these cities have come under direct fire so far, the media said, adding that air raid sirens sounded in several cities in Ukraine before the explosions.

The Russian military fired on the Institute of Physics and Technology in Kharkiv, which has an experimental nuclear reactor.

According to a Twitter message from the Ukrainian parliament, fighting in the area has not stopped. Russian forces have been expelled from the city of Mykolaiv and continue to be pushed out of the city, said the head of the regional administration Vitaly Kim.

UNICEF: More than a Million Children have left Ukraine since the Russian Invasion

In another video address tonight, Ukrainian President Zelensky said Ukrainian authorities had managed to evacuate nearly 40,000 people yesterday from a number of cities in the country. According to him, humanitarian aid was successfully delivered - hundreds of tons of products and medicines. Zelensky also described the reports in the Russian media about the development of weapons of mass destruction in Ukraine as fake news.

“We are accused of developing biological weapons and preparing a chemical attack, which worries me, because we have been convinced many times - if you want to know what Russia's plans are, look at what it accuses others of.”

The US has warned that Russia may be preparing to use Chemical Weapons in Ukraine

He also warned that Russia would receive “the heaviest sanctions” in return if it used such weapons against Ukraine.

The UN Security Council is expected to hold an extraordinary meeting today at Russia's request to discuss Moscow's claim that the United States is funding the development of biological weapons in Ukraine. According to Western countries, Russia has fabricated these accusations to justify its own future use of biological and chemical weapons in Ukraine.

Earlier, the Secretary-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, said that Moscow and Kyiv were ready to work with the organization to ensure nuclear security. The agency expressed concern over the situation after it became clear that the Russian military had seized the largest nuclear power plant in Europe - Zaporizhzhia - as well as the Chernobyl plant.

Russia and Ukraine Negotiations: No Progress on the Ceasefire

Yesterday, peace talks between the foreign ministers of Ukraine and Russia in Turkey ended without progress on a ceasefire. Russia later announced that it would open humanitarian corridors to its territory on a daily basis from the besieged Ukrainian cities. Corridors to Central and Western Ukraine are also allowed, but in coordination with the Ukrainian authorities.

The United States has also more than doubled its military presence in Poland, which is a member of NATO, to 9,000 troops in recent weeks.Russia's state communications watchdog has ordered to completely block access to Facebook in Russia amid the tensions over the war in Ukraine.The agency, Roskomnadzor, said Friday it decided to cut access to Facebook over its alleged ""discrimination"" of the Russian media and state information resources. It said the restrictions introduced by Facebook owner Meta on the RT and other state-controlled media violate the Russian law.A week ago, the watchdog announced ""partial restrictions"" on access to Facebook that sharply slowed it down, citing the platform's moves to limit the accounts of several state-controlled Russian media. Facebook and Twitter have played a major role in amplifying dissent in Russia in recent years.The move against Facebook follows the blocks imposed Friday on the BBC, the U.S. government-funded Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, German broadcaster Deutsche Welle and Latvia-based website Meduza as the government seeks to uproot independent sources of information about the invasion of Ukraine.Facebook's parent company Meta tweeted in response: ""We have been closely following the invasion in Ukraine and taking steps to help protect and support our community."" They also listed a few actions the company has already taken to combat this blcok.Foreign ministers from the Group of Seven major world powers say that those responsible for Russian military attacks on civilians in Ukraine must be held accountable for their crimes, amid reports of the use of cluster bombs and other banned munitions.In a statement after talks in Brussels on Friday, the G7 ministers said they are ""deeply concerned with the catastrophic humanitarian toll taken by Russia's continuing strikes against the civilian population of Ukraine's cities.""They underlined that ""indiscriminate attacks are prohibited by international humanitarian law,"" and that they ""will hold accountable those responsible for war crimes, including indiscriminate use of weapons against civilians.""The ministers also welcomed the investigations and evidence-gathering being done to establish what war crimes might have been committed in Ukraine.The International Criminal Court prosecutor has launched an investigation that could target senior officials believed responsible for war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide amid a rising civilian death toll and widespread destruction of property.The BBC says it is temporarily suspending the work of all its journalists in Russia after the country's lawmakers approved legislation criminalizing reporting of the war in Ukraine that differs from the government line.Tim Davie, director-general of the British broadcaster, said the legislation ""appears to criminalize the process of independent journalism."" He said the corporation was halting newsgathering work by its journalists and support staff in Russia ""while we assess the full implications of this unwelcome development.""""The safety of our staff is paramount and we are not prepared to expose them to the risk of criminal prosecution simply for doing their jobs,"" he said.Davie said the BBC's Russian-language news service would continue to operate from outside Russia.The Russian parliament voted unanimously Friday to approve a draft law criminalizing the intentional spreading of what Russia deems to be ""fake"" reports. It could be signed by President Vladimir Putin and take effect as soon as Saturday.A Western official says a huge Russian military convoy advancing on Kyiv has made little progress for several days.The official said the convoy, which has been estimated at up to 40 miles (64 kilometers) long, had become a huge traffic jam that included damaged or destroyed vehicles.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence, said the convoy had been attacked from the air by the Ukrainians, but that Ukraine's ability to do so was limited.The official assessed that Ukrainian forces remain in control of much of the country's territory but that Russia holds the cities of Kherson, Melitopol and Berdiansk in the south.Multiple Western officials have said Russia's invasion of Ukraine has advanced more slowly than planned, with Russian forces meeting stiff Ukrainian resistance and encountering myriad logistical problems.Russian President Vladmir Putin said Thursday that what he calls a ""special military operation"" was on course to meet its goals.President Vladimir Putin says Russia is ready for talks with Ukraine but insisted that it must meet Moscow's demands.Putin told German Chancellor Olaf Scholz that Ukraine must agree to demilitarize, accept Moscow's sovereignty over Crimea and surrender territory to Russia-backed rebels in the east, the Kremlin said in its readout of Friday's call.Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014 following the ouster of the country's former Moscow-friendly leaders and cast its support behind the rebels in eastern Ukraine.Putin recognized the separatist ""people's republics"" as independent states just before he launched an invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, citing their plea for military assistance.Russian and Ukrainian negotiators on Thursday held the second of two rounds of talks, reaching a tentative agreement on setting up safe corridors to allow civilians to leave besieged Ukrainian cities and the delivery of humanitarian supplies. They also agreed to keep talking on ways to negotiate a settlement, but Putin's tough demands make prospects for a compromise look dim.Ukrainian negotiators said the parties may conduct another round of talks over the weekend.Russian forces are advancing on Mykolaiv, another key city in southern Ukraine, the regional governor warned Friday.In a video message posted on social media, Mykolaiv Oblast Gov. Vitaliy Kim said Russian troops are moving on Mykolaiv city from two directions and that some have already entered the city limits but are not yet inside in significant numbers.The city is preparing to defend itself, according to Kim.Russian troops are shelling Europe's largest nuclear power station in Ukraine.""We demand that they stop the heavy weapons fire,"" Andriy Tuz, spokesperson for the plant in Enerhodar, said in a video posted on Telegram. ""There is a real threat of nuclear danger in the biggest atomic energy station in Europe.""The plant accounts for about one quarter of Ukraine's power generation.The fighting at Enerhodar, a city on the Dnieper River that accounts for one-quarter of the country's power generation, came as another round of talks between the two sides yielded a tentative agreement to set up safe corridors inside Ukraine to evacuate citizens and deliver humanitarian aid.The mayor of Enerhodar said Ukrainian forces were battling Russian troops on the city's outskirts. Video showed flames and black smoke rising above the city of more than 50,000, with people streaming past wrecked cars, just a day after the U.N. atomic watchdog agency expressed grave concern that the fighting could cause accidental damage to Ukraine's 15 nuclear reactors.The Pentagon has established a channel of direct communication with the Russian ministry of defense to avoid unintended conflict related to the war in Ukraine.A U.S. defense official said the ""de-confliction line"" was established March 1 ""for the purpose of preventing miscalculation, military incidents, and escalation."" The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the communication line has not been announced.Associated Press Writer Robert Burns in Washington contributed to this report.U.S. President Joe Biden's administration on Thursday announced new sanctions against Russian oligarchs and others in President Vladimir Putin's inner circle as Russian forces continue to pummel Ukraine.Those targeted by the new sanctions include Putin's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, and Alisher Burhanovich Usmanov, one of Russia's wealthiest individuals and a close ally of Putin. The U.S. State Department also announced it was imposing visa bans on 19 Russian oligarchs and dozens of their family members and close associates.""These individuals and their family members will be cut off from the U.S. financial system; their assets in the United States will be frozen and their property will be blocked from use,"" the White House said in a statement announcing the new penalties.The White House described Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson, as a ""top purveyor of Putin's propaganda.""The property of Usmanov and the others will be blocked from use in the U.S. and by Americans. His assets include his superyacht, one of the world's largest. Usmanov's private jet, one of Russia's largest privately owned aircraft, is also covered by the sanctions.Russian President Vladimir Putin says the Russian military has offered safe corridors to civilians to allow them to leave areas of fighting in Ukraine.Putin, speaking in a video call with members of his Security Council, has charged that Ukrainian nationalist groups are preventing civilians from leaving.The Russian leader said the groups were also using civilians as shields, taking up firing positions to provoke the Russian retaliatory fire. Putin's claim couldn't be independently verified.The Russian military says it has only struck military facilities and haven't targeted residential areas, a claim that has been contradicted by the abundant evidence of massive casualties and damage to residential areas of Kyiv, Kharkiv, Chernihiv and other cities in Ukraine documented by The Associated Press.Putin reaffirmed his claim that the Russian military was fighting ""neo-Nazis,"" adding that some Ukrainians were also ""fooled by nationalist propaganda.""He hailed the Russian military as heroes and ordered additional payments to families of the soldiers who were killed and servicemen who were wounded in action.A growing number of international companies, including Apple, Disney and Ford, are dialing back operations in Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. See the list here Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has challenged Russian President Vladimir Putin to sit down for talks while urging the West to offer a stronger military assistance to Ukraine to fight the Russian invasion.In a sarcastic reference to a long table Putin used for his recent meetings with foreign leaders and Russian officials, Zelenskyy said: ""Sit down with me to negotiate, just not at 30 meters,"" adding, ""I don't bite. What are you afraid of?""During Thursday's news conference, Zelenskyy said that prospects for another round of talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiations don't seem promising, but emphasized the need to negotiate, adding that ""any words are more important than shots.""He said the world was too slow to offer support for Ukraine and prodded Western leaders to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine to deny access to the Russian warplanes. The U.S. and NATO allies have ruled out the move that would directly pit Russian and Western militaries.Zelenskyy charged that if the West remains reluctant to declare a no-fly zone over Ukraine, it should at least provide Kyiv with warplanes.The mayor of Enerhodar says Ukrainian forces are battling Russian troops for control of the city that has Europe's largest nuclear plant.The U.N. human rights chief says military operations in Ukraine are ""escalating further as we speak"" and warned of ""concerning reports"" of the use of cluster bombs.Michelle Bachelet said the Ukrainian town of Volnovakha in the eastern Donetsk region, where pro-Russian separatists seized territory in 2014, leading to a drawn-out military conflict, ""has been almost completely destroyed by shelling,"" with residents hiding in basements.She spoke Thursday during an ""urgent debate"" at the Human Rights Council, where country after country spoke out against Russia's invasion. Many Western envoys sported blue or yellow ties, scarves, jackets or ribbons on their lapels - colors of the Ukrainian flag.Delegates will vote Friday on a resolution that would create a three-person panel of experts to monitor human rights and report on rights abuses and violations in Ukraine.U.S. Ambassador Sheba Crocker said her country was ""deeply alarmed"" by reports of ""Russia's deployment of weapons such as cluster munitions and thermobarics against cities where innocent people are sheltering."" She urged countries to vote for the resolution.Chen Xu, China's ambassador, hailed diplomatic talks between Russia and Ukraine but said his country opposed efforts to ""politicize"" human rights. He said China would vote against the resolution.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office says a second round of talks with Russia about the war in Ukraine has begun in neighboring Belarus.A video released by Zelenskyy's office Thursday showed the informally dressed Ukrainian delegation walking into the meeting room where they shook hands with Russian delegates in suits and ties.The talks are aimed at stopping the fighting that has sent more than 1 million people fleeing over Ukraine's borders, but the two sides appeared to have little common ground.Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned Ukraine that it must quickly accept the Kremlin's demand for its ""demilitarization"" and declare itself neutral, formally renouncing its bid to join NATO. Putin has long contended that Ukraine's turn toward the West is a threat to Moscow, an argument he used to justify last week's invasion.The talks came as the Russian military made significant gains in the south of Ukraine as part of an effort to sever the country's connection to the Black and Azov seas.The U.N. refugee agency says 1 million people have fled Ukraine since Russia's invasion less than a week ago, an exodus without precedent in this century for its speed.The tally from UNHCR amounts to more than 2 percent of Ukraine's population on the move in under a week. The World Bank counted the population at 44 million at the end of 2020.The U.N. agency has predicted that up to 4 million people could eventually leave Ukraine but cautioned that even that projection could be revised upward.In an email, UNHCR spokesperson Joung-ah Ghedini-Williams wrote: ""Our data indicates we passed the 1M mark"" as of midnight in central Europe, based on counts collected by national authorities.On Twitter, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, wrote: ""In just seven days we have witnessed the exodus of one million refugees from Ukraine to neighboring countries.""A Russian official says troops have taken the Ukrainian port city of Kherson - a claim that the Ukrainian military denies.The city is under Russian soldiers' ""complete control,"" Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said Wednesday.He said that the city's civilian infrastructure, essential facilities and transport are operating as usual and that there are no shortages of food or essential goods.Konashenkov said talks between the Russian commanders, city administrations and regional authorities on how to maintain order in the city were underway Wednesday. The claims could not be immediately verified.A senior U.S. defense official said Wednesday that they have seen claims that the Russians have taken Kherson, but that the Ukrainian military is rejecting that claim.""Our view is that Kherson is very much a contested city at this point,"" said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to make military assessments.Ukrainian officials have reported a powerful explosion in central Kyiv, between the Southern Railway station and the Ibis hotel, an area near Ukraine's Defense Ministry.Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office told The Associated Press on Wednesday night that it was a missile strike.Officials said it wasn't immediately clear how damaging the strike was, whether there were any casualties or where exactly the missile hit.The Southern Railway station is one of two stations that make up the main passenger rail complex that thousands have used to flee the war over the past week. The two stations are connected by an overhead corridor that crosses over about a dozen tracks.The stations are about 3 kilometers (2 miles) from Maidan Nezalezhnosti, the square that was the site of huge protests in 2014 and 2004.A top aide for Russian President Vladimir Putin says Ukrainians are on their way to Belarus for talks that have been scheduled for Thursday.""As far as I know, the Ukrainian delegation has already departed from Kyiv, is en route ... We're expecting them tomorrow,"" Vladimir Medinsky, the head of the Russian delegation, told reporters Wednesday eveningAccording to Medinsky, the two sides agreed on the Brest region of Belarus, which borders Poland, as the site of the talks.Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office confirmed to The Associated Press that the delegation is on its way, but gave no details on the time of the arrival.Some 836,000 people have fled Ukraine since Russia launched an invasion there on Feb. 24, according to the latest figures from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). About 453,000 of them have gone to neighboring Poland, UNHCR said.As the war in Ukraine continues to unfold, one Bay Area nonprofit is working to help get both their volunteers and animals out of the country to safety.

With Russia’s unprovoked war against its Slavic neighbor midway through a third wrenching week, the Biden administration signaled Sunday that it would challenge any effort by Moscow to enlist Chinese help in evading the effects of Western sanctions that are pummeling Russia’s economy. High-level U.S.-Chinese talks were set Monday in Rome.

Amid the intensifying conflict, Ukrainian authorities on Sunday reported the death of an award-winning American journalist and documentary filmmaker, Brent Renaud, in Irpin, a suburb of Kyiv that has been the scene of intensive Russian bombardment. Another journalist who was with him was wounded, they said.

Anton Gerashchenko, an advisor to Ukraine’s interior minister, said Renaud “paid with his life” for documenting the suffering caused by the invasion.

In the Sunday morning attack near the Polish border, Ukraine said its air defenses downed most of the incoming missiles aimed at the base in the town of Yavoriv, known as the International Peacekeeping and Security Center. But at least eight hit the facility, igniting fires that raged for hours and setting off an intense search-and-rescue effort, said Maksym Kozytskyi, head of the Lviv regional administration, who confirmed the death toll.

Russia offered its own version of the strike, with its Defense Ministry claiming a far higher death toll — 180 — and saying the attack was aimed at foreign weaponry and “foreign mercenaries.” The two sides’ conflicting casualty claims could not be immediately reconciled.

The targeted base, some 11 miles from the Polish border, was used before the war for the training of Ukrainian troops by NATO forces, and is now a logistical hub and training center for arriving foreign volunteers.

No American troops were present at the center when it was hit, although U.S. forces regularly rotated through before the war, and were at the site as recently as “several weeks” ago, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said on ABC’s “This Week.”

The training center’s proximity to the frontier raises the specter that Russia may seek to block a crucial artery for both humanitarian supplies and shipments of weaponry. Russia said Saturday that it would consider Western weapons shipments to Ukraine a “legitimate target,” though without suggesting it would strike outside Ukraine’s borders.

As the base was under attack, air raid sirens wailed Sunday in the major metropolis of Lviv, about 25 miles to the southeast, which has become a refuge and a transit point for those seeking to escape spiraling bombardment in the country’s north, south and east. A booming voice on loudspeakers urged: “Citizens! Seek shelter!”

Lviv residents were told to turn on radios for news updates, and switch off gas and electrical connections to prevent fires. Some people hurried back to their homes or to other shelter when the sirens sounded, though many continued taking their morning coffee in the open air, or walking about on the cobblestoned streets of the city center.

“People are definitely getting more stressed,” said Alex Liashch, 35, an IT worker interviewed in central Rynok Square. “The war is coming here too.”

On the war’s 18th day, the strike on the training base came against the backdrop of a devastating Russian assault on Ukrainian cities and towns, which has brought invading forces closer to the outskirts of the capital, Kyiv, and caused a dire humanitarian crisis in the besieged southern port of Mariupol. Authorities in Mariupol have been burying bodies in mass graves, and residents reported boiling water from puddles to drink.

The civilian toll continued to climb — but even those trying to track noncombatant fatalities acknowledge their estimates are surely low. On Sunday, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said at least 596 civilians have been killed since the start of the Russian onslaught, 43 of them children. At least 1,067 have been injured, it said.

Russian attacks on healthcare facilities are being singled out for particular condemnation. Three U.N. agencies issued a joint statement calling attacks on health infrastructure, patients and personnel “horrific” and “an act of unconscionable cruelty.”

Getting food and medical supplies to Mariupol — where local officials say more than 2,100 people have been killed, an estimate that could not be independently verified — is a crucial mission, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday. A humanitarian shipment remained more than 20 miles from the city, blocked for several days by bombardment, after trying repeatedly to reach Mariupol from the north.

“Today the key task is Mariupol,” Zelensky said in a video address.

With a Russian armored column only about 15 miles from Kyiv, the city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said a full-scale assault could come at any time. But Ukrainian officials say the Russians’ failure to breach the city more than two weeks after invading on Feb. 24 points to disorganization and poor planning on Russia’s part — and their own fierce determination to defend the capital.

“It’s not secret that the goal, the target, is Kyiv,” Klitschko told CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday, adding that Ukrainian defenders “destroyed the plans of Russians.”

U.S. officials also sounded the theme that Russia’s invasion has not gone as planned. National security advisor Jake Sullivan, interviewed on CNN, said Russian President Vladimir Putin was “frustrated by the fact that his forces are not making the kind of progress that he thought they would make against major cities, including Kyiv.”

As a result, he said, the Russian leader is “lashing out” at an expanded list of targets.

In the southern city of Mykolaiv, nine civilians were killed in a Russian airstrike Sunday, the regional governor, Vitaliy Kim, said in a video address. The Black Sea port has been under attack as Russia aims to seize Ukraine’s seacoasts to block vital maritime access.

The fighting has spurred an enormous refugee exodus, with more than 2.6 million people, mainly women and children, fleeing to neighboring countries. More than 1.5 million have arrived in Poland, which has appealed for more international help in caring for them.

Although there has been little visible sign of diplomatic progress — French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz both spoke Saturday with Putin and reported no breakthroughs — a top U.S. diplomat said there might be some movement in the offing.

Deputy Secretary of State Wendy R. Sherman said on “Fox News Sunday” that Russian diplomats were beginning to show willingness to enter into “real, serious” negotiations aimed at halting the fighting.

China has refrained from publicly criticizing Putin; the Biden administration appeared to be seeking ways to soften Beijing’s pro-Moscow stance. Sullivan, the national security advisor, is to meet Monday in Rome with Yang Jiechi, China’s top foreign policy official, the White House said Sunday, with Ukraine among the topics to be discussed.

Previewing that encounter, Sullivan said in his CNN interview that Beijing has already been told “directly, privately” that the United States would not “allow there to be a lifeline” to Russia from any country to help it evade sanctions.

The Kremlin has demanded that Ukraine renounce future attempts to join NATO, demilitarize and acknowledge Russian sovereignty over the Crimean peninsula, which Russia seized in 2014. Ukraine has resisted on all counts, and demanded an immediate halt to fighting.

On the ground, signs pointed to a widening zone of conflict, spreading westward. In Ivano-Frankivsk, in the country’s west, Mayor Ruslan Martsinkiv said in a Facebook post Sunday that Russian missiles had targeted the city airport for a third time. Last week, Russian forces struck Lutsk airfield,

roughly 70 miles from the Polish border.

Sunday’s strike on the military training base prompted warnings from Ukrainian officials about the potential for the conflict spilling over into the territory of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Kozytskyi, head of the Lviv regional administration, wrote on a Telegram channel that bombardment “is approaching the borders of NATO countries.”

Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi directly addressed President Biden and the NATO chief in warning of prospects for a spillover. “Joe Biden, Jens Stoltenberg, do you understand that war is closer than you imagine?” he wrote on Facebook. “Russia is already on your border.”

NATO forces are not involved in fighting inside Ukraine, and the Biden administration is resolutely avoiding steps that could spark direct confrontation with Russian forces, such as a no-fly zone that Zelensky has repeatedly pleaded be created.

Ukraine also telegraphed disappointment that a proposed deal under which Poland would have transferred Russian-made fighter jets to NATO, for passing on to Ukraine, was nixed by the U.S. because it was seen as a potential spark for direct conflict between Russia and NATO. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, interviewed on CBS, on Sunday urged the United States and allies to supply “all the weapons necessary.”

“We need more planes. This is the most pressing issue,” he said. “We are ready to fight, but we need proper equipment to do so.”

In an ominous sign of how Russia intends to deal with areas that fall under its control, Russia appointed an “acting” mayor in the southern city of Melitopol to replace the city’s defiantly anti-occupation mayor, Ivan Fedorov, who was arrested and taken away last week after helping to organize protests against the invasion.

The Russian appointee, Galina Danilchenko, issued a video statement Sunday telling residents of the city that they needed to adjust to “the new reality” of Russian occupation.

Sunday brought a new peace appeal from Pope Francis, who has called for an immediate halt to the Russian invasion.

“In the name of God, let the cry of the suffering people be heard, and let the bombings and attacks stop,” the pontiff said, addressing crowds assembled in St. Peter’s Square. “In the name of God, I ask you, stop this massacre.”

Reports: Russia requests Chinese military support

US officials was quoted by media outlets, including the Financial Times, the Washington Post and the New York Times, as saying that Moscow had asked Beijing for military equipment since it invaded Ukraine on February 24.

The spokesperson for China's embassy in Washington, Liu Pengyu, responded to the reports by saying, ""I've never heard of that.""

Pengyu told reporters that the situation in Ukraine was ""disconcerting"" and that China's priority was to prevent it from ""escalating or even getting out of control.""

The reports came hours after the White House warned Beijing would face severe ""consequences"" if it helps Moscow evade sanctions.

Instagram now blocked in Russia

Social network app Instagram is now blocked in Russia following similar bans on Facebook and Twitter.

This was confirmed by the NetBlocks cybersecurity watchdog and Russian Instagram users early on Monday.

Russian media regulator Roskomnadzor announced the step on Friday, saying it would come into effect on Sunday at midnight. The regulator justified the measure saying that calls for violence against Russian citizens were being made from the network.

The step follows a decision by Meta, the company that owns Instagram, to allow for calls for violence against Russian troops.

In a Sunday statement published by Russian news agency TASS, Roskomnadzor pointed out that Russia has its own social network platforms such as Vkontakte and Odnoklassniki, and encouraged users to find ""new ways of communicating"" after losing access to Instagram.

Chechen leader Kadyrov says he traveled to Ukraine

Ramzan Kadyrov, leader of Russia's Chechnya region, said on Sunday that he had traveled to Ukraine to meet with Chechen troops.

Chechen television channel Grozny posted a video on its Telegram channel that showed Kadyrov discussing military operations with Chechen troops, which they said took place 7 km from Kyiv.

Chechen fighters have been in Ukraine since 2014, when they entered in support of the pro-Russian secessionist regions in eastern Ukraine. They have also been involved in Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine since February 24.

UK: Ukraine isolated from international maritime trade

The British Defence Ministry said Russian naval forces had established a ""distant blockade of Ukraine's Black Sea Coast"" in a Sunday intelligence update. It added that this effectively isolates Ukraine from international maritime trade.

The ministry said that Russian naval forces are continuing to conduct missile strikes throughout Ukraine.

Russia has already conducted one amphibious landing in the Sea of Azov, according to the ministry, and ""could look to conduct further such operations in the coming weeks.""

Ukraine, Russia negotiators to talk again on Monday

Cease-fire talks between Russia and Ukraine are ongoing via video-link and would continue on Monday, said Ukrainian delegate Mykhailo Podolyak.

Previously, Podolyak and Russian negotiator Leonid Slutsky both confirmed there was progress and that results could materialize in the coming days.

Report: Ukraine using facial recognition software Clearview AI

Ukraine has begun using Clearview AI, a facial recognition developed by a US startup, as a tool to identify Russian assailants and victims of the ongoing Russian invasion.

Clearview AI [Artificial Intelligence] told the Reuters new agency it has provided the tool to Ukraine's Defense Ministry.

Ukraine gets free access to the platform's search engine for faces, which can let authorities vet people of interest at checkpoints, among other uses. However, the details on how Ukraine is utilizing the technology were not immediately known.

Clearview's founder and CEO Hoan Ton-That said his platform has more than 2 billion images from the Russian social media service VKontakte at its disposal, out of a database of over 10 billion photos.

However, critics have warned that facial recognition is not yet 100% accurate, which could lead to people being wrongly identified. Clearview has been facing lawsuits in the US for allegedly violating people's privacy by using their images from the web.

Zelenskyy calls on software giants to step up Russia boycott

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on Microsoft, SAP and Oracle to stop offering support for their products in Russia.

In a tweet, Zelenskyy called out the tech giants, saying there can be ""no 'half' decisions or 'halftones'! [grey areas] There is only black and white, good or evil!""

Last week, Microsoft and SAP said they would stop sales of their products and services in Russia, while Oracle suspended its operations in the country.

However, Zelenskyy was referring to the support for products delivered remotely, via software updates and international help desks. It is unclear whether these services have been suspended.

Kremlin: Too early to confirm Putin-Zelenskyy meeting

At the talks between Moscow and Kyiv, negotiators were also discussing the possibility a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Kremlin said.

Moscow is not ruling out the idea, according to Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov.

However, ""we need to understand what should be the result and what will be discussed at this meeting,"" the spokesman was quoted as saying but the Interfax news agency.

Peskov told the agency it was too early to discuss the outcome of the efforts to set up a meeting.

Earlier on Sunday, both sides signaled cease-fire talks were making headway.

Moscow also said talks would continue on Monday by video link.

IMF: Russia could default on foreign debt

The head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Kristalina Georgieva said Russia is at risk of a deep recession that might make it unable to pay its debts.

""We no longer think of Russian default as improbable,"" Georgieva said in an interview with US broadcaster CBS.

As well as targeting key Kremlin figures and Russian oligarchs, many of the punitive measures will likely cripple Russia's financial system.

The measures helped send the rouble crashing against other currencies, which has already ""significantly diminished"" the purchasing power of the Russian people, Georgieva added.

The Russian central bank's foreign exchange reserves are largely blocked and servicing government debt has become increasingly complicated.

Last week, Morgan Stanley said a Russian default could come as early as next month.

Hundreds arrested at anti-war protests across Russia

More than 800 people were detained during peace rallies across Russia.

OVD-Info, which monitors arrests during protests, said police had held 817 people during demonstrations in 37 cities.

There was a heavy police presence at central Moscow locations including Manezhnaya Square near the Kremlin, with officers carrying demonstrators away to waiting police vans, in footage posted by Russian media.

Protesters risk fines and possible prison sentences by taking to the streets against what Moscow calls a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.

The number of people protesting appeared to be far fewer than a week ago. Over 14,000 people have been detained across Russia since the invasion started on February 24, according to OVD-Info.

Kyiv: Broken power line at Chernobyl repaired

Ukraine says it has fixed a broken power line to the Chernobyl power plant, which has been seized by Russian troops.

Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said that ''heroes'' from the national power grid company managed to restore the connection.

In 1986, the now-decommissioned facility in northern Ukraine was the scene of the worst nuclear meltdown in history that killed hundreds and spread a radioactive cloud west across Europe.

Nowadays, outside power is directed into the facility to run pumps which keep spent nuclear fuel cool and prevent radiation leaks.

The UN's atomic watchdog said the broken line had ""no critical impact on safety.""

But there were concerns when Russia seized control of Chernobyl that Moscow may attempt to sabotage the facility.

Mariupol evacuation delayed once again

A humanitarian convoy carrying aid, along with evacuation buses, once again failed to reach the besieged port city of Mariupol due to Russian shelling, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on national TV.

""The column has stayed in (the Russian-occupied city of) Berdiansk, and will tomorrow again attempt to reach Mariupol,” she said.

Vereshchuk said more than 140,000 civilians were evacuated from other conflict zones, including several thousand from towns close to the capital Kyiv.

The International Committee of the Red Cross has warned that Mariupol faces ""a worst-case scenario"" if the warring parties don't urgently reach a ""concrete humanitarian agreement.""

The port city of around half a million has been under siege since early this month.

Pro-Russian protest held in Belgrade

A far-right group has staged a protest in Serbia's capital in support of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Several dozen vehicles flying Serbian and Russian flags took part in the ""ride in support of Russia"" convoy through the central streets of Belgrade. The letters Z and V used by Russian forces on their vehicles in the conflicts in Ukraine were visible on the vehicles.

Despite formally seeking EU membership, Serbia has refused to join international sanctions against its traditional ally Russia. However, it did vote in favor of the UN resolution condemning Moscow's aggression.

Meanwhile, Serbia's president said AirSerbia will reduce its flights to Moscow, two weeks after it doubled its service to the Russian capital and introduced larger aircraft to cater to the increased demand.

Beside some Turkish carriers, AirSerbia is the only European airline that has kept on flying to Russia since the international flight ban was announced.

Russia confirms attack on Ukrainian military facility

Russia said its forces hit a military training facility in western Ukraine, near the Polish border.

Defense ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov said the strike at the Yavoriv base had killed ""up to 180 foreign mercenaries"" and a ""large amount of foreign weapons were destroyed.""

The statement could not be independently verified.

A Ukrainian regional governor said 35 people were killed and 134 wounded in the attack, which involved more than 30 Russian cruise missiles.

Mariupol officials say death toll has almost doubled in the besieged city

More than 2,100 residents of Ukraine's city of Mariupol have been killed since hostilities began, the local authorities have said.

""As of today, 2,187 Mariupol residents have died from attacks by Russia,"" the city council posted on Telegram, raising the toll by almost 1,000 since Wednesday, when they said 1,207 civilians had died in the first nine days of the siege.

These numbers could not be independently verified.

""People have been in a difficult situation for 12 days. There is no electricity, water or heating in the city. There is almost no mobile communication. The last reserves of food and water are running out,"" the council said.

Russian forces have continued to shell non-military targets in the southern port city and several attempts at civilian evacuations have failed due to the fighting.

Taking Mariupol and other ports on the Azov Sea could allow Russia to establish a land corridor to Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.

Russia, Ukraine both speak of progress in cease-fire talks

Russian and Ukrainian officials gave their most optimistic assessments yet of progress on cease-fire talks, suggesting there could be positive results within days.

""We will not concede in principle on any positions,"" Ukrainian negotiator and presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said in a video posted online. He added that the Kremlin now understands this and ""is already beginning to talk constructively.""

""I think that we will achieve some results literally in a matter of days,"" he said.

Russia's Interfax news agency cited a Russian delegate, Leonid Slutsky, as saying the talks had made substantial progress.

""According to my personal expectations, in the coming days this progress may grow into a joint position of both delegations, into documents for signing,"" Slutsky said.

Neither side indicated what the scope of any agreement might be.

""We have part of our gold and foreign exchange reserves in the Chinese currency, in yuan. And we see what pressure is being exerted by western countries on China in order to limit mutual trade with China. Of course, there is pressure to limit access to those reserves,"" Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said.

Missile attack near Lviv

An area outside the major western Ukrainian city of Lviv was targeted by a missile attack early Sunday.

Eight missiles are believed to have been fired at Ukraine's Center for International Peacekeeping and Security, according to Lviv's Regional Military Administration on Telegram. The center is located in Yavoriv, not far from the Polish border and some 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of Lviv.

Lviv regional governor Maksym Kozytskyy said on Telegram that 35 people have died in the strike and a further 134 were injured.

The strike on the military base could possibly be a Russian message intended for NATO. The US and other NATO countries previously conducted training exercises with the Ukrainian military at the center called Rapid Trident 21, according to the US Army website.

A Ukrainian general cited by the US army website said the Rapid Trident 21 exercises held at the Yavoriv center were ""not just another stage of military skills improvement, but also an important step towards Ukraine's European integration.""

Ukraine's defense minister said in a tweet that ""foreign instructors"" work at the training center. A NATO official told Reuters news agency that there was no alliance personnel at the base.

NATO chief warns against 'possible' Russian plan to use chemical weapons

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg expects a further intensification of the fighting and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, he told the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag.

He said Ukrainians were resisting Russian forces with courage and determination, but the coming days could get worse.

Stoltenberg also dismissed recent ""absurd claims"" by Moscow that the US was secretly operating laboratories in Ukraine to make chemical and biological weapons.

""Now that these false allegations have been made, we must remain vigilant, because it is possible that Russia itself could be conducting missions with chemical weapons under this tissue of lie,"" he said.

He also rejected calls for NATO to impose and enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine. ""That could mean a direct confrontation and escalation. We need to end this war, not let it expand,"" he added.

As a message to Russian President Vladimir Putin, he said: ""End this war, withdraw all your forces back and commit to diplomacy.""

Zelenskyy warns of new pro-Russia 'pseudo republics' in Ukraine

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed fellow Ukrainians in an online speech and reiterated their right to live in their land on their own terms.

Zelenskyy also said Russian forces would create new people's republics in captured territories, similar to those operating in Donetsk and Luhansk since 2014. Moscow recognized the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk ""people's republics"" immediately before its invasion of Ukraine.

""The occupiers on the territory of the Kherson region are trying to repeat the sad experience of the formation of pseudo republics,"" Zelenskyy said.

""They are blackmailing local leaders, putting pressure on deputies, looking for someone to bribe,"" he added.

Zelenskyy said such ""pseudo republics"" would end up being isolated from the rest of the world and face poverty, crime and exodus.

Zelenskyy said the withdrawal of IT professionals, businesses and artists from Russia was the fate that awaited Donetsk and Luhansk as well.

Towns and villages in the Kherson region have been under occupation by Russian troops since the first days of the war.

Urging Ukrainians to continue their fight, he said they would regain what is theirs. ""Ukraine will not forget. Ukraine will find and prosecute,"" he said.

Zelenskyy said the agreed-upon humanitarian corridors worked and that aid would be arriving in Mariupol on Sunday.
