Those statements came after the White House rejected Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Maria Zakharova’s claim that the U.S. was working with Ukraine to develop chemical and biological weapons to use against Russian forces.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki this week condemned Russia’s actions as an “obvious ploy” in order to justify its attack on Ukraine, and Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby called Russia’s claims “a bunch of malarkey.” Kirby leaned into that message again on Friday.

“We’re watching this very, very closely,” Kirby said on MSNBC. “[It’s] an absurd claim that we are helping Ukraine develop bioweapons. That’s just not true. It’s laughable. But that they would use such a claim for some sort of pretextual event in the future, that’s something we’re concerned about.”

U.S. and Ukrainian officials have expressed concern this week that the narrative advanced by Zakharova is an indication Russia could be planning to use the weapons against Ukrainians or as part of a false flag operation. The State Department noted on Twitter this week that the U.S. does not have chemical and biological weapons labs in Ukraine. The U.S. does support public health labs in Ukraine, which help to provide support to the government’s health department on efforts such as studying diseases like Covid-19.

U.S. involvement with these labs goes back to the Cooperative Threat Program, created by the U.S. in 1991, which was formed to help secure and eliminate what was left of the former Soviet Union’s biochemical weapons program in countries like Ukraine. Russia in recent years has spread false information about U.S. biological weapon research, and China has repeatedly endorsed the propaganda — claiming these labs are a cover-up for secret U.S. bioweapons program.

Russia doubled down on those claims this week, ultimately calling for an emergency United Nations Security Council meeting on Friday. The meeting was called just 24 hours after Russia’s Defense Ministry falsely claimed it found “U.S. secret military biological projects in Ukraine.”

At the Security Council meeting on Friday, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield accused Russia of using the U.N. forum to legitimize its disinformation campaign. In line with the U.S. strategy to combat Russia’s information war with public declarations about Moscow’s intentions, Thomas-Greenfield said the U.S. didn’t veto the meeting so the body could “expose Russia’s lies.”

“We believe Russia could use chemical or biological agents for assassinations as part of a staged or false flag incident or to support tactical military operations. From the beginning, our strategy to counter Russia’s tactics has been to share what we know with the world transparently. And candidly, we have been right more than often — more than we’d like to,” Thomas-Greenfield said. “We’re not going to let Russia get away with lying to the world or staining the integrity of the security council by using this forum as a venue for legitimizing Putin’s violence.”",https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/11/biden-says-russia-will-pay-severe-price-if-it-uses-chemical-weapons-in-ukraine-00016546
1,fa2b0027-c6a5-4638-bb87-5d97688d2b1d,"['Abc News', 'Shannon K. Crawford', 'March']",,"While President Joe Biden has repeated that the U.S. will not send troops to Ukraine to fight Russia, he warned Friday that ""Russia would pay a severe price"" if it used chemical weapons in Ukraine, raising questions over what those consequences would look like.

Biden announced new trade sanctions on Russia Friday and reiterated his position from the White House that ""we will not fight a war against Russia in Ukraine,"" but so far, economic sanctions from the international community have not stopped Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion.

The Biden administration has warned this week that Putin could use chemical or biological weapons, but officials have repeatedly refused to say if a chemical attack would cross a red line or whether they have intelligence that an attack is imminent.

""Your White House has said that -- that Russia may use chemical weapons, or create a false flag operation to use them,"" a reporter asked the president Friday. ""What evidence have you seen showing that, and would the U.S. have a military response if Putin does launch a chemical weapons attack?""

""I'm not going to speak about intelligence,"" Biden said, ""but Russia would pay a severe price if they used chemical weapons.""

It was the only question he took before leaving the room.

White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates, briefing reporters on Air Force One after the remarks, echoed Biden that there would be ""severe consequences,"" but also declined to go into specifics about what those would look like for Russia.

""They have used chemical weapons, which again, they are the only country in the mix here who possesses those, in Syria, and time again, we have warned about this particular pretext, and so it is something that we are being attentive to,"" he said. ""Russia is the only country in this equation with a chemical and biological weapons program in violation of international law.""

And Pentagon press secretary John Kirby, asked Friday about a Russian false flag to justify Russian chemical weapons use, would only say, ""We don't have firm indications right now,"" but that it's something they're watching for.

""I don't want to get into intelligence assessments,"" he said, explaining the U.S. was trying to preempt any Russian pretext.

""One, this is a country that has a reputation for using those kinds of weapons on people, and we know they have a program,"" Kirby added. ""And two, we continue to watch for the potential -- and I want to stress the word potential -- potential that they could be banging this drum with the intent of creating some sort of false-flag event, that they could use it as an excuse to escalate the conflict even more.""

Russia escalates false chemical weapons claims

Russia, meanwhile, has doubled down on false claims that the U.S. is helping Ukraine develop chemical or biological weapons, bringing the accusations to the world's stage at the U.N. Security Council Friday in an emergency session.

""I can foresee what the reaction will be from our Western colleagues, who I am sure are going to be saying now that all of this information is fake and Russian propaganda, but this is self-delusion and I do not think this will be helpful to the European people in case there are outbreaks in Ukraine and neighboring states,"" said U.N. Ambassador for Russia Vassily Nebenzya.

Russia has not supplied any credible information to support their claims, but a web of disinformation spread the conspiracy theory this week -- heightening concern among U.S. and Ukrainian officials that Russia itself may be planning to deploy chemical or biological weapons against Ukrainian targets or as part of a so-called ""false flag"" operation.

""I will say this once: Ukraine does not have a biological weapons program, and there are no Ukrainian biological weapons laboratories supported by the United States. Not near Russia's border or anywhere,"" rebutted U.N. Ambassador for Linda Thomas-Greenfield. ""Ukraine owns and operates its own public health laboratory infrastructure,"" she continued. ""It has absolutely nothing to do with biological weapons.""

Reports of Russia sending chem-bio suits to Ukraine

A senior administration official told ABC News Chief Global Affairs Correspondent Martha Raddatz that aside from the so-called ""false flag operations"" -- in which Russians are accusing Ukraine and the U.S. of a possible chemical or biological attack -- the U.S. is receiving reports that the Russians are starting to bring in chem-bio suits to Ukraine.

""We believe it is an ominous sign they are possibly doing it for cover,"" the official said of the Russian pretext.

The official also said that as much as one-fifth of the Russian force is now ""inoperable"" -- meaning they are either dead, wounded or don't have the support or equipment needed to continue right now -- but there are still fears forces could take Kyiv as it wears down Ukraine.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a televised address late Thursday, that Russia falsely accusing Ukraine of preparing for a chemical attack ""makes me really worried, because we've been repeatedly convinced if you want to know Russia's plans, look at what Russia accuses others of.""

Thomas Greenfield added Friday, ""In fact, it is Russia that has long maintained a biological weapons program in violation of international law. It is Russia that has a well-documented history of using chemical weapons. It is Russia who is the aggressor here,"" she said, pointing out the Kremlin's recent history of poisoning political enemies and supporting the Assad regime's use of chemical weapons in Syria.

Pentagon pushes back against Russia's false claim

A senior defense official said Friday that despite the barrage of claims from China and Russia, the U.S. is not helping Ukraine create any chemical or biological weapons.

""We have nothing to hide, and the only reason why we elevated the discussion is because the Russians and the Chinese decided to lie about it -- just flat out lie,"" the official added. But they would not offer any U.S. intelligence assessment of the likelihood of Putin deploying chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine.

""We know that the Russians have had -- and we assess that they still have -- a sophisticated chemical and biological weapons program. I'm not going to talk about intelligence assessments about what they may do with that program or what, if any, designs they might have on Ukraine in that regard,"" the official said.

A Pentagon official told reporters Thursday it has ""picked up indications that the Russians could be making these claims -- these false claims -- about us and Ukrainian work in biodefense as a way of creating a pretext of their own, to perhaps use these kinds of agents in an attack.""

Pressed on what ""indications"" they were referring to, they added, ""I have to leave it with you with indications, and [I'm] not going to be at liberty to go in more detail than that today.""

Amid the looming threat, the World Health Organization has urged Ukraine to now destroy pathogen samples because Russia's war in the country risks an ""accidental spill.""

""This is part of us providing public health advice to every country to try to ensure there is a minimized risk of any harm to population because of any possible accidental leak of pathogens,"" said WHO spokesperson Tarik Jašarević said from Lviv, Ukraine.

""I'm not going to speak about the intelligence, but Russia will pay a severe price if they use chemicals,"" Biden told CNN's Arlette Saenz following remarks announcing further economic moves against Russia.

While the US has so far not presented any evidence that Russia plans to use chemical weapons in Ukraine, the White House -- most notably, press secretary Jen Psaki -- has warned that the weapons could be used in the conflict.

Russia could use chemical weapons in Ukraine or manufacture a ""false flag"" operation that uses them, Psaki said Wednesday. The press secretary, slamming what she called false claims from Russia that the US is developing chemical weapons in Ukraine, tweeted, ""Now that Russia has made these false claims, and China has seemingly endorsed this propaganda, we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them. It's a clear pattern.""

She also noted Russia's ""long and well-documented track record of using chemical weapons"" as well as its pattern of ""accusing the West of the very violations that Russia itself is perpetrating.""

The US government has previously found that the Russian government used chemical weapons in both the 2020 poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny and in 2018 against Sergei and Yulia Skripal in England. Both determinations by the US led to sanctions under the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act, which requires the President to impose economic and diplomatic sanctions if a country is found to have used chemical weapons. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned earlier this year of the possibility of Russia carrying out a fake or real chemical weapons attack as a manufactured pretext for an invasion into Ukraine. But his comments came before Russia's full invasion began.

Additionally, the US has said tha t Syria's Bashar al-Assad, whose regime is supported by Russia, has used chemical weapons on its people dozens of times during the war there.

When asked about her tweets at Thursday's press briefing, Psaki declined to speculate on hypotheticals regarding the US response if Russia were to use chemical weapons in Ukraine.

""Well, they have a large biological and chemical weapons program. So it's a pattern, but they also have the capacity. While I'm not going to get into specific intelligence, we look at all of those factors,"" Psaki told reporters.

She continued, ""So the objective (of the tweets) was to make clear the inaccuracy of the information and the misinformation they're trying to put out and make clear to the world that they not only have the capacity, they have a history of using chemical and biological weapons, and that in this moment, we should have our eyes open for that possibility.""

She declined to speculate on whether there is any sign of imminent use of chemical weapons by Russia in Ukraine.

Pressed by CNN's Kaitlan Collins on whether there will be a military response from the US if Russia were to conduct a chemical weapons attack, Psaki said the current US posture has not changed.

""I'm not going to get into hypotheticals. What we're saying right now is they have the capacity and the capabilities. I'm also not going to get into intelligence. But the President's intention of sending US military to fight in Ukraine against Russia has not changed,"" she said.

Biden emphasized later Friday that the US will not send ground troops into Ukraine.

""We will not fight the third world war in Ukraine,"" Biden said during a speech in Philadelphia to the House Democratic Caucus.

He added, ""I want to be clear though, we are going to make sure that Ukraine has the weapons to defend themselves of an invading Russian force. And we will send money and food aid to save Ukrainians lives. We're going to welcome Ukrainian refugees with open arms if in fact they come all the way here.""

During the speech, Biden also thanked Democratic House members for their support of Ukraine, noting he spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday for about an hour. Biden added that he speaks to the Ukrainian President ""almost daily."" Biden stressed how important it is that the US and its allies move together on any moves to counteract the Kremlin.

""I know I've occasionally frustrated you, but more important than us moving when we want to is making sure all of NATO is together, is together -- they have different vulnerabilities than we do,"" Biden said.

White House stops short of saying Russia is committing war crimes

The White House said Friday that there are ""strong indications"" that Russia is committing war crimes in Ukraine, stopping short of a declaration, which legally requires an investigation before such an assessment can be made.

""We have all seen the devastating images coming out of Ukraine and are appalled by Russia's brutal tactics. Pregnant women on stretchers, apartment buildings shelled, families killed while seeking safety from this terrible violence. We are also seeing reports of other types of potential abuses, including sexual and gender-based violence,"" White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates told reporters aboard Air Force One.

He added, ""These are disgusting attacks. Civilian casualties are increasing. If Russia is intentionally targeting civilians, that would be a war crime. And as we are all seeing on live television, evidence is mounting and we are documenting it as it takes place. There are strong indications that this is occurring and that the heinous way Russia is prosecuting this war will result in war crimes.""

US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield became the highest-ranking US official to say that actions committed by Russia against the Ukrainian people constitute war crimes, telling the BBC Thursday, ""They constitute war crimes; there are attacks on civilians that cannot be justified by any -- in any way whatsoever.""

Other Biden administration officials have not gone as far as to declare outright that Russia has committed war crimes -- violations of international laws of armed conflict -- and instead have pointed to ""credible reports"" that such crimes have been carried out and their support for investigations into Moscow's actions.

Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday referenced ""atrocities"" committed by the Russians and said that the UN should investigate the allegations of Russian war crimes. On Friday, Harris said, ""We are clear that any intentional attack or targeting of civilians is a war crime. Period.""

Bates said the US supports the human rights activists, civil society and independent media documenting, collecting and exposing evidence of possible war crimes, human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law.

The US will share that evidence with allies and partners and will ""support accountability"" with every tool available, ""including prosecutions when appropriate,"" Bates said.

President Joe Biden on Friday vowed that Russia would ""pay a severe price"" if it used chemical weapons in its war against Ukraine, a warning that came as other Western leaders expressed fear that such an attack could soon happen.

""I'm not going to speak about the intelligence, but Russia would pay a severe price if it used chemical weapons,"" Biden said in response to a reporter's question after remarks at the White House.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and top White House officials have called out Russia for seeking to concoct a narrative that the US and Ukraine are scheming to use chemical weapons. Western officials pointed out that Russia previously provided cover for or defended its chemical attacks with similar rationales.

""They start saying that there are chemical weapons that have been stored by their opponents or by the Americans,"" Johnson told Sky News on Thursday. ""And so when they themselves deploy chemical weapons, as I fear they may, they have as a sort of a maskirovka, a fake story ready to go.""

The Kremlin has denied any suggestion that it's preparing a chemical-weapons attack. The Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry continued Friday to accused Ukraine and the US of gearing up for such an attack.

""Radical Ukrainian groups under the control of the representatives of American special services have prepared several potential scenarios of the use of toxic chemicals in order to carry out various types of provocations,"" the ministry said in a statement.

Russia was supposed to have destroyed its chemical-weapons stockpile. During the Cold War, the US and Russia amassed the world's largest stockpiles of some of the most brutal weapons. But after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the two former adversaries worked together to eliminate their arsenals.

The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons certified in 2017 that Russia had destroyed its declared stockpile that once reached a staggering 40,000 metric tons of chemical agents like mustard gas, VX, and sarin. The latter two nerve agents disrupt the human body's nervous system, which can lead to permanent damage or death. The US and experts believe that Russia still maintains a small secretive stockpile.

""The United States assesses that Russia maintains an offensive BW (bioweapons) program and is in violation of its obligations under Articles I and II of the BWC (Biological Weapons Convention),"" the State Department wrote in its 2021 edition of its annual report on arms control and compliance. The US has said that Russia's failure to comply with the convention that it signed in 1975 ""has been of concern for many years.""

The 2018 poisoning of the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in London offered evidence that Russia maintained a chemical-weapons program. The United Kingdom said it assessed the Kremlin ordered the attack and used Novichok, a Soviet-era nerve agent, as the poison of choice.

Daryl G. Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association, said Russia's continuing program made it ""possible"" for the Kremlin to stage an attack just as the West feared it might. He said the war in Ukraine was already brutal but the deployment of chemical weapons would make for a ghastly scene.

""These are weapons of potentially mass and clearly indiscriminate destruction,"" Kimball said in an interview. ""Any death is horrendous, but nerve agents, choking agents, blistering agents — they produce acute suffering in the victim. A bullet can kill very quickly, but chemical weapons produce partially difficult deaths and injuries.""

Biden's warning came as he announced that the West would expand its crippling sanctions on the Russian economy by banding together to deprive Moscow of its favored trade status, a way nations ensure smooth trade relationships with minimal or no barriers like tariffs or import controls. The president also said the US was banning the exportation of luxury goods to Russia and the importation of key Russian goods like seafood, diamonds, and vodka.",https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-vows-russia-will-pay-a-severe-price-if-it-uses-chemical-weapons-2022-3

Russia had hastily called a Friday morning U.N. Security Council meeting to discuss in open debate what it called ""the military biological activities of the US on the territory of Ukraine"" — leading the Biden administration to immediately denounce it as a ""false flag effort.""

""This is exactly the kind of false flag effort we have warned Russia might initiate to justify a biological or chemical weapons attack,"" Olivia Dalton, spokesperson for the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, told CBS News.

The Friday meeting was announced by Russia's Deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyansky in a tweet linking to the Russian Ministry of Defense, claiming analysis of documents about U.S. ""military biological activities"" in Ukraine, with a half-dozen documents attached with graphs and charts.

U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield told Security Council members on Friday that Russia asked for the council meeting ""for the sole purpose of lying and spreading disinformation.""

""I will say this once: Ukraine does not have a biological weapons program, and there are no Ukrainian biological weapons laboratories supported by the United States. Not near Russia's borders, not anywhere,"" Thomas-Greenfield said.

Her comments came as Russia's Foreign Affairs Ministry claimed that Ukrainian groups under control of ""representatives of American special services have prepared several potential scenarios of the use of toxic chemicals in order to carry out various types of provocations,"" with the objective of accusing Russia of using chemical weapons against civilians.

The purported ""scenarios"" could include ""a diversion"" at a Ukrainian industrial chemical site ""involving the destruction of large-volume containers holding industrial chemicals,"" reads a statement on the ministry's website Friday. Another scenario involves destroying containers with toxic chemicals in ""highly populated areas,"" it said.

Washington had warned earlier this week that Russia could escalate the violence in its war in Ukraine with the use of biological or chemical weapons, or by claiming Ukrainian forces used them as a pretext.

""Russia has a well-documented history of using chemical weapons and has long maintained a biological weapons program in violation of international law,"" Dalton told CBS News. ""Russia also has a track record of falsely accusing the West of the very violations that Russia itself is perpetrating.""

At the U.N. meeting on Friday, Security Council members overwhelmingly debunked Russia's allegations.

U.K. Ambassador to the U.N. Barbara Woodward called the Russian allegations ""utter nonsense"" and said ""Russia has today brought into the Security Council a series of wild, completely baseless and irresponsible conspiracy theories.""

Others more generally cautioned against the use of banned weapons.

Under Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs Rosemary DiCarlo said the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) ""has received credible reports of Russian forces using cluster munitions, including in populated areas.""

""Indiscriminate attacks, including those using cluster munitions, which are of a nature to strike military objectives and civilians or civilian objects without distinction, are prohibited under international humanitarian law,"" DiCarlo said.

The U.N.'s High Representative for Disarmament, Izumi Nakamitsu, spoke about the ""worrying issue of safety and security of nuclear power plants in Ukraine,"" and she noted that safe operations procedures ""are reportedly not being implemented"" at Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhya – the two Ukrainian plants that the Russian government has occupied.

Albanian Ambassador Ferit Hoxha added to the chorus of nations that are worried that the ""allegations about weapons of mass destruction could serve as yet another pretext for Russia"" in its invasion of Ukraine.

Eyes were on China's U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun after Thomas-Greenfield said that China ""has been spreading disinformation in support of Russia's outrageous claims.""

China's envoy focused on the need for a ""political settlement"" but also made a point about the importance of the prohibition of the development and use of all weapons of mass destruction, including biological and chemical weapons, ultimately making its position clear: ""The concerns raised by Russia should be properly addressed.""

After the meeting, speaking to reporters, Thomas-Greenfield said: ""We believe the world is bearing witness to a war of Russian aggression, and no matter how much Russia tries, it can't change that. That's what today showed, and it continues to show that Russia is the aggressor here. No one else.""",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-un-meeting-alleging-us-military-biological-activities-in-ukraine-false-flag/
