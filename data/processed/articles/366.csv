Gas

Specialists of the GTS Operator of Ukraine localized fire at a section of the damaged main gas pipeline in Luhansk region and restored the normal gas supply regime for more than 100,000 residents of Luhansk region. The pipeline was damaged by enemy shelling on April 1, 2022. As a result, several gas distribution stations were shut down completely. A number of other settlements received gas under a temporary scheme ""from a container"". Thanks to the efforts of Gas Transmission System Operator of Ukraine specialists, a reliable gas transportation route has been restored for certain part of residents of Luhansk region who were receiving gas on a temporary basis. The situation with gas supply to the residents of Luhansk region due to the fighting remains difficult, part of the region - without gas supply due to damage to the main gas pipeline. However, the specialists of the GTS Operator of Ukraine continue to exert every effort to ensure reliable operation of the gas transmission system and to restore gas supply to the residents of Luhansk region.

International dimension and sanctions

Lithuania has completely stopped importing gas from russia since the beginning of April, becoming the first EU country to take such a step. Since the beginning of April, the Lithuanian gas transportation system has not imported gas from russia at all. Now all of Lithuania's gas needs are met by imports through the LNG terminal in Klaipeda. It is estimated that in the future this should be sufficient. If necessary, gas can also be pumped from Latvia, and from May 1 - through an interconnector with Poland.

The bodies of at least 20 civilian men have been found lying strewn across the street in the town of Bucha, northwest of Kyiv following the withdrawal of Russian forces from the area in shocking images released by AFP on Saturday.

The dead, all in civilian clothing, are found in a variety of awkward poses, some face down against the pavement, others facing upwards with mouths open.

""Three of them are tangled up in bicycles after taking their final ride, while others, with waxy skin, have fallen next to bullet-ridden and crushed cars,"" according to AFP journalists who accessed the town after it had been cut off for nearly a month.

One corpse can be seen with his hands tied behind his back with a white cloth.

The Mayor of Bucha, Anatoliy Fedoruk, said the dead civilians had received inhumane treatment at the hands of Russian forces.

""Corpses of executed people still line the Yabluska street in Bucha. Their hands are tied behind their backs with white 'civilian' rags, they were shot in the back of their heads. So you can imagine what kind of lawlessness they perpetrated here,"" Fedoruk told Reuters on Saturday.

Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said the bodies of the men found with hands tied, ""were shot dead by Russian soldiers,"" in a tweet on Saturday.

Podolyak added, ""these people were not in the military. They had no weapons. They posed no threat. How many more such cases are happening right now in the occupied territories?""

CNN has not been able to independently confirm the details around the men's deaths.

Russian forces withdrew from several towns near Kyiv in recent days after Moscow's bid to encircle the capital failed, with Ukraine declaring that Bucha had been ""liberated.""",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-04-2-22/index.html

Ukraine prosecutor-general says 410 civilian bodies found near Kyiv KYIV, Ukraine —Ukraine’s prosecutor-general says the bodies of 410 civilians have been removed from Kyiv-area towns that were recently retaken from Russian forces. Iryna Venediktova, Ukraine’s prosecutor-general, says on Facebook that the bodies were removed on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

Zelenskyy decries war atrocities in new address, saying, 'Evil will be punished' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy delivered his harshest rebuke yet Sunday as Russian forces retreated from the war-torn city of Bucha, Ukraine, leaving in their wake a mass of what appeared to be civilian fatalities. ""Today this appeal will be without congratulations. I do not want any extra words. Presidents do not usually record appeals like this. But today I have to say just that. To say after what opened in Bucha and our other cities, from which the occupiers were chased out. Hundreds of people were killed. Tortured, shot — civilians. Bodies on the streets. Mined territory,"" Zelenskyy said. ""The bodies of the dead were mined."" Zelenskyy switched from speaking Ukrainian and made a direct appeal in Russian, saying: ""I want every mother of every Russian soldier to see the bodies of the killed people in Bucha, in Irpin, in Hostomel. What did they do? Why were they killed? What did the man who was riding his bicycle down the street do? Why were ordinary civilians tortured to death in an ordinary peaceful city? Why were women strangled after their earrings were torn out of their ears? How could women be raped and killed in front of children? Their bodies were mocked even after death. Why did they crush the bodies of people with tanks? What did the Ukrainian city of Bucha do to your Russia? How did all this become possible?"" He added: ""Russian mothers! Even if you raised marauders, how did they also become executioners? You couldn't help but know what's inside your children. You could not help but notice that they are deprived of everything human. No soul. No heart. They killed deliberately and with pleasure."" Speaking again in Ukrainian, Zelenskyy said that ""evil will be punished"" and that he had created a ""special mechanism of justice"" in Ukraine to investigate and prosecute every crime of Russian occupiers in the country. ""The essence of this mechanism is the joint work of national and international experts: investigators, prosecutors and judges. This mechanism will help Ukraine and the world to bring to justice those who unleashed or in any way participated in this terrible war against the Ukrainian people and in crimes against our people,"" he said.

NATO chief: This is 'not a real withdrawal' NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Sunday said Russia is shifting its strategy in Ukraine, explaining that Putin's retreat from Kyiv is not a sign that he is withdrawing from the country. “What we see is not a real withdrawal,"" Stoltenberg said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday.

Russian naval forces block Ukraine's resupply by Black Sea, U.K. military intelligence says Russian naval forces continue to blockade the Ukrainian coast on the Black Sea and Sea of Azov, preventing resupply by sea, British military intelligence said Sunday.

""Reported mines within the Black Sea pose a serious risk to maritime activity,"" it added. The report said the origin of the mines was unclear and disputed, but their presence was almost certainly the result of Russian naval activity in the area, demonstrating how its invasion of Ukraine is affecting neutral and civilian interests.

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

How you can help: Here are ways those in the U.S. can help support the Ukrainian people as well as what people around the world have been donating.

Russia preventing Ukraine resupply by Black Sea: UK

The British ministry of defence has said Russian naval forces continue to blockade the Ukrainian coast on the Black Sea and Sea of Azov, preventing resupply by sea.

Russia retains the capability to attempt an amphibious landing, but such an operation is likely to be increasingly risky due to the time Ukrainian forces have had to prepare, the ministry said on Twitter.

It added that the presence of mines within the Black Sea was “almost certainly the result of Russian naval activity in the area, demonstrating how its invasion of Ukraine is affecting neutral and civilian interests”.

Russia increasing air activity in southeastern Ukraine: UK

The British Ministry of Defence says there has been a “concentration of Russian air activity in southeastern Ukraine” over the past week.

This is likely a result of Russia focusing its military operations in that area, the ministry said in its latest intelligence update.

It added that Ukraine continues to provide a significant challenge to Russian air and missile operations despite Russian efforts to diminish Ukrainian air defence capabilities.

“Russia’s inability to find and destroy air defence systems has seriously hampered their efforts to gain broad control of the air, which in turn has significantly affected their ability to support the advance of their ground forces on a number of fronts.”

“There is a world where we have six or seven sites in the UK” by 2050, Kwarteng told the newspaper.

Russia and Ukraine have held several rounds of negotiations, both in Turkey and by video conference.

Almost 300 buried in mass grave in Bucha, near Kyiv: Mayor

Almost 300 people have been buried in a mass grave in Bucha, discovered after the Ukrainian army retook control of the key town close to Kyiv.

Anatoly Fedoruk told Al Jazeera that the town’s streets remain littered with the bodies of at least 22 people killed by Russian forces. He said it had not been possible to collect the bodies yet, amid fears that Russian forces had booby-trapped the corpses.

“According to the mayor, [the dead people] were trying to escape to Ukrainian-held territory when, according to him, they were simply gunned down,” said Al Jazeera’s Rob McBride, reporting from Lviv in western Ukraine.

Ukraine says regained control of ‘whole Kyiv region’

Ukraine has regained control of “the whole Kyiv region” after Russian forces retreated from key towns near the Ukrainian capital, Deputy Defence Minister Ganna Maliar said.

“Irpin, Bucha, Gostomel and the whole Kyiv region were liberated from the invader,” Maliar said on Facebook.

All three towns lie northwest of Kyiv and have suffered heavy destruction since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24.

Ukraine presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said its troops have retaken more than 30 towns and villages since Russia pulled back from the area this week.
