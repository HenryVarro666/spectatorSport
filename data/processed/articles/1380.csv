1,2980da17-92ec-4302-8810-14c377720b82,[],2022-02-28 00:00:00,"Late yesterday the European Union announced an “unprecedented” step against Russian disinformation, saying it would ban Kremlin-based media outlets, Russia Today (aka RT) and Sputnik — extending measures targeting the country following president Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.

“The state-owned Russia Today and Sputnik, as well as their subsidiaries will no longer be able to spread their lies to justify Putin’s war and to saw division in our Union,” said the EU’s president, Ursula von der Leyen. “So we are developing tools to ban their toxic and harmful disinformation in Europe.”

Details on the EU’s planned ban on Russian state media content are still thin on the ground.

At the time of writing EU officials we’ve spoken to were unable to confirm whether or not the ban will extend to online platforms such as Google’s YouTube — where RT and Sputnik both have a number of channels, and the US platform hosts thousands of videos they upload for viewing on demand as well as enabling them to reach viewers via livestreaming.

However in the past few hours EU officials have been cranking up the public pressure on mainstream tech platforms on the disinformation issue.

Today the office of internal market commissioner Thierry Breton announced that both he and the values & transparency commissioner, Vera Jourova, had spoken to the CEOs of Google and YouTube urging them to step up efforts against Russian propaganda.

EU’s @ThierryBreton & @VeraJourova spoke with Google & YouTube CEOs, urged online platforms to step up efforts to address Russian war propaganda 👇#EUvsDisinfo 🇪🇺 🇺🇦 https://t.co/8d9hUk8Q8u — Lucía Caudet (@LuciaCaudet) February 28, 2022

On Saturday Google announced it had demonetized RT and other Russian-backed channels, meaning they can no longer receive ad revenue via its platforms or ad networks. But in a video call with the two tech CEOs Breton it reported to have said they need to go further, per Reuters.

“Freedom of expression does not cover war propaganda. For too long, content from Russia Today and other Russian state media has been amplified by algorithms and proposed as ‘recommended content’ to people who had never requested it,” the commissioner said in a statement after the call.

“War propaganda should never be recommended content — what is more, it should have no place on online platforms at all. I count on the tech industry to take urgent and effective measures to counter disinformation.”

The EU’s high commissioner for foreign affairs, Josep Borrell, was also asked for details of the ban by the BBC this morning and also declined to specify if it will apply online.

“We’ll do whatever we can to prevent them to disseminate [toxic content to] a European audience,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today program when questioned on how workable a ban would be, adding: “We have to try to cut them.”

He also aggressively rebutted a line of questions querying the consistency of the EU’s move vis-a-vis Western liberal democratic principles which center free speech — saying the two channels do not distribute free information but rather pump out “massive disinformation” and create an “atmosphere of hate” that he asserted is “against the freedom of thinking” and is “toxifying minds”.

“If you start telling lies all the time, if you create an atmosphere of hate this has to be forbidden,” Borrell added.

The EU’s previous proposals for dealing with online disinformation have largely focused on getting voluntary buy-in from the tech sphere, through a Code of Practice on disinformation. However it has been pressing for tougher action in recent years, especially around COVID-19 disinformation which presents a clear public safety danger.

But an out-and-out ban on media entities — even those clearly linked to the Kremlin — is a major departure from the usual Commission script.

Of the two sanctioned channels, Russia Today appears to garner the most eyeballs on YouTube — where its main channel has some 4.65M subscribers, although content produced by the state-backed media outlet can be found far more widely across the platform.

The channel’s marketing even claims it is “the most watched news network on YouTube” — with a touted 10BN+ views — which looks more than a little awkward for Google in the context of Putin’s land war in Europe.

We reached out to Google to ask if it intends to take further action against the Kremlin-backed media channels in light of the EU’s decision to ban them.

At the time of writing the company had not responded but we’ll update this report if it does.

While the Kremlin deploys the very thinly veiled camouflage of (claimed) media operations to launder its propaganda as professional news commentary, its infowars tactics are of course far more sprawling online — where multiple user generated platforms provide Putin with (essentially) limitless opportunities to pass his influence ops off as genuine public opinion by making his propaganda look like organic user generated content.

That means, even if pressure from the EU forces mainstream platforms like YouTube to ban RT and Sputnik it can’t hope to stop the Kremlin’s propaganda machine — it will just drive Russia to produce more less directly attributable propaganda, via sock puppet/fake accounts and the like.

And — notably — among the new sanctions that the EU announced at the weekend it added the notorious Russian troll factory, the Internet Research Agency, to the expanded list — along with its oligarch funder.

Although that took isn’t likely to be the only troll farm operating at Russia’s bidding, even if it is the most well known. Reports have long suggested Russian’s web brigade has used outsourcing tactics to try to better cover its manipulative tracks, for example.

In a small sign of some of the less immediately visible Kremlin-backed propaganda activity dialling up around the Ukraine war, Facebook’s parent company Meta put out an update today — saying the teams it has monitoring disinformation (aka “coordinated inauthentic behavior”, as Facebook terms it) have been on “high alert” since the invasion, and have taken down a network, of circa 40 accounts/Pages/Groups on Facebook and Instagram, being run out of Russia, which had been targeting people in Ukraine.

In a neat illustration of the malicious duality that can be applied to even disinformation reporting tools, Meta said the Russian network it identified had been reporting Ukrainians for violating its policies on coordinated inauthentic behavior — including by posing as independent news outlets.

“They ran websites posing as independent news entities and created fake personas across social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Telegram and also Russian Odnoklassniki and VK,” write Nathaniel Gleicher, Meta’s head of security policy, and David Agranovich, a director, threat disruption.

“They were operated from Russia and Ukraine and targeted people in Ukraine across multiple social media platforms and through their own websites. We took down this operation, blocked their domains from being shared on our platform, and shared information with other tech platforms, researchers and governments. When we disrupted this network on our platform, it had fewer than 4,000 Facebook accounts following one of more of its Pages and fewer than 500 accounts following one or more of its Instagram accounts.”

Meta also said some of the accounts it found using fictitious personas had also used profile pictures which is suggests were generated using artificial intelligence techniques like generative adversarial networks (GAN).

“They claimed to be based in Kyiv and posed as news editors, a former aviation engineer, and an author of a scientific publication on hydrography — the science of mapping water. This operation ran a handful of websites masquerading as independent news outlets, publishing claims about the West betraying Ukraine and Ukraine being a failed state,” it adds.

“Our investigation is ongoing, and so far we’ve found links between this network and another operation we removed in April 2020, which we then connected to individuals in Russia, the Donbass region in Ukraine and two media organizations in Crimea — NewsFront and SouthFront, now sanctioned by the US government.”

Meta’s security update also warns that it’s seen increased targeting of people in Ukraine — including Ukrainian military and public figures — by Ghostwriter, a threat actor it notes has been tracked for some time by the security community.

“We detected attempts to target people on Facebook to post YouTube videos portraying Ukrainian troops as weak and surrendering to Russia, including one video claiming to show Ukrainian soldiers coming out of a forest while flying a white flag of surrender,” it notes, adding: “We’ve taken steps to secure accounts that we believe were targeted by this threat actor and, when we can, to alert the users that they had been targeted. We also blocked phishing domains these hackers used to try to trick people in Ukraine into compromising their online accounts.”

Twitter also confirmed that it has taken some action against suspected Russian disinformation on its platform since the invasion when we asked.

A spokesperson for the social network told us:

On Feb. 27, we permanently suspended more than a dozen accounts and blocked the sharing of several links in violation of our platform manipulation and spam policy. Our investigation is ongoing; however, our initial findings indicate that the accounts and links originated in Russia and were attempting to disrupt the public conversation around the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. As is standard, further details will be shared through our information operations archive once complete.

Twitter said it will be continuing to monitor its platform for “emerging narratives” which violate platform rules as the situation in Ukraine develops — such as rules on synthetic and manipulated media and its platform manipulation policy — adding that it will take enforcement action when it identifies content and accounts that violate its policies.

The platform does already label state-affiliated accounts belonging to the Russian Federation.

Meta, meanwhile, faced restrictions on its service inside Russia Friday — after the state internet regulator appears to have retaliated over fact-checking labels Facebook had placed on four Kremlin-linked media firms.

On Saturday, Twitter also said access to its service had been restricted in Russia following street protests against the war.

Both Meta and Twitter are urging users to beef up their account security in light of the threat posed by Russian cyberops, suggesting people be cautious about accepting Facebook friend requests from people they don’t know, for example, and implementing 2FA on their accounts to add an additional security layer.

We also reached out to TikTok to ask if it’s taken any measures against Russian propaganda but at the time of writing it had not responded.

The Russian military has been a keen user of TikTok in recent years as Putin’s propaganda tacticians leveraged the viral video clip sharing platform to crank up a visual display of power which looked intended to psyche out and sap the will of Ukraine to resist Russian aggression.

Albeit, if anti-Ukraine ‘psyops’ was the primary goal of Russian military TikTokking the tactic appears to have entirely failed to hit the mark.",https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/28/eu-rt-sputnik-ban-social-media-pressure/

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced Sunday that Kremlin-backed RT, formerly known as Russia Today, and Sputnik, would be banned in the EU.

""We will ban the Kremlin’s media machine in the EU. The state-owned Russia Today and Sputnik, and their subsidiaries, will no longer be able to spread their lies to justify Putin’s war,"" she said.

""We are developing tools to ban their toxic and harmful disinformation in Europe,"" von der Leyen added, without providing more details.

Kremlin-backed media have been under increased pressure in Europe since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. Poland and Estonia regulators have in recent days banned Russian TV broadcasters while Western countries including the U.K. and France have renewed scrutiny on RT. The power to shut down broadcasters is in the hands of national regulators.

In recent weeks, a massive information war unfolded both online and offline between Kremlin-backed news outlets and online trolls and media and actors both in Ukraine and across the West. According to French public radio France Inter, RT France's coverage of Ukraine was obviously one-sided and biased toward the Russian government.

Russia could decide to retaliate after the Commission president's statement: When Germany banned RT Deutsch in early February, Moscow forced German media outlet Deutsche Welle to shut down its Russian operations.

Von der Leyen's comments come hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his nuclear forces on high alert, after complaining about the West’s response to the Ukraine invasion.

The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said: “Russia Today and Sputnik, as well as their subsidiaries, will no longer be able to spread their lies to justify Putin’s war and to sow division in our union. So we are developing tools to ban their toxic and harmful disinformation in Europe.”

The move, which was not trailed or widely discussed, came as part of a package of tougher sanctions against Vladimir Putin’s government and the regime of the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, which Von der Leyen described as “complicit in this vicious attack against Ukraine”.

European foreign policy taboos have been smashed in just a few days, after Russia invaded its neighbour, provoking fears of the biggest war in Europe since 1945.

For the first time in its history, the EU will finance the purchase and delivery of weapons to a country under attack, Von der Leyen said. EU foreign ministers are expected to approve the use of funds from the European Peace Facility to finance lethal and non-lethal aid to Ukraine at a meeting on Sunday evening. While a handful of countries may hold back, because of policies against sending weapons into a conflict zone, the plan is expected to pass.

Ministers are also set to agree to ban Russian airlines from EU skies, after more than a dozen countries took the decision unilaterally. “Our airspace will be closed to every Russian plane – and that includes the private jets of oligarchs,” Von der Leyen said.

In a historic announcement to parliament, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said a fund of €100bn (£85bn) would be set up immediately to boost the strength of the country’s armed forces, as he also announced a sustained increase in defence spending over the coming years.

Scholz admitted that the urgency of the Ukraine crisis had forced Germany’s decision to invest in the military, telling the emergency session of the Bundestag: “It is clear that we must invest significantly more in the security of our country, in order to protect our freedom and democracy.”

He called it “Germany’s historical responsibility” to ensure that Vladimir Putin “does not turn the clocks back”.

Long-term defence spending was to be increased year on year by more than 2% of GDP, he said. It is currently about 1.5% with Germany having been under growing pressure from its Nato allies, in particular the US, to increase the amount for years. The existence of the special fund should be anchored in Germany’s constitution, Scholz said, in order to ensure it remained a guarantee beyond the life of the current parliament.

Germany has long been criticised by its allies for its resistance to increasing its defence spending. This position has been reinforced by a strong pacifist sentiment among the electorate linked to Germany’s Nazi past. In recent weeks, the country was also criticised for having not offered enough material support, in particular refusing to deliver lethal weapons to assist Ukraine to defend itself against Russia.

The move came after the government made the surprise announcement on Saturday that it would be sending weapons and other supplies to Ukraine, including 1,000 anti-tank weapons, 500 surface-to-air Stinger missiles and thousands of gallons of petrol. The decision marks a historical break with Germany’s postwar pledge not to export weapons to conflict zones.

A turning point came on Saturday evening with the government’s surprise announcement on weapons to Ukraine. It has also lifted certain restrictions on German-manufactured weapons being sent to conflict zones from third countries, such as Estonia and the Netherlands.

The announcement to parliament was greeted with relief and surprise, with Scholz receiving a standing ovation on Sunday morning, even as some MPs, mainly from the Left party as well as the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), voiced their disapproval.

As expected the EU is also broadening economic sanctions against Belarus, imposed in 2020 after Lukashenko launched a brutal crackdown on peaceful protesters who contested his claimed election victory, seen as fraudulent by all independent observers.

The Belarusian opposition has criticised the EU for loopholes in its sanctions regime that allowed Lukashenko to continue to benefit from export earnings. Von der Leyen insisted the new measures would “stop their exports of products from mineral fuels to tobacco, wood and timber, cement, iron and steel”.

The EU’s promise to cut some Russian banks out of Swift, however, was not expected to be finalised on Sunday.

The move against RT and Sputnik was the biggest surprise from the commission. The culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, this week wrote to Ofcom asking it to look at whether RT should be allowed to broadcast “harmful disinformation” in the UK. Some argued against a ban, warning it could lead to Moscow closing down the BBC in Russia.",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/27/eu-ban-russian-state-backed-channels-rt-sputnik

On Sunday, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, the European Union’s executive branch, announced that in addition to barring all Russian aircraft in European airspace, the European Union is going to crack down on “the Kremlin’s media machine in the EU”—namely its state-run media outlets Russia Today and Sputnik. The EU, Leyen said, would develop tools to “ban the toxic and harmful disinformation” spreading through Europe, which in the days since the invasion of Ukraine has included false claims from Putin that Ukraine’s government has committed genocide against its own people. Ukraine has dismissed those claims as untrue in a suit filed Sunday to the International Criminal Court and called on the United Nation’s highest court to order a stop to Russia’s invasion.

Second, we will ban the Kremlin’s media machine in the EU.

Both RT and Sputnik air in the United States, too. Will Biden follow suit and crack down on pro-Russia disinformation? If he does, US cable companies will also need to scrutinize media outlets like Fox News, whose shows —Tucker Carlson’s in particular—have parroted pro-Russia talking points. Russian media outlets are even using Carlson’s commentary to criticize Democrats and the Biden administration’s approach to sanctioning Russia over its infiltration of Ukraine. (Carlson eventually backpedaled a bit from his Putin defense.)

Congress could follow the calls of Virginia Sen. Mark Warner and put pressure on social media companies like Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and TikTok to impose further content restrictions to curtail the spread of propaganda and disinformation on their platforms. Politico reported last week that “debunked posts have been racking up millions of likes, comments and shares on Facebook and Twitter” and elsewhere.

It may be difficult to bar all disinformation from the Kremlin-backed media agencies: Pro-Russia propaganda has spilled through the secure messaging platform, Telegram, which has prompted Ukraine’s government anti-disinformation body to call the spread of pro-Russia channels “information terrorism.” But as Russia continues to wage its war on Ukraine, it’s crucial to reinforce that Putin’s pursuit of “the demilitarization and denazification” of Ukraine, a country led by a Jewish president, is its own false flag.",https://www.motherjones.com/mojo-wire/2022/02/the-eu-is-trying-to-combat-disinformation-from-russian-state-media-the-us-should-do-the-same/

Von der Leyen said the move was part of a broader plan to ban “Kremlin’s media machine” from Europe. “We are developing tools to ban the toxic and harmful disinformation in Europe.”

RT and Sputnik are widely seen as mouthpieces of Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian government. Broadcasting in multiple languages, the channels have been accused of spreading misinformation and pro-Russian propaganda. On Saturday, Foxtel suspended the broadcast of RT in Australia. In the U.K., RT is under review by media regulator Ofcom.

Europe has ratcheted up its sanctions against Russia in the wake of the country’s invasion of Ukraine on Thursday. The European Commission on Saturday said they would join the U.S., Britain, Canada and Japan in banning some Russian banks from the SWIFT financial messaging system, essentially barring them from international transactions. The 27 nations in the European Union have also shut their airspace to Russian airlines. “We are shutting down the EU airspace for Russians,” von der Leyen said. “We are proposing a prohibition on all Russian-owned, Russian-registered or Russian-controlled aircraft. These aircraft will no more be able to land in, take off or overfly the territory of the EU.”

The moves follow a threat by Putin on Sunday that was putting his country’s nuclear forces on high alert. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday he had agreed to send a Ukrainian delegation to meet with Russian negotiators to discuss, “without preconditions,” an end to the war.

“I do not really believe in the outcome of this meeting, but let them try so that later not a single citizen of Ukraine has any doubt that I, as president, tried to stop the war, when there was even a small, but still a chance,” Zelensky said, via his official Telegram channel.

Zelensky said the meeting would take place at the Belarusian-Ukrainian border.",https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/europe-bans-channels-russia-today-sputnik-1235100372/

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced, on Sunday, that Kremlin-backed RT, formerly known as Russia Today, and Sputnik, would be banned in the EU. The European Federation of Journalists (EFJ) fears the effects of this spiral of censorship on freedom of expression in Europe.

“We will ban the Kremlin’s media machine in the EU. The state-owned Russia Today and Sputnik, and their subsidiaries, will no longer be able to spread their lies to justify Putin’s war,” said Ursula von der Leyen. “We are developing tools to ban their toxic and harmful disinformation in Europe,” she added, without providing more details.

After EU Member States gave their green light to the Commission’s proposal on Tuesday, the sanction will be published in the Official Journal today, effectively empowering national media regulators to block RT and Sputnik. The sanction will apply to transmission and distribution through satellite, cable, online video sharing platforms, and both new and already installed apps

Commission Vice President for Values and Transparency Věra Jourová and Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton spoke with the chair and members of the European Regulators Group for Audiovisual Media Services (ERGA) to discuss the implementation. They called on the media watchdogs to ensure the sanctions are implemented “immediately,” and the ERGA agreed. The sanction will apply to transmission and distribution through satellite, cable, online video sharing platforms, and both new and already installed apps.

The EFJ General Secretary Ricardo Gutiérrez expressed surprise: “First of all, it should be remembered that media regulation does not fall within the competence of the European Union. We believe the EU has no right to grant or withdraw broadcasting licences. This is an exclusive competence of the states. In our liberal democracies, it is independent regulators, never the government, that are allowed to manage the allocation of licences. The EU’s decision is a complete break with these democratic guarantees. For the first time in modern history, Western European governments are banning media.”

“Secondly, the total closure of a media outlet does not seem to me to be the best way to combat disinformation or propaganda,” added Gutiérrez. “This act of censorship can have a totally counterproductive effect on the citizens who follow the banned media. In our opinion, it is always better to counteract the disinformation of propagandist or allegedly propagandist media by exposing their factual errors or bad journalism, by demonstrating their lack of financial or operational independence, by highlighting their loyalty to government interests and their disregard for the public interest.”

The EFJ recalls the case law of the European Court of Human Rights, which states that banning of a media outlet is a serious act, which must be based on solid legal grounds and objective elements, to avoid arbitrariness. “The challenge for democracies is to fight disinformation while preserving freedom of expression,” said Gutiérrez.

For the EFJ, other strategies should be favoured: increasing support for independent journalism, strengthening the independence of editorial offices, reinforcing the social status of journalists, promoting professional ethics through independent press councils, encouraging media pluralism, promoting media literacy for all, increasing the transparency of those in power (which they never propose!)…

“The real antidote to disinformation is not the banning of the media, but the promotion of a vibrant, pluralistic, professional, ethical and viable media ecosystem, totally independent of those in power,” said Gutiérrez.

“The risk of a censorship policy is also that of likely retaliation, as we have seen with the banning of DW in Russia in response to the banning of RT in Germany. The result of this escalation has been the impoverishment of media pluralism in Russia. Citizens have lost the right to access information broadcast by DW. This is regrettable,” he concluded.

Western restriction on free circulation of info (incl from Russian state media) seems wrong to me: 1) It defies the values we defend 2) It limits Western citizens' understanding of the Russian narrative 3) It leads to retaliation that will limit Russians' access to truth https://t.co/dehvbH5khk — Michael Bang Petersen (@M_B_Petersen) March 1, 2022
