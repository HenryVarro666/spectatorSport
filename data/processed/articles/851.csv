MOSCOW. Feb 24 (Interfax) - British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has expressed the most decisive protest to the Russian ambassador in London over the launch by Russia of a special operation in Donbas, the Russian Embassy to the United Kingdom said.

""On February 24 the ambassador of the Russian Federation, Andrei Kelin, was invited to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Elizabeth Truss. She stated the 'most decisive' protest over the 'unprovoked and unjustified' Russian attack on Ukraine,"" the embassy said in a statement obtained by Interfax on Thursday.

""She stressed that there will follow a relevant international reaction in respect of the Russian Federation,"" it said.

The ambassador explained in detail that, ""the reluctance of NATO countries, including Britain, to discuss security guarantees with Russia, in combination with Ukraine's refusal to implement the Minsk agreements have driven diplomatic efforts to the deadlock,"" the embassy said.

""Against this backdrop, the increasingly aggressive actions of Ukrainian armed forces and the real threat of a Ukrainian military attack on the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics leave us with no choice but to respond to their plea for help,"" it stated.",https://interfax.com/newsroom/top-stories/74119/

Foreign Office minister James Cleverly spoke by phone with his opposite number in Moscow to condemn the “unprovoked and unjustified” attack.

Mr Cleverly told deputy foreign minister Vladimir Titov that the assault on Ukraine was an “appalling” violation of the charter of the United Nations, to which Russia is a signatory.

The meeting comes after foreign secretary Liz Truss gave a dressing-down on Thursday to Russia’s ambassador to London Andrei Kelin.

Ms Truss told the ambassador that the invasion had made his country “an international pariah” and kicked him out of the meeting after he repeated the Kremlin’s justifications for the act of aggression.

Following Friday’s call, Mr Cleverly said: “Today I spoke with Russian deputy foreign minister Titov.

Liz Truss 'kicks out' Russian ambassador from meeting saying he 'should be ashamed'

The Russian ambassador was ""kicked out"" of the Foreign Office by Liz Truss after a ""heated"" meeting with the Foreign Secretary today.

Ms Truss had summoned Andrei Kelin to speak to her after Vladimir Putin's repeated threats to invade Ukraine.

But a Foreign Office source said it became ""a heated meeting"" and the envoy was pictured leaving Whitehall after barely ten minutes.

It came as Boris Johnson condemned Russia for launching a ""tidal wave of violence"" on Ukraine, without provocation or credible excuse, after Moscow's forces attack by land, sea and air.

One source told Sky News: ""Liz Truss kicked him out early.

""Said he should be ashamed of himself, that Russia has lied repeatedly and lost its last shred of credibility with the international community.""

Ms Truss told Russian ambassador that Moscow should expect a “long, protracted conflict” with vast costs.

A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: “The Foreign Secretary said the Russian government had repeatedly lied about having no plans to invade Ukraine, and its unprovoked aggression had made it an international pariah.

“She condemned Russia’s outrageous attack on Ukraine as a clear breach of international law.

“She reiterated there would be severe sanctions in retribution for the invasion, which will inflict pain on the Russian economy and those closely associated with the Kremlin.

“She added that Russia should expect a long, protracted conflict that would inflict a huge human, economic and political cost on the Russian government. She said allies and partners are united in support for Ukraine, providing economic and defensive support.”

In an address to the nation this morning, Boris Johnson condemned Russia.

He said: ""Innumerable missiles and bombs have been raining down on an entirely innocent population. A vast invasion is under way, by land, by sea and by air.""

The Prime Minister said a massive package of sanctions had been drawn up to ""hobble"" Russia 's economy and vowed to reduce dependance on Russian oil and gas.

Mr Johnson added: ""Our mission is clear. Diplomatically, politically, economically and eventually militarily this hideous and barbaric venture of Vladimir Putin must end in failure.""

The PM - who is attending a 2pm meeting of G7 leaders - was woken before dawn by a phone call with the news that Russian forces had mounted an assault on Ukraine from the north, the south and the east.

Warning sirens blared through Ukraine's capital Kyiv in the early hours of today as Moscow began to attack by air, land and sea.

In a chilling early-morning statement, Vladimir Putin said he was launching a ""special military operation"" in response to unfounded accusations of aggression from Ukraine.

He warned Western leaders they would face ""consequences they have never seen"" if they tried to intervene.

At least 40 casualties have been reported, with footage emerging of queues of traffic fleeing the Ukrainian capital.

Western officials believe Russia intends to seize and control a very large section of Ukraine - including the capital Kiev - and will need ground troops to do so.

They fear this will lead to large numbers of civilian injuries and deaths with fighting in the built-up urban area.

But they are unclear whether that will mean occupying the whole country, for which Russian forces do not yet appear to be ready.

Likewise, Western officials are unclear whether Vladimir Putin intends Russia to rule Ukraine directly, or to replace the government in Kiev with a more favourable puppet regime.",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/breaking-liz-truss-kicks-out-26320967
