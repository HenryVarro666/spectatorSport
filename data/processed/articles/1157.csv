New Delhi: Air raid sirens blared on Saturday afternoon was followed by three powerful explosions in the Ukrainian city of Lviv, said governor of the region, Maxym Kozytsky, without giving any further details, reported news agency The Associated Press.

The explosion comes two weeks after the Russian forces had fired missiles on a military training centre near Lviv, killing 35 people.

Since the invasion of Russian troops in Ukraine on February 24, Lviv has offered to be a safe harbour for some 2,00,000 displaced Ukrainians as the city has been largely spared from major Russian attacks in two weeks.

Biden Visits Poland

The explosion in Lviv comes soon after US President Joe Biden was concluding his visit to neighbouring NATO ally Poland.

In an intense criticism of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, Biden called Putin a “butcher” after meeting with refugees in Warsaw.

After Biden met with the refugees he said that “they are an amazing group of people.”

“Each one of those children said, 'Pray for my dad, my grandfather, my brother who is back there fighting.' I remember what it's like when you've someone in a war zone, every morning you get up & wonder...They're an amazing group of people,” reported Reuters.

He also told Poland's president, Andrzej Duda, that “your freedom is ours,” which was welcomed by the Polish president. He stressed that the assurance was all the more important as Russia is carrying out brutal assaults in Ukraine, just across Poland's eastern border.

I think that for us Poles, in the situation we have today, in our part of Europe, in the era of Russian aggression against Ukraine, this is a very important element, Duda said.",https://news.abplive.com/news/world/ukraine-crisis-air-raid-sirens-in-kyiv-3-explosions-reported-biden-calls-putin-a-butcher-top-points-1521903

LVIV, Ukraine, March 26 (Reuters) - Four rockets hit the western Ukrainian city of Lviv on Saturday, local officials said, in the most significant attack on the city since the start of the war with Russia.

Lviv, just 60 kilometres (40 miles) from the Polish border, has so far escaped the heavy bombardment and fighting that has devastated some Ukrainian cities closer to Russia since Moscow launched its invasion on Feb. 24.

Governor Maksym Kozytskyy said five people had been wounded after two rockets hit a fuel depot and two others later hit a military factory. Earlier he reported powerful explosions in Lviv's eastern outskirts from the strikes.

""Stay in shelters! Do not go out into the streets!,"" he warned after the first strike.

The rockets fell as U.S. President Joseph Biden, speaking in Warsaw during a visit to Poland, condemned Russian aggression and assured Ukraine of the United States's unwavering support. read more

""With today's blows, the aggressor sends greetings to President Biden, who is in Poland,"" Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadoviy said in a televised briefing, saying Russia had fired the rockets from Sevastopol in Crimea which it annexed in 2014.

There was no immediate comment on the Lviv attacks from the Russian authorities, who refer to the invasion as a ""special military operation"" aimed at demilitarising Ukraine.

The city authorities did not give the exact locations of the strikes, but said they damaged critical infrastructure, set fire to the fuel depot and blasted the windows out of a school building. No residential buildings were hit, according to the mayor.

Reuters witnesses in central Lviv saw heavy black smoke rising from the northeast side of the city and a strong smell of burning filled the air.

Men huddled together on the street to watch a plume of smoke rising behind an apartment block. Most residents appeared to stay indoors, peeking out from behind curtains as others hurried past on the road carrying their bags.

The Ukrainian president's chief of staff Andriy Yermak said the attacks showed Russia wanted to intimidate Ukraine and the foreign diplomats who have relocated their embassies to Lviv for the perceived relative safety compared to the capital, Kyiv.

""Ukraine should definitely not be intimidated by such crimes of the Russians, and I want to say to my Western partners once again - close the sky, show strength,"" he said on Telegram.

This referred to Ukraine's repeated request for no-fly zone, which NATO has ruled out.

Lviv had a pre-war population of around 717,000, but for the thousands of families fleeing the worst of the fighting in eastern, southern and central Ukraine, it has become either a place of refuge within the country or a transit hub for people leaving the country. read more

Everywhere is a target, and anyone can be a victim, it seems, but a few hundred families believe they’ve found the safest place in Ukraine, tucked away in the Carpathian Mountains.

The remote urban settlement of Slavsko is a popular ski destination for locals, but as spring melted its snow-capped peaks and Russian troops invaded the country’s east, a lucky few found solace in the slopes.

Many of the hotels welcomed the families, offering a handful of rooms for free and others at discounted rates. Staicy Chernilevskaia, who fled with her partner Ramir Holubov from Kharkiv, is among 50 people staying at the Karpatsky Zatyshok hotel.

“It’s mind boggling when you look at these mountains and read the news,"" Chernilevskaia said. ""It seems like it’s not real.”

The couple’s families are still in Kharkiv where Russian artillery consistently strikes residential areas, according to Ukrainian officials.

“You are here, you are safe, but you feel guilty,” Holubov said.

After a terrifying week spent sheltering in the car park of their apartment block in Kyiv and two failed escape attempts, 12-year-old Diana Kovalyova and her mother finally squeezed onto one of the overcrowded trains leaving the capital.

But they didn’t know where to go until they remembered a family trip one summer to the ski resort.

“We had good memories here,” said Larysa Kovalyova, Diana's mother. “The people were kind and we knew they would take care of us.”

Situated in a valley between two rivers, the idyllic town has one small gold-domed church and little interest to Russian firepower that has targeted military infrastructure and urban centers.

“I feel safe here and also the view is perfect,"" Diana said. ""I like it so much, but I hope the war is over soon and we can go home because living at home is still much better.""

The town now hosts about 3,400 internally displaced people, nearly doubling its population, but the mayor says it’s not a burden. The community wants to share its mountain sanctuary.

“We think that it is our duty to host people who were thrown out of their homes by the war,” Mayor Volodymyr Beha said. “We feel a responsibility to make them warm and comfortable.”

Some are staying in less traditional accommodations. Olesya Matiushenko found peace for her two children in a glamping pod perched atop the mountains.

“My daughter wakes up every morning, opens the curtains, wipes the dew from the windows and says, ‘Mommy look!’” Olesya said with a smile as she looks out at her stunning view.

“It’s calming here,"" she said. ""I feel lighter. And I start to believe everything will be okay.”",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-27-22/h_a08bc69f42700c8220f46db25e19bc58

One of the strikes hit a fuel storage facility, causing it to catch fire, and a later strike caused ""significant damage"" to the city's infrastructure facilities, according to the city's mayor, Andriy Sadovyi.

Three powerful blasts were heard in the center of the city earlier, and plumes of thick black smoke could be seen rising in the distance. Air raid sirens rang out prior to the explosions. Maksym Kozytsky, the head of the Lviv regional military administration, later on his Telegram account reported three more explosions following the strike on the fuel depot, saying, ""The air alarm remains.""

Lviv is a strategic Ukrainian city close to the Polish border that has largely been spared from the relentless bombardment seen across much of the country during the Russian invasion. It was a surprising attack, coming just a day after the Russian military said that the first phase of the conflict had ended and that it was shifting its attention to the disputed eastern parts of Ukraine.

The Russian military on Sunday confirmed strikes on fuel depots on the western Ukrainian city of Lviv and outside of Kyiv, saying it had targeted fuel supplies for Ukrainian troops.

Lviv governor Maksym Kozytskyy said there had been two missile strikes at about 2.45pm UK time. Shortly before 5pm, the governor said there had been three more explosions.

It is understood an oil depot was hit in the first attack. Five people were injured in the initial strikes, Mr Kozytskyy said.

Both he and the city's mayor, Andriy Sadovyi, urged people to stay indoors. ""Stay in the shelters!"" Mr Kozytskyy said. ""Don't walk down the street! Don't take pictures of anything! Do not read information in anonymous Telegram channels and do not spread it from there!""

Footage from the first strikes showed plumes of heavy black smoke in the sky near the city. Sky News correspondent Sally Lockwood, who is at the scene, heard air raid sirens and said there were reports of jets flying over.

Flashes and loud bangs could be heard from the site in the hours after the attack, she said, describing it as an ""active situation"". The later explosions are believed to have hit a defence facility.

There are concerns that an ""enormous"" fire that has broken out, close to homes and two petrol stations, could spread due to high winds, and police and soldiers have been moving people away from the area.

Mr Sadovyi said the strikes were by rockets that had been fired from Sevastopol in Crimea.

The attack happened as US president Joe Biden was over the border in Warsaw, Poland.

Defence and security analyst Michael Clarke told Sky News: ""The Russians are using the missiles to probe for supply routes and depots and stuff that's coming in from Poland, so every time they think they see something around Lviv, I think they go for it.""

Lviv, a city of more than 700,000 people roughly 45 miles east of Ukraine's border with Poland, has been largely spared of major attacks in recent weeks.

Russia says footage 'from Black Sea' shows missile launch targeting region west of Kyiv

Earlier, Russia claimed it had launched missile strikes on Ukrainian military infrastructure from the Black Sea in the northwestern city of Zhytomyr - around 96 miles from the capital of Kyiv.

A crew of a small missile ship off the Black Sea Fleet launched four Kalibr cruise missiles at military facilities belonging to the Ukrainian Armed Forces from the Black Sea, Russia's Ministry of Defence said.

""As a result of an accurate hit, the high-precision weaponry destroyed weapons and military equipment depot on the territory of Zhytomyr Region,"" it said, in a Facebook post with footage of the blasts.

Russia appeared to be scaling back its ambitions in Ukraine to focus on consolidating control of eastern areas, but the UK warmed that the bombardment of cities would likely continue.

Another video released by the Defence Ministry on Saturday allegedly showed an airstrike on a Ukrainian Buk missile system performed by an Iskander missile in the Kyiv region - causing a huge explosion.

Russia has previously pointed to far bigger ambitions but stiff resistance from Ukraine forces, logistical problems and reported low morale may have taken their toll as its forces have been unable to seize any major Ukrainian city more than four weeks into the conflict.

The Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, in the north of the country, has been cut off by Russian forces, its regional governor said on Friday.

""The city has been conditionally, operationally surrounded by the enemy,"" Viacheslav Chaus said, adding that it was being bombarded by artillery and warplanes.

Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk announced on Saturday that 10 human corridors had been confirmed for the day across the country.

It comes as Ukraine's prosecutor general office announced that at least 136 children have died since the Russian invasion a month ago.

Speaking on national television, she said civilians trying to flee the besieged port city of Mariupol would have to

leave in private cars as Russian forces were not letting buses through their checkpoints.

It shows Kyiv continuing to be encircled, as well as predicting advances into more cities in the north and south of the country by Russian troops.

The US also said Russian forces were no longer in full control of Kherson, the first city to fall after the invasion began.

It's another apparent boost for Ukraine, which also claimed to have destroyed a Russian landing ship near the coastal city of Berdyansk this week.
