Zelenskyy calls on EU to 'do more' after member states refuse to fast-track Ukraine's application to be a member

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy delivering a video address that was released on March 11, 2022. Volodymyr Zelenskyy

In a Friday video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy slammed European Union leaders for refusing to fast-track Ukraine's application to join the bloc and called on them to ""do more.""

Leaders of the 27 EU member states met in Versailles, France, on Thursday, and ultimately concluded that the bloc would not speed up Ukraine's application.

Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland were in favor, while France, Germany, Spain, and the Netherlands were not, The Guardian reported. Accession to the EU typically takes multiple years.

Zelenskyy said on Friday: ""A very important meeting of the leaders of the European Union took place yesterday ... We know what was said at this meeting. What all leaders said. Who specifically spoke. Who supported. Who remained silent.""

""How do we evaluate the decision made? It's very simple: it must be stronger. This is not what we expect.""

He said: ""The European Union must do more. It must do more for us, for Ukraine. And for itself.""

Notably, Zelenskyy could be seen outdoors in the video. Most of his video addresses were filmed indoors amid multiple reports suggesting he was the target of assassination attempts.

Bank sanctions are a sharper sword than cutting Russia off SWIFT, German minister says

The package of banking sanctions that the European Union is imposing will hit Putin’s government harder than excluding Russia from the SWIFT payments system, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has said.

Excluding Russia from SWIFT would make it impossible to support civil rights groups in Russia from abroad, or for Russian students abroad to send money to help their grandmothers, she told ARD public television.

“The sword that looks hardest isn’t always the cleverest one,” she said. “It’s not just oligarchs who do financial transactions … The sharper sword at the moment is listing banks. Government bonds can’t be sold abroad any more.”

US defence official says Russian forces have lost momentum amid stiff resistance

Russia’s drive to seize control of Ukraine has lost momentum amid stiff resistance from Ukrainian forces, both on the ground and in the air, a senior US defence official says.

“Their momentum, particularly as it comes to Kyiv, has slowed over the last 24 hours,” the official told reporters at a Pentagon briefing on condition of anonymity.

Russian forces have yet to seize any of Ukraine’s major cities, or achieve air superiority over the country, the official said.

“They have not achieved the progress that we believe they anticipated they would … [and] are meeting more resistance than they expected” the official added. “A good indicator of that is no population centers have been taken. None.”

Russia puts ‘partial restriction’ on Facebook access

Russian authorities have announced access to Facebook will be partially restricted after the social media network banned the accounts of several Kremlin-backed news outlets over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

Russian state communications watchdog Roskomnadzor said it had demanded that Facebook lift the bans it had on Thursday placed on state news agency RIA Novosti, state TV channel Zvezda, and pro-Kremlin news sites Lenta.Ru and Gazeta.Ru. The agency said Facebook didn’t reinstate the media outlets.

Roskomnadzor cast its action as a move “to protect Russian media.” It said Russia’s Foreign Ministry and the Prosecutor General’s office found Facebook “complicit in violation of fundamental human rights and freedoms, as well as the rights and freedoms of Russian nationals”.

It did not clarify what exactly the move means.

Russia claims Kyiv has gone silent on talks

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said there is a “pause” in contact between Moscow and Kyiv over possible in-person talks between the two sides following a discussion over where any such meeting should take place.

Peskov said Moscow had offered to hold the talks in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, but Kyiv had instead proposed Warsaw as a venue.

He said the Ukrainians had then taken what he described as quite a long time-out. During that pause, he claimed Ukrainian “nationalists” had deployed missile systems in residential areas within the country’s big cities, mirroring claims made by Putin.

Peskov did not provide evidence to support his assertion but said it was a very dangerous development. There was no immediate comment from Ukrainian authorities.

Ukrainians build makeshift roadblocks to stall Russian advance

Some Ukrainians are building makeshift roadblocks in a bid to stall Russian troops.

Vladimir, a former coalmine owner who fled Ukraine’s eastern region of Luhansk for Kyiv in 2014, when Russian-backed separatists took control of swaths of territory there, is among them.

The 47-year-old’s fortification, which features several concrete slabs and about a dozen sandbags, stands in the town of Rzhyshchiv, on the outskirts of Kyiv.

It is manned by six men, including Vladimir, who declined to give his surname. Two of those guarding the site are armed with hunting rifles.

“We won’t stop tanks with it, but we can stop other vehicles,” he told Al Jazeera, adding he had paid for the supplies from his own pocket.

Dozens of similar roadblocks have reportedly sprung up around the capital and elsewhere in Ukraine.

“Take power into your own hands, it will be easier for us to reach agreement,” he added.

‘The problem for the Kremlin is Zelenskyy’

Al Jazeera’s Bernard Smith, reporting from Moscow, says Russia’s suggestions it is ready for talks with Ukraine in Minsk were made after Moscow called for Kyiv to “lay down its arms” and warned it could never recognise Zelenskyy’s government as democratic.

“It is worth reminding people that the current Ukrainian president was elected in 2019 with a landslide 73 percent share of the vote, so he was democratically elected,” Smith said.

“But clearly, the problem for the Kremlin is Zelenskyy, and whether they will be able to have talks while he remains in power is unclear,” he added.

Zelenskyy had appealed for talks with Putin prior to the Kremlin’s suggestions of a summit in the Belarusian capital, which has hosted previous rounds of discussions between officials from Ukraine and Russia.

“I would like to address the President of the Russian Federation once again. There is fighting all over Ukraine now. Let’s sit down at the negotiation table to stop the people’s deaths,” Zelenskyy said in a video message to the nation.

Russia claims capture of airfield northwest of Kyiv

Russia’s defence ministry says its forces have captured the strategic Hostomel airfield, situated just seven kilometres (four miles) northwest of Kyiv, and landed paratroopers in the area.

It added troops had blocked access to Kyiv from the west, and Moscow-backed separatist forces in eastern Ukraine had attacked Ukrainian army positions with Russian support.

The Hostomel airfield has been the site of some of the most intense fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces. The site has a long runway capable of accommodating heavy transport planes.

Its seizure could allow Russia to airlift troops directly to Kyiv’s outskirts.

Only way forward for Ukraine is neutrality, Russian spy chief says

Russia’s Foreign Intelligence chief has said the only way forward for Ukraine is neutrality after an adviser of Zelenskyy suggested Kyiv was ready for talks with Moscow, including on adopting a neutral status regarding NATO.

Sergei Naryshkin’s remarks came after the Kremlin said it had noted the statement by Mykhailo Podolyak, given to the Reuters news agency, and was in the process of analysing his comments.

Ukraine was promised eventual NATO membership as far back as 2008, drawing Moscow’s ire. In the run-up to Russia’s invasion, Putin demanded that the United States-led alliance commit to never accepting Kyiv into its ranks.

NATO and Washington flatly rejected to provide such guarantees.

Hungary opens humanitarian corridor for third-country citizens fleeing Ukraine

Hungary will open a humanitarian corridor for citizens from third-party countries like Iran or India fleeing Ukraine, letting them in without visas and taking them to the nearest international airport, in Debrecen, the Hungarian foreign minister says.

Peter Szijjarto also said in a video posted on his Facebook page that crossing from Ukraine was continuous at five crossing points but cars were queuing for up to three-five kilometres on the Ukrainian side.

His remarks came after Iran’s foreign minister, Hossein Amirabdollahian, said he had requested Hungary’s assistance to evacuate Iranian citizens from Ukraine during a phone call with Szijjarto.

Iran’s foreign ministry had previously said it was seeking a permit to send a flight to Kyiv to repatriate its citizens, but it appears Russia’s offensive has eliminated that possibility.

US decries Russia’s ‘aggression’, thanks Baltic states

Blinken has condemned Russia’s military operation in Ukraine as “premeditated, unprovoked and unjustified”, the department said in a statement.

Blinken spoke with Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis, and Estonian Foreign Minister Eva-Maria Liimets on Thursday, spokesperson Ned Price said.

“Blinken thanked the Baltic states for their steadfast support of Ukraine and for hosting US and NATO forces. Blinken strongly condemned Russia’s premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified attack on Ukraine and emphasised the importance of Allied unity for the strong, swift response to Russia’s aggression,” Price said in a readout of the call.

6,6252621c-6557-4a13-9426-3bde59d0e97e,"['Nathan Hodge', 'Matthew Chance', 'Tim Lister', 'Laura Smith-Spark', 'Helen Regan']",2022-02-24 00:00:00,"(CNN) Explosions have been seen and heard in parts of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, as the fight by Ukrainian forces to hold back a Russian advance on the capital intensifies in the early hours of Saturday morning, amid warnings the city could fall within days and as officials handed out weapons to reservists.

""This night will be very difficult, and the enemy will use all available forces to break the resistance of Ukrainians,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a late-night video message Friday. ""This night we have to stand ground. The fate of Ukraine is being decided right now.""

Earlier Saturday, videos from eyewitnesses showed explosions taking place in an area north-west of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. There is a military base in the area.

CNN teams in the capital also reported hearing loud explosions to the west and south of the city Saturday. Shortly afterward, Ukraine's State Service of Special Communications said clashes are underway in an eastern suburb as well -- as Russian forces close in on the capital from multiple sides.

Meanwhile, the Ukrainian armed forces reported heavy fighting around the city of Vasylkiv, some 30 kilometers southwest of Kyiv.

""Heavy fighting is currently underway in the town of Vasylkiv in the Kyiv region, where the occupiers are trying to land a landing party,"" the armed forces said.

Russian forces are close to Kyiv, Zelensky confirmed in his message Friday, advancing on the capital from the north and east after seizing control Thursday of an airbase just north of the city. But ""Ukrainians resist the Russian aggression heroically,"" he said.

Russia's military claimed earlier Friday its forces had staged a ""successful landing operation"" to capture Hostomel airfield, viewed as strategically important, on Kyiv's outskirts.

Zelensky's comments came hours after a video was posted on his Facebook page, showing him with a group of men, saying, ""We are here. We are in Kyiv. We are defending Ukraine.""

Before dawn Friday, explosions lit up the sky above the capital as Russia targeted the city with missile strikes, according to a Ukrainian government adviser. A CNN team reported hearing two large blasts in central Kyiv and a third loud explosion in the distance, followed by at least three more explosions to the south-west of the city a few hours later.

""Strikes on Kyiv with cruise or ballistic missiles continued,"" Anton Gerashchenko, adviser to the Head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine told reporters via text message Friday.

Meanwhile, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said Russian reconnaissance troops had entered the Obolon district of northern Kyiv, just a few miles from the city center. Videos from the area showed chaotic scenes as civilians tried to hide from small arms fire.

Ukrainian military vehicles move past Independence Square in central Kyiv on February 24, 2022.

A tweet from the ministry asked citizens of the district to report any suspicious movements, adding: ""Make Molotov cocktails and take down the occupier.""

CNN witnessed a group of Ukrainian security forces leave the city police headquarters with weapons and ammunition -- apparently heading towards Obolon.

Meanwhile, 92 people working at the Chernobyl power plant, the site of the world's worst-ever nuclear disaster, have been taken hostage, the Ukrainian ambassador to the US said Friday. Russian forces took control of the site on Thursday, sparking fears that the fighting could interfere with the operation of nuclear waste facilities.

As Russian troops advance, US intelligence officials are concerned that Kyiv could fall under Russian control within days, according to two sources familiar with the latest intelligence.

However, the latest British defense intelligence assessment said Russia had made ""limited progress"" Friday in its attack.

""Fighting continues in key locations. Russia has made limited progress so far today and Ukraine retains control of key cities. Ukrainian MOD reports that Russian forces have arrived in the suburbs of Kyiv,"" the UK Ministry of Defence tweeted

A senior US defense official told reporters that the Russians have ""about a third of their combat power"" in Ukraine out of the total combat power they have amassed on the country's borders right now, but ""that does not mean that they will not commit more.""

The Ukrainian Defense Ministry earlier said that airborne assault troops blew up a bridge over the Teteriv River at Ivankiv, about 30 miles north of Kyiv, successfully preventing a Russian column of forces from advancing towards the capital, which has a population of close to 3 million.

For now, Ukraine's democratically elected government remains intact but President Volodymr Zelensky warned in a video address late Thursday that ""enemy sabotage groups"" had entered this city and he is their No. 1 target. ""They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state,"" he said.

""Russian forces continued to launch missile strikes on the territory of Ukraine. They say that they are only targeting military facilities, but these are lies. In fact, they do not distinguish in which areas they operate,"" he said. ""Such attacks on our capital haven't occurred since 1941.""

In an address Friday morning, Zelensky said Ukrainians were ""showing their true heroism"" but that they were defending their country ""alone."" The sanctions imposed on Russia by Western powers are ""not enough to get these foreign troops off our soil,"" he said.

A few hours later, Zelensky released a message in which he again called for Russian President Vladimir Putin to hold direct talks. ""There is fighting all over Ukraine now. Let's sit down at the negotiation table to stop the people's deaths,"" he said, speaking in Russian.

Shortly afterward, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was ready to send a delegation to Minsk, the capital of Belarus, for talks with Ukraine, Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti reported.

""As you know, today the President of Ukraine Zelensky announced his readiness to discuss the neutral status of Ukraine,"" Peskov said, according to RIA. The talks would concern ""neutral status,"" he suggested. Peskov said later Friday that the Ukrainian side had countered with a proposal to meet in Warsaw and then dropped contact.

Zelensky has not directly proposed neutral status but has signaled a willingness to discuss it, while insisting his country be provided security guarantees.

""Ukraine has been and remains ready to talk about a ceasefire and peace. This is our constant position,"" Sergii Nykyforov, a spokesperson for Zelensky, said late Friday. He also denied what he called ""claims that we have refused to negotiate.""

Meanwhile, Putin called on Ukraine's armed forces to overthrow their government in remarks to his security council Friday.

""Do not let Banderites (Ukrainian nationalists) and neo-Nazis use your children, wives and old people as human shields,"" Putin said in remarks aired on Russian state television. ""Take power into your own hands, it looks like it will be easier for us to come to an agreement than with this gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis that has settled in Kyiv and taken hostage the entire Ukrainian people.""

Putin frequently repeats the baseless and inaccurate claim that the democratically elected Ukrainian government is a ""Nazi"" or ""fascist"" regime. The language has been roundly condemned internationally, especially considering that Zelensky is Jewish.

Asked by CNN at a news conference Friday what Moscow's plans were for the leadership of Ukraine as Russian forces advance on Kyiv, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov replied: ""Nobody is going to attack the people of Ukraine.""

In an interview with CNN on the streets of Kyiv, former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko accused Putin of being ""simply crazy"" in wanting to ""come here to kill Ukrainians"" -- and vowed they would resist. ""We demonstrate a unique quality that we can stand against Russian aggression,"" he said.

Homes damaged

The advance on Kyiv comes only a day after Russian forces entered Ukraine from three sides, by land, sea and air, prompting a barrage of international condemnation and sanctions -- and questions about Putin's wider ambitions for the country and its capital.

It's unclear how long Ukrainian forces can resist the advance of Russian forces who are much better equipped and have superior air power.

Two residential buildings in Kyiv suffered damage in the early hours of Friday, but it's not clear if they were intentionally struck or hit by debris, or if anyone was injured.

Ukrainian Deputy Interior Minister Evgeny Yenin told CNN a Ukrainian Sukhoi Su-27 fighter jet was shot down over Kyiv. Photos tweeted by the emergency forces appear to show a fire at a two-story private house with debris from what looks to be a plane nearby. It is unclear if the house was hit by remnants of the jet.

Separately, images showed firefighters working to put out a blaze at an apartment building on the left bank of the city.

As they approach, many Ukrainians are preparing to fight back. Some 18,000 guns with ammunition have been distributed to reservists in the Kyiv region alone since the Russian invasion began early Thursday, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said, with more weapons on their way.

Outside the Kyiv region, fighting continued in cities including Sumy, in the northeast, Chernihiv in the north and Kherson to the south.

A CNN team that visited a bridge crossing from Russian-held areas into the southern city of Kherson saw four large shell craters, 10 discarded Ukrainian armored vehicles and several bodies, but the Ukrainians appeared to have been able to push Russian forces back.

Low-flying jets could be seen overhead and air raid sirens wailed across the city.

A Russian defense ministry spokesperson said in a statement that a ""counter-offensive"" was underway in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, and that Ukrainian service members had surrendered to Russian troops and pro-Russian separatists. CNN could not immediately check the veracity of those claims.

Makeshift bunkers

Officials in the country believe Russia's plan is to overthrow the Ukrainian leadership and install a pro-Russian government.

Those fears were shared with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, who said Thursday that he's ""convinced"" Moscow is going to try to overthrow the Ukrainian government.

If that happens, Blinken said he believes ""Moscow has developed plans to inflict widespread human rights abuses -- and potentially worse -- on the Ukrainian people.""

The fighting in Ukraine appears to be some of the worst conventional warfare Europe has seen since World War II and the conflicts in the Balkans in the 1990s. Preliminary figures indicate 137 Ukrainian solders have been killed, including every soldier defending an island in the Black Sea that was taken over by Russian troops, according to President Zelensky.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy makes a statement in Kyiv, Ukraine, February 25.

The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said its armed forces had caused around 800 casualties among Russian forces since the attacks started early on Thursday. It was not immediately clear whether the ministry was referring solely to the number killed and CNN is not able to independently verify Ukraine's figures.

By the end of Thursday, Putin's forces had launched ""in total more than 160 missiles for airstrikes,"" a senior US defense official said, prompting a response reminiscent of the late 1930s, with vulnerable children evacuated by train from eastern Ukraine and packed subway stations turned into makeshift bunkers as air raid sirens wailed.

A family takes shelter along with other Kyiv residents in an underground parking garage on Friday. Some areas of the Ukrainian capital were hit by aerial attacks.

In an ominous sign a ground war could escalate, Zelensky barred male citizens between the ages of 18 and 60 from leaving the country, according to the State Border Guard Service.

Zelensky also ordered a general military mobilization ""in order to ensure the defense of the state, maintaining combat and mobilization readiness of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other military formations, in a declaration signed late Thursday.

More than 100,000 people have already fled areas most at risk of attack within Ukraine, according to the United Nations refugee agency. The mass movement followed warnings from the US Ambassador to the UN, who said Russia's actions in Ukraine could create one of the largest refugee crises facing the world today, displacing as many as five million people.

Polish officials reported an increase in the number of people crossing into the country from Ukraine in the hours after the Russian invasion began.

Sanctioning Putin

The United States will impose sanctions on Putin and Lavrov, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Friday, hours after the European Union and United Kingdom said they would do the same.

The EU also announced a slew of other new sanctions on Russia, designed to have ""maximum impact on the Russian economy and political elite.""

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the sanctions would hit Russia's financial, energy and transport sectors, visa policy, and include export controls and export financing bans.

""We want to financially isolate Russia, we want to cut all the ties between Russia and the international financial system,"" said French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire.

Speaking in Brussels on Thursday, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg described Russia's attack on Ukraine as a ""brutal act of war.""

The alliance activated the NATO Response Force (NRF) for the first time ever in response to the invasion. The NRF is made up of land, air, sea and special operations forces from the allies that can deploy quickly in support of the NATO alliance.

""We have over 100 jets at high alert, operating in over 30 different locations, and over 120 ships from the high north, to the Mediterranean. We activated the defense plans yesterday, and now elements of this force are being deployed,"" Stoltenberg said during a press briefing on Friday, following an extraordinary meeting of NATO Heads of State and Government in Brussels. He also clarified that while the United States, Canada and European allies have ""deployed thousands more troops"" to the eastern part of the alliance, NATO is not deploying the entire Response Force.

A big concern for NATO is whether Putin's intentions lie beyond Ukraine, a prospect that risks drawing all 30 members -- including the US, the United Kingdom, Canada, France and Germany -- into a wider conflict on European soil.

""You don't need intelligence to tell you that that's exactly what President Putin wants. He has made clear he'd like to reconstitute the Soviet Empire, short of that he'd like to reassert a sphere of influence around the neighboring countries that were once part of the Soviet bloc,"" said Blinken on CBS Evening News.

Blinken said NATO would stand in the way if those were Putin's ultimate goals.

""Now, when it comes to a threat beyond Ukraine's borders. There's something very powerful standing in his way. That's article five of NATO, an attack on one is an attack on all,"" the top diplomat said.

On Thursday, the US Secretary of Defense ordered the deployment of 7,000 US service members to Europe. The deployment brings the number of US troops moved towards eastern Europe at more than 14,000.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/24/europe/ukraine-russia-invasion-friday-intl-hnk/index.html

Zelenskyy orders full military mobilization to counter Russia Zelenskyy said he was ordering a full mobilization of the Ukraine armed forces to counter Russia's attacks. The mobilization will be carried out within 90 days from the date of entry into force, he said in a statement. Zelenskyy also confirmed that 137 people have been killed and that 316 have been injured thus far since the attacks began Thursday. Share this -







Why would Russia want to take Chernobyl? Few places conjure more foreboding than Chernobyl, the site of the deadly 1986 nuclear disaster. So alarm bells rang in the West when Russian forces seized the decommissioned power plant in the early hours of their invasion of Ukraine on Thursday. Why would Russia make a radioactive wasteland one of its very first targets in Ukraine? While the full answer may be known only to top officials in Moscow, the site happens to lie along one of the most direct paths to Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital. “The location is important because of where it sits,” retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, former commanding general of U.S. Army Europe, said in an interview. ""If Russian forces were attacking Kyiv from the north, Chernobyl is right there on the way, almost in the way."" Chernobyl is less than 10 miles from Ukraine's border with Belarus, a Russian ally where Moscow has been massing troops in preparation for its attack on Ukraine. From there, it's a relatively straight shot of about 80 miles south to Kyiv. Read the full story here. Share this -







Russia sanctions are a ‘big deal,’ experts say. But effects could take years. The flurry of sanctions the U.S. announced this week against Russia are some of the hardest-hitting that Moscow has ever faced, but the slow pain they inflict may not be enough to deter Putin from escalating his invasion of Ukraine, experts said. Biden and several U.S. allies, including the European Union, the United Kingdom and Japan, have vowed to review further restrictions on Moscow as punishment for the invasion. The sanctions that have already been announced are significant in size and scope, said former Treasury and State Department officials who handled U.S. sanctions in the past, but the longtime U.S. reliance on the national security tool has left the U.S. with few other options if Putin and Russia do not respond. Nevertheless, the Russian economy is already feeling the effects of war, and the sanctions could over time further cause the Russian stock market to falter, deflate the value of the ruble — which hit an all-time low Thursday — and make doing business in Russia increasingly difficult. “We’re counting a lot on sanctions, and the ones the Biden administration have put together are really pretty tough,” said Daniel Fried, a longtime diplomat and former ambassador to Poland who helped lead the West’s 2014 response to Moscow’s aggression against Ukraine as the State Department coordinator for sanctions policy. He called the recent sanctions ""a big deal."" Read the full story here. Share this -







Russia says it will support banks under sanctions Russia said its central bank will support banks affected by the sanctions the U.S. and other countries imposed this week. Leaders in Europe, Canada and the U.S. announced Thursday that they are committed to issuing severe economic sanctions following Putin's decision to attack Ukraine. Biden took aim at Putin by mounting pressure through Russia's economy, including the two largest majority state-owned institutions, Sberbank and VTB. Russia issued a statement through its central bank assuring that the state has a plan to remain functioning regardless of the sanctions. ""All operations of banks in rubles will be carried out, and the corresponding services will be provided to all customers as usual,"" the statement said. ""All customer funds in foreign currencies are also held and can be withdrawn in the account currency. The Bank of Russia is ready to support banks with funds in rubles and foreign currency."" A majority of the bank's balance at each bank is measured in rubles, the statement insists, and ""maintain a high margin of stability."" Share this -







Some Russians share black squares on social media to indicate anti-war stance Some well-known Russians have posted black squares on social media to publicly indicate their opposition to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Black squares were shared to show solidarity with the protests in the U.S. after the death of George Floyd nearly two years ago. And Thursday, many Russians appeared to use the same tactic to show their support for the country's anti-war movement. Television host and comedian Ivan Urgant posted “Fear and pain. NO to war"" on Instagram, alongside a black square, for his 9.9 million followers. Maxim Galkin, a Russian singer and comedian, posted the same black square for his 9.4 million Instagram followers, writing: ""There can be no justification for war! No War!"" Two-time Olympic figure skating silver medalist Evgenia Medvedevа wrote over a black background on her Instagram story, ""I hope this all ends as soon as possible, like a bad dream,"" placing a white dove emoji below the text for her 1.3 million followers. Former television host Xenia Sobchak, whose father was a mentor to Putin, posted the black square to Instagram for her millions of followers. ""We are all now locked in this situation. No exit. We, the Russians, will be dealing with the consequences of today for many years to come,"" she wrote. Share this -

Conductor Valery Gergiev, a Putin supporter, replaced ahead of Carnegie Hall performance Russian conductor Valery Gergiev, a known friend and supporter of Putin’s, will no longer lead a series of concerts this weekend at Carnegie Hall. Carnegie Hall and the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra announced Thursday that the Canadian conductor Yannick Nézet-Séguin will step in for Gergiev, leading the orchestra in three concerts at Carnegie Hall from Friday through Sunday. No reason was cited for Gergiev’s removal from the program; his relationship with Putin reflects the global denunciation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Daniel Froschauer, the orchestra’s chairman, called Gergiev a gifted artist and said he would take the podium for the Carnegie dates. “He’s going as a performer, not a politician,” Froschauer said. Carnegie Hall and the orchestra also said the Russian pianist Denis Matsuev, who had been scheduled to perform with Gergiev and the orchestra Friday, would not appear. Share this -







Russian forces have moved closer to Kyiv, fired more than 160 missiles, says U.S. defense official Russia has launched more than 160 missiles since it began striking Ukraine, a senior U.S. defense official said. Russian troops, meanwhile, have moved closer to Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, the official said Thursday, adding that the country has also sent additional airborne troops to Kharkiv, where fighting is ongoing. As part of its response to Russia's aggression and in support of its NATO allies, the U.S will deploy 7,000 more troops to Germany from Fort Carson, Colorado, the Defense Department said.

U.S. sanctions also target Belarus for supporting Russia The new round of sanctions against Russia that Biden unveiled Thursday also targets another country: Belarus. The measures take aim at Belarusian state-owned banks and the country's defense and security industries, as well as a number of its ""regime-connected officials and elites,"" for their support of Russia's invasion, according to the Treasury Department. The White House said in a statement, ""We call on Belarus to withdraw its support for Russian aggression in Ukraine."" Biden announced the latest round of sanctions just hours after the United Kingdom slapped similar sanctions on Belarus, as well as Russia. Other U.S. allies are expected to follow suit. Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus and a close ally of Putin's, said Thursday that troops from his country could be used in further Russian military operations in Ukraine if necessary, local media reported.

U.S. expels No. 2 ranking Russian diplomat The second-highest ranking Russian diplomat is being expelled from the U.S. in retaliation for a similar move made by Russia earlier this month, a senior State Department official told NBC News Thursday. Sergey Trepelkov is the second-highest ranking diplomat at the Russian Embassy in Washington, D.C., under Ambassador Antoly Antonov. The move is not a response to the Ukraine invasion, the State Department official said, but is instead a counter to Russia ousting U.S. Deputy Chief of Mission Bart Gorman earlier this month. Gorman had not completed his three-year diplomatic tour before being told to leave Russia. “We believe it is critical that our countries have the necessary diplomatic personnel in place to facilitate communication between our governments,” the official said. “However, we will not let actions like this go without a response and today, we have announced our response.” Share this -

Putin using false 'Nazi' narrative in attack on Ukraine, experts say Putin peddled accusations of Nazi elements within Ukraine on Thursday to justify the Russian attack, a move that experts slammed as slanderous and false. In announcing he had launched Russian forces against key Ukrainian military and logistics posts, Putin said he's striving for ""the demilitarization and denazification"" of the sovereign democracy in Kyiv. David Harris, the CEO of the American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group, said he's confident that Putin's Nazi narrative ""won't work."" ""First, Ukraine is led by a Jewish president, who was overwhelmingly chosen by voters in a democratic election. It reflects today's Ukrainian mindset and outlook, a far cry from the past,"" Harris said. ""And second, the ones behaving like Nazis are, let's be clear, Putin and his regime. Brazenly invading another country, invoking fake grievances, lying incessantly and denying another nation's right to chart its own destiny are all, yes, taken from the Nazi playbook.""

European leaders not interested in pulling Russia out of SWIFT, Biden says Pulling Russia out of the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or SWIFT, is not an option European leaders are currently pursuing, Biden told reporters on Thursday. ""The sanctions that were proposed on all their banks have equal consequence — maybe more consequences — than SWIFT number one,"" Biden said. ""Number two, it is always an option. But right now, that's not the position that the rest of Europe wishes to take."" SWIFT is a secure messaging system that links more than 11,000 financial institutions in over 200 countries and territories. Removing Russia from the coalition would prevent the country from making most international transactions but could also hurt other economies. Share this -

Biden announces stronger round of sanctions against Russia Biden on Thursday announced a new, stronger round of sanctions against Russia in response to the nation’s invasion of Ukraine that he said are designed to “maximize the long-term impact” on the country. “Putin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war. And now he and his country will bear the consequences,” Biden said during a speech from the White House. The sanctions, undertaken in conjunction with U.S. allies, will “stunt the ability to grow and finance” the Russian military and will include new limits on what can be exported to Russia. 'Putin is the aggressor': Biden announces sanctions in response to Russian attacks on Ukraine Feb. 24, 2022 04:23 The new round of sanctions will target four additional major Russian Banks, including VTB, a state-owned bank in Russia and the second-largest bank in Russia. The measures will not include removing Russian from SWIFT, Biden said. Biden added that the U.S. and its allies would add names to the list of Russian elites and their family members” who have already been targeted individually with sanctions. Share this -

McConnell says U.S. must ensure Ukrainians are ""fully armed,"" calls for tougher sanctions McConnell: Biden should 'ratchet the sanctions all the way up' against Russia Feb. 24, 2022 02:18 Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., on Thursday said that the U.S. must ensure Ukrainians are ""fully armed"" in the fight against Russian forces as he called for tougher sanctions against Moscow. “A combination of perception of weakness and a yearning for empire is what led to the war in Ukraine,"" McConnell told reporters in Louisville, Kentucky. “Ratchet the sanctions all the way up. Don’t hold any back. Every single available sanction should be employed. There’s no such thing as a little invasion.” He also stressed the importance of ensuring that Ukraine has the military capabilities to counter Russia's aggression. “If the Ukrainians have the willingness to fight, and we’re going to find that out starting today, we need to make sure they’re fully armed and able to use every available weapon that will help inflict maximum damage on the Russian forces,"" he said.

On TikTok, livestreams show protests — and attract scams Livestreams on TikTok are bringing a first-person view of the conflict from all over Europe — but some of the streams purporting to come from Ukraine appeared to be fake. Some of the livestreams appear to be authentic, showing crowds gathered in major cities to protest Russian aggression. But other TikTok users are pretending to be in Ukraine, using doctored or dubbed footage of other places in an attempt to solicit followers and monetary donations. One account, which called for donations through TikTok, featured a livestream of a line of houses in a residential area as the sounds of gunshots, sirens and people screaming for help could be heard in the background. But that account hours earlier had posted a different angle of the same street in which cars with U.K. license plates were visible. Other videos posted to TikTok appear to be recycling old video and passing it off as coming from Ukraine. In one video viewed almost 20 million times on TikTok and posted about two hours after the first reports of shellings in Ukraine, a soldier is seen parachuting out of an airplane. “Bro is recording an invasion,” the top comment reads. The video is from a training exercise, first posted to an Instagram account by a user with the same username on April 6, 2016. The user on TikTok was seen later on Tuesday livestreaming on his couch.

Schiff calls for increased sanctions against Russia, says he expects bipartisan support Rep.

Ukraine invasion jeopardizes U.S.-Russia space cooperation Russia's invasion of Ukraine is already causing tension in the space community, one of the few global arenas in which the U.S. and Russia still cooperate. In a statement posted Wednesday on Twitter, Dmitry Rogozin, the director general of Russia’s space agency, hinted at tensions but said he values cooperation with NASA. “We greatly value our professional relationship with NASA, but as a Russian and a citizen of Russia I am very unhappy with the openly hostile policy of the U.S. towards my country,” Rogozin said, according to a translation. Rogozin also tweeted “Glory to Russia!” on Monday, after Russian President Vladimir Putin gave a televised speech with misleading claims that Ukraine is “historically Russian land” and false claims the country has fallen into the hands of neo-Nazis and corrupt “puppets” controlled by the West. NASA said in a statement that the agency is carrying out spaceflight operations as normal: “NASA continues working with Roscosmos and our other international partners in Canada, Europe, and Japan to maintain safe and continuous International Space Station operations.” Share this -

Russian disinformation, propaganda ramp up as conflict in Ukraine grows Russia’s effort to spread disinformation and propaganda across the internet and through foreign and domestic media about its invasion of Ukraine started weeks ago — and it’s expected to ramp up now that the conflict has begun. Disinformation experts say that they have seen a concerted effort from Russian leaders and state-backed media to push a false narrative around the reasons for invading Ukraine, and that they expect that to continue as both international pressure and even some domestic Russian resistance to war grows. “We’re going to see a huge onslaught,” said Jane Lytvynenko, senior research fellow at Harvard University’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy. “And we need to be prepared for that.” Lytvynenko said people should be prepared for a wide variety of disinformation and propaganda, including the use of authentic images and video to push false narratives.

Russia isolated as 'Iron Curtain' falls down, Zelenskyy says Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy offered citizens details of military resistance in his latest update on Thursday, while continuing to urge Russian citizens to push back in protest against Putin.

U.S. defense official: Russians 'making a move' on Kyiv The Russian invasion of Ukraine has so far focused on three main axes of assault – all of which have been assessed to have the intention of taking key population centers – and Putin's forces are ""making a move on Kyiv,"" a senior defense official told NBC News. The first axis is a south-to-north approach from Crimea to Kherson; the second axis is a north-central to south approach from Belarus to Kyiv; and the third axis is a northeast to south approach occurring around Kharkiv, where the heaviest fighting is currently occurring, the official said. The official disclosed the information as part of an operational update on the situation in Ukraine. Russia is “making a move on Kyiv,” the official said, adding that the the U.S. assessment of Putin’s actions indicate that Russia has “every intention of basically decapitating the government and installing their own method of governance.” “We have not been surprised so far with what we have seen them do,” the official said. “It is very much in line with what was expected.” Russia’s actions so far indicate that its invasion is still only in its initial phase, the official said. Russia’s military operation will include multiple phases, but the U.S. does not currently know how many phases the invasion will include – or how long the phases will take. Share this -







SWIFT banking system could be used as sanction against Russia. What is it? In recent weeks, President Joe Biden has threatened Russian President Vladimir Putin with ""severe economic consequences"" and sanctions like ""he's never seen"" if Russia invades Ukraine. Now, with Putin taking military action against Ukraine, Biden and U.S. allies may consider imposing one of the harshest financial penalties against Russia: kicking it out of the SWIFT banking system. But doing so, which some financial analysts have likened to a ""nuclear option,"" would be an unprecedented move against one of the world's largest economies. The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or SWIFT, is a cooperative of financial institutions formed in 1973 and headquartered in Belgium. It is overseen by the National Bank of Belgium with cooperation from other major central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve System, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank.

Putin says he is fighting a resurgence of Nazism. That's not true. Putin's rationalization for invading Ukraine includes a claim that he is fighting neo-Nazism. ""It is not surprising that Ukrainian society was faced with the rise of far-right nationalism, which rapidly developed into aggressive Russophobia and neo-Nazism,"" Putin said Monday, suggesting that NATO countries are backing neo-Nazis. While it's true that the Ukrainian National Guard is home to the Azov Battalion — a force populated by neo-Nazis — there is no evidence to suggest widespread support for such extreme-right nationalism in the government, military or electorate. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is Jewish; three of his family members were killed in the Holocaust. In the most recent Ukrainian parliamentary elections in 2019, a coalition of ultranationalist right-wing parties failed to win even a single seat in the Rada, the country's 450-member legislature. And for several years, U.S. appropriations laws have included a provision banning spending in support of the Azov Battalion. But in accusing Ukraine of pro-Nazi sentiment, Putin is playing to generations-old scars from World War II, when his country was allied with the U.S., Britain and other countries in defeating the Axis powers. According to the World War II museum in New Orleans, an estimated 24 million Russians died in that war. Share this -

He has absolutely no right to invade Ukraine’s sovereign borders and impose Russia’s will on the freedom-loving people of Ukraine,"" Cramer said in a statement. “We needed sanctions months ago to ward off exactly this type of action.

U.N. Secretary General urges Putin to halt attack on Ukraine United Nations Secretary General António Guterres urged Putin to stop his troops from invading Ukraine in a speech on Wednesday night. Guterres said he never believed the rumors that Russia would invade and thought nothing serious would happen, but ""I was wrong and I would like not to be wrong again today,"" he said during an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting. ""So, if indeed an operation is being prepared I have only one thing to say from the bottom of my heart,"" said Guterres, according to a real-time UN translation. ""President Putin stop your troops from attacking Ukraine, give peace a chance, too many people have already died."" @POTUS is closely monitoring the developments in Ukraine and he will continue receiving regular updates from Jake Sullivan, his National Security Advisor. He also spoke with his UN Ambassador, Linda Thomas Greenfield before the UNSC meeting this evening. — Jen Psaki (@PressSec) February 24, 2022 Share this -
