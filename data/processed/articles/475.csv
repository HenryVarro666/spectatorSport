On Day 23 of the war, Russian troops did not make any significant gains on any front on Thursday. Ukrainian counterattacks, particularly in the Kyiv area, inflicted “heavy casualties” on the Kremlin’s forces, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW).

Incessant Ukrainian counterattacks are forcing Russia to divert a large number of troops to defend their own supply lines, said the United Kingdom’s Defence Ministry in its daily update. “This is severely limiting Russia’s offensive potential.”

“Reluctance to maneuver cross-country, lack of control of the air and limited bridging capabilities are preventing Russia from effectively resupplying their forward troops with even basic essentials such as food and fuel,” added the report.

Ukrainian forces continued to repel Russian efforts to encircle Kyiv and the southern city of Mykolaiv. But the cities of Kharkiv, Chernihov, Sumy and Mariupol are encircled and under constant shelling.

In the west, the mayor of Lviv said that several missiles had struck near the airport before dawn on Friday. A plume of smoke could be seen in the area, reported EL PAÍS correspondent Luis de Vega. Lviv, a city of 700,000 residents, is located near the border with Poland and until now it had been considered a safe place for Ukrainians fleeing other parts of the country.

In the south, some reserve forces of the Russian naval fleet that is stationed near the port city of Odessa were deployed to Mariupol in what appears to be an effort to support the ongoing assault there, said the ISW.

In the east, Russia said on Thursday that separatist forces in the Donbas region captured several towns after making limited territorial gains.

March 17 | The Russian invasion has stalled

The Russian invasion of Ukraine has “largely stalled on all fronts,” according to the United Kingdom Defense Ministry’s latest intelligence report. Moscow’s forces have made minimal progress on land, sea and air in recent days and continue to suffer heavy losses, said the report. “Ukrainian resistance remains staunch and well coordinated. The vast majority of Ukrainian territory, including all major cities, remains in Ukrainian hands.”

Russian troops failed to make any progress on any of their four fronts: the attempt to encircle the capital Kyiv, the assault on Kharkiv, the advance on Donetsk and the capture of Mariupol. There were also no significant gains in the push west from Kherson.

Russian troops conducted several unsuccessful attacks northwest of Kyiv on Wednesday, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). There were no major ground operations in Chernihiv, Sumy or Kharkov, three cities that the Russian army is attempting to encircle.

In the meantime, Russian forces continued to pound civilian targets. According to Ukrainian authorities, a theater in Mariupol that was being used as a shelter was struck on Wednesday, and at least 10 people died while lining up for bread in Chernihiv. Before dawn on Thursday emergency services also reported an attack against a residential building in Kyiv.

The United States estimates that 7,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in Ukraine in these past three weeks, according to information published by The New York Times. There could be an additional 14,000 to 21,000 injured out of a total of 150,000 troops, according to the Pentagon’s calculations. This casualty rate could make it difficult for combat units to carry out their tasks.

March 16 | Advances in the Kherson province

The Russian advance in Ukraine has been slowing for several days now when compared to the early stages of the offensive. The Russian troops have not carried out simultaneous attacks on the different fronts since March 4, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). The biggest Russian advances in the last day were in the south of the country, where Russian troops have been mounting a series of attacks from Kherson, toward Zaporizhzhia.

In the south, the Russian Defense Ministry stated on Tuesday that it had taken control of the Kherson province, although the ISW limited that advance to certain areas in the northeast of that area. This move could be aimed at surrounding Zaporizhzhia, something that seems unlikely, at least until this front can receive reinforcements from the Russian troops that are currently trying to force the surrender of Mariupol, in the east of the country.

Russian troops are encountering difficulties in replacing the losses that they are suffering, according to British intelligence services. This difficulty is impeding the invading troops from consolidating positions that they have secured as well as from carrying out multiple offensive operations, given the Ukrainian resistance.

In the east, the outskirts of Mariupol – which is located on the coast of the Sea of Azov – have suffered constant Russian air and artillery attacks, both in residential areas and on civil infrastructure. The ISW believes that the surrender of Mariupol will be the next turning point in the conflict, given that the Ukrainian defenders of the city are likely to be left without ammunition or drinking water in “the near future.”

The capture of this city, which has been under siege practically since the start of the offensive, would free up Russian troops that the army could send to the east of Zaporizhzhia and toward the area of the Ukrainian coast that Russia is yet to control: Odessa. This port city was bombed last night by a number of Russian ships, according to Anton Yuriiovych, an advisor at the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs.

On the outskirts of Kyiv, the Russian troops launched a number of attacks on different areas in the northwest of the capital, while on the eastern flank of the city, the combat units continued to receive reinforcements.

March 15 | Russian troops make no progress towards Kyiv

There were no significant changes to the situation on the ground. Russian forces launched several attacks northwest of the capital, Kyiv, and unsuccessfully attempted to bridge the Irpin river, according to the ISW.

The Russian army did not advance east of Kyiv and might be lacking sufficient troops to renew the offensive on that front for a few days. According to Rochan Consulting, an independent defense consulting firm, Russian soldiers were held back by Ukrainian forces in Brovary, northeast of the capital.

Airstrikes on Kyiv continued on Monday, when a projectile hit a residential building in the northern neighborhood of Obolon. There were more strikes on Tuesday and two residential buildings in the districts of Podilsk (northwest) and Osokorky (southeast) were reportedly hit, according to Ukrainian emergency services.

In southern Ukraine, Russian troops resumed their attacks from Kherson toward Mykolaiv but Ukrainian forces were able to contain them, according to the ISW.

In recent days, Ukrainian citizens have staged public protests in Kherson, Melitopol and Berdiansk against the Russian occupation. According to the UK Defense Ministry, Russia may be trying to organize a “referendum” in Kherson in a bid to legitimize the area as a “separatist republic” similar to Donetsk or Luhansk, in eastern Ukraine, which Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized as republics shortly before launching the invasion.

March 14 | Russia secures positions in the Donbas region

The Russian army conducted few ground offensives on Sunday save for the Donbas region, where it secured new positions in Donetsk and Luhansk, according to the latest report by the ISW. Operations were renewed on Monday, however, when Ukrainian emergency services reported that two people were killed in an airstrike against a residential building northwest of the capital, Kyiv.

In the east, Moscow’s forces launched several attacks in the area extending north of the besieged city of Mariupol. The Ukrainian army said the Russians have captured several towns but that their own forces were able to repel an offensive in Volnovaja, a town of 21,000 residents located between the Sea of Azov and the city of Donetsk, around 40 miles (65 km) from Mariupol. Volnovaja has been hard hit by airstrikes in recent days.

In the south, the British Defense Ministry said that Russia has established a distant blockade of Ukraine’s Black Sea coast, thereby isolating the country from international maritime trade. Russian naval forces are continuing to carry out missile strikes against targets in Ukraine, said the ministry in its latest intelligence update. “Russia has already conducted one amphibious landing in the Sea of Azov and could look to conduct further such operations in the coming weeks,” said the report.

In the west, there were Russian airstrikes against military facilities near the border with Poland.

March 13 | Airstrikes hit western Ukraine

Russian airstrikes hit targets around 15 miles (25 km) from the border with Poland, which is a member of the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Ukrainian authorities said Russia launched around 30 missiles against a military base in Yavoriv, near Lviv, a major city in western Ukraine. Following the Friday attacks on Ivano-Frankivsk and Lutsk, this represents the third Russian offensive in an area that up until this weekend had been deemed relatively safe for Ukrainians fleeing the country as well as for the delivery of Western resources to the local army.

Around Kyiv, Russian troops renewed their attacks with the goal of encircling the city. The New York Times reported on street-by-street battles in suburbs such as Irpin, west of the capital.

Even so, the Russian army did not appear to have gained new territory. Logistical problems, growing losses and Ukrainian counter-attacks have been slowing down Russian forces’ advance, according to the ISW. This would explain why they have not launched a major attack on Kyiv in recent days, although new troops appeared to be deploying on this front.

There was no progress towards Kyiv from other directions, either. Russian forces have for days been trying to capture Chernihiv (north). Near Sumy (northeast), Ukrainian forces said they had attacked and destroyed several Russian vehicles. In Kharkiv (east), the second largest city in the country, the front had barely moved while the fighting and the Russian airstrikes continued.

In the south, Ukrainian authorities said Russian troops have captured suburbs east of Mariupol, which has been under intense attack for days. It is here that Russian bombs destroyed a hospital’s maternity ward. According to the ISW, the Kremlin’s goal is not to march into the city with its troops, but to keep up the airstrikes and isolate the city in order to force its citizens to surrender. Ukraine said that a convoy carrying 90 tons of food and medicine is already on its way to Mariupol.

March 12 | The Russians are massing forces to encircle Kyiv

Russian troops have made no progress for a week. In the last 48 hours they tested the Ukrainian defenses west of Kyiv without success. They failed to take Kharkiv, made no progress on their path towards Mykolaiv or Zaporizhzhia, and same near Donetsk and Luhansk, according to the ISW.

In Kyiv, Putin’s troops continued to try to encircle the city, attacking on three flanks. The fighting continued in the northwest, with Russian soldiers around 15 miles from the city center, according to a British Defense Ministry intelligence report from Saturday. The vehicles in the enormous convoy that was detected 10 days ago appear to have dispersed, either to surround Kyiv or to be less vulnerable to Ukrainian attacks.

The Russians are also approaching Kyiv from the east, around Brovary. However, according to the ISW, their forces have not secured new territory and part of the contingent appears to have fallen back to defend against Ukrainian counterattacks in the Sumy region.

The cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Mariupol remain under siege and air bombardments. On Friday, Ukrainian authorities reported bombing in Mykolaiv.

In the south, Ukrainian forces halted Russian advances from Crimea, in the north and the west. Russian forces have been dealing with growing problems with supplies and troop morale, according to the ISW.

March 11 | “Limited” progress and new airstrikes

Russian troops have been making “limited” progress in Ukraine in recent days, according to British Defense Ministry intelligence reports. The invading ground forces have been dealing with logistical problems and with “strong Ukrainian resistance.” This pushback throughout the north of the country, from eastern Kyiv to the city of Sumy, continues to disrupt the Russian army’s efforts to move more troops towards Kyiv in order to encircle the city, according to the ISW.

On the 16th day of fighting, British intelligence reports said it was “highly unlikely that Russia has achieved the objectives outlined in its pre-invasion plan.” But Moscow is still expected to reorganize its forces for a renewed offensive, probably including attacks against the capital.

In eastern Ukraine, Russian troops bombed civilian areas in Dnipro, a city that had so far not come under attack, said Ukrainian emergency services. In the northwest, Russia claimed to have bombed and rendered inoperative the airbases of Ivano-Frankivsk and Lutsk. Local authorities in the latter municipality, which is near the Polish border, said they heard explosions during the night. Mikhaílo Podoliak, an advisor to the president of Ukraine, confirmed attacks on all three cities.

Meanwhile, Russian troops continued to put pressure on besieged cities like Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol. Ukrainian resistance in these enclaves is forcing Russia to devote more resources to them, slowing down their advance to other parts of the country, said the United Kingdom. The Russian Defense Ministry on Friday announced it will declare a ceasefire in the capital and in those four cities. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an overnight address that around 40,000 people had been evacuated on Thursday via humanitarian corridors.

March 10 | Russian troops test Kyiv’s defenses

Russian troops did not make significant progress. According to the British Defense Ministry intelligence reports, there was a notable drop in air operations thanks to an efficient Ukrainian defense.

In the north, Russian troops renewed their attempt to encircle Kyiv, and on Wednesday they tested the Ukrainian defenses at several points, as confirmed by the ISW and Rochan Consulting. According to Ukrainian information gathered on Tuesday, five Russian battalions launched an attack near Bucha, around 15 miles northwest of Kyiv. Four more battalions reportedly advanced on Yasnohorodka, 23 miles southwest of the capital’s center, in a bid to reach Kyiv from that direction as well. British intelligence on Thursday provided an update on a convoy of Russian vehicles first spotted northwest of Kyiv a few days ago, and which has made little progress over the past week; the convoy has reportedly suffered continuous losses.

Russian forces are besieging five cities, according to British intelligence reports: Chernihiv, Sumy, Konotop, Kharkiv and Mariupol. Hundreds of thousands of people are trapped in these locations without food, water, electricity or medicines.

After several unsuccessful attempts to establish a safe route to evacuate residents from Mariupol, Ukraine and Russia held another meeting on Thursday, but it ended without agreement. “Ukraine has proposed a humanitarian corridor to and from Mariupol and a ceasefire of at least one day to address the humanitarian problems of civilians. The Russian side did not agree. I am willing to continue negotiations,” said Ukraine‘s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba.

Satellite images published on Thursday by the private US company Maxar Technologies show the damage caused by Russia’s bombardment of key infrastructure in Mariupol, which has been in a critical situation for days.

March 9 | Few advances and new bombings

The Russian army continued to bomb Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Mariupol, some of Ukraine’s main cities, as it prepared for a siege of Kyiv.

The humanitarian crisis led both sides to agree to a 12-hour ceasefire starting early on Wednesday to provide some relief for the hundreds of thousands of people trapped in cities under attack. Ukrainian authorities said that they were only able to carry out evacuations in Sumy and Energodar.

In the south, Russian troops were apparently trying to reach Odessa, the main port on the Black Sea. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on social media that Russia has bombed a children’s hospital in Mariupol, a city where the situation is “apocalyptic” according to the Red Cross. The hospital has been destroyed, as seen in footage verified by this newspaper, and local authorities said that 17 people have been injured.

Near the capital, the most active front was in Irpin, in the western outskirts of Kyiv, where civilians have been hit by shelling in recent days. Russian troops did not make any gains, but they were reportedly concentrating their forces ahead of new operations. All analysts agree that Russia’s goal is to encircle Kyiv and force it to surrender.

In northeastern Ukraine, there was fighting in Chernihiv and in Sumy, two cities from which Russian troops are trying to create a communication line to Kyiv. In the east, British Defense Ministry intelligence reports talked about shelling in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second biggest city. From here, it is believed that Russian forces are seeking to connect with the troops currently deployed in the Donetsk and Donbas regions to create a large front in this part of the country.

March 8 | Supplies and reinforcements for the siege

Russian troop movement around Kyiv has several goals: surrounding the capital from several sides, accumulating supplies and reinforcements, and cutting off the city’s links to the outside world, according to the ISW. The Kremlin is reportedly massing tanks and men on two flanks: the northwest one, where it is trying to gain control of the cities of Irpin, 15 miles from the capital, and Bucha, three miles further north. On the eastern flank, the target is Brovary, a small town on the outskirts of Kyiv. In both cases, Russian soldiers are running into resistance from Ukrainians.

Shelling has also been reported in the last two days around 59 miles south of the capital, in the city of Bila Tserkva. This could be an attempt to reach Kyiv from a front where there was little activity in previous days, according to the Rochan Institute and The Guardian.

Irpin, a dormitory town of around 60,000 residents, has become a containment wall against Russia’s advance west of the capital. It was targeted for bombing at the beginning of the invasion and it has been the scene of fighting over the past week.

Russian soldiers may be using “siege-and-starve” tactics on the city, using a strategy that was already used in Syria, according to the ISW. The goal is to get the population to surrender by preventing water and food from coming in, said Ukrainian authorities.

Last Sunday, images of civilians killed by artillery fire as they were trying to flee Irpin created greater pressure for humanitarian corridors to evacuate people and bring in supplies. Attempts at establishing safe passages failed on Monday, but were established on Tuesday in Sumy and Irpin. Around 150 people had fled the latter city in the early morning hours, according to local authorities.

In the east, fighting continued in major cities such as Kharkiv and Sumy, where a bomb attack killed at least 10 people according to Ukrainian authorities. The city of Mariupol is reportedly surrounded by Russian troops.

In the south, a bloody battle took place on Monday for control over the city of Mykolaiv, according to The New York Times. This is a key port on the Black Sea and would help Moscow prepare its attack on Odessa. If it manages to take both cities, Russia will have almost total control over the country’s access to the sea.

Ukraine reported on Thursday that its soldiers have attacked Kherson airport as part of a counter-offensive aimed at driving Russian troops out of Kyiv and other key Ukrainian cities.

In the early days of the ongoing war, Russia seized the southern port city without any struggle. Control of Kherson allows Russia to reintroduce freshwater supplies to Crimea, which had been shut off by Ukraine following Russia's 2014 annexation of the peninsula. Furthermore, Ukraine's military announced yesterday that it had initiated a counter-attack in Kyiv and other vital cities, as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy requested the US Congress to provide more weaponry and mount economic pressure on Russia.

Overnight, the sound of distant shelling rang across Kyiv's centre, as Ukrainian forces appeared to launch a counter-offensive in the outlying towns of Irpin, Bucha, and Hostomel, which have been seriously battered by weeks of street warfare and artillery exchanges. On Wednesday, the city and its environments were subjected to an all-day curfew. The Ukrainian military also claimed to have launched an offensive south and east of Mykolaiv, Ukraine's southern port.

Russia-Ukraine War

Moscow has mostly remained silent on combat losses, claiming that the campaign is on track. Furthermore, a Russian bomb demolished the city's main drama theatre, where hundreds of citizens had sought refuge from shelling, according to local officials in the beleaguered southern port city of Mariupol. Officials reported a bomb shelter beneath the theatre was blocked by rubble, and the city had not yet recorded casualties.

Moreover, officials in Rivne, in western Ukraine, have boosted the death toll from an attack on a television tower earlier this week to 21 persons, up from nine on the day of the incident. At least ten persons in line outside a bakery in Chernihiv, Ukraine's northern city, were slain when an artillery fire landed nearby, according to Ukrainian media agencies. They were shot dead by Russian soldiers, according to the US Embassy's Twitter account.

This isn’t the sort of thing you expect to see from an invading army:

What’s this about? Instead of trying to take new territory, Russian invaders are now sweating Ukrainian counterattacks in the region. Look at what’s being reinforced (map from here):

You can see the little airport icon for Antonov International Airport in Hostomel, and I added the two other towns listed in that tweet, to the left of the map (and circled). In other words, they’re reinforcing the current front lines, under pressure from the current Ukrainian counteroffensive. You can rest assured similar defensive emplacements are going up on all those front-line towns in the area. Would be fun if Ukraine was able to cut off Russian defenders in Hostomel and Bucha. It’s critical that Russia is kept outside artillery range of central Kyiv.

Speaking of artillery range, being out of it makes all the difference to a city. We’ve been following Ukrainian counter-attacks in Southern Ukraine, and in particular the effort toward Kherson from Mykolaiv. Now free of the scourge of MLRS and other artillery barrages, life quickly returns to normal.

For weeks, Mykolaiv was on the front line. Now, with Ukrainian forces pressing a counteroffensive, the Russians have been pushed back and the port city’s 470,000 people are attempting a tentative return to normality. Coffee shops and some restaurants are open again. Supermarkets have been restocked with fresh groceries. Bank branches have reopened. Municipal buses and trams run the streets. Mothers with children play in playgrounds as the sound of artillery thuds in the distance. Fresh tulips and roses are available in a variety of shades in a row of downtown flower shops.

Reports state that Russia’s besieging army retreated to Kherson, so it might be too well-defended at this point for a head-on assault. Troops in town have been digging in since earlier this week. Ukraine might be happy enough to just free Mykolaiv from most daily terror. And I emphasis “most,” because cruise missiles hit an army barracks that killed at least 40 soldiers. Perhaps it’s small consolation that at least this time, Russia actually targeted a military facility.

Down in Mariupol, hopes of rescue were dashed by Ukrainian general staff, which announced that the closest Ukrainian troops were at least 100 kilometers away. The city should’ve fallen on the first day of the war. It’s a wonder it has lasted this long, and every day it holds out is another miracle. But those days are running out.

Finally, this is one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever seen:

7,dc0425b7-784e-4f8b-b21b-1612142d45b1,[],,"March 19, 3:00 pm ET

Ukrainian forces have defeated the initial Russian campaign of this war. That campaign aimed to conduct airborne and mechanized operations to seize Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odesa, and other major Ukrainian cities to force a change of government in Ukraine. That campaign has culminated. Russian forces continue to make limited advances in some parts of the theater but are very unlikely to be able to seize their objectives in this way. The doctrinally sound Russian response to this situation would be to end this campaign, accept a possibly lengthy operational pause, develop the plan for a new campaign, build up resources for that new campaign, and launch it when the resources and other conditions are ready. The Russian military has not yet adopted this approach. It is instead continuing to feed small collections of reinforcements into an ongoing effort to keep the current campaign alive. We assess that that effort will fail.

The ultimate fall of Mariupol is increasingly unlikely to free up enough Russian combat power to change the outcome of the initial campaign dramatically. Russian forces concentrated considerable combat power around Mariupol drawn from the 8th Combined Arms Army to the east and from the group of Russian forces in Crimea to the west. Had the Russians taken Mariupol quickly or with relatively few losses they would likely have been able to move enough combat power west toward Zaporizhiya and Dnipro to threaten those cities. The protracted siege of Mariupol is seriously weakening Russian forces on that axis, however. The confirmed death of the commander of the Russian 150th Motorized Rifle Division likely indicates the scale of the damage Ukrainian defenders are inflicting on those formations. The block-by-block fighting in Mariupol itself is costing the Russian military time, initiative, and combat power. If and when Mariupol ultimately falls the Russian forces now besieging it may not be strong enough to change the course of the campaign dramatically by attacking to the west.

Russian forces in the south appear to be focusing on a drive toward Kryvyi Rih, presumably to isolate and then take Zaporizhiya and Dnipro from the west but are unlikely to secure any of those cities in the coming weeks if at all. Kryvyi Rih is a city of more than 600,000 and heavily fortified according to the head of its military administration. Zaporizhiya and Dnipro are also large. The Russian military has been struggling to take Mariupol, smaller than any of them, since the start of the war with more combat power than it is currently pushing toward Kryvyi Rih. The Russian advance on that axis is thus likely to bog down as all other Russian advances on major cities have done.

The Russian military continues to commit small groups of reinforcements to localized fighting rather than concentrating them to launch new large-scale operations. Russia continues to commit units drawn from its naval infantry from all fleets, likely because those units are relatively more combat-ready than rank-and-file Russian regiments and brigades. The naval infantry belonging to the Black Sea Fleet is likely the largest single pool of ready reserve forces the Russian military has not yet committed. Much of that naval infantry has likely been embarked on amphibious landing ships off the Odesa coast since early in the war, presumably ready to land near Odesa as soon as Russian forces from Crimea secured a reliable ground line of communication (GLOC) from Crimea to Odesa. The likelihood that Russian forces from Crimea will establish such a GLOC in the near future is becoming remote, however, and the Russian military has apparently begun using elements of the Black Sea Fleet naval infantry to reinforce efforts to take Mariupol.

The culmination of the initial Russian campaign is creating conditions of stalemate throughout most of Ukraine. Russian forces are digging in around the periphery of Kyiv and elsewhere, attempting to consolidate political control over areas they currently occupy, resupplying and attempting to reinforce units in static positions, and generally beginning to set conditions to hold in approximately their current forward positions for an indefinite time. Maxar imagery of Russian forces digging trenches and revetments in Kyiv Oblast over the past several days supports this assessment.[1] Comments by Duma members about forcing Ukraine to surrender by exhaustion in May could reflect a revised Russian approach to ending this conflict on terms favorable to Moscow.

Stalemate will likely be very violent and bloody, especially if it protracts. Stalemate is not armistice or ceasefire. It is a condition in war in which each side conducts offensive operations that do not fundamentally alter the situation. Those operations can be very damaging and cause enormous casualties. The World War I battles of the Somme, Verdun, and Passchendaele were all fought in conditions of stalemate and did not break the stalemate. If the war in Ukraine settles into a stalemate condition Russian forces will continue to bomb and bombard Ukrainian cities, devastating them and killing civilians, even as Ukrainian forces impose losses on Russian attackers and conduct counter-attacks of their own. The Russians could hope to break Ukrainians’ will to continue fighting under such circumstances by demonstrating Kyiv’s inability to expel Russian forces or stop their attacks even if the Russians are demonstrably unable to take Ukraine’s cities. Ukraine’s defeat of the initial Russian campaign may therefore set conditions for a devastating protraction of the conflict and a dangerous new period testing the resolve of Ukraine and the West. Continued and expanded Western support to Ukraine will be vital to seeing Ukraine through that new period.

Key Takeaways:

We now assess that the initial Russian campaign to seize Ukraine’s capital and major cities and force regime change has failed;

Russian forces continue efforts to restore momentum to this culminated campaign, but those efforts will likely also fail;

Russian troops will continue trying to advance to within effective artillery range of the center of Kyiv, but prospects for their success are unclear;

The war will likely descend into a phase of bloody stalemate that could last for weeks or months;

Russia will expand efforts to bombard Ukrainian civilians in order to break Ukrainians’ will to continue fighting (at which the Russians will likely fail);

The most dangerous current Russian advance is from Kherson north toward Kryvyi Rih in an effort to isolate Zaporizhiya and Dnipro from the west. Russian forces are unlikely to be able to surround or take Kryvyi Rih in the coming days, and may not be able to do so at all without massing much larger forces for the effort than they now have available on that axis;

The Russians appear to have abandoned plans to attack Odesa at least in the near term.

The Ukrainian General Staff continues to report Russian efforts to find and deploy reinforcements to fight in Ukraine as well as continuing problems of morale and discipline in the Russian military. The Ukrainian General Staff reported on March 19 that Russia was redeploying elements of the 40th Separate Naval Infantry Brigade and the 155th Separate Naval Infantry Brigade, both from the Eastern Military District, to “replenish the losses of the Eastern Military District group” in Belarus.[2] The Ukrainian General Staff reports that Russian soldiers are continuing to desert and refuse orders.[3] The General Staff renewed warnings on March 19 that the Russians might use false flag attacks or other staged provocations to justify further conscription and mobilization in Russia.[4] Such actions would not generate additional usable combat power for many months. The Russian military might even struggle to train new conscripts to standard given losses, including those sustained by the 437th Training Regiment as reported in our previous update.[5]

The Russian military is increasing its aerial, missile, and artillery bombardment of populated Ukrainian areas as its conventional mechanized advances culminate.[6] Russia announced the use of its Kinzhal hypersonic missile to strike an ammunition depot in Ivano-Frankivsk on March 18.[7] The use of such an expensive, rare, and high-end system to hit an ammunition depot was likely signaling and demonstrating intent and capability to escalate rather than seeking to achieve a concrete military objective. The Kinzhal is a dual-use missile that can carry a nuclear payload, although the one used in Ukraine bore a conventional high-explosive payload.[8] Its use likely signaled Moscow’s willingness to consider using low-yield nuclear weapons in addition to demonstrating the capability to use hypersonic weapons.

We do not report in detail on the deliberate Russian targeting of civilian infrastructure and attacks on unarmed civilians, which are war crimes, because those activities are well-covered in Western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. We will continue to evaluate and report on the effects of these criminal activities on the Ukrainian military and population and specifically on combat in Ukrainian urban areas. We utterly condemn these Russian violations of the laws of armed conflict, Geneva Conventions, and humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports.

Russian forces are engaged in four primary efforts at this time:

Main effort—Kyiv (comprised of three subordinate supporting efforts);

Supporting effort 1—Kharkiv; Supporting effort 1a—Luhansk Oblast;

Supporting effort 2—Mariupol and Donetsk Oblast; and

Supporting effort 3—Kherson and advances northward and westward.

Main effort—Kyiv axis: Russian operations on the Kyiv axis are aimed at encircling the city from the northwest, west, and east.

Subordinate main effort along the west bank of the Dnipro

The Russians have likely abandoned plans to encircle Kyiv from the west or to assault to seize the city from the west in the coming weeks. They are instead likely seeking to set conditions for an expanded artillery and missile bombardment of the city by moving into effective artillery range of its center.

Russian forces remained in a defensive posture to the west and northwest of Kyiv. Satellite imagery provided by Maxar Technologies shows Russian armored vehicles dug into defensive revetments near Antonov Airfield as of March 17.

Russian 152 millimeter self-propelled howitzers have a maximum range of close to 25 kilometers.[9] Russian forces are within that distance of Kyiv’s center in some places, but consolidated Russian positions around Antonov Airfield, for example, are outside the optimal range ring for targeting central Kyiv. The Russians reportedly attempted to cross the Irpin River and seize the town of Mochun, just inside this range-ring, on March 18 but were defeated.[10] The suburb of Brovary on the eastern bank of the Dnipro is within range, a fact that may help explain the Russians’ tenacity in trying to secure their positions in that location.

Subordinate supporting effort — Chernihiv and Sumy axis

There were no significant changes to the situation on this axis in the past 24 hours. We have updated our map to show expanded Russian areas of controlled terrain based on more detailed reporting from the Ukrainian General Staff and other sources. The expanded areas of assessed Russian control in our map of March 19 DO NOT INDICATE THAT THE RUSSIANS HAVE MADE FURTHER GAINS, ONLY THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED SUFFICIENTLY DETAILED AND RELIABLE REPORTING OF PREVIOUS GAINS TO ADJUST OUR MAP. The Ukrainian General Staff reported on March 18 that up to three Russian brigades remained in defensive positions around Chernihiv city.[11] The Ukrainian General Staff also noted that roughly three Russian brigades remain in positions in the eastern suburbs of Kyiv on March 18 but had taken no significant actions in the past 24 hours.[12]

Supporting Effort #1—Kharkiv:

Russian forces, mainly drawn from the 6th Combined Arms Army and the Northern Fleet, did not engage in notable activity around Kharkiv City on March 19.[13] The Ukrainian General Staff reported on March 18 that the Russians were reinforcing their positions near the city with two elements of the 6th Combined Arms Army and the 1st Guards Tank Army.[14] The General Staff reports that Russian forces continue to press Sumy and Izyum and warns that they are preparing a renewed drive from Kharkiv west toward Kyiv and Poltava, among other locations at some unspecified time.[15]

Supporting Effort #1a—Luhansk Oblast:

Russian forces continued their assault on Rubizhne, northwest of Severodonetsk, on March 18 and 19 and have secured areas in the western and northwestern outskirts according to the Ukrainian General Staff.[16] They are also continuing offensive operations at Popasna, southwest of Severodonetsk, likely in an effort to blockade Severodonetsk itself.[17]

Supporting Effort #2—Mariupol and Donetsk Oblast:

Russian forces continued their grinding block-by-block advance into Mariupol on March 19, although without apparently making much new progress.[18] The Russians continue to attack civilian targets with air, missile, artillery, and even tank main gun rounds.[19]

Supporting Effort #3—Kherson and advances northward and westwards:

Russian forces appear to have abandoned efforts to cross the Southern Bug and establish a ground line of communication toward Odesa for the time being. The Ukrainian General Staff reports that Russian troops near Mykolayiv focused on establishing logistics systems but did not conduct major offensive operations on March 19.[20] Russian forces have instead continued their advance toward Kryvyi Rih, hometown of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, about 130 kilometers west of Zaporizhiya.[21] The head of Kryvyi Rih’s military administration described the situation and recent Russian efforts to advance on the city on March 19.[22] Russian forces attempted to land an aircraft at the city’s airport, he reported, but failed. They then began advancing with armored columns of 10-20 vehicles each (likely the mechanized companies of a one or more battalion tactical groups). They have since formed an extended front line that they are fortifying, he said.

Immediate items to watch

Russian forces will likely capture Mariupol or force the city to capitulate within the coming weeks;

Russia will expand its air, missile, and artillery bombardments of Ukrainian cities;

Russian forces will likely continue efforts to reach Kryvyi Rih and isolate Zaporizhiya;

Russian forces around Kyiv will continue efforts to push forward into effective artillery range of the center of the city;

Russian troops will continue efforts to reduce Chernihiv and Sumy.

8,dc0425b7-784e-4f8b-b21b-1612142d45b1,"['Michael Levenson', 'Megan Specia', 'Edward Wong', 'Michael Schwirtz', 'Marc Santora', 'Ivan Nechepurenko', 'Victoria Kim', 'Mauricio Lima', 'Hikari Hida', 'The New York Times']",2022-03-18,"WASHINGTON — President Biden warned President Xi Jinping of China on Friday of “implications and consequences” if Beijing decides to give material aid to Russia to support its war in Ukraine, the White House said.

During a nearly two-hour video call, Mr. Biden laid out for Mr. Xi the punishments the United States and its allies had imposed on Russia after it invaded Ukraine last month, said a senior U.S. official, who spoke to reporters on the condition of anonymity to more freely discuss the diplomatic exchange. And he made the case, officials said, that China would pay a similarly heavy price if it backed President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in the fight, less than two months after Mr. Putin and Mr. Xi declared a partnership in facing off against the United States and the West.

“He made clear what the implications and consequences would be if China provides material support to Russia as it conducts brutal attacks against Ukrainian cities and civilians,” Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Friday afternoon. She declined to say how Mr. Xi responded or give details on the costs the United States has threatened to impose on Beijing.

The call was the culmination of an effort to cut off Russian appeals to China for help, as its invasion plan runs into trouble. Mr. Biden’s national security adviser issued a similar warning to his Chinese counterpart in Rome earlier in the week, setting up the video call on Friday between the two leaders.

In conversations this week, administration officials said they were concerned Beijing would try to appease both sides, publicly urging calm while quietly fueling the Russian effort and nurturing its relationship with Mr. Putin. Some of them pointed to how China had dealt with North Korea — calling for it to rein in its nuclear weapons program, but providing energy and other support to make up for United Nations sanctions.

The measures against Russia have also mainly taken the form of sanctions, but on a scale that appeared to surprise Mr. Putin, blocking him from even accessing much of the foreign reserves he had amassed in an effort to “sanctions-proof” the Russian economy. The effects have rippled outward, bringing the ruble to new lows and forcing credit agencies to warn that the Russian Federation was on the brink of default on its sovereign debt.

In its public messages, the White House is implying that the United States could impose what are called “secondary sanctions” on China, the world’s second-largest economy. Of course, unlike Russia, China’s size and economic reach mean penalties against it could reverberate in a much bigger way across the global economy, and various governments and companies could lobby heavily against such sanctions.

The conversation took place at a key moment in the war, just as Russia is seeking to take Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, and expand control of the southern coast. But the Russian military is reeling from high casualties — 7,000 or more Russian soldiers killed, according to a conservative American intelligence estimate — and the discovery of critical gaps in its prowess.

U.S. officials have warned that Mr. Putin is hoping to secure economic help, military hardware and rations for troops from China. American officials have leaked those findings, perhaps to both embarrass Mr. Putin and put China’s leadership on the spot.

U.S. and European officials see China’s role in the conflict as critical, and decisions by Mr. Xi could push the war in different directions — perhaps toward a cease-fire or more robust diplomatic talks, or toward renewed momentum by the Russian forces in their deadly offensive. Mr. Xi, who has built a bond with Mr. Putin over years, gave no indication he would help seek a diplomatic solution, according to an official Chinese readout of the call.

That summary emphasized the friction between China and the United States over Taiwan before addressing Ukraine. It said Mr. Xi pointed out that “the situation in Ukraine has developed to this point, which China does not want to see.” He reiterated standard talking points that China would provide humanitarian aid and that Russia and Ukraine should hold peace talks. Mr. Xi did not suggest any role China could play in ending the war, and instead said the United States and NATO should talk to Russia to resolve the crisis.

Mr. Xi also used a phrase he and other Chinese officials have previously employed when blaming troubles on the United States: “Let he who tied the bell on the tiger take it off.”

Tensions between the United States and China have grown since the invasion because of Beijing’s persistent alignment with Moscow, even as the Russian military kills thousands of Ukrainian civilians.

On Thursday, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken delivered his strongest public warning yet to China, saying the United States “will not hesitate to impose costs” if China gives military aid or other support to Russia. He and other officials say China’s strategy is to keep up a pretense of neutrality while siding with Russia.

Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden’s national security adviser, gave similar warnings to Yang Jiechi, a top Chinese foreign affairs official, when the two met in Rome on Monday. U.S. officials told reporters a day before those talks that Russia had asked China for military and economic aid after it began its war, and a Pentagon official said there were indications China was leaning toward obliging Russia on military support.

China could be held responsible for violating international law if it gives military aid to Russia, according to two prominent law professors, Oona A. Hathaway of Yale and Ryan Goodman of New York University.

Washington is also watching for any signs China might try to help Russia blunt the effect of the sanctions imposed by the United States and its European and Asian allies. Large Chinese companies will likely avoid overtly violating those sanctions for fear of jeopardizing their global commerce.

“China does not want its struggling economy to be hit by sanctions, and the Biden administration is mindful of the economic fallout of imposing them,” said Daniel R. Russel, a former assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs.

China analysts doubt Mr. Xi will distance himself from Mr. Putin. The two have met 38 times as national leaders and developed a bond that is highly personal. They share a major strategic interest in trying to weaken American power. At their last meeting, just two weeks before Mr. Putin’s invasion, they issued a 5,000-word statement that said their partnership had “no limits” and that they intended to stand together against U.S.-led democratic nations.

For weeks, Chinese officials have blamed the United States for the war and echoed Mr. Putin in criticizing NATO, while expressing concern for the humanitarian crisis. Chinese diplomats and state media organizations have amplified Kremlin propaganda and a conspiracy theory about Pentagon-funded bioweapons labs in Ukraine.

On Wednesday, Xue Hanqin, the Chinese judge at the International Court of Justice, sided with the Russian judge in dissenting from a ruling that Russia must immediately end its war in Ukraine. The vote was 13 to 2.

Hours before the call on Friday, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, kept up a combative tone. Asked by a reporter about China’s views on civilian casualties in Ukraine, he said, “As the culprit of the Ukraine crisis, why does the U.S. keep smearing China instead of reflecting on the security predicament in Europe caused by the eastward expansion of U.S.-led NATO?”

China’s refusal to condemn Russia’s atrocities and its endorsement of Russia’s views on NATO have made European nations more suspicious of Beijing. Leaders of nations in the European Union, one of China’s largest trading partners, talk about China in increasingly hostile tones, a situation that could worsen if Mr. Xi continues his support of Mr. Putin.

“China has a strategic opportunity to tie itself to the global order, which has fueled its economic growth,” said Alina Polyakova, the president of the Center for European Policy Analysis in Washington. “Or it could make an ideological decision to align itself with Russia.

“In the end the Russian economy is not the golden goose for China’s growth,” she said. “It is Western countries.”

But Kevin Rudd, the former Australian prime minister and the current president of the Asia Society in New York, said that “China saw today’s call as an opportunity to not only wash Beijing’s hands of responsibility for ending Putin’s blitzkrieg in Ukraine, but to also continue to paint the United States as responsible for Russia’s actions in the first place.”

He noted that when Mr. Xi told Mr. Biden to “Let he who tied the bell on the tiger take it off,” he was referring to the United States.

“But the fact is that China is the only power capable of getting Putin to withdraw,” Mr. Rudd said, “and it is unwilling to do so.”

Starting in November, American officials began sharing intelligence about Russia’s troop buildup around Ukraine with Chinese officials and urged them to ask Mr. Putin not to invade, but were repeatedly rebuffed, U.S. officials have said. A Western intelligence report said senior Chinese officials asked senior Russian officials in early February to delay an invasion of Ukraine until after the Winter Olympics in Beijing, U.S. and European officials have said.

On Friday, Taiwan’s defense ministry confirmed reports that a Chinese aircraft carrier, the Shandong, sailed through the Taiwan Strait just hours before Mr. Biden and Mr. Xi spoke. Taiwan remains the most sensitive and intractable issue between China and the United States. Mr. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has underscored questions over whether China would try to invade the democratic island, which is claimed by Beijing but has never been under Communist Party rule.

The Taiwanese defense ministry declined to comment on reports that a U.S.-guided missile destroyer shadowed the carrier for part of its route.

The United States provides defensive equipment to Taiwan and maintains “strategic ambiguity,” meaning it leaves open whether it would send its military to defend Taiwan if China tries to invade.

A U.S. official said Mr. Biden reiterated to Mr. Xi on the call that the United States abided by the “One China” policy, which acknowledges but does not endorse Beijing’s insistence that Taiwan and China are part of the same country.

The word “children” had been written in large white letters in Russian in front of the building and behind it.

KYIV, Ukraine — A day after a Russian strike reduced to rubble a theater in southern Ukraine where hundreds of people had been huddling for shelter, rescuers wading through the debris — even as Russian shells kept falling — began pulling out survivors one by one.

“Adults and children are emerging from there alive,” Ukraine’s human rights ombudsman, Lyudmila Denisova, reported early Thursday as the rescue effort continued at the Drama Theater in Mariupol, a southern port city under siege by Russian forces.

But information was scarce from the desperate city, which has been squarely in Moscow’s cross hairs since the invasion began three weeks ago. With as many as a thousand people, many of them children, reported to have taken shelter at the theater and still unaccounted for, fears remained that whatever hope emerged from the rescue scene Thursday would eventually be eclipsed by despair.

“Our hearts are broken by what Russia is doing to our people, to our Mariupol,” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said in an overnight public address.

The rescue efforts at the theater came against a fearsome backdrop of thousands of civilian casualties across much of Ukraine. Taking heavy losses on the battlefield, Russian forces have increasingly been aiming bombs and missiles at towns and cities. Unable to capture urban centers, they are leveling them instead, and the toll on civilians is worsening.

In Mariupol, it was people sheltering in a theater where the word “children” was written in huge letters on the pavement on both sides of the building, clearly visible from the air. In Chernihiv, it was people waiting in a bread line. In Kyiv, it was a 16-story apartment building pierced by a missile fragment, and, amid the debris and broken glass outside, a man with a sweatshirt pulled over his head kneeling silently beside a body under a bloody sheet, holding a lifeless hand for several minutes and then staggering away in grief.

As a fourth consecutive day of peace talks Thursday yielded no announcements, and the United Nations Security Council held an emergency session on the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, Western officials portrayed the Russian advance as bogged down.

While Russian forces have made a bit of progress in the south and east, said one of the officials, they are stalled outside Kyiv, the capital, where they have taken heavy casualties and — perhaps most surprising — have failed to achieve dominance in the air. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence assessments.

Given all the setbacks, the Western officials said they were no longer confident that Russia planned a ground assault on Kyiv, a major objective. “An ill-judged assault on a city as well-prepared and well-defended as Kyiv would be a very costly business,” one said. They cautioned that Russia could still decide to assault the city or, failing that, strangle it in a prolonged siege.

As cruise missiles hammered their capital, Ukrainian fighters described several successful, if modest, counteroffensives against Russian forces.

To the east of Kyiv, in the suburban town of Brovary, the thrust of the counterattack focused on artillery, according to Lt. Pavlo Proskochilo, the military commander in the town. He said Ukrainian artillery strikes had in some places forced the Russians to dig in, assuming more of a defensive than offensive posture.

“We hit them in the teeth,” he said. “They are now waiting for reinforcements.”

It was not clear whether Ukrainian forces had actually forced the Russians to pull back in any location, and in outlying towns, the regular booms and thuds of artillery fire were constant through the day.

But it was not just soldiers vowing to take the fight to the invaders.

Outside the apartment building in Kyiv damaged by the missile, Tetiana Vaskovska, a 58-year-old lawyer, angrily surveyed the wreckage of what had been her home of 25 years.

“I know how to shoot,” she said. “Give me a gun.”

In recent days, an increasingly brutal war of attrition has been unfolding on the ground and in the air, with fierce battles raging in the suburbs of Kyiv, and Russian warships on the Black Sea launching missiles at towns around the southern city of Odessa. Eyewitness accounts, official statements and satellite imagery paint a picture of destruction on a vast scale. More than three million people have fled the country.

On Thursday, President Biden heaped unrestrained scorn on President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who ordered the invasion. A day after labeling Mr. Putin a war criminal, Mr. Biden, speaking at the Capitol, called him a “murderous dictator, a pure thug who is waging an immoral war against the people of Ukraine.” On Friday, Mr. Biden will speak with the president of China, Xi Jinping, and plans to warn Beijing not to aid Moscow, his spokeswoman said.

Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken suggested that Mr. Putin “may be growing more desperate,” and warned that Moscow might be preparing to use chemical weapons and had begun to kidnap local officials in Ukraine and replace them with Mr. Putin’s allies.

The House of Representatives voted, 424 to 8, to suspend normal trade relations with Russia, another blow to a country whose economy is already staggering under Western economic penalties.

In recent days, Mr. Zelensky has been taking his case directly to Western lawmakers, urging them to help Ukraine fight Russia. To the British Parliament he recalled the Nazis’ campaign of terror. To Congress, he spoke of Pearl Harbor. On Thursday, it was Germany’s turn: Mr. Zelensky, addressing the Bundestag, offered multiple references to German atrocities inflicted on Ukraine and Russia, among others, in World War II, and analogies to the Berlin Wall.

“You are like behind the wall again,” he said. “Not the Berlin Wall but in the middle of Europe, between freedom and slavery.”

A British intelligence report said that Russian forces have “made minimal progress on land, sea or air in recent days,” and that they “continue to suffer heavy losses.” U.S. assessments have put Russian military deaths at 7,000, though the figure cannot be independently confirmed.

If Russia has miscalculated, the cost may not be limited to the battlefields of Ukraine. On Thursday, President Emmanuel Macron of France, who once famously accused NATO of “brain death,” said that the war had reinvigorated it, giving the military alliance “an electric shock, a wake-up call.”

But for all their struggles, Russian forces are reported to have taken control of large sections of Ukraine, particularly in the east and south. In eastern cities controlled by Russia, witnesses described desolation and ruin, as well as looting by Russian troops, where tens of thousands of people had once lived.

In the eastern city of Volnovakha, the Russian defense ministry declared it “liberated,” but after weeks of bombardment, Moscow’s prize was a landscape of rubble and ash.

About 200 miles north of Mariupol, the city of Izyum has been surrounded by Russian forces for two weeks.

“No water, no light, no heat, no food, no medicine, no communication. The situation is no better than Mariupol,” the deputy mayor, Volodymyr Matsokin, wrote on Facebook. “There is no one to bury the dead.”

President Putin’s military setbacks in Russia’s war in Ukraine are mounting, with evidence emerging yesterday that he has lost at least 7,000 troops and more than 200 tanks in the conflict so far.

The Ukrainian side also says that it is now counter-attacking against stalled Russian positions as the invasion enters its fourth week. Moscow is having to summon troops from other deployments.

Russian forces were being held off last night both east and west of the capital, Kyiv, as well as in the second city, Kharkiv, despite a ferocious bombardment. The besieged city of Mariupol was resisting the Russian advance in the south, and the Ukrainian military said it was counter- attacking east of Mykolaiv and around Kherson, which is in Russian hands.
