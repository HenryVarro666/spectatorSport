BREAKING NEWS – Ukraine’s historic city of Korosten, in the Zhytomyr region, is currently under siege, according to reports, with videos showing a TV tower and checkpoint being wiped out on Wednesday, March 2.

A Russian airstrike killed two people and injured wounded five others when they hit a checkpoint in Korosten, according to the official Twitter account of the unicameral parliament of Ukraine, Verkhovna Rada.

The report was reiterated by an official Korosten information page on Facebook, which said: “There was an air attack on the checkpoint, there are wounded,” the statement read.

For a week now, Russia has been bombing cities in Ukraine in a war of aggression that violates international law. Hundreds of civilians have already been killed.

More and more people are fleeing west, the Ukrainian authorities are asking for aid supplies.

The humanitarian situation at a glance.

How are people doing in Ukraine:

More and more cities are shelled with Russian artillery.

The port city of Cherson has already been conquered, and the cities of Kharkiv and Mariupol could also soon fall to the Russians.

Many attacks are aimed at civilian infrastructure and residential areas, and the Ukrainian authorities are reporting more and more civilian deaths.

""Hundreds, if not thousands, of civilians have been killed or injured in the Russian offensive,"" said US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Washington.

The consequences for the population are ""staggering"".

The Russian military is attacking buildings and cities that ""are not military targets,"" he said.

""We have certainly seen in the past that one of Russia's methods of war is to be absolutely brutal and try to intimidate a country's citizens."" He predicts a further increase in suffering in the coming days.

To protect its population, the Kiev government is now demanding corridors through which people can be supplied with relief supplies.

Children must be brought to safety, and food, medicine and ambulances are urgently needed, says Mykhailo Podoliak, adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

""In the villages and towns where Russian troops are stationed, there is direct looting, robbery and murder.""

Ukraine also called on Russia to cease fire in the Kharkiv and Sumy regions to evacuate civilians.

In Korosten, north of the city of Zhytomyr, two people died in an airstrike on a large checkpoint, according to the administration.

Five people were injured.

Aid supplies are currently being brought into the country mainly by train.

Trains commute daily between the Czech Republic and the cities of Lviv in the west and Chop in the south-west of the Ukraine.

They bring humanitarian supplies on the way there and take women and children with them on the way back.

The situation for refugees:

More than a million people have fled Ukraine since the start of the Russian attack, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).

UNHCR chief Filippo Grandi warned on Twitter that those seeking protection urgently needed humanitarian assistance.

Most of those seeking protection are now staying in neighboring Ukrainian countries, above all in Poland, Romania and Hungary.

Many refugees travel via the Republic of Moldova - a detour because various Ukrainian highways have become unsafe due to the war situation.

Those who can travel on, including to Germany.

Poland has so far had around 575,100 refugees from the neighboring country, according to the border guard. On Wednesday there were around 95,000, and by Thursday morning at 7 a.m. another 27,100 people had crossed the border.

According to the border police, more than 139,000 refugees from Ukraine have arrived in Romania . Almost 88,000 of them have already traveled to another country, according to data from the border police.

The police in Hungary reported more than 125,000 people seeking protection since the beginning of the Russian invasion on Wednesday afternoon.

So far, the three countries have not asked for support at EU level in taking in the war refugees.

In view of the increase in refugees, the Czech Republic already declared a state of emergency from Friday.

This enables better coordination of aid in this crisis situation, said Interior Minister Vit Rakusan after a cabinet meeting on Wednesday evening.

Around 20,000 Ukrainians have arrived in the small EU country by train in the past few days.

Federal Interior Minister Nancy Faeser assumes that the EU heads of department will set the legal framework for the reception of refugees at their meeting today.

It will then take about a week before the guidelines are set in motion, says the SPD politician when she arrives at the council building in Brussels.

It is not yet foreseeable how many people will come to Germany from the war zone.

The goal for 2025: to activate and involve at least 1% of citizens in decision-making and promotion of reforms in Ukraine on a systemic basis for the well-being of Ukrainian communities. Today we work in 30 communities in Ukraine.

The Armed Forces of Ukraine are beginning to seize the initiative of the Russian occupiers in some areas. The enemy is trying to avoid direct clashes not only with the Ukrainian army but also with civilians who are blocking the movement of its columns.

In the Volyn direction, the enemy has lost the initiative and is not taking active action.

In the Polissya direction, the Russian occupiers continue to advance in the direction of Makarov – Brusyliv – Fastiv, and part of the forces – to Kyiv.

On the routes to Malyn and Irpin, they lost the offensive pace, suffered significant losses, and stopped at unfavorable borders.
