BERLIN, March 9 (Reuters) - Germany will certainly not send warplanes to Ukraine, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Wednesday, after the United States rejected an offer by Poland to transfer its Russian-made MiG-29 jets to a U.S. base in Germany as a way of helping Ukrainian forces.

Speaking at a joint news conference with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Scholz said Germany had provided all kinds of defence equipment and had sent weapons.

""But it is also true that we have to consider very carefully what we do concretely, and definitely warplanes are not part of that,"" said Scholz.

Ukraine has pleaded with Western nations to provide it with fighter jets to counter a Russian invasion that has forced more than two million refugees to flee the country.

Poland said on Tuesday it was ready to transfer all its MIG-29 jets to Ramstein Air Base in Germany and put them at the disposal of the United States and urged other NATO members to do the same. The Pentagon rejected the offer as not ""tenable"", while Russia said it would be dangerous. read more

Trudeau said his country was sending an extra C$50 million ($39 million) worth of equipment to Ukraine, including cameras used in drones.

""We want to de-escalate the conflict,"" Trudeau added.

Scholz and Trudeau said they had discussed energy cooperation, both in light of climate targets and the Ukraine crisis, which has highlighted Europe's, and particularly Germany's, dependence on oil and gas imports from Russia.

Canada is the world's fourth-largest oil producer and sixth-largest natural gas producer.

Scholz said Germany must diversify raw materials used by industry.

Asked if Germany was categorically opposed to a ban on Russian energy imports, Scholz said he had for several months been working on reducing its dependency on fossil fuel imports.

Ukraine’s top security official Oleksiy Danilov claimed on Wednesday 67 children had been killed since the Russian invasion began on February 24, as he urged Kyiv’s allies to enforce a no-fly zone over the country.

Ukrainian official: 17 wounded by air strike on Mariupol children’s hospital

A Russian air strike on a children’s hospital in Mariupol has injured 17 people, according to preliminary figures, a local official stated.

“So far there are 17 wounded personnel of the hospital,” Pavlo Kyrylenko said in a video posted on Facebook.

He added that “so far no kids were wounded” and there have been “no deaths”.

US: Russia still has about “90% of their available combat power” ready to use in Ukraine

Russia has about “90% of their available combat power still ready for their use” in Ukraine, a senior US defense official told reporters on Wednesday.

The US assesses Russia no longer has “several hundred vehicles of different stripes and sizes” available to them, but the US does not know if those vehicles were captured, destroyed or abandoned, the official noted..

US & UK rule out no-fly zone again

The top diplomats from the UK and the US have again ruled out establishing a no-fly zone over Ukraine, even a limited one to protect humanitarian corridors.

“The reality is that setting up a no-fly zone would lead to a direct confrontation between NATO and Russia,” Liz Truss told reporters.

“And that is not what we are looking at. What we are looking at is making sure that the Ukrainians are able to defend their own country with the best possible selection of anti-tank weapons and anti-air defence systems,” she added.

Antony Blinken echoed Truss’s remarks, saying that Washington’s aim is to end the war, not expand it.

WHO: Many Ukraine health centers have been attacked causing deaths, injuries

Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization (WHO), stated on Wednesday that the organization has verified 18 attacks in Ukraine against health facilities, health workers and ambulances, with 10 deaths and 16 injuries.

US warns Russia may be using ‘dumb’ bombs in Ukraine war

The United States has seen indications that Russia’s military is bombing Ukraine using so-called “dumb” bombs that are not precision-guided and would have limited ability to hit targets precisely, a senior US defense official said on Wednesday.

“We do have indications that the Russians are in fact dropping some dumb munitions,” the official stated, speaking on condition of anonymity, adding that the United States was observing “increasing damage to civilian infrastructure and civilian casualties”.

The comments came shortly after Ukraine accused Russia of bombing a children’s hospital in the besieged port of Mariupol. Moscow denies targeting civilians.

Blinken says Kremlin proposals to create humanitarian corridors into Russia ‘absurd’

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday stated Russia’s proposals to create humanitarian corridors from Ukraine to Russia are “absurd” as he called for Russia to allow civilians in Ukraine to leave safely.

“It’s offensive to suggest the Ukrainian people should seek refuge from the very government that has demonstrated such disregard for their lives,” Blinken told reporters following his meeting with UK foreign secretary Liz Truss in Washington.

Blinken said he is “absolutely convinced that Vladimir Putin will fail and Russia will suffer a strategic defeat”.

“As we’ve said before, you can win a battle, but that doesn’t mean you win the war – on the contrary. You can take a city but you can’t take the hearts and minds of its people and Ukrainians are demonstrating that every single day,” he added.

Truss: Putin ‘not making progress he’d planned’

Russian President Vladimir Putin is “not making the progress he’d planned”, UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said.

Speaking in a Washington press conference alongside US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the foreign secretary stated, “We have surprised Putin with our unity and the toughness of our sanctions… the brave Ukrainian people have surprised him with their unity and… leadership.”

“Now is not the time to let up – Putin must fail”, Truss has continued, adding, “If we do not do enough now ‘other aggressors around the world will be emboldened.”

She said by “letting up” its efforts in helping Ukraine, the UK “would be sending a message that sovereign nations can be trampled on”.

“Since the end of the Cold War we took our eye off the ball”, she added.

She noted the UK will supply air defense systems to Ukraine.

Ukraine claims 1,170 civilians have been killed in Mariupol since Russian invasion

At least 1,170 civilians have been killed in Ukraine’s besieged city of Mariupol since the start of the Russian invasion, a Ukrainian state information agency announced on Wednesday, citing figures from Mariupol’s deputy mayor.

“At least 1,170 people have been killed and 47 were buried in a mass grave today,” deputy mayor Serhiy Orlov was quoted as saying.

“People are without water, heat, electricity, gas, residents are melting snow to drink,” Orlov added.

Local mayor: Russians forces regrouping near Kharkiv

Russian forces appear to be regrouping near Kharkiv, according to the northeastern city’s mayor.

Speaking on live television, Ihor Terekhov described the situation in the area as very tense and stated Russian shelling was continuing.

Ukraine: Russia largely failed to respect civilian evacuation plans

Ukrainian interior ministry adviser Vadym Denysenko has said that Russia has largely failed to respect agreements to allow civilians to be evacuated from towns and cities through humanitarian corridors.

Evacuations took place from the cities of Sumy and Enerhodar, but not from the regional capital of Kharkiv and only partially in areas in the Kyiv region, he added.

EU says Russia reports of biolabs in Ukraine likely disinformation

The European Union said on Wednesday it doubted the credibility of Russian government claims it had uncovered a military biological programme in Ukraine, adding that Moscow had a history of spreading disinformation about biological weapons.

“The credibility of information provided by Kremlin is in general very doubtful and low,” EU foreign affairs spokesman Peter Stano stated.

“Russian disinformation has a track record of promoting manipulative narratives about biological weapons and alleged ‘secret labs’,” he said, adding that the EU was not aware of any Ukrainian laboratories not in line with international law.

In recent days, Russia has accused Ukraine of having tried to develop biological or nuclear weapons. On Wednesday, the Kremlin said Washington must explain “Ukrainian biological weapons labs”.

A Ukrainian presidential spokesperson noted, “Ukraine strictly denies any such allegation.”

US says “majority” of Ukrainian air fleet “still intact and operable”

The “majority” of the Ukrainian air fleet is still “intact and operable”, a senior US defense official told reporters on Wednesday.

“They do have fixed-wing aircraft available to them, still the majority of their fleet is still intact and operable,” the official said, adding that the airspace over Ukraine remains “contested”.

The official stated the reason the airspace over Ukraine remains “contested” is because Ukraine’s air defense systems “remains viable” and “effective”.

The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed Wednesday that 90% of Ukrainian military airfields are now out of action.

US: Russia launched 710 missiles against Ukraine

Russia has launched 710 missiles against Ukraine since the start of the invasion, and Russian forces have gotten closer to the cities of Kharkiv and Mykolaiv, according to a senior US defense official.

Russian forces gained 20 km (or 12 miles) in the last day and are just outside Kharkiv now, said the official. Additionally, Russia is about 15 km (9 miles) to the north of Mykolaiv.

There have been “no significant movements” by Russian forces towards Kyiv or Chernihiv, though there continues to be “a lot of fighting” near Chernihiv, added the official.

Zelensky accuses Russian forces of ‘direct strike’ on Mariupol hospital complex

Ukraine’s president has accused Russian forces of carrying out a “direct strike” on a hospital complex in Mariupol that reportedly houses maternity and children wards.

“People, children are under the wreckage,” Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted, calling the attack an “atrocity”.

“How much longer will the world be an accomplice ignoring terror? Close the sky right now! Stop the killings! You have power but you seem to be losing humanity,” he added.

Zelensky also shared footage from the scene of the alleged strike which appeared to show several wrecked rooms along a corridor in a building that had blown-out windows. Outside of the building, a square carpeted with rubble and debris could be seen.

Ukraine’s FM says Russia holding 400,000 people ‘hostage’ in Mariupol

Ukraine’s foreign minister has accused Russia of holding more than 400,000 people hostage in Mariupol.

“Indiscriminate shelling continues,” Dmytro Kuleba tweeted, adding that nearly 3,000 newborn babies currently lack medicine and food.

He went on to reiterate earlier calls for foreign intervention to end Russia’s offensive, which has seen Moscow’s forces pound Mariupol with aerial attacks.

Conditions in the city are reportedly desperate, with water, power and heating supplies all cut off.

Several attempts in recent days to establish humanitarian corridors through which citizens can safely be evacuated have failed.

Mariupol city council claims children’s hospital destroyed by Russian bombing

A children’s hospital in Mariupol has been destroyed by Russian air raids, according to the city council.

“The Russian occupying forces have dropped several bombs on the children’s hospital. The destruction is colossal,” the council claimed.

It did not provide any information about possible casualties.

Russia claims 90% of Ukraine’s military airports containing majority of its air force knocked out

90 percent of Ukraine’s military aerodromes containing the majority of the country’s Air Force have been knocked out of operation, and part of its fleet of aircraft has flown to Romania and is not taking part in any combat, Russian Defence Ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov has claimed.

“At the start of the special operation, the Ukrainian Air Force had as many as 250 serviceable combat aircraft and helicopters. Russia’s Aerospace Fores have destroyed 89 combat aircraft and 57 helicopters on the ground and in the air,” Konashenkov added.

Ukraine’s Air Force has also nearly completely run out of first and second class military pilots, and is limiting flights to individual attempts to mount missions, according to Konashenkov.

Russia has destroyed 81 radar stations from Ukraine’s air defence troops, causing a loss of battlefield control and a dramatic deterioration in the country’s air defence capabilities, which have been reduced to only a local capability to resist, the MoD spokesman noted.

Russian forces have destroyed a total of 2,786 pieces of Ukrainian military infrastructure since the start of the operation, Konashenkov said. 49 facilities, among them two command and control points, six air defence systems, four caches of ammunition and fuel, and 37 areas of concentration of military equpment were destroyed in the course of operations Wednesday, he continued. The MoD spokesman stated Ukrainian losses include 953 tanks and other armoured vehicles, 101 rocket artillery systems, 351 pieces of artillery and mortar systems, 718 military vehicles, and 93 drones. He also indicated that 137 Ukrainian S-125, S-300 and Buk-M1 air defence systems had been destroyed, with these losses constituting over 90 percent of Ukraine’s air defence systems.

Russia acknowledges conscripts deployed to Ukraine

Russia’s Defence Ministry has acknowledged that some conscripts have participated in the war in Ukraine days after President Vladimir Putin denied that was the case.

The defence ministry announced that some of the conscripts had been taken prisoner by Ukrainian forces. But it claimed that “practically all” such individuals deployed to neighbouring Ukraine had now been pulled back to Russia.

All Russian men aged 18-27 must by law do a year’s military service, although there are some exceptions to that rule.

Putin stated earlier this week that only professional soldiers and officers had been deployed as part of Moscow’s offensive.

Report: Mariupol dead being buried in mass grave

Local authorities in Mariupol are burying their dead in a mass grave, the Associated Press has reported.

With the city under steady bombardment, officials had been waiting for a chance to allow individual burials to resume. But with morgues overflowing, and many corpses uncollected at home, they decided they had to take action.

A deep trench some 25 meters (80 feet) long has been opened in one of the city’s old cemeteries in the heart of the city, according to the AP. Social workers brought 30 bodies wrapped in carpets or bags on Wednesday, after 40 were brought on Tuesday.

The dead include civilian victims of shelling on the city as well as some soldiers. Workers with the municipal social services have also been collecting bodies from homes, including some civilians who died of disease or natural causes.

No mourners were present and no families said their goodbyes, AP reported.

Ukrainians say evacuation convoy blocked

The city council of Bucha, just north of Kyiv, has accused Russian forces of blocking the evacuation of people through an agreed evacuation corridor.

“The occupants are disrupting the evacuation. Currently, 50 buses are blocked by Russian military in the parking lot: do not give passage to the column,” the city council said in a brief Facebook post.

“Negotiations are ongoing to unlock traffic.” “We remind you that the “green corridor” was an agreement at the highest level,” it added.

Ukraine claims Russian shelling disrupts evacuation of Izyum

A planned evacuation of civilians from the Ukrainian town of Izyum in the eastern Kharkiv region has been held up by Russian shelling, according to the region’s governor.

An evacuation route from Izyum to Lozova was one of the six humanitarian corridors announced by Kyiv earlier on Wednesday, but Oleh Synehubov said buses were still waiting at the entrance to the town and hence had not been able to ferry people out.

He added that negotiations with the Russians were under way with the support of the Red Cross.

UK sending Ukraine more anti-tank weapons to defend against Russian troops

Britain is increasing its supply of weapons systems to Ukraine in “response to further acts of aggression by Russia”, UK Defence Minister Ben Wallace said Wednesday.

Britain has now supplied 3,615 anti-tank weapons to Ukraine, and will also shortly be supplying a small consignment of Javelin anti-tank missiles, he told lawmakers in parliament.

Wallace added the “initial supply was to be 2,000 New Light anti-tank weapons, small arms and ammunition”, but that has been increased and the UK will continue to deliver more.

“We will shortly be starting the delivery of small consignment of anti-tank Javelin missiles,” he said adding that all weapons are considered to be “defensive systems”, and are “calibrated not to escalate to a strategic level”.

The UK is also considering supplying Ukraine with Starstreak high velocity anti-air missiles in response to their request. The ministry of defence believes that this system “will remain within the definition of defensive weapons, but will allow the accredit force to better defend their skies”.

Russia has only been successful in one of its original objectives in Ukraine, according to UK intelligence and failed to take out Ukrainian air defenses, Wallace continued.

“The Ukrainian armed forces have put up a strong defense while mobilizing the whole population. President Putin’s arrogant assumption that he would be welcomed as the Liberator has deservedly crumbled as far as his troops morale,” he added.

UN nuclear watchdog says Chernobyl power cut has no critical impact on safety

The loss of power at the Chernobyl plant does not have any critical impact on safety at the site, the UN’s nuclear watchdog announced.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) tweeted that the “heat load of spent fuel storage pool and volume of cooling water at Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant [are] sufficient for effective heat removal without [the] need for electrical supply”.

Dutch PM says ‘not possible’ for EU to cut off Russian energy supplies immediately

Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has said it is not possible for the EU to immediately cut off Russian supplies of oil and gas to the bloc.

“We have to discuss our vulnerabilities in terms of our dependency on Russian oil and Russian gas. I would not plead for cutting off our supply of oil and gas from Russia today; it’s not possible because we need the supply and that is the uncomfortable truth”, Rutte stated during a joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris.

“But we can do more to get the green agenda going, to decarbonise our economies”, he added.

G7 energy ministers to hold emergency meeting on 10 March

The energy ministers of the G7 countries will hold an emergency meeting on Thursday due to rising energy prices, UK Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Kwasi Kwarteng stated.

Earlier, Kwarteng noted that the UK would stop importing Russian oil and oil products by the end of 2022.

According to him, this transition will give the market, businesses and supply chains more than enough time to replace Russian imports, which make up 8% of UK demand.

German chancellor: No fighter jets will be sent to Ukraine

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that Berlin would continue financial support for Ukraine, but “no fighter jets” would be delivered.

“We have organized support, as you know, it is about financial assistance that we started many years ago to strengthen the stability of the Ukrainian economy. We have continued this now in a crisis, there is a lot of financial support, we have launched humanitarian efforts, provided all possible military supplies, and as you know, a separate weapon that we informed about,” the chancellor stated at a briefing in Berlin when asked whether Berlin supported the delivery of MiG-29 fighters from Poland to Ukraine, and whether they were ready to provide a military base in Ramstein for this.

He added that “in addition, we must decide very precisely what exactly we are doing, obviously, no fighters jets belong to this”.

EU tells citizens to lower heating

The European Union’s (EU) High Representative for Foreign Policy Josep Borrell has asked citizens to turn down the heating in their homes, as one way for the bloc to cut its dependence on Russian gas amid the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.

“The challenges we face are going to require a very tough stance and we have to be willing to pay the price,” Borrell stated, suggesting, “European citizens lower the heating of their homes,” as part of their “individual effort to cut gas consumption.”

Russia’s ruble continues its slide as new curbs restrict access to foreign currency

Russia’s currency continued its descent on Wednesday as trading in the ruble was restarted on the Moscow Exchange. But in an effort to stanch the currency’s decline, the Russian central bank issued an order further restricting access to US dollars.

The Central Bank of Russia said owners of foreign-currency accounts in Russian banks will be allowed to withdraw only up to $10,000 in dollars (regardless of the currency in the account), and the rest would have to be taken out in rubles.

New foreign-currency accounts can be opened, but only rubles will be permitted to be withdrawn. The order will be in place until Sept. 9, the central bank added. Until then, banks cannot sell foreign currency to Russians either.

Kyiv calls for ceasefire amid efforts to restore power at Chernobyl

Ukraine’s foreign minister has called on Russia to urgently observe a temporary ceasefire in order to allow work to take place to restore power to the defunct Chernobyl nuclear power plant, saying radiation could be leaked if an electricity outage at the site continues.

“Reserve diesel generators have a 48-hour capacity to power the Chornobyl NPP. After that, cooling systems of the storage facility for spent nuclear fuel will stop, making radiation leaks imminent,” Dmytro Kuleba tweeted.

Radioactive substances could be released from Chernobyl after power switched off

Radioactive substances could be released from Ukraine’s Chernobyl nuclear power plant after its power connection was severed, Ukraine’s state-run nuclear company Energoatom has said.

Work to repair the connection and restore power to the plant, which has been occupied by Russian troops, has not been possible because fighting is under way, it added.

Ukraine has claimed that the power cut could affect the cooling system, though this remains unclear.

Any decision to give fighter jets to Ukraine must be taken jointly by all NATO countries, Poland’s prime minister has said during a visit to the Austrian capital Vienna.

“We did not agree to supply planes by ourselves, because it must be the decision of the whole of NATO,” Mateusz Morawiecki added.

Russia: World would like to know what US biolabs in Ukraine were doing

The Kremlin hopes that efforts to shed light on the operation of US laboratories in Ukraine will be successful. The whole world would like to know what exactly they were doing there, presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday.

“This issue is of great importance, of course. Possibly, it is important to the whole world. It is to be hoped that it will be possible to shed light on the activity of these facilities in Ukraine, which in fact were run by US specialists,” Peskov continued, adding, “Apparently, the whole world would like to have an idea what these facilities’ tasks were.”

Moscow: Russia controls nuclear facilities in Ukraine to prevent provocations

Russia took control over a number of nuclear facilities in Ukraine to prevent nuclear provocations on the part of militants, this threat does actually exist, Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said at a briefing on Wednesday.

“During the special operation by the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, control was established over the Chernobyl and Zaporozhye nuclear power plants and adjacent territories. This move was undertaken exclusively to prevent Ukrainian nationalist and other terrorist formations as well as foreign mercenaries from taking advantage of the situation that shaped in the country to organize nuclear provocations, and these risks really exist,” the diplomat added.

Kuleba cool on expectations ahead of talks with Lavrov

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has said he has limited expectations for planned talks with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov.

Kuleba confirmed in a video statement that the pair would hold discussions in Turkey on Thursday and urged Lavrov to approach the talks “in good faith, not from a propagandistic perspective”.

“But I will say frankly that my expectations of the talks are low,” he continued, adding, “We are interested in a ceasefire, liberating our territories and the third point is to resolve all humanitarian issues.”

Russia says it boycotted ICJ hearing because of ‘absurd’ lawsuit

Russia’s Foreign Ministry has said Moscow boycotted a hearing this week at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) over a lawsuit brought by Ukraine because of the “absurdity” of the case.

Ukraine on Monday requested the UN’s top court order Russia to halt its offensive, arguing Moscow had wrongly tried to justify its invasion on false assertions.

The ICJ, based in The Hague, has announced it will rule on the case “as soon as possible”.

Russia is not expected to comply with any decision ordering it to stop its attack.

US waging ‘economic war’ on Russia

The US is waging “economic war” on Russia, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has announced.

“The United States has declared economic war on Russia and it is de facto waging this war,” Peskov told reporters, with the Russian government scrambling to impose measures to limit the economic fallout of the sanctions.

Speaking in Moscow, Peskov said Russia will “defend its interests” in the face of Western imposed sanctions.

He added that Poland’s offer to send MiG jets to Ukraine would create a “highly undesirable and a potentially dangerous scenario”.

Zelensky says no-fly zone is needed to avert humanitarian catastrophe

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the international community would be responsible for a mass “humanitarian catastrophe” if it did not agree a no-fly zone to protect his country.

In a daily televised address, he stated the threat level in Ukraine was at a maximum nearly two weeks into Russia’s invasion but Ukrainians had shown they would never give in.

“Russia uses missiles, aircraft and helicopters against us, against civilians, against our cities, against our infrastructure. It is the humanitarian duty of the world to respond,” he continued.

“When will there be a decision? Look, we’re at war!” he noted, adding, “We ask you again to decide as soon as possible. Send us planes.”

France: World heading for 1973-type energy shock

The spike in energy prices caused by Russia’s war in Ukraine will produce effects comparable to the 1973 oil shock, French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire has warned.

The current energy crisis was “comparable in intensity, in brutality, to the oil shock of 1973,” Mr Le Maire told a conference in Paris.

“In 1973, as you know, the response caused an inflationary shock, leading central banks to massively increase their rates, which killed off growth,” he added, noting that “this has a name: stagflation, and it’s precisely what we want to avoid in 2022”.

The first oil shock in the early 1970s was caused by the Yom Kippur war when Egyptian and Syrian forces launched an offensive against Israel.

Six Arab members of the OPEC oil cartel declared an embargo on exports to countries supporting Israel, notably the United States. They quadrupled the oil price to $11.65 a barrel, provoking recessions in Western countries and steep inflation.

UK: Ukraine crisis a ‘wake-up call’ for democracies

“The Ukraine crisis is a wake-up call for free democracies,” British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss wrote on Twitter.

Erdogan: Turkey aims to end suffering of Ukrainian civilians

Turkey sees it as a responsibility to end the suffering of Ukrainian civilians and has been striving to establish diplomatic contacts in this regard, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan stated, adding that “fascist practices” against Russians cast a shadow over Ukraine’s legitimate struggle.

Addressing his ruling Justice and Development Party (AK Party) meeting in the Parliament in the capital Ankara, he underlined that Turkey rejects moves resembling a ‘witch-hunt’ against Russian people, literature, students and artists.

“Fascist practices” against Russians cast a shadow over Ukraine’s “legitimate struggle”, he underscored.

Kyiv unaware of what’s happening at occupied nuclear plants

Ukraine’s energy minister has warned the country’s authorities do not know what the current radiation levels are at the defunct Chernobyl nuclear power plant as they have received no information regarding the site since it was seized by Russian troops.

EU: New anti-Russia sanctions will target over 100 individuals

New EU sanctions against Russia will target some 100 individuals, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Wednesday.

“We need to continue increasing pressure through the options that we have.

I hope that this package will be adopted before the end of this session today,” Borrell added.

UN: 2.1-2.2 million people have now fled Ukraine

The number of people fleeing Ukraine since the Russian invasion began has probably now reached 2.1-2.2 million people, the head of the United Nation’s refugee agency UNHCR has said.

United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi told a news conference during a visit to Stockholm that “the time is now to try to help at the border”, rather than discussions on the division of refugees between countries.

Grandi added that non-EU-member Moldova in particular was very vulnerable in the current situation.

Civilians start leaving Ukraine’s Sumy in private cars

Moscow: Russia’s special operation does not seek to overthrow Ukrainian government

Russia’s special military operation is not aimed at overthrowing Ukraine’s current government or destroying its statehood but seeks to protect the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics (DPR, LPR), demilitarize and denazify Ukraine, as well as to eliminate military threats for Russia, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said at a briefing on Wednesday.

“The special military operation seeks to protect the DPR and LPR, demilitarize and denazify Ukraine, eliminate the military threat for Russia that is coming from Ukraine’s territory due to the activities of NATO countries there and attempts to pump the country with weapons. The operation is not aimed at occupying Ukraine, destroying its statehood or overthrowing the current government. It is not directed against civilians,” she pointed out.

Zakharova added that Russia had to keep explaining its goals amid “the disinformation and bogus stories that Western intelligence agencies are creating in the Western media.”

It comes as the UN said Belarus is crushing dissent and blocking victims of rights abuses from seeking justice, hitting out at a “situation of complete impunity” in the country.

“The authorities’ extensive and sustained actions to crush dissent and repress civil society, independent media and opposition groups, while at the same time shielding perpetrators, points to a situation of complete impunity in Belarus,” UN human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, announced in a statement following the publication of a new report on the situation inside Belarus.

Moscow says Bioweapon labs in Ukraine prove Washington criminal activity

Research conducted in US laboratories in Ukraine corroborates US illegal and criminal activity in that Eastern European country, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told the Sputnik radio station on Wednesday commenting on the corresponding statement by US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland.

“Yesterday, Victoria Nuland, in response to a question by American legislators, confirmed the existence of not just the laboratories in question but, as they actually call it, research. And she uttered a remarkable phrase – that is, the very body of evidence that was needed, which we now have – that they [the US] were doing everything so that these materials wouldn’t end up in Russia’s hands. We don’t have to guess what kind of materials those are, there is nothing to guess here anymore. These are the materials that prove the US’ illegal and criminal activity on Ukrainian soil,” the diplomat stated.

22 people killed in residential bombing

A humanitarian corridor out of the besieged Ukrainian city of Sumy will continue to function on Wednesday, regional governor Dmytro Zhyvytsky said.

About 5,000 people rode buses out of the north-eastern city on Tuesday after Moscow and Kyiv agreed on the corridor, he added, and about 1,000 cars were also able to leave, moving towards the city of Poltava.

The Sumy-Poltava corridor was the only one that functioned on Tuesday. Although Russia had announced it would also allow civilians to leave Kyiv and the cities of Kharkiv, Mariupol and Chernihiv, the sides accused each other of failing to implement those deals.

Zhyvytsky stated the city’s residential area had been bombed overnight, with one bomb killing 22 civilians.

Congressional leaders have reached a bipartisan deal providing $13.6bn to help Ukraine and European allies plus billions more to battle the pandemic as part of an overdue $1.5 trillion measure financing federal agencies for the rest of this year.

Russian MoD makes public documents confirming preparation by Kiev of offensive operation in Donbass

Russia’s Ministry of Defence has made public documents confirming preparation by Kiev authorities of an offensive operation in Donbass in March.

“In the course of a special military operation, secret documents of the command of the National Guard of Ukraine came into the possession of the Russian military. These documents confirm covert preparation by the Kiev regime of an offensive operation in Donbas scheduled for March 2022,” said official representative of the Russian Defence Ministry, Major General Igor Konashenkov.

Russia’s MoD well remembers the statements made by the Kiev regime, circulated in February by the Western media, about alleged absence of any plans for the armed seizure of the Lugansk and Donetsk People’s Republics (LPR, DPR) and Ukraine’s purported desire to resolve all issues allegedly “by political and diplomatic means”, he added.

“However, the originals of the secret military documents of the National Guard of Ukraine clearly prove the falsity of those statements,” stated Konashenkov.

Moscow: EU sanctions against Russia cause enormous damage to EU citizens

The EU sanctions against Russia cause enormous damage to EU citizens, Dmitry Birichevsky, director of the Russian Foreign Ministry’s Department of Economic Cooperation, said in an interview with Sputnik.

“The EU continues to call for a further increase in sanctions pressure on Russia. Such a policy of the West is based on logic that is completely divorced from reality,” Birichevsky stated.

He added Moscow repeatedly noted that the EU restrictive measures are illegitimate and undermine the foundations of international law; among other things, they contradict the interests of the European Union itself.

“They lead to a break in the existing trade and production chains and cause enormous damage to citizens of the EU member states. At the same time, restrictive measures are especially counterproductive in conditions of global economic instability caused by the coronavirus pandemic,” the Russian diplomat continued.

Moscow will work out targeted trade and financial restrictions to Western sanctions introduced in the wake of Russia’s operation in Ukraine, Birichevsky said.

“It is obvious that targeted retaliatory trade and financial restrictions will also be developed,” Birichevsky added.

US claims it’s ‘clear’ Russia will lose conflict

Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland says Russia is destined to lose its war in Ukraine.

“It is clear that Russia will lose this conflict – whether they lose it quickly or whether they lose it extremely slowly, it is only a matter of time,” she stated.

“The problem is that if this can be lost quickly, many, many, many lives will be saved, which is why we have to continue to pour on the economic pressure; we have to continue to support the defensive needs of the Ukrainian people,” she added.

Nuland noted US officials’ engagements with China – including a recent call between the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi – aimed to get Beijing to influence Moscow to end the invasion.

“Our intention in our regular engagement with China, including Secretary Blinken’s call with his counterpart, was to underscore that this war is not good for China, that we want to see China use its influence with Russia to get this war ended, and at a minimum to help get these humanitarian corridors going,” Nuland told US legislators.

“And that if they are concerned about their economic situation as they should well be, with the lowest growth rates in 15 years, that this war is contributing to it,” she continued.

“You may have seen in the news today the story that the United Nations allegedly does not consider the Russian invasion a war. I know this outraged many, and not only in Ukraine,” Zelensky said.

The word “war” will be heard on this site. Because that is the truth. We will not allow anyone in the world to ignore the suffering and murder of our people, our children,” he added.

The United Nations in New York, for its part, walked back the email contents in a Tuesday news briefing, with UN spokesperson Stephan Dujarric saying that an unnamed regional office should not have issued a memo warning staff to not use the words “war” or “invasion” to describe what is happening in Ukraine, “because there are no official instructions on what words saying those things”.

The UN spokesperson added UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has used the word “war” and so has his top political deputy in a tweet, stating that “this war is senseless”.
