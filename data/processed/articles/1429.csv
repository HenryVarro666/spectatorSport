“Putin must not win this war,” Estonia’s Prime Minister Kaja Kallas told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Sunday, adding that it was “heartbreaking” to see what Russia is doing in Ukraine.

“We are trying to do everything what we can to support and help Ukraine to fight this war. Putin must not win this war,” Kallas said on ""State of the Union.""

Kallas, who will be attending the upcoming NATO summit, said that NATO’s strategy should focus on ending the war by using “smart containment”, meaning that NATO should move from a “deterrence posture” to a secure “defense posture,” raising NATO nations’ contribution to strengthen each nation’s defense and ultimately NATO as a whole and focusing on cooperation.

“There are some capabilities that are too expensive for any individual state, but if we do them together here in Europe to protect our territories, we are stronger,” she said, nations should move to isolate Russia “at all the political levels that is possible.”

When asked about Poland’s proposal to send peacekeepers to Ukraine, Kallas said that first peace must be achieved, and that Russia is not showing any intentions of achieving it.

“We can only have a peacekeeping mission if we have peace, but you know, if you look at what is happening in Ukraine, peace is nothing that we see there. It's a war that is going on, and I don't see that Russia has any intention of doing anything to achieve peace. So first we should have peace, then, to keep it,” she said. “Sometimes in order to achieve peace, we have to have the willingness to use military power.”

Kallas said they do not see the possibility of a third World War in Europe and that the effort should be on ending this war.

Kallas also compared deportations happening in Mariupol to what Russia did in the 1940s where Estonians were put in “cattle cars” sent to Siberia.

She said that Putin’s is feeding into the right-wing narrative in Europe and the US by creating a refugee crisis.

“He is creating this huge migration pressure to Europe and what we see in different countries, we also see that the Far Right now picking up the tone” and not helping refugees coming from Ukraine, she added.

“The enemy is Russia and not the refugees,” Kallas said.",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-20-22/h_1013540b90c27108b9830d8e55dc028e

This was announced by Deputy Prime Minister - Minister for Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories Iryna Vereshchuk.

A corridor from the city of Mariupol to the city of Zaporizhzhia is planned in the Donetsk region. According to Iryna Vereshchuk, a convoy of buses has already left to transport Mariupol residents from Berdyansk to Zaporizhzhia. Also trucks with products for aid points in Berdyansk were sent. The Deputy Prime Minister noted that buses were sent for the citizens evacuated from Mariupol who are in Manhush to transport them to Berdyansk.

A number of humanitarian corridors have also been agreed upon in the Kyiv region, in particular from the village of Bervytsya to the city of Brovary.

According to Iryna Vereshchuk, people from Bervytsya have to walk to the bridge in the village of Mokrets and cross the Trubizh River towards Radhospnoyi Street where buses will be waiting for them. The route of the convoy: Bervytsya - Mokrets - Zavorychi - Kalyta - Semypolky - Litky - Rozhny - Pukhivka - Zazymya - Brovary.

On Sunday evening, the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti said a humanitarian corridor would open out of the heavily shelled city from 10am Moscow time (7am GMT) on Monday. Moscow also demanded defenders of Mariupol surrender and laid down their arms by 5am.

Linda Thomas-Greenfield, America’s ambassador to the UN, said the US had not yet confirmed the allegations, made on Saturday by Mariupol city council and repeated in detail on Sunday by Ukraine’s human rights spokesperson, Lyudmyla Denisova.

“I’ve only heard it. I can’t confirm it,” Thomas-Greenfield told CNN. “But I can say it is disturbing. It is unconscionable for Russia to force Ukrainian citizens into Russia and put them in what will basically be concentration and prisoner camps.”

As the UN said 10 million people – about a quarter of Ukraine’s prewar population –had been displaced by the conflict and Ukrainian authorities accused Moscow of bombing an art school in Mariupol where more than 400 people had taken shelter, Denisova said Russian troops had “kidnapped” residents and taken them to Russia.

“Several thousand Mariupol residents have been deported to Russia,” she said on Telegram. After processing at “filtration camps”, some had been transported to the Russian city of Taganrog, about 60 miles (100km) from Mariupol, and from there sent by rail “to various economically depressed cities in Russia”, she said.

Denisova said Ukrainian citizens had been “issued papers that require them to be in a certain city. They have no right to leave it for at least two years with the obligation to work at the specified place of work. The fate of others remains unknown.”

Russian news agencies have reported that hundreds of people whom Moscow are calling refugees have been taken by bus from Mariupol to Russia. Denisova said the “abductions and forced displacements” violated the Geneva and European human rights conventions and called on the international community to “respond … and increase sanctions against the terrorist state of the Russian Federation”.

Resident Anna Iwashyna, 39, who recently fled Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia, said: “I don’t know if people are being taken to Russia by force, but I can say for sure nobody is going there willingly.”

Iwashyna said conditions in the city were atrocious. “The entire infrastructure has been destroyed,” she told the Guardian. “There are no shops, no pharmacies, no medical aid, fires are all around the city, there are no firefighters. There’s nowhere to get food.”

Iwashyna said she had seen “dead bodies on the street, with my own eyes. Right by the Maritime University. There was a missile, it was still stuck into an intersection, and there was a dead person on the sidewalk. I could hear planes all night long, they are bombing and bombing and bombing the city, non-stop.”

Another resident, Roman Kruglyakov, left his hometown of Mariupol to stay in a nearby village at the beginning of the war. From March 17 to March 19, he made three trips back to the devastated city to pick up his trapped family members.

“Out of the 25 people who I took out, there was not one who wanted to evacuate to Russia,” he said. “They all want to go to Zaporizhzhia but not everyone is able to.”

Days after Russian shells struck a theatre in the city that was also being used as a shelter, local authorities said Mariupol’s G12 art school had been destroyed while women, children and elderly people were inside. There was no immediate word on casualties at the site and no further update on the search for survivors at the theatre.

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Sunday described Russia’s siege of the city as “a terror that will be remembered for centuries to come”. Bombarded since the start of the invasion, many of Mariupol’s residents have been without heat, power or water for more than a fortnight. Local authorities have said at least 2,300 have died, some of whom had to be buried in mass graves.

Denisova also accused Russian forces of the murder of 56 elderly people in the town of Kreminna in the Luhansk region after a Russian tank “cynically and purposefully fired at a home for the elderly”. Fifteen survivors were “abducted by the occupiers”, she said, calling the attack “another act of horrific genocide”.

Mariupol authorities said on Sunday that nearly 40,000 residents had managed to leave the city in the previous week, mostly in their own vehicles, despite ongoing air and artillery strikes. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said seven safe routes would again be open across the country on Sunday.

In the north-eastern city of Sumy, authorities evacuated 71 orphaned babies through a humanitarian corridor, the regional governor, Dmytro Zhyvytskyy, said on Sunday. He said the orphans, most of whom need constant medical attention, would be taken to an unspecified foreign country.

But in the capital, Kyiv, authorities said at least 20 babies carried by Ukrainian surrogate mothers were being cared for by nurses in a bomb shelter because of constant shelling, with parents unable to travel into the war zone to pick them up.

The head of the UN’s refugee agency, UNHCR, said more than a quarter of Ukraine’s prewar population had fled their homes to escape the Russian onslaught. “Among the responsibilities of those who wage war, everywhere in the world, is the suffering inflicted on civilians who are forced to flee their homes,” Filippo Grandi tweeted.

“The war in Ukraine is so devastating that 10 million have fled either displaced inside the country, or as refugees abroad,” he said. The UN said 3,389,044 Ukrainians had left the country since Russia’s invasion began on 24 February, 90% of them women and children. More than 6.5 million people are internally displaced.

The UN human rights office, OHCHR, said it had confirmed the deaths of 902 civilians in Ukraine since the start of the conflict, adding that most of the casualties were from explosive weapons such as heavy artillery shells, missile and airstrikes, OHCHR said. The actual toll will be significantly higher, it said.

As military experts said Russia’s largely stalled ground advance was forcing Moscow to switch to a war of attrition, the Kremlin said on Sunday it had deployed another of its new Kinzhal (Dagger) hypersonic missiles, which travel faster than the speed of sound and can change direction mid-flight.

Ukraine has confirmed that missile attacks took place on a fuel depot near the southern city of Mykolaiv and an ammunition depot in western Ukraine, but said the missile type had not yet been determined.

Russian shelling also heavily damaged the Azovstal metallurgical plant in Mariupol, one of the largest in Europe, Ukrainian officials said. “The economic losses for Ukraine are immense,” tweeted an MP, Lesia Vasylenko.

The mayor of the encircled northern city of Chernihiv said on Sunday a hospital had been hit in the latest shelling, killing dozens of civilians. “The city is suffering from an absolute humanitarian catastrophe,” Vladislav Atroshenko said.

Details are also emerging of a rocket attack that killed as many as 40 marines in Mykolaiv, a Black Sea port city, on Friday, according to the New York Times, which cited an unnamed Ukrainian military official.

Nevertheless, the Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said on Sunday that the frontlines between Ukrainian and Russian forces were “practically frozen” as Russia did not have enough combat strength to advance further. “[Over the past day] there were practically no rocket strikes on [Ukrainian] cities,” Arestovych added.

Britain’s defence ministry said Russian forces had made “limited progress in capturing cities” but had instead “increased its indiscriminate shelling of urban areas, resulting in widespread destruction and large numbers of civilian casualties”.

It warned that Russia would “continue to use its heavy firepower to support assaults on urban areas as it looks to limit its own already considerable losses, at the cost of further civilian casualties.”

David Petraeus, the former US military commander and CIA chief, said it was “absolutely confirmed” that Ukrainian forces had killed at least four Russian generals. The Russian forces’ command-and-control structure had “broken down”, he said. “Their comms have been jammed by the Ukrainians. They’re literally stealing cell phones from Ukrainian civilians to communicate among each other.”

The two sides are currently holding negotiations remotely but so far, like previous rounds, they have yielded little progress. None have been at the presidential level.

“This is the time to meet, to talk, time for renewing territorial integrity and fairness for Ukraine,” Zelensky says in a video posted to Facebook.

“Otherwise, Russia’s losses will be such, that several generations will not recover.”

Zelensky also says that Ukrainian authorities had been able to rescue more than 9,000 people from the port city of Mariupol, which is under siege by Russian forces.

There was still no information about the number of people who had died when a theatre in the city sheltering civilians was bombed, he says.

Over 180,000 Ukrainian citizens had been rescued through humanitarian corridors across the country, Zelensky says.

He accuses Russian forces of blocking aid around hotspot areas, saying “they have a strict order to do everything, so the humanitarian catastrophe in Ukrainian cities turned into a reason for Ukrainians to work together with the occupiers”.

“This is a war crime!” he adds.

Several rounds of negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow have taken place both in person and virtually since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began on February 24.

The latest set of talks, the fourth, opened on Monday.

Russia’s top negotiator said Friday that Moscow and Kyiv had brought their positions “as close as possible” on a proposal for Ukraine to become a neutral state.

But Mikhailo Podolyak, an advisor to Zelensky taking part in the negotiations, said his country’s position had not budged.

Ukrainian authorities say Russian forces bombed a school in Mariupol where hundreds of people, including women and children, had taken shelter, as Moscow continued with its relentless attacks on the besieged port city.

“Yesterday, the Russian occupiers dropped bombs on an art school No 12,” the city council said on messaging app Telegram on Sunday, adding that about 400 women, children and elderly people had been sheltering there from bombardments.

The building in the east of the city had been destroyed, the council said. “Peaceful civilians are still under the rubble,” it added.

Russian troops have pushed deeper into the strategic city, which has been shelled for days and is facing a near-total communication blackout.

City authorities also said some residents of Mariupol were being “forcibly taken to Russia [and] stripped of their Ukrainian passports and given a piece of paper that carries no legal weight and is not recognised by the entire civilised world”.

Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol’s mayor, said the residents had been taken to the Russian cities of Tomsk, Vladimir and Yaroslavl.

Al Jazeera’s Rob McBride reporting from the western city of Lviv said conditions in Mariupol were worsening.

“We are still waiting to see whether there are survivors,” McBride said about the school which was hit on Sunday.

“The problem, the authorities in Mariupol say, is that they simply can’t get close to this place because of the ongoing fierce fighting in the surrounding street. While people are being allowed to leave through humanitarian corridors, the Russian soldiers are checking if they are civilians instead of being soldiers or fighters,” he added.

Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of the Donetsk regional administration, said Russian forces had already deported more than a thousand residents of Mariupol.

“The occupiers are sending the residents of Mariupol to filtration camps, checking their phones and seizing (their) Ukrainian documents,” he added, urging the international community to intervene.

The White House said it was a ""critical"" moment to boost defences.

This is the latest in a series of warnings about possible fall-out in cyberspace from the conflict.

In particular, there have been concerns that Russia might retaliate for sanctions by hitting back at the US and Western economies through cyber-attacks.

So far these attacks have not materialised.

Street fighting in the besieged city hampered efforts to evacuate civilians and rescue people still trapped in the basement of a theater used for shelter that officials said Russia bombed on Wednesday.

Should Mariupol fall, Russia will have a land corridor from Crimea, stretching for most of the south coast and up the eastern regions of Ukraine.

It was unclear if any humanitarian aid was reaching the city, where hundreds of thousands are trapped with little or no food or water.

The Mariupol city council said about 80% of residential buildings have been ruined by Russian attacks, Bloomberg reported.

“The shelling never stops and the shooting never stops,” said Dmytro Gurin, an MP whose parents are trapped in the south-eastern city. “Airplanes, they drop hundreds of bombs over 24 hours.”

He described conditions in the city as “medieval” in an interview with the BBC.

“People are out of food, and more importantly out of water,” Gurin said. “And several of days ago, tanks started to shoot nine-story buildings, so people cannot get out. Everybody is sitting in their apartments and basements thinking whether they will die in the next hour.”

The city, which has no electricity or heat amid sub-zero temperatures, is now unrecognizable, Gurin added. “From photos I have seen, there is no city anymore,” he said. “By estimate of the mayor’s office, 30% of buildings are totally destroyed and 50% are heavily damaged. My house is burned to the ground.”

A statement from the city council said that about 30,000 residents had managed to escape so far. That included more than 5,000 on Friday, but more than 350,000 remained stuck there.

Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said a route out of Mariupol was one of 10 humanitarian corridors opened on Saturday.

But Gurin expressed pessimism over the prospect of getting people out through such corridors, saying “the Ukrainian side are trying to have an agreement and open it, but Russia, almost always its only words”.

Many of those fleeing Mariupol have landed in the city of Zaporizhzhia, where the mayor declared a curfew amid Russian shelling.

Meanwhile, the fate of hundreds of people, mostly women, children and the elderly, who had been hiding in the theatre and a nearby swimming pool building because of heavy shelling, was still unknown.

Russia continued its attacks on Ukraine on March 19, 2022.

Petro Andrushchenko, an adviser to the city’s mayor, said some people survived the blast and the bomb shelter had held. Emergency workers were looking for them in the rubble.

In a video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said more than 130 people have been rescued from the theater, but there was no information about how many people had died there.

Outside the city, Ukrainian and Russian forces fought for the Azovstal steel plant, one of the biggest in Europe, said Vadym Denysenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister, in televised remarks on Saturday.

“Now there is a fight for Azovstal,” he said. “I can say that we have lost this economic giant. In fact, one of the largest metallurgical plants in Europe is actually being destroyed.”
