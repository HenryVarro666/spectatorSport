The United States and our Allies and partners stand in solidarity with the people and government of Ukraine in the face of the Kremlin’s aggression.

Exercising the additional authority provided in the extension of the continuing resolution, I have immediately authorized today, pursuant to a delegation by the President, a fourth Presidential Drawdown of up to $200 million for additional military assistance for Ukraine’s defense. This package will include further defensive assistance to help Ukraine meet the armored, airborne, and other threats it is facing. This drawdown will bring the total security assistance provided by the United States to Ukraine to more than $1.2 billion since the beginning of the Administration.

We salute the armed forces of Ukraine and all Ukrainian citizens who are defending their country with great skill, iron will, and profound courage. America and its Allies support their efforts to defend their country and protect their fellow citizens, and urge Russia to recognize that force will never defeat Ukraine’s spirit. We are committed to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and will continue to provide Ukraine the support it needs.

We will also continue to provide humanitarian assistance to those in need and to back the people of Ukraine in their fight for their country through security and economic assistance.

1,7e9febda-5235-46a8-919d-d1f63d4e757b,[],,"Good morning, Chairman Menendez, Ranking Member Risch, and distinguished members of the Committee. It’s an honor to appear before you and it is great to see all the familiar faces I worked with for so many years. I am pleased to be here to discuss United States security sector assistance with Dr. Mara Karlin, Assistant Secretary of Defense.

The subject of this Hearing is the future of U.S. Security Assistance, and I come before the committee with six recommendations for your consideration for (1) a greater focus on Security Sector Governance; (2) the need for greater flexibility; (3) the urgency of process reforms to make U.S. defense articles more available to partners and expedite their delivery; (4) the value of strengthening State-DOD coordination through concurrence mechanisms and (5) the foundational requirement to support the State Department’s security assistance workforce.

Before laying those proposals out in detail, I want to review how we got to the current authorities and programs we have; what those programs are; and, the strategic context in which we are currently exercising them.

The Development and Current State of State Department Security Assistance

Security cooperation, including security sector assistance, is an instrument of foreign policy. It is an integral component of our national security strategy that enables foreign partners to join us in advancing global security. Consequently, our national security interests can put us in a situation in which we need to evaluate hard choices between supporting the security needs of some partners or stepping back to allow those partners to buy from our adversaries. Security Assistance is also an opportunity to promote stronger and more effective security sector governance; it is a key to long-term relationship building. It is a mechanism for enhancing regional security, burden sharing, and interoperability with U.S. forces. It is a means of strengthening the professionalism of the armed forces agencies of allied and partner nations. It is also, and this is critical, just one element of our foreign policy toolkit. Security assistance is not a panacea, but rather, when applied alongside other tools of our diplomacy, an instrument by which we can support and advance security, stability, and peace.

Congress – and specifically this committee, Mr. Chairman – has been a key partner in this endeavor from its outset. We look to build on this decades’ long partnership, to open a discussion by sharing some general recommendations on the way forward with you today. Of course, it is impossible to talk about the future without some discussion of how we created the security sector assistance we have today. It took many years of policymaking, legislating, planning, and partnership for the United States to develop the security assistance tools we now have at our disposal.

Security assistance took on its initial form in the early days of the Cold War, when the United States began providing surplus military equipment and military advisors to U.S. allies and partners.

Then, in the wake of the Korean War and Berlin Airlift, and facing rising security challenges in the context of the Cold War, on November 3, 1961, President John F. Kennedy signed the Foreign Assistance Act to reorganize the structure of existing U.S. foreign assistance programs, with Congress writing into statute the role of the Secretary of State as responsible for the “continuous supervision and general direction of economic assistance, military assistance, and military education and training programs, including but not limited to determining where there shall be a military assistance (including civic action) or a military education and training program for a country and the value thereof, to the end that such programs are effectively integrated both at home and abroad and the foreign policy of the United States is best served thereby.” Thus, with the passage of the Act by Congress, U.S. foreign assistance underwent a major transformation that placed security assistance squarely under State’s purview. The primary State Department security assistance tools we know today, including Foreign Military Financing, can be traced back to the Foreign Assistance Act.

The next pillar of our current system came in the Arms Export Control Act of 1976. The “AECA” reformed the landscape for U.S. security cooperation, including security assistance, by setting the terms on which arms transfers could occur – including for internal security, for legitimate self-defense, and for preventing or hindering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Like the Foreign Assistance Act, the Arms Export Control Act reflected the strategic thinking of the times, requiring consideration to be given as to whether the exports “would contribute to an arms race, aid in the development of weapons of mass destruction, support international terrorism, increase the possibility of outbreak or escalation of conflict, or prejudice the development of bilateral or multilateral arms control or nonproliferation agreements or other arrangements.”

The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the Arms Export Control Act establish the foundational authorities for contemporary State Department U.S. security assistance programs. The United States relied mostly on these authorities through the remainder of the Cold War to shore up NATO partners, and to solidify diplomatic accomplishments such as the signing of the Camp David Accords.

As the Cold War waned, the foreign policy landscape shifted, as did the United States’ response to global threats.

Beginning in the 1980s, Congress began providing DoD with additional authorities through annual National Defense Authorization Acts. Early examples focused on counter narcotics and humanitarian assistance, focused initially on emergency challenges in Central and South America.

This trend accelerated considerably after 9/11 due to the perception that the United States needed to urgently build the capacity of local partners in the fight against violent extremists. Once of secondary importance, “security cooperation” with partner security forces was elevated to an integral part of DoD’s mission.

In FY 2006, Congress enacted the first major global DoD authority (Section 1206) to be used expressly for the purpose of training and equipping the national military forces of foreign countries worldwide. DoD’s global train and equip authorities have since been consolidated and expanded under Title 10 Section 333 (as of FY 2017).

Numerous country- and function-specific authorities, such as the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI), The Indo-Pacific Maritime Security Initiative (MSI), the Counterterrorism Partnership Fund (CTPF), the Counter-Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) Train and Equip Fund (CTEF), and, of course, the Iraq and Afghanistan Security Forces Funds (ISFF and ASFF), have also accrued directly to DoD over the past 15 years as well.

Recognizing the potential for duplicative programming between State and DoD authorities, Congress has legislated Secretary of State concurrence, coordination, and joint planning requirements for many (but not all) DoD authorities.

My bureau, the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, links diplomacy and defense to bolster U.S. national security. My team works closely with the Department of Defense, Congress, and the U.S. defense industry to deliver tools and training that strengthen our allies’ and partners’ abilities to provide for their defense and contribute meaningfully to the stability of the rules-based international order. Day to day, the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs oversees approximately $7 billion in security sector assistance programs annually – which accounts for roughly 20 percent of the Department of State’s and USAID’s total annual assistance. This assistance supports grants under Foreign Military Financing to help our partners invest in U.S. training and equipment; International Military Education and Training that enables foreign military personnel to study beside their U.S. counterparts; and Peacekeeping Operations funds to help train and equip foreign forces to rise to the challenge of helping countries emerge and recover from war.

Notably, the $7B of security assistance appropriations is dwarfed by the foreign military sales funded by our allies and partners, which amounted to $28.67B in fiscal year 2021. Furthermore, For Fiscal Year 2021, Direct Commercial Sales to our allies and partners accounted for $103.4B in fiscal year 2021. In other words, our global network of alliances and partnerships generated over $130B of funds to our defense industry that in turn will go back to support our national security. In addition, the Bureau coordinates State Department review of and Secretary of State concurrence with DoD activities conducted under 25 different DoD authorities.

This proliferation of DoD authorities has been matched with growing appropriations for DoD security cooperation activities. Since 2001-2022, the total amount of security sector assistance has tripled to roughly $18 billion, and the proportion managed by DoD has grown from approximately 20 percent to slightly more than half.

The State Department’s resources, meanwhile, have also grown increasingly inflexible. Of the nearly $7 billion in annual assistance resources I oversee in PM, 93 percent has been subject to Congressional funding directives in recent fiscal years. Once assistance to partners such as Egypt, Israel, Jordan, and Iraq are accounted for, only limited resources remain (less than $1.8 billion) to strengthen other allies in need worldwide, creating countless lost opportunities to further America’s foreign policy and national security.

But within these constraints, Mr. Chairman, we make a difference.

Security assistance still holds tremendous potential to advance our foreign policy by offering new avenues of access, influencing and assuring partners, strengthening their institutional capacity, and bolstering regional stability.

Strategic Context

I sit before you to discuss these matters at a time where that proposition is being tested, and displayed, as at few points in history. As the bombs rain down on the hospitals and schools of Kyiv, as the Russian tanks roll through the Ukrainian countryside, as we see before our very eyes the sights of war in the European Theater that we had imagined had been retired to history, I can say that I am proud – and that you can all be proud – of the support the United States has provided to Ukraine in, and in advance of, their time of need – and proud of the remarkable courage of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the Ukrainian people as they wield our assistance to push back on Russia’s unforgiveable assault.

And our support to Ukraine demonstrates the wide array of tools that State and DOD can bring to a partner’s security sector.

Since assuming office last January, this Administration has provided over $1 billion to Ukraine’s defensive capabilities, including through Foreign Military Financing, the DoD Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, and other program lines. Through the Multinational Joint Commission (MJC) we work with Ukraine and our Allies to identify military requirements and match funding streams to support needed defense capabilities, ranging from radars to Javelins. Through the Excess Defense Articles program, we have delivered to Ukraine armed Coast Guard Cutters to create an asymmetric maritime capability in the Black Sea. In addition, through programs such as our International Military Education and Training (IMET) authority, we have supported the development of a cadre of professional and Western-looking mid- and senior-level Ukrainian officers, and through a series of exercises, DOD has strengthened the interoperability of our forces and Ukraine’s tactical and operational capabilities. We have repeatedly condemned President Putin’s efforts to intimidate and isolate Ukraine and have provided $1 billion in assistance in the last year alone. On at least two occasions we have turned around requests within just 24 hours; an incredible speed for issues of this complexity.

As the Secretary said recently, last fall, as the present threat against Ukraine from Russia developed, under authority delegated by the President, he authorized the Department of Defense to provide $60 million in immediate military assistance to Ukraine.

In December, as that threat materialized, he authorized a further drawdown worth $200 million. Then, as Ukraine took up arms with courage to fend off Russia’s brutal and unprovoked assault, he authorized, an unprecedented third Presidential Drawdown of up to $350 million for immediate support to Ukraine’s defense.

At the same time, we continue to expeditiously process and approve requests for deliveries of U.S.-origin materiel military equipment to Ukraine from allies and partners under our Third-Party Transfer Authority.

Congruent to our efforts to assist Ukraine in its fight against Russia, the challenge posed by the PRC is unlike anything we have faced in recent history. The PRC is the only country with the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to seriously challenge the stable and open international system – all the rules, values, and relationships that make the world work. As we turn to the pacing threat the PRC and its model of autocracy poses to the rules-based order, we can look to security cooperation and security assistance as a key element of our response. This challenge forces us to return to our national security interests. We can either maintain our unprecedented network of security assistance relationships or we must acknowledge the risk of allowing these relationships to stagnate and open opportunities for China and Russia to step into the vacuum. For decades, for example, we have worked to strengthen our security cooperation with key allies such as Japan and South Korea while creating new partnerships with countries like Vietnam, all while working hand-in-glove with Taiwan to strengthen that brave island’s defense and deterrence – and this Administration intends to deepen and expand that cooperation in the months and years ahead.

As shown in our response to Ukraine, our global network of allies and partners are a unique American advantage and strategic asset in competition with the PRC and Russia. As a fundamentally political, relationship-building tool, security sector assistance can play a vital role in strengthening those partnerships. Both Beijing and Moscow have invested heavily in efforts meant to drive a wedge between us and our allies and partners.

For the foreseeable future, it will be a priority for the United States to continue leveraging security cooperation to help our partners deter and defeat Russian and PRC aggression. It is especially critical that our fellow democracies on the frontlines have the means to defend themselves against their larger, autocratic neighbors. I should be clear, however, that just because a strategic competitor is willing to transfer arms to a country, it does not mean we should, or will. We will approve arms transfers only when they are actually in our foreign policy interest.

Indeed, we must keep in mind that strategic competition is not simply a struggle of might between great powers. It is at base a contest of values and norms – of two fundamentally different models of global governance. As President Biden has said, “We’re living at an inflection point in history, both at home and abroad. We’re engaged anew in a struggle between democracy and autocracy.” And as Secretary Blinken said last year in a message to all our diplomatic posts worldwide, “in a more contested, competitive world, America’s values and our commitment to supporting the rights and freedoms of people around the world are a competitive structural advantage that our undemocratic adversaries and competitors cannot match, and that we should not cede.”

Therefore, the President has stressed the need to defend free societies and promote democracy around the world, including by elevating our promotion of human rights. We must keep the importance of security sector governance and respect for universal human rights front and center as we consider where to provide security assistance, and as we engage partner nations’ security institutions and empower them toward modernization, accountability, and reform.

The same principles apply for security assistance intended to manage the persistent threats from violent extremists, Iranian proxies, and other destabilizing actors. These threats show no sign of decreasing even as we shift our policy focus to the long-term challenge posed by the PRC and, more immediately, by Russia. A significant share of security assistance is still allocated toward addressing these persistent threats globally.

Challenges and Opportunities

Considering the strategic environment and the existing architecture of security cooperation and assistance together, I see several opportunities for Congress to help address the security challenges we are currently facing and apply valuable lessons learned: (1) a greater focus on Security Sector Governance; (2) the need for greater flexibility; (3) the urgency of process reforms to make U.S. defense articles more available to partners and expedite their delivery; (4) the value of strengthening State-DOD coordination through concurrence mechanisms and (5) the foundational requirement to support the State Department’s security assistance workforce.

First, I would encourage the Committee to elevate security sector governance as a central consideration in U.S. security cooperation and assistance planning and treat long-term institutional capacity building as our primary mission.

It is not enough to build defense institutions in tandem with “train and equip” missions; security sector governance must be the pacesetter. Security assistance delivered before baseline standards of governance and institutional capacity are in place will at best provide little return on investment, and more likely will harm U.S. interests in the long run.

A governance-centered approach to security cooperation and assistance would better integrate our political-military tools with our foreign policy and with the diplomatic and economic instruments of statecraft, in keeping with the spirit of the Foreign Assistance Act.

Operationalizing a governance-centered approach will also require the interagency to reduce duplication and to develop a common operating picture – especially with regards to the foreign policy risks posed by weak governance and the potential for elite capture of the security sector – and continuous, strategic-level monitoring and evaluation frameworks. The risk assessments and learning frameworks, moreover, should not merely inform program planning but meaningfully steer it.

Second, State’s authorities require more flexibility if we are to effectively address emerging crises and opportunities in today’s geopolitical environment. Greater flexibility is needed on several fronts.

The Department faces a perennial need to deliver basic military articles, training, and services to developing partners for the purposes of building institutional capacity, preventing conflict, and promoting stability. The Peacekeeping Operations account allows us to address such needs but is heavily directed by Congress. Greater flexibility for FMF and PKO funding would allow the Department to be more responsive and in certain circumstances result in cost-saving.

I would also encourage the appropriation of funds on a more regional or functional basis. Most FMF is directed on a bilateral basis, which risks creating a latent expectancy among allies and partners and limits the Department’s flexibility and responsiveness and the ability to utilize FMF in concert with diplomatic tools. After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014, for example, the Department of State was only able to urgently reallocate a few million dollars in FMF assistance.

Expanded use of security sector assistance funding appropriated as regional funds provides not only greater flexibility to respond to emerging needs and align to strategic priorities, but also promotes fruitful competition among program proposals.

To be clear, I am not suggesting that State is interested in greater flexibility to avoid the tough questions on security sector governance, democracy, and human rights, which are issues that this Administration is committed to prioritizing and in which Congress rightly maintains a steadfast interest. Rather, I have noted several areas where improvements are needed to State’s flexibility after a decision is made to provide security assistance.

Third, because there is no free-standing acquisition system for FMS, we also encourage Congress to work with our DoD colleagues to provide authorities and funding consistent with Administration requests that enable efficiencies and reforms to the Federal acquisition processes, which directly impact the speed of the FMS system. Concurrently, we are working diligently in the interagency to address challenges that have been identified through the Conventional Arms Transfer (CAT) Policy revision process, designed to ensure the United States remains competitive once the Administration has decided to provide security assistance. The four main areas we are working on are: expanding financing options for partners; improving the efficiency of the U.S. technology transfer approval process; building exportability into the development of new capabilities in order to get the capability to our partners more quickly; and encouraging innovative solutions by exploring options for partners that are not currently used by U.S. military, what we call non-program of record cases. These are requests from partners via the FMS system for capabilities that are not existing mainline DoD procurements, and which therefore require the addition of expertise and management processes within DOD to be able to facilitate the procurement of defense articles that are unfamiliar to the DOD system.

In the context of strategic competition, I also see an acute need to offer more attractive financing options to partners who are considering acquiring major U.S. defense articles – for example, through expanded FMF loan authorities. Currently foreign competitors offer far more flexible financing than the United States. FMF loans would provide a tool for the United States to compete for more FMS in countries where FMF grant assistance is unavailable or insufficient to support major procurements and/or where foreign partners lack the national funds to pay the purchase price upfront.

In addition, we look forward to working with Congress to identify opportunities and mechanisms to prioritize and expedite our assistance and our arms transfers to the partners who need them most urgently, in line with the requirements of those partners’ defense. Taiwan is a useful case in point: we work constantly with our partners in Taiwan to develop a joint understanding of the asymmetric capabilities required for its defense; having identified those capabilities, we also need to ensure we can deliver them in a timely manner, and this is a challenge that stretches beyond government – though contracting process reform is certainly on the agenda – to industry, where production timelines have faced increased lag due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Fourth, to ensure security cooperation and security assistance serve U.S. foreign policy goals and are properly synchronized and deconflicted to make maximal efficiency of taxpayer dollars, DoD security cooperation authorities – when requested by the Administration – should include Secretary of State concurrence.

Fifth, and in support of the reforms above, we encourage the Congress to provide requested State Department staffing resources to keep pace with the increased workload, and to develop a better trained security cooperation workforce at the Department. While DoD’s Security Cooperation workforce is more than 20,000 strong, State maintains a roughly analogous political-military workforce that numbers in the low hundreds. This has remained the case despite the ever-increasing expansion of DoD authorities and funds that PM is required to jointly develop, in addition to our own funds. In short, we risk losing strong political-military talent when we must do more and more without additional personnel.

While State actively supports many DoD security sector assistance activities, the Department currently lacks sufficient staff and bandwidth to fully participate in DoD planning processes and to thoroughly review proposed programs, including when some authorities include “joint formulation” requirements.

It is also important to facilitate the development of a security cooperation expertise and capacity at the State Department. Today’s security sector assistance programs are larger and more complex than those contemplated when the FAA was enacted, and they require personnel with both military and civilian areas of expertise.

Conclusion

What our history tells us is one thing for certain: the nature of global security is ever-changing. As it shifts and evolves so too should our security assistance toolkit. What security sector assistance looks like today is not what it looked like 10, 20, 30, or even 60-plus-years-ago when many of the key statutes, policies and process that guide the current system were developed. Our world and the political landscape we live in has changed greatly in the post-Cold-War environment.

Today, we are confronted on all sides by constantly emerging challenges and ever-present risks. Many of the security threats we face respect no borders or walls. Cyber and digital threats, international economic disruptions, climate insecurity, humanitarian crises, violent extremism and terrorism, and the proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction all pose profound and dangers. None of these dangers can be effectively addressed by one nation acting alone – not even one as powerful as the United States. That is why our alliances and partnerships are so vital. These alliances and partnerships, in turn, rely on security assistance and security cooperation to build capabilities, strengthen relationships, and provide interoperability. Security assistance is not just a concept to be debated in the abstract: it is a real demand of today’s world, encompassing a complex and broad scope of activities. It is therefore critical that we apply the authorities we have as effectively as we can – and continue to think about how we can revise and renew those authorities and processes to face the next challenge.

In remarks from the White House, Biden also called for revoking Russia’s ""most favored nation"" status, known as permanent normal trade relations in the US. The move, which has been coordinated with G7 and EU allies, will require an act of Congress.

The United States’ ban of exporting of luxury goods to Russia, which Biden referenced in his speech, will also include items like tobacco, clothing, jewelry, cars and antiques, an administration official tells CNN.

The idea behind this, the official explains, is to continue hurting Russian oligarchs and the country’s wealthiest by depriving them of their creature comforts, as the US continues to try to put pressure around those close to Vladimir Putin. It is also aimed at removing ways for these oligarchs to shelter their money, as they are already increasingly closed off from traditional financial avenues, the official said.

So how much alcohol and seafood does the US import from Russia? The US imported 48,867 metric tons of seafood from Russia in 2021, worth about $1.2 billion, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Crab accounted for the largest portion of those imports, with the US buying more than $900 million worth of frozen snow and red king crab last year.

The US does not sell any seafood directly to Russia, as the country banned US exports of seafood and fish in 2014.

CNN is still tracking down overall alcohol figures but according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, imports of Russian vodka to the United States accounted for only 1.3% of total vodka imports in in 2021.

The total amounts to $18.5 million dollars in 2021, the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States said.",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-11-22/h_de7fa3a673e0bc109d5fc99bd62cbd42

5,7e9febda-5235-46a8-919d-d1f63d4e757b,"['Leo Shane Iii', 'Joe Gould']",2022-03-11 00:00:00,"WASHINGTON ― Senate lawmakers finalized a $1.5 trillion spending bill late Thursday that provides $13.6 billion in new aid for Ukraine and funding stability for the Defense Department for the rest of the fiscal year.

President Joe Biden is expected to sign the measure into law Friday. Without the budget deal, government agencies would have faced partial shutdowns starting Saturday morning because of a lapse in available funding.

In a statement Thursday night, White House press secretary Jen Psaki praised the bipartisan deal as allowing federal officials to “advance American leadership abroad” and “deliver historic support for the Ukrainian people as they defend their country and democracy.”

She also noted the full-year budget agreement “ends a damaging series of short-term continuing resolutions that have undermined the government’s ability to meet pressing challenges.”

The budget deal includes $728.5 billion in discretionary funding for the Department of Defense for fiscal 2022 (which began in October). That’s an increase of nearly 5% over fiscal 2021 defense spending levels.

Rep. Betty McCollum, chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee’s defense panel, in a statement praised the final spending deal as “absolutely necessary to meet the needs of the American people and confront unprecedented global challenges.”

The package passed both the House and Senate this week with significant bipartisan backing.

Senate Armed Services Committee ranking member Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., said the military funding level — well above what the White House requested in its budget — will help maintain military investments and “keep us from falling even further behind China” and other adversaries.

Since the new fiscal year began Oct. 1, defense planners have been operating on a series of budget measures that kept spending at fiscal 2021 levels. That meant new equipment purchases, program starts and other new priorities have been sidelined for months awaiting the full-year agreement.

That has been particularly problematic in the area of military personnel. A 2.7% pay raise went into effect for service members Jan. 1, but Pentagon leaders were not given extra money to implement that change. As a result, officials have had to move money from other accounts to cover those costs, totaling more than $200 million.

The new compromise budget solves that problem, and also provides a large aid package for Ukrainian officials fighting back against Russian forces that invaded their country last month.

About half of the $13.6 billion will go to the Department of Defense, in large part to restore military stocks of equipment already transferred to Ukrainian military units through the president’s drawdown authority. Though on the second day of the war the White House proposed spending $6.4 billion, the special fund grew steadily over the last two weeks amid Ukraine’s battlefield gains against Russia and pressure from lawmakers.

Pentagon Comptroller Mike McCord told a defense industry audience this week Ukraine will force increases to future defense budgets. The added funding in this budget, he said, dovetails with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s pressure on his staff to do as much as possible for Ukraine.

“He has been admonishing us that at every daily meeting, and we do have daily meetings on this, to focus on helping Ukrainians with our drawdown authorities as fast as we can, as long as we’re able to safely,” McCord said. “That has been a big priority and Congress has been very supportive of that.”

Another $3.1 billion will cover “deployment, operational, and intelligence costs” for U.S. forces deployed to Europe in response to the Russian actions. Nearly 15,000 American service members have been deployed to the region in support of NATO allies in recent weeks, but none have been sent into Ukraine itself.

The bill also funds the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative — an account to help train and equip the Ukrainian military — at $300 million.

The State Department will receive about $4 billion for “the rapidly expanding humanitarian crisis in Ukraine.” Officials say more than 12 million people in the region are in need of food, shelter and other basic necessities because of shortages caused by the fighting.

The bill provides $650 million for military support and “an expansion of existing authorities to bolster the defense capabilities of the Ukrainian military and regional allies.”

The increased defense top line is a boon to Pentagon’s weapons programs and the defense industry. The budget’s defense procurement allotment exceeds the budget request by about $12 billion, with lawmakers adding $7 billion more for research and development.

Among notable moves for the Air Force, it would buy 20 more C-130J Super Hercules aircraft, made by Lockheed Martin, primarily for the Air National Guard to modernize two operational wings at an additional cost of $1.8 billion. Amid testing failures, the Air Force’s planned hypersonic missile, the the AGM-183A Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon, is facing a $161 million cut.

Lawmakers added 12 F/A-18E/F Super Hornets to the Navy’s budget, keeping the Boeing’s production line going, and they added five ships ― including one more Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer than the administration requested.

The Army won about $300 million more than requested for Stryker and Abrams upgrades and $500 million more for aircraft, chiefly to add more UH-60 Blackhawks, CH-47 Chinooks and Gray Eagle drones.

""If there are diplomatic steps that we can take that the Ukrainian Government believes would be helpful, we're prepared to take them"", the spokesperson said.

""We are working to put the Ukrainians in the strongest possible negotiating position, including by increasing pressure on Russia by imposing severe costs and by providing security assistance to help Ukrainians defend themselves.""

Debate has been swirling in Washington and among NATO allies about whether states can legally provide Ukraine military assistance in its ongoing armed conflict with Russia. Several NATO members have sent or promised lethal weaponry to the Ukrainian government. The United States alone has promised a billion dollars of security assistance. Germany broke its long-standing policy of banning all exports of lethal weapons to a conflict zone when it agreed to deliver 1,000 rocket launchers and 500 Stinger surface-to-air missiles to Ukraine. France, Belgium, the Netherlands and many other states have joined the effort, providing weapons and protective equipment to the Ukrainian government.

But some have begun to worry that this support violates the law of neutrality–that supplying arms might be an act of war by the United States. The Biden Administration reportedly debated the legality of arming the Ukrainians. Some officials warned that arming the Ukrainians could make the United States a “co-combatant” or party to the conflict. More recently the Biden Administration refused a Polish offer to transfer MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine via a U.S. airbase in Germany. While there were practical and political concerns, some also worried that supplying the jets would cross a legal line into direct participation in the war.

These fears have been stoked by Russia. Vladimir Putin has tried, in all sorts of contexts, to fudge the legal line of participation in war. He declared, for example, that Russia would treat economic sanctions against Russia “akin to an act of war.” The Russian ministry of defense issued a statement warning that if countries allowed their bases to be used as a safe haven for Ukrainian planes, “subsequent use against the Russian armed forces can be regarded as the involvement of these states in an armed conflict.” The Russian legal argument, however, is based on laws of neutrality that no longer hold. The United States and other states supporting Ukraine should refuse to accept these outdated arguments.

The Law of Neutrality

The law of neutrality has a long history. Scholars have debated, for example, whether classical Greece and Rome recognized neutrality in war. Whether or not ancient international law recognized neutrality, the legal regime that dominated in Europe beginning in the seventeenth century—which, in other writing, we have labeled the “Old World Order”—certainly did. Indeed, by the eighteenth century, states had developed a rich and detailed set of rules to regulate states that wished to stay out of hostilities.

This law of neutrality granted several important rights to states that were not involved in a war. The most important right was that no belligerent state could force a neutral one to fight alongside it, unless the two states had agreed to the alliance beforehand. The territory of a neutral state was also inviolable. Thus, international law prohibited fighting and recruiting soldiers on neutral ground. Neutrals also had the right to conduct business with belligerents. For example, during the wars of the French Revolution, the United States traded with France. Great Britain, however, did not complain that the United States was supplying its enemy, even though France and its colonies would have starved without American produce. By ensuring the right of neutrals to trade with belligerents, the Old World Order minimized the economic disruption of war. Even when hostilities broke out, the world would still remain open for business.

With rights, however, came responsibilities. Neutral states were expected to be strictly impartial: They were prohibited from discriminating between warring sides unless there was an explicit agreement otherwise. As Vattel stated:

As long as a neutral nation wishes securely to enjoy the advantages of her neutrality, she must in all things show a strict impartiality towards the belligerent powers: for, should she favor one of the parties to the prejudice of the other, she cannot complain of being treated by him as an adherent and confederate of his enemy.

Jefferson quoted this precise passage in a letter (June 17, 1793) to Ambassador Genêt of France to rebuff his attempts to get the United States to favor his country over Great Britain in their war.

The duty of impartiality was not an isolated legal rule. It was a consequence of states having the right to wage war to repair wrongs done to them. Trading with one side to the exclusion of the other transformed a neutral—“a common friend of both parties”—into a co-belligerent, an ally of the trading partner, because partial treatment interfered with the disfavored party’s right of war. Vattel was explicit about the forfeiture of neutrality. “But to refuse any of those things to one of the parties purely because he is at war with the other, and because she wishes to favor the latter, would be departing from the line of strict neutrality.” Discrimination in trade was an act of war that licensed the other side to attack the discriminator even though it had fired no shots.

The Hague Convention of 1907 included the strict duty of impartiality in its formulation of the laws of neutrality. Article 9 states: “Every measure of restriction or prohibition taken by a neutral Power in regard to the matters referred to in Articles 7 and 8 must be impartially applied by it to both belligerents.”

The End of Impartiality

But the law of neutrality changed dramatically in the early Twentieth Century. As we explain in our book, The Internationalists, the 1928 Kellogg-Briand Pact, which was at the time the most ratified treaty in the world, outlawed war. That treaty is commonly treated as a laughing stock, but we argue in our book that, by eliminating a state’s right of war, it set in motion a legal transformation that gave us our modern legal order. What’s more, the Kellogg-Briand Pact led directly to the UN Charter’s prohibition on wars of aggression and recognition of the right of self-defense. The modern system of international law, accordingly, affirms the transformation of neutrality initiated by the Pact.

The transformation in the law of neutrality can be seen in then-Attorney General Jackson’s speech at the First Conference of the Inter-American Bar Association in 1941, where he defended President Franklin Roosevelt’s Lend Lease Program under which the United States would provide significant weapons and other equipment to assist in the fight against Germany. The United States had not yet entered the war, and some critics of the plan worried that providing arms to the allies would violate the United States’ duty of neutrality and make the United States a co-belligerent. The American public was at the time opposed to entry into the war and hence if the plan was tantamount to entering the war, it would have been dead in the water.

Jackson explained: “The Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928, in which Germany, Italy, and Japan covenanted with us, as well as with other nations, to renounce war as an instrument of policy, made definite the outlawry of war and of necessity altered the dependent concept of neutral obligations.” He went on to explain that

[i]in the light of the flagrancy of current aggressions…the United States and other states are entitled to assert a right of discriminatory action by reason of the fact that, since 1928 so far as it is concerned, the place of war and with it the place of neutrality in the international legal system have no longer been the same as they were prior to that date.

The decision to outlaw war does not impose on states a duty to discriminate against the aggressor, he argued, but “it conferred upon them the right to act in that manner.” He concluded:

These events have ushered into international law a basis upon which the United States, may legally give aid to the Allies in the present situation. No longer can it be argued that the civilized world must behave with rigid impartiality toward both an aggressor in violation of the Treaty and the victims of unprovoked attack. . . such an interpretation of international law is not only proper but necessary if it is not to be a boon to the lawless and the aggressive.

Jackson’s position wasn’t a rogue one. As we document in our book, Jackson had met with the premiere international lawyer of his generation, the Lviv-born Hersch Lauterpacht. Lauterpacht had already noted the change in the law of neutrality in 1935 when revising the premiere international law treatise of its day, Lassa Oppenheim’s International Law (1935, 5th edition). In a memo he wrote for Jackson, Lauterpacht explained that the Kellogg-Briand Pact, by outlawing war, had changed the fundamental presupposition of the classical law of neutrality.

Discriminating against aggressors, either through economic sanctions or by transferring arms to their opponent, did not violate their right of war, because belligerents no longer had that right.

Lauterpacht’s view has become state practice. Take, for example, economic relations. Financial sanctions, and more generally what we have called “outcasting,” has become the standard tool for enforcing international law in the postwar world. Instead of responding with war, states now enforce international law, including against states waging illegal wars, by withdrawing the benefits of cooperation. Outcasting has become so unremarkable that legal challenges to them are themselves remarkable.

What This Means for Ukraine

If this war were taking place in 1922 rather than 2022, Putin would have a good legal argument and a basis for claiming that the United States and others can become parties to the conflict by supplying arms to Ukraine. In the Old World Order that existed before 1928, economic sanctions against a belligerent and supplying arms to one side and not another were violations of the duty of neutrality. But when the states joined together to outlaw war in 1928 and reaffirm that commitment in the UN Charter in 1945, they created a New World Order in which might is no longer right and in which states can provide weapons and other support to a state unjustly attacked so that it can defend itself.

The end of impartiality means that states are permitted to supply weapons or other support to Ukraine. Doing so violates no legal duty of neutrality. States would become parties to the international armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine if, and only if, they resort to armed force against Russia. Indeed, if anything, providing assistance to Ukraine supports the international legal order by allowing Ukraine to defend itself against a war of aggression.

8,7e9febda-5235-46a8-919d-d1f63d4e757b,[],,"Today, Vice President Kamala Harris announced nearly $53 million in additional humanitarian assistance from the United States government, through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), to support Ukrainians affected by Russia’s unjustified invasion of Ukraine.

This additional assistance includes support to the UN World Food Programme (WFP) to provide lifesaving emergency food assistance, including high-energy biscuits, to meet immediate needs. This assistance is for hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians affected by the invasion, including people who are displaced from their homes and who are crossing the border out of Ukraine. In addition, it will support WFP’s logistics operations to move assistance into Ukraine, including to people in Kyiv.

The United States stands with the people of Ukraine and will continue to work to meet immediate needs and save lives. The United States is the single largest donor of humanitarian assistance in Ukraine and has provided $159 million in overall humanitarian assistance to Ukraine since October 2020. In the past two weeks, the United States has provided nearly $107 million in humanitarian assistance in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. USAID’s Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) based in the region is leading the U.S. humanitarian response to the crisis in Ukraine. In addition, USAID's development programming has ramped up in the wake of the crisis to respond to cyber attacks, disinformation, threats to the energy sector, essential health needs, and to support the continued functioning of local and national government entities.

To date, over two million people have been forced to flee Ukraine due to the conflict, and an estimated one million are displaced inside Ukraine. At least 12 million people are in need of humanitarian aid across Ukraine.
