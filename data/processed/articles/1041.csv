NASA astronaut says Russian crew 'blindsided' by response to yellow and blue flight suit

NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei on how Ukraine crisis impacted partnership with Russians April 5, 2022 01:26 HOUSTON — NASA’s record-setting astronaut Mark Vande Hei says he and his Russian crewmates focused on their mission, not the “heartbreaking” news unfolding in Ukraine, while serving aboard the International Space Station. His 355-day spaceflight ended last Wednesday with a landing in Kazakhstan. He returned to Earth in a Russian Soyuz capsule with cosmonauts Anton Shkaplerov and Pyotr Dubrov, the latter of whom also spent a year in orbit. In his first news conference back on Earth, Vande Hei said Tuesday that he did not shy away from the topic with his Russian crewmates while aboard the space station. “They weren’t very long discussions, but I did ask them how they were feeling and sometimes I asked pointed questions. But our focus really was on our mission together.” Vande Hei also cleared up any misunderstandings about the yellow-with-blue-trim flight suits worn by their Russian replacements when arriving at the space station last month. Those were the school colors of their university, Vande Hei said from NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, and not meant as a political statement. “The folks who wore them had no idea that people would perceive that as having anything to do with Ukraine ... I think they were kind of blindsided by it.” Share this -

Joint Chiefs chairman says Ukraine war could last 'years' In testimony before the House Armed Services Committee Tuesday, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said the U.S. and its allies should be prepared to counter Russian aggression in Eastern Europe for ""quite some time."" “I do think this a very protracted conflict and I think it’s at least measured in years. I don’t know about a decade, but at least years, for sure,"" said Gen. Mark Milley, the nation's top military commander. ""This is a very extended conflict that Russia has initiated. And I think that NATO, the United States, Ukraine and all of the allies and partners that are supporting Ukraine are going to be involved in this for quite some time."" Milley said it's still too soon to tell how Ukraine's fiercer than expected resistance might influence Moscow's plans in the future, but said the U.S. must be prepared to counter future Russian aggression as Moscow tries to expand its sphere of influence in Ukraine and other Eastern European nations. ""We are witness to the greatest threat to peace and security of Europe, and perhaps the world, in my 42 years of service in uniform,"" Milley said in his opening remarks at the hearing on the Defense Department's budget.

Zelenskyy slams U.N. for inaction, details atrocities Ukrainian President Volodmyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday laid out atrocities committed by Russia in Ukraine in a powerful speech to the U.N. Security Council from Kyiv. Zelenskyy said he visited the city of Bucha near Kyiv on Monday and said the Russian military there “searched for and purposely killed anyone who served our country.” “They shot and killed women outside their houses,” Zelenskyy said. “They killed entire families, adults and children, and they tried to burn the bodies.” The Ukrainian leader said civilians were fatally shot in the back of the head after being tortured. Some were shot in the streets and thrown into wells and others were killed in their own apartments by grenades, he said. “The civilians were crushed by tanks while sitting in their cars in the middle of the road,” he continued. “They cut off limbs, cut their throats, slashed their throats. Women were raped and killed in front of their children. Their tongues were pulled out only because the aggressor did not hear what they wanted to hear from them.” Read the full story here.

""The perpetrators of these heinous crimes must not go unpunished."" The proposed package has six pillars, she said.

It would further block Russian vessels and Russian-operated vessels from accessing E.U. ports, with some exemptions, including for agricultural food products, humanitarian aid and energy, along with other measures aimed at cutting ""the money stream of Russia and its oligarchs.""

Sweden to expel 3 Russian diplomats for spying, foreign minister says Sweden will expel three Russian diplomats for spying, Foreign Minister Ann Linde said on Tuesday, joining a number of European countries that have expelled Russian diplomats in recent days. “It is because they are not following the Vienna Convention and they are undertaking illegal intelligence-gathering operations,” Linde told reporters. France, Belgium and the Netherlands have recently expelled Russian diplomats over alleged spying activity. The moves coincide with outrage across the continent over reports of the discovery of mass graves and of civilian killings in the Ukrainian town of Bucha following the retreat of Russian soldiers, conducting what Moscow calls its “special operation” in Ukraine. “It is obvious that war crimes have been committed,” Linde said. The Kremlin denies any accusations related to the murder of civilians, including in Bucha. Share this -







Japan’s top envoy brings back 20 Ukrainians from Poland Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi returned from Poland on Tuesday with 20 Ukrainians displaced by Russia’s ongoing war on their country as Tokyo seeks to play a greater role in international support for Ukraine. During three days in Poland, Hayashi visited facilities for Ukrainian refugees in Warsaw and held talks with Polish officials, international humanitarian organizations and civil groups to assess how Japan can provide support. He said the visit ""renewed my resolve"" that Japan should ""cooperate with international society and provide the utmost assistance."" Japan has an extremely strict refugee policy and has been reluctant to fully accept migrant workers, making its offer to accept Ukrainians unusual. However, the government has carefully called them evacuees and it is still unclear if the Ukrainian situation will change its immigration policy. Tokyo expects the 20 evacuees will stay in Japan for at least six months, and will provide further support if needed, said Deputy Justice Minister Jun Tsushima, who was traveling with Hayashi. Tokyo has previously accepted about 300 other Ukrainians, all relatives of about 2,000 Ukrainian residents in Japan who arrived on their own since the Russian invasion began. Share this -

Zelenskyy says negotiations with Russia still necessary despite events in Bucha Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday that the country still needed to negotiate an end to the war, even after the reports of atrocities and attacks on civilians in Bucha and other cities around the capital. “I think I have no other choice,” he told journalists in a press conference aired on Ukrainian television. “We cannot fight constantly,” he added. “It does not suit us, and we need security guarantees.” Still, he said, ""I think this is a great tragedy in general, because all of us, as I consider myself a part of society, will see even the possibility of negotiations as a challenge.""

Seven humanitarian corridors to open Tuesday, Ukraine says Seven humanitarian corridors to evacuate residents from cities in the south and east of Ukraine were set to open Tuesday, the country’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said in a message posted on Telegram. The besieged southern port city of Mariupol was included in the list, with residents scheduled to go to Zaporizhzhia in their own vehicles rather than buses. However, safe routes out of the city have come under fire or been blocked in recent weeks making evacuations difficult or impossible, and Vereshchuk offered little reason for hope Tuesday. “Despite the promises of its leadership, the occupying forces do not allow anyone to travel to Mariupol,” she wrote on the Telegram post. Seven buses were planned to help evacuate residents of Manhush, just east of Mariupol. Russian forces blocked Red Cross representatives on Monday, according to Vereshchuk. “After negotiations, they were released at night and sent to Zaporizhia,” Vereshchuk said. Share this -

Today is April 4. Russia's military attack on Ukraine has been going on for forty days. We're reporting on all current news. The article will be constantly updated.

What about today?

Key points

During the past 24hrs, 7 enemy attacks have been repulsed in Donetsk and Luhansk regions, and two units of armored vehicles, forty-three vehicles, and an enemy mortar have been destroyed.

Anti-aircraft missile forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine have hit 6 air targets in the past 24 hours: three planes (Su-34, Su-35, and an IL-22 radio relay aircraft), one helicopter, and two cruise missiles.

One of the downed planes is a modern IL-22 radio relay aircraft, which acted as an air control point, and carried out reconnaissance operations. The impact of our air force on the plane probably happened in Russia, near Taganrog, at an altitude of about 4000 meters.

Recent data on enemy losses during the entire period of hostilities:

About 18,300 soldiers were killed!

tanks – 647 units,

armored combat vehicles – 1844 units,

artillery systems – 330 units,

MLRS – 107 units,

air defense means – 54 units,

aircraft – 147 units,

helicopters – 134 units,

automotive equipment – 1273 units,

ships / boats – 7 units,

fuel tanks – 76,

UAVs of operational and tactical level – 92.

special equipment – 25.

OTRK / TRK launchers – 4.

From Zelenskyy's night video address: ""The world has seen many war crimes. At different times. On different continents. But it's time to do everything to make the war crimes of the Russian military the last manifestation of such evil on earth. Everyone guilty of such crimes will be entered into a special book of executioners. They will be found and punished.""

""This is not a war of two states and not a war of nations. This is a war of civilization and savage medieval barbarism. We will definitely defeat this savage Moscow horde. But we must win and remain civilized,"" said Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar.

12:00 – Now heavy fighting continues in Kharkiv, Luhansk, and Donetsk regions. Our troops are pushing back the occupiers in the Kherson region. Chernihiv remains in a difficult situation. The defenders of Mariupol, who have already become legends of today, are fighting heroically, said the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Oleksii Reznikov about the situation on the fronts.

President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited Bucha, where evidence of mass killings of civilians was found. When asked by the BBC if he still considered it possible to discuss peace with Russia, he said: ""Yes, because Ukraine must gain peace. We are in 21st century Europe. We will continue diplomatic and military efforts.""

""Ukrainian prisoners were kept in a field, in a pit, in a garage. They were beaten and intimidated. Soldiers from the island of Zmiinyi, who were taken to Sevastopol, were used by local propagandists, and then kept in a tent camp at -20 ℃, which caused many to have frostbite. They were treated like prisoners and put a dog on them,"" said Ombudswoman Liudmyla Denisova on her Facebook page.

The Defense Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense has published a list of personnel of the russian brigade that took part in war crimes against civilians in Bucha, the Kyiv region.

The Ministry of Culture and Information Policy expressed its deepest condolences to the families and relatives of all the wounded, taken prisoner, missing and journalists killed. So far, russia has committed 74 crimes against media representatives in Ukraine, including 19 against citizens of other countries: Great Britain, the Czech Republic, the United States, Denmark, the UAE, Russia, Ireland, Switzerland, France, and Lithuania. 18 journalists were killed, 8 were abducted, 13 were injured and three went missing.

The genocide perpetrated by the russians in Ukraine may be the largest in Europe since World War II. The number of civilian casualties in Irpin and Bucha has already exceeded the number of internationally recognized war crimes cases in the Croatian cities of Gospic and Vukovar. It is still unknown how many civilians died at the hands of the Russians in 450,000-people Mariupol.

But we know for sure that all those guilty of inhumane crimes will be put on trial and will receive their punishment. Of course, if they live.

""Currently, the fate of the whole of Eastern and Central Europe and the Black Sea region is being decided on the territory of Ukraine. Therefore, to protect the freedom of Ukraine, to protect the freedom of Ukrainians is to guarantee the security of Europe,"" Zelenskyy said in an address to the Romanian government.

In his speech, Victor Orban, who won the election, named Zelenskyy among those who prevented his party's re-election: ""This victory will be remembered for a lifetime because so many people rebelled against us, including the left at home. left abroad, bureaucrats in Brussels, all the foundations and organizations of the ruling empire, foreign media, and ultimately even the Ukrainian president.""

Greece will help rebuild Odesa after the war. This was stated by Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias during a meeting with Deputy Prime Minister for European Integration Olha Stefanishyna, the press service of the ministry reports. ""In these difficult times, we will be part of this future, helping you to rebuild this city and make it even more beautiful, even better,"" Dandias said.

14:30 – The Prime Minister of Poland Mateusz Morawiecki criticized Macron for frequent calls to putin: ""President Macron, how many times have you negotiated with Putin, what have you achieved? Did you stop any actions that took place? No one negotiated with Hitler. Would you negotiate with Hitler, with Stalin, with Pol Pot?"" And really, what's the point in conversations that lead to nothing?

Dmytro Kuleba said that Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi had expressed solidarity with Ukraine over the mass killings of civilians in Ukraine. ""We both share the belief that ending the war against Ukraine is in the interests of peace, food security, and international trade,"" Kuleba said after a conversation with Wang Yi. It should be noted that there were no comments on the events in Bucha.

""Britain will never hesitate to support our friends, and I have no doubt that when this time of suffering is over, Ukraine will be reborn and take its place among free and sovereign states again,"" said British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in a video appeal. ""We in Britain are fascinated by the courage and patriotism of Ukrainians."" Thank you!

19:00 – The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Lithuania ordered the russian ambassador to leave the country, according to the website of the agency. The Lithuanian government is also closing the consulate in Klaipeda, ""given the general unconstructive role of the Russian diplomatic service in its aggression against Ukraine.""

The United States is asking to exclude russia from the UN Human Rights Council. This was stated by the Permanent Representative of the United States to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield over the massacre of civilians in Bucha. ""russia's participation in the Human Rights Council is a farce. This is wrong, and that is why we believe it is time for the UN General Assembly to vote to exclude them,"" she told Reuters.

After the Bucha massacre, the eyes of the President of Germany were opened. Frank-Walter Steinmeier regrets former support for Russia: ""My commitment to the Nord Stream-2 gas pipeline was a clear mistake. We clung to bridges that Russia no longer believed in, as our partners warned us. I did not believe that Putin will accept the complete economic, political and moral decline of his country for the sake of his imperial madness,"" Steinmeier admitted.

21:00 – Germany and France send russian diplomats out of their countries. The German Foreign Ministry has declared 40 diplomats from Russia non grata. In turn, France has also decided to send a significant number of Russian diplomats for actions contrary to the country's security. However, their exact figure is currently unknown.

Reaction to the atrocities of the russian occupiers in Ukraine

The Prime Minister of Poland Mateusz Morawiecki: ""No more maneuvers and false gestures. Enough! Sanctions do not work. Cut off oxygen from russia's genocide!""

""First, Ukraine needs three things: weapons, weapons, and weapons again."" This was stated by Polish leader Andrzej Duda after the publication of photos from Bucha. ""Criminals must be called criminals, prosecuted and convicted. The Bucha photos refute the belief that compromise must be sought at all costs. In fact, Ukraine's defenders need three things: weapons, weapons, and weapons again.""

Emmanuel Macron said that the russian authorities would have to answer for the crimes in Bucha: ""The footage coming from Bucha, a liberated city near Kyiv, is intolerable. Hundreds of civilians were cowardly killed in the streets. My condolences to the victims, my solidarity with Ukrainians.""

InformNapalm volunteers found the data of the commander of military base 51460, russia's 64th separate motorized rifle brigade, which according to preliminary data committed war crimes in Bucha, Kyiv region. This is Lieutenant Colonel Omurbekov Azatbek Asanbekovich

Email address: mnac1981@gmail.com

Address: Knyaze-Volkonskoye, Khabarovsk district.

The war crimes of the russian military in Bucha and other cities will be considered at a meeting of the UN Security Council on April 5, said President Zelenskyy.

Former UN tribunal prosecutor for ex-Yugoslavia and Rwanda Carla del Ponte has called on the International Criminal Court to issue an arrest warrant for putin. Del Ponte explicitly called putin a ""war criminal"" over russia's invasion of Ukraine and stressed that the issuance of an arrest warrant would be an important signal that ""investigative work has been carried out.""

Who and how will carry out the arrest itself is a rhetorical question, there is no answer to it, but such steps are necessary. First, it will be an ""important signal"" that putin is no longer an equal member of the world's civilized community. No talks are being held with terrorists.

Moldova has declared April 4 a day of mourning for all those killed in russia's invasion of Ukraine, President Maia Sandu. ""It is impossible to watch the atrocities in Bucha and other Ukrainian cities. Shocked by the brutality against the civilian population. Moldova strongly condemns these crimes against humanity, this illegal and unprovoked war against Ukraine."" Is it possible to sponsor the aggressor's army by buying gas from them?

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida condemned the atrocities of the russian military in Bucha: ""I am deeply shocked by the horrific atrocities against civilians on the outskirts of Kyiv. The killing of innocent civilians is a violation of international humanitarian law. This is absolutely unbearable, and Japan strongly condemns it. russia must take strict responsibility for these actions.""

Crimes of the russian occupiers in Bucha are on the front pages of world newspapers! Europe, America, the world wake up! We are dealing with pathological killers and maniacs!

The European Union ""strongly condemns the atrocities committed by the russian armed forces in several Ukrainian cities."" This is stated in a statement issued by the European Council on 4 April.

""Evidence of the huge number of dead and wounded among the civilian population, as well as the destruction of civilian infrastructure, show the true identity of the brutal aggressive war that russia is waging against Ukraine and its people. The massacres in Bucha and other cities in Ukraine will be included in the list of atrocities committed on European soil,"" the statement said. According to the European Council, the russian authorities are ""responsible for the atrocities committed while they controlled the area.""

The Turkish embassy said it shared the pain of the friendly Ukrainian people over the crimes in the suburbs of Kyiv and expected an independent investigation.

""It is impossible to remain indifferent to the horrible images from Bucha, near Kyiv, after the withdrawal of the russian army,"" Israel condemned the actions of the russian armed forces in Bucha. The relevant statement was made by Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid on Twitter.

What's in russia?

""When Bucha was under the control of the russian Armed Forces, no local resident suffered from any violence,"" said the Ministry of Defense of the russian federation. And this was said after the documented atrocities of the russian army shocked the world!

russia has begun covert conscription of reservists. They expect to attract approximately 60,000 people. Conscripts are seduced by unrestrained looting, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reports.

putin signs decree suspending visa facilitation agreements with unfriendly EU countries, Norway, Switzerland, Denmark, and Iceland

After Bucha Massacre, russia demands to convene an urgent meeting of the UN.

But it was denied. The UN Security Council will not meet on April 4 at russia's request to discuss ""criminal provocations by Ukrainian soldiers and radicals"" in Bucha but will hold a scheduled meeting on the war in Ukraine on April 5. The russians can't stop: the russian Foreign Ministry has stated that it will address the Security Council with a new proposal to hold such a meeting.

What about belarus?

The names of the occupiers who sent the property robbed in Ukraine to Russia became known. The looters delivered the stolen items through the post office in Mozyr (belarus), where they were caught on video by surveillance cameras.

Russian lies

russia's Defense Ministry is trying to deny the atrocities of its army in the Kyiv region. However, they fail to do it, traditionally. ""russian troops left Bucha on March 30,"" the Russian Defense Ministry said yesterday. Also, the same Ministry of Defense, but on April 1: ""Bucha and other settlements are under the full control of russian troops.""

Russian propagandists changed the name of the maps ""success of the special operation"" to ""special operation."" Judging by the map, ""successes"" have decreased significantly in just two days.

An eloquent comparison of how Google search engine and Kremlin-controlled Yandex search engine process Bucha's request.

The Center for Strategic Communications investigated the main narratives in the russian media amid the massacre staged by the occupiers in Bucha and other cities of the Kyiv region. One part of russian propaganda wrote something sacramental and hysterical: ""Someday we will hear and see the testimonies of these people, who may have been forced to lie at Volkssturm rifle point and imitate the dead on the cold ground."" The second dispersed the ""analysis of memories"" such as: ""Tactics of video staging ceased to amaze me in Syria…""

In fact, a year ago the russian media wrote that ""Ukrainians want to build Srebrenica in Donetsk region."" Now the Russians themselves arranged it in Bucha.

Sanctions on the aggressor!

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that the West would soon agree to further sanctions against russia in connection with the war and, in particular, the atrocities committed in Bucha. This was reported by DW.

French President Macron has also called for new sanctions against Russia, which he says should affect coal and petrol. He confirmed that they would be discussed in the coming days.

According to Bild, up to 100 employees of russian diplomatic missions are going to be sent away from Germany.

Wargaming, which has created such popular MMO games as World of Tanks and World of Warships, has decided to close its business in russia and belarus. Wargaming has also started the process of closing its studio in Minsk.

Because of international sanctions being introduced, russia has lost the ability to supply a wide range of military, dual, and civilian goods. However, it would be a mistake to underestimate the enemy's agility. According to the Ukrainian Defense Intelligence, in order to circumvent the sanctions, russian agents are setting up smuggling channels that pass, in particular, through Georgia. At the same time, representatives of the Georgian special services were instructed by the political leadership not to interfere with the activities of smugglers.

Today we know about another channel of supply of military goods to Russia, East Asia. Through it, spare parts for machinery, electronics, and optical devices are delivered to the occupying country.

It became known that the possibility of resuming flights between Georgia and Russia is being considered.

The Polish prime minister called Germany the ""main brake"" on new sanctions against russia. He also added that Hungary does not block the possibility of tightening restrictions against russia. In addition, Moraweczki is convinced that the current sanctions against Russia are not enough: ""We need clear, tough sanctions. The current ones do not work, and decisive action is needed to break putin's military machine. Otherwise, more innocent people will die.""

Japan is shocked by the crimes committed by the Russians near Kyiv. Tokyo, along with the civilized world, is in favor of tough sanctions against moscow, said Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi.

But Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg opposed the Russian gas embargo. According to him, in addition to the gas embargo, ""there are enough other opportunities where [the EU] could tighten the sanctions valve.""

But the Italian authorities do not plan to block possible sanctions against the supply of russian gas, said Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio.

Trophies of the Ukrainian Armed Forces

Another trophy was won in the Brovary district.

Vasylkiv's territorial defense, together with the staff of the Defense Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, captured the Russian BMD-4. This was announced by the commander of the territorial defense unit Vasylkiv Shield Andrii Melnyk.

BMD-4 after inspection and necessary repairs will be used by our defenders on the front line.

Russian equipment was shattered in one of the liberated villages in the south of the Kharkiv region. It was the servicemen of the 93rd separate mechanized brigade, Kholodnyi Yar, who set the russians on fire.

Life considering hostilities

The Center for Countering Disinformation at the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine reports on the security of the ""Tell your story about the war in Ukraine"" message from Ukraine with reference to mywar.mkip.gov.ua, which Ukrainians received yesterday. mywar.mkip.gov.ua is a website created by the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy of Ukraine so that citizens can tell their war stories to the whole world. The account from which the message under the name ""Ukraine"" was sent belongs to the State Special Communications Service.

At the same time, today, after receiving this message, messages with the following text began to appear on the Internet: ""Do not open, delete, this is for the purpose of obtaining data."" These intimidations are not true. It's just that someone really needs the stories about the war not to be heard.

Ukraine has launched a chatbot to search for people with whom contact was lost during the war, https://t.me/Family_Search_bot. How to use the search people service is in the instructions at the link.

Wikipedia has published an article entitled Bucha Massacre, which tells about the horrors that took place in the city during its occupation by Russian troops. The article is also available in Russian.

April 4, International Day for Mine Awareness and De-mining Assistance. For Ukraine, this is no longer just one of the Days that can be read on Wikipedia. Thousands of munitions remain unexploded through Ukrainian streets and fields after enemy shelling. The occupiers, retreating, chaotically mine everything they can: the corpses of the people they killed, children's toys, houses, kindergartens, and even their abandoned equipment, trying to mutilate as many people as possible.

Therefore, the Ukrainian Armed Forces call on:

Returning to your hometown and village after the official permission of the state and local authorities. Specialists risk their lives every day in order to eliminate the consequences of the enemy's presence!

If you are in combat areas, do not try to clear explosive devices yourself. Report them to specialists immediately.

Be sure to instruct children and loved ones.

The Ministry of Justice said that in the Vinnytsia region and Kyiv City, the newborn boy and girl were named Yan Javelin and Javelina.

Kyiv and region

Bucha was liberated. The city continues to be demined. Humanitarian aid is distributed to those who remain there. In the city itself, there are the bodies of the dead. Russian military equipment. Waste. Empty shops. And the guys with the basketball on the playground. Life is stronger than death! Ukraine will win!

Kyiv metro resumes traffic across the South Bridge. Trains on this branch will start running from 8:30 on April 4, the Kyiv City State Administration reports. Also, as of today, traffic in both directions on the North Bridge has been completely restored. The Kyiv City State Administration notes that the Darnytsia Bridge is still working for road connections between the left and right banks. The South Bridge remains open to public transport, including the metro.

Bucha Mayor Anatolii Fedoruk said at least 280 people were buried in mass graves. But this is an approximate figure because they are still searching. And the first mass graves in Bucha around the church appeared on March 10. This is evidenced by satellite images of the American company Maxar Technologies.

A Ukrainian woman from the village with the eloquent name Peremoha (victory in Ukrainian – ed.), Baryshyvka district, took possession of a bag of ammunition and hid it in a cage for rabbits. She has already given it to the Ukrainian soldiers who liberated her native village. Everyone is making our victory closer as best they can.

The photo above shows a mass grave in the village of Motyzhyn, Kyiv region, which was discovered after the withdrawal of Russian troops. Here, among other buried villagers, the village head elder Olha Sukhenko was tortured.

Killed children under the age of 10 with signs of violence and torture were found in Irpin and Bucha: ""Some of the killed children have their hands tied. Children. Children were tied up. Shot dogs. Killed women. Girls under 10 with torn vaginas. Irpin, Bucha, Dmytrivka. How to explain it? How?""

A torture chamber with the bodies of five dead men was found in the basement of one of the children's sanatoriums in Bucha. They also had their hands tied.

Almost 5,000 explosive devices were found in the Kyiv region on April 3, mostly ammunition, the State Emergency Service said. ""Don't hurry to return!"" the SES urges. ""Wait for the official permission, be careful!""

The worst situation with regard to civilian casualties is in Borodianka, Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova said. ""We can talk about the Kyiv region, because yesterday we got access to it, and we are working on Irpin, Bucha, Vorzel. I think we will talk about Borodianka separately. There is something to talk about,"" she said. The exact number of victims in the city has not yet been named.

20:00 – Kyiv Mayor Vitalii Klychko appealed to Kyiv residents not to return to the city at least until the end of this week:

In some districts of the Kyiv region, there is now a curfew around the clock.

In the region and suburbs of Kyiv, there are many mines and shells that did not explode.

Despite the fact that the air defense works quite effectively, missile attacks on the capital are not ruled out.

Getting around the city is complicated by a large number of checkpoints.

Kyiv residents were promised to be informed when it will be possible to return to the capital.

A temporary crossing will be built in Stoianka on the site of the destroyed bridge over the Irpin River. It will be opened in two weeks. It will take up to four months to fully restore the bridge.

Donetsk and Luhansk regions

russian occupation forces continue to accumulate military equipment and personnel in the Luhansk region. On the night of March 4, the Ukrainian military repulsed an attack by the russian occupiers in the Rubizhne area. According to the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration Serhii Haidai, the occupiers are using the residents of the temporarily occupied territories as ""cannon fodder.""

New photo of Mariupol, ""liberated"" by russian orcs. It is scary to imagine what will open to the world after the liberation of the city.

In a letter to Biden on Tuesday shared with CNN, Sen. Ed Markey and Rep. Bill Keating, both of Massachusetts, expressed concern that Russia could lash out with further cyberattacks in Ukraine or with hacking that tests NATO’s resolve as Russian military progress in Ukraine stalls.

A cyberattack last week on Ukrtelecom, which describes itself as Ukraine’s largest “fixed line” internet and phone provider, that reportedly knocked connectivity down at the telecom operator to 13% of its pre-war levels.

The lawmakers, both members of their respective chamber’s foreign affairs committees, want a newly formed cybersecurity bureau at the State Department to bolster US cooperation with Ukraine and European allies on cybersecurity issues, and in turn help defend against Russian hacking threats.

A spokesperson for Markey’s office called the $37 million the White House requested from Congress to run the bureau in fiscal 2023 a “strong starting point,” but said that it was “imperative” that the State Department coordinate with government entities like the US Cyber Command and the Department of Homeland Security that have long provided cybersecurity assistance to Ukraine.

CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.

Separate from the new bureau, the State Department has overseen millions of dollars in aid to Kyiv to shore up its networks in recent years. And the head of US Cyber Command, the military’s hacking unit, said Tuesday that the command dispatched a team of cyber specialists to Ukraine late last year to help defend Ukrainian infrastructure.

More on the hacks: While there have been an array of Russia-linked hacking incidents against Ukrainian organizations since the war began, there haven’t been the level of disruptive hacks against critical infrastructure that some analysts feared.

One exception was a cyberattack at the onset of the war that knocked out internet service for tens of thousands of satellite modems in Ukraine and elsewhere in Europe. US officials are investigating that incident as a potential state-sponsored Russian hack, CNN previously reported.

On March 21, Biden warned US business executives that “the magnitude of Russia's cyber capacity is fairly consequential and it's coming."" So far, no consequential hacks on US organizations publicly attributed to the Russian government have emerged. But US officials continue to prepare for the possibility.

Markey and Keating asked Biden to “promptly” nominate an ambassador-at-large to lead the State Department’s new cybersecurity bureau. (Secretary of State Antony Blinken told State Department employees Monday that Biden would nominate someone for the role “very soon.”)

The Democratic lawmakers also want to know what lessons the Biden administration have learned from Russian hacking in Ukraine in recent weeks.

“How is the Administration coordinating U.S. government agencies to apply these lessons to shore up potential U.S. vulnerabilities as well as those of our allies and partners?” Markey and Keating wrote to Biden, asking for answers by April 29.",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-04-05-22/h_e0695ed5aef31b981207031420358d24

But as the Russian invasion continues, it’s now also home to Ukrainian refugees, fleeing violence and seeking safety.

Oleg Smaliychuk, the owner of the team, has opened the club’s offices as a resting place for hundreds of Ukrainian refugees.

(CNN)

“We left because of our children. We left our town because we were afraid of their psychological state. We have a war there, and we were very scared,” said Katia, a woman currently living at the soccer club with her sister-in-law and their four kids, via translator.

CNN’s Jake Tapper visited with Katia and her family, who fled Donetsk, heading west in hopes of avoiding the violence that plagues their city.

“I miss my grandmother and I would like to be back in my town. Because here everything looks very unfamiliar to me,” says 11-year-old Yegor, the eldest of the children.

Smaliychuk, the team's owner, told CNN he's been so impacted by the violence and terror, that he is contemplating a new career path.

“I want to change my profession. I bought a rifle. I want to become a sniper,"" he told Tapper. ""I believe after what we have seen, what happened in Bucha, the number has increased 10-fold of people like me who want to join.""
