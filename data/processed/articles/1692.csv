He led the London Symphony Orchestra in New York in 2015.

Valery Gergiev, the star Russian maestro and prominent supporter of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, was removed Tuesday from his post as chief conductor of the Munich Philharmonic after he refused to denounce Mr. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.

And Anna Netrebko, the Russian diva who is one of opera’s biggest international stars and also has ties to Mr. Putin, saw her upcoming engagements with the Bavarian State Opera canceled, and the Zurich Opera House announced that she had withdrawn from her next performances there.

Mr. Gergiev’s abrupt dismissal, three years before his contract was set to expire, was the biggest setback yet for the conductor, who has been the target of widespread anger and condemnation in recent days for his long record of support for Mr. Putin, whom he has known for three decades.

Dieter Reiter, the mayor of Munich, said that Mr. Gergiev, who had held the post of chief conductor there since 2015, had failed to respond to a demand issued on Friday by Mr. Reiter that he condemn Mr. Putin’s “brutal war of aggression” by Monday or be fired.

“I would have expected him to reconsider and revise his very positive assessment of Russia’s leader,” Mr. Reiter said in a statement. “He didn’t.”

Mr. Gergiev was also dismissed on Tuesday from his position as honorary conductor of the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra. The orchestra’s managers, who had also recently asked Mr. Gergiev to denounce Mr. Putin, said in a statement that they had spoken with Mr. Gergiev but could not resolve an “unbridgeable” divide. The orchestra said it was eliminating its “Gergiev Festival.”

Mr. Gergiev did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.

Ms. Netrebko also came under fire for her ties to Mr. Putin, who has awarded her prizes and praised her artistry. Ms. Netrebko endorsed his re-election bid, and has at times appeared to lend support to his policies, including in 2014, when she was pictured holding a flag used by some Russian-backed separatist groups in Ukraine.

While she had in recent days sought some distance from the invasion, issuing a statement over the weekend saying she opposed the war, she has remained silent on Mr. Putin.

The director of the Zurich Opera House, Andreas Homoki, called Ms. Netrebko’s statement condemning the war a “positive development” and said the company did not “consider it appropriate to judge the decisions and actions of citizens of repressive regimes based on the perspective of those living in a Western European democracy.”

But Mr. Homoki went on to note that the opera house’s “decisive condemnation” of Mr. Putin and his actions was “not compatible with Anna Netrebko’s public position.”

He said that Ms. Netrebko had decided not to sing in the upcoming performances, and relayed a statement from her that said: “This is not a time for me to make music and perform. I have therefore decided to take a step back from performing for the time being. It is an extremely difficult decision for me, but I know that my audience will understand and respect this decision.”

After the cancellations were announced on Tuesday, Ms. Netrebko posted a picture on Instagram of herself with Mr. Gergiev smiling after a concert. Then, in a separate post, she wrote: “As I have said, I am opposed to this senseless war of aggression and I am calling on Russia to end this war right now, to save all of us. We need peace right now.” Both posts were then deleted.

The Metropolitan Opera did not make any announcement regarding Ms. Netrebko’s scheduled appearances this spring, but Peter Gelb, its general manager, said in an interview on Tuesday that “The Met stands by its position that artists who support Putin are not going to be allowed to perform at the Met.”

Asked about Ms. Netrebko’s statement opposing the war, Mr. Gelb said, “In the case of somebody who is so closely associated with Putin, denouncing the war is not enough.”

Before the Met performed Verdi’s “Don Carlos” on Monday evening, the company performed the Ukrainian national anthem.

The fast-moving events showed how quickly arts organizations around the world had moved to sever ties with some of Russia’s most prominent cultural ambassadors since the start of Mr. Putin’s invasion on Thursday.

Mr. Gergiev had lost a number of engagements in the days that followed, but the loss of his leadership position at the helm of a major European orchestra suggested much more serious ramifications for his international career.

It is a stunning turnaround for Mr. Gergiev, whose packed schedule and regular engagements with many of the world’s leading concert halls and opera houses has led the website Bachtrack, which collect statistics on classical music performances, to proclaim him the world’s busiest conductor in several recent seasons.

Mr. Gergiev endorsed Mr. Putin’s re-election and appeared at concerts in Russia and abroad to promote his policies. The two have known each other since the early 1990s, when Mr. Putin was an official in St. Petersburg and Mr. Gergiev was beginning his tenure as the leader of the Mariinsky, then called the Kirov.

Mr. Putin has played an important role in Mr. Gergiev’s success, providing funding to the Mariinsky Theater, where Mr. Gergiev serves as general and artistic director.

Mr. Gergiev’s international engagements began drying up last week, when Carnegie Hall and the Vienna Philharmonic dropped him from a series of performances. On Sunday, Mr. Gergiev’s manager announced he was ending his relationship with his client.

The manager, Marcus Felsner, said in a statement that it had become impossible to defend Mr. Gergiev, whom he described as “one of the greatest conductors of all time, a visionary artist loved and admired by many of us, who will not, or cannot, publicly end his long-expressed support for a regime that has come to commit such crimes.”

On Monday, the fallout continued, with the Verbier Festival in Switzerland saying it had asked for and accepted the resignation of Mr. Gergiev as music director of the festival’s orchestra. (The festival also said it would ban other artists who had shown support for Mr. Putin’s actions, and that it would return donations from individuals under sanctions from Western governments.)

The Edinburgh International Festival in Scotland, where Mr. Gergiev served as honorary president, also said Monday that he had resigned his position after being asked to do so. Philharmonie de Paris, a performing arts complex in France, announced it was canceling two concerts in April with Mr. Gergiev and the Mariinsky Orchestra. And the Lucerne Festival in Switzerland said it was canceling two performances in August with Mr. Gergiev and the Mariinsky.

“In view of Russia’s acts of war in violation of international law, we are sending a clear signal of solidarity to the people of Ukraine,” Michael Haefliger, the festival’s executive and artistic director, said in a statement.

Shortly after the mayor of Munich announced his decision on Tuesday, a spokesman for the Elbphilharmonie in Hamburg, Germany — another major concert hall — said it, too, had canceled Mr. Gergiev’s future engagements. Several other institutions are considering similar moves, including Teatro alla Scala, in Milan.

The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making “the most important decision of their life -- to fight.”

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.”

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the major developments on Russia's invasion, how Kyiv is fighting back, the plight of civilians, and Western reaction. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.

Zelenskiy noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.”

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

KRAMATORSK, Ukraine — “I thought it was a dream, or big fireworks maybe,” says Lara. “I just pulled the duvet over my head so I could go back to sleep.” The blood rushes to the cheeks of the 37-year-old hotel worker with long, combed-back hair. “But of course, the world can’t be pushed away so easily, especially when it’s so menacing and so violent.”

What had jolted Lara and all the other residents of the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk from their sleep at 5 o’clock on Thursday morning were the powerful but dull denotations of numerous Russian missiles targeting the airport and the Ukrainian military’s radar installations.

At the same time, similar attacks were taking place in several other cities. The procedure was straight out of the military handbook: taking out the air defenses as the first step in a full-scale invasion. “The day before, everything was still normal and peaceful,” says Lara. “Now all of a sudden we’re at war, and no one knows what terrible things may be in store for us.”

In Kramatorsk, the shops, supermarkets and restaurants are closed. Early in the morning, there are already long queues at gasoline stations, cash machines and pharmacies. There is a curfew in effect from 10 o’clock at night until 5 o’clock in the morning. During the day, it remains quiet, but for a few explosions and the occasional burst of machine-gun fire. But the Russian army is getting closer and closer to the city. It seems to be only a matter of time before it reaches Kramatorsk. And then the 150,000 inhabitants will have no choice but to flee.

Many of them have been through this before, in 2014. “We were in our basement when a missile destroyed our house,” Lara recalls. “We had to get out of there as fast as we could.” That time, war had broken out following the mass demonstrations in Kyiv’s Maidan Square and the overthrow of the pro-Kremlin government.

People who remained in Severodonetsk went en masse to banks and shops

Separatists fought with Russian support against the Ukrainian army and founded the “People’s Republics” of Luhansk and Donetsk. In the eight years since then, the Donbas conflict has turned some 1.5 million people in Ukraine into refugees; and now hundreds of thousands are once again being driven from their homes.

The first to be affected were the inhabitants of Severodonetsk, roughly 90 kilometers from Kramatorsk. The city authorities made the decision to evacuate on the first day of the war. “We organized the evacuation because the fighting was getting too close,” explains the mayor, Oleksandr Stryuk, from behind his big, varnished desk. “We set up four assembly points for residents. Those who didn’t have a car were taken to the railway station by bus and then by train to safe areas in the west of Ukraine.”

The roads leading out of Severodonetsk are packed, the vehicles all filled to capacity. Suitcases, bags and boxes are piled up in pickup trucks. Evidently, things are not moving fast enough for some drivers, who overtake at break-neck speed. The seemingly endless line of traffic also includes military vehicles, armored ambulances and a Médecins Sans Frontières convoy.

The city itself is virtually deserted. The gray, run-down rows of Soviet-era apartment blocks add to the sense of desolation. In the city center, in the huge square with its bare trees and damp benches, there are only a few people to be seen. At the entrance to the regional administration, a soldier with helmet, bulletproof vest and rifle stands guard.

The entrances to the offices are locked — no staff have turned up for work. The governor is said to have been moved to a secret location with his staff. “Get out of here,” says the young soldier with the clean-shaven, almost delicate face. “This is a state of emergency. Leave the building immediately.” He takes a step forward and holds the barrel of his gun tighter with one hand, to lend extra weight to his order.

Outside, the passers-by are not much more talkative. They brush questions aside with a scowl, walk past quickly, seem annoyed. These people have remained in Severodonetsk even though Russian tanks could soon be rolling through the streets. They don’t want to talk about it.

An elderly woman suddenly stops. But she just wants to vent her anger, and in the process reveals her sympathy for the Russian-backed separatists in the region. “For eight years, Ukraine has been shelling the people’s republics,” she claims in an angry voice. “But the moment the missiles start flying in the other direction, the whole world gets worked up about it.” She walks on in disgust.

‘Where am I supposed to go?’

Tatjana responds somewhat differently. Asked why she has stayed, the 60-year-old pensioner replies: “Where am I supposed to go, without any family or a single cent in my pocket?” Yet she would have reason enough to leave. “Our lives here are miserable, we’re destitute, and we’ve been at war for the last eight years. Can you imagine how it feels to never know if life will still be the same tomorrow?”

The uncertainty gnaws at her nerves, she says. “If the Russians do invade, at least we’ll know where we stand.” She believes they might finally bring the long-awaited peace. “For me and many others, it no longer matters who brings peace. Whoever does that will be welcome.”

The words of these two women would be music to the ears of Russian President Vladimir Putin. He claims that the purpose of his invasion is to protect the Russian population, who are a minority in Ukraine. But Mayor Stryuk, who has been in office since 2020, disagrees. “No, no, Severodonetsk has more than 130,000 residents, and most of them do not see the Russians as liberators. They feel Ukrainian and support the national army’s fight against the invasion.” The supposedly “pro-Russian outlook” is just the result of propaganda, he says.

The narrative of the oppression of the Russian-speaking population in Ukraine has indeed been spread on social media and by Russia’s state press for years. “The vast majority of the population don’t actively support either side in the conflict — they are just waiting for it to end and for peace to come,” says Volodymyr Fessenko of the Kyiv Center of Political Studies.

At the railway station in Lysychansk on Thursday afternoon, several hundred people are waiting for the train that will take them to safety in western Ukraine. They include more than 150 orphans: children and teenagers aged between 6 and 18, from Severodonetsk and elsewhere in the local area. Most of them are sitting patiently in the school buses that have brought them to the station.

“I only found out 40 minutes ago that we had to evacuate,” says Inna Sasonana, deputy director of one of the orphanages. One train has been canceled, and no one knows yet where the replacement train will be going. This is not a new experience for the 55-year-old. “We had to flee once before, in 2014, to Odesa,” she recalls.

Back then she told the children they were going to the Black Sea on holiday. This time she told them they were going to a spa for a while. “But the children immediately said: ‘We’re not stupid, we know what’s going on.’” Many of them had cried bitterly when they heard that they had to leave, she says.

The director of the orphanage is worried too, since she and a few colleagues will only be taking the children to their new homes. “We have to come back,” she explains. She is afraid that she will never see her charges again. “We’re all one big family,” she says, wiping the tears from her eyes.

The train, in which several carriages have been set aside for the orphans, pulls in punctually at 3 p.m. The children and teenagers climb on board, noisily but in neat lines. Helpers bring supplies for the journey: bottles of water, boxes of mandarins, boiled eggs, tomatoes, chocolate. When the train slowly moves off, everyone is sitting, well behaved, in their seats.

3,7b132fd4-453f-4d94-916d-6193e3ed89fd,"['Rachel Treisman', 'Terry Gross', 'Frank Langfitt', 'Npr Staff']",2022-02-28 00:00:00,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has officially signed an application for Ukraine's membership in the European Union, according to a post from his verified Facebook page.

""[Zelenskyy] has just signed a historical document — Ukraine's application for European Union membership,"" tweeted Andrii Sybiha, the deputy head of the president's office. Ukraine's prime minister and head of parliament also signed a joint statement, he added.

The move comes hours after Zelenskyy released a video appealing to the EU for membership and calling on Russian forces to go home. He urged the EU to allow Ukraine's immediate entry under what he described as a ""new special procedure,"" on which he did not elaborate.

""Our goal is to be with all Europeans and, most importantly, to be equal,"" he said, according to a translation from The Guardian. ""I am confident that it is fair. I am confident we have deserved it. I am confident that all this is possible.""

Ukraine is not currently recognized as an official candidate for EU membership, though it's been part of an association agreement with the EU (in which both parties agreed to align their economies in certain areas and deepen political ties) since 2017, as Politico notes.

Zelenskyy discussed membership with European leaders

Zelenskyy's plea echoes remarks he made over the weekend when he pushed publicly for Ukraine's accession into the EU and discussed the subject with European leaders.

Zelenskyy tweeted on Saturday that he had spoken with European Council President Charles Michel, writing: ""It is a crucial moment to close the long-standing discussion once and for all and decide on Ukraine's membership in the #EU.""

Michel responded in a tweet of his own: ""#Ukraine and its people are family. Further concrete support is on its way.""

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told Euronews on Sunday that Ukraine is ""one of us and we want them in"" the European Union.

But she suggested its entry wouldn't be immediate, saying the process would involve integrating Ukraine's market into that of the EU and noting that the two cooperate closely in areas such as energy.

Indeed, the EU's own website stresses that ""becoming a member of the EU is a complex procedure which does not happen overnight.""

The process involves time-consuming negotiations

A country can only apply once it satisfies certain conditions, including having a free-market economy and stable democracy and accepting all EU legislation as well as the euro. Then it submits its application to the European Council, which asks the European Commission to assess the country's ability to meet those criteria.

If the commission's assessment is favorable, the European Council must unanimously agree on a formal framework for negotiations, which then take place between ministers and ambassadors of EU governments and the candidate country.

""Due to the huge volume of EU rules and regulations each candidate country must adopt as national law, the negotiations take time to complete,"" the EU explains.

Five countries are currently in the process of integrating EU legislation into national law: Albania, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia and Turkey. Two others — Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina — are classified as ""potential candidates"" because they do not yet meet the criteria to apply for membership.

4,7b132fd4-453f-4d94-916d-6193e3ed89fd,['Miami Standard News Staff'],2022-02-28 00:00:00,"When Christina was 19 years old, she came out as gay and was swiftly booted from her family’s home in Hialeah. Now, almost 15 years later, she teaches language arts at a public charter school in northwest Hialeah.

Christina wants her students to feel accepted and adorns her classroom with rainbow decals and “safe space” stickers. She sponsors the school’s Gay-Straight Alliance, a student-run club that unites LGBTQ youth and their allies. Students — especially the ones questioning their gender identity or sexual orientation — have come to trust her. One student even confided to her that he was gay — the first time the 17-year-old had ever uttered the words out loud to another person. Both of them cried.

“I could tell he was burdened by whatever it was,” Christina tells New Times. “As soon as we sat down, he started to talk about himself, about his family, and about the culture of oppression and silence he had worked under all this time.”

Christina, who requested New Times withhold her real name for fear of professional retaliation, worries about her LGBTQ students now that the Republican-controlled Florida House of Representatives passed HB 1557, commonly referred to by opponents as the “Don’t Say Gay” bill last Thursday. The bill prohibits any instruction on sexuality and gender between kindergarten and third grade or “in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.” It also requires school-district personnel to notify parents if there is a change in the “student’s mental, emotional, or physical health or well-being…to encourage a student to discuss issues relating to his well-being with his or her parent or facilitate discussion with the parent.”

Even though an amendment that would have required educators to “out” LGBTQ students to their guardians was axed following national outrage, scores of public educators across the state, particularly those who identify as LGBTQ, worry that if Gov. Ron DeSantis signs the bill into law, a culture of fear and silence will descend over classrooms, overriding the trust students place in their teachers. This is especially concerning given that LGBTQ youth already face higher rates of bullying and suicide than their straight, cisgender peers.

“So much of the trust students place in the adults in their lives would be eroded by something like this,” Christina says. “I don’t know that I would’ve had the chance to have that [coming out] conversation [with my student], and I don’t know if he would’ve been comfortable.”

Generally speaking, a violation of this law would open the door for parents or guardians to sue the school district.

“The bill is designed to keep school districts from talking about these topics before kids are ready to process them. I don’t think it’s controversial to empower parents,” said Rep. Joe Harding (R-Williston), a co-sponsor of the bill, in a video clip he tweeted responding to criticism. “Kids can and will talk about whatever they want at school. We just want to make sure that teachers promote that discussion at the right age level, and we want to make sure parents are kept in the loop.”

The bill now heads to the Florida Senate, where lawmakers are expected to vote along party lines and forward along the legislation to DeSantis’ desk.

“If signed into law, these bills will have disastrous impacts on classrooms and workplaces,” Brandon Wolf, spokesman for LGBTQ rights group Equality Florida, tells New Times. “They will turn Florida into a surveillance state and give the government broad license to censor conversations about American history, the origins of racism and injustice, and the existence of LGBTQ people.”

Last week, the Florida House passed another, similarly controversial bill, HB7, under the guise of protecting “individual freedom,” called the “Stop Woke” bill.

The proposed legislation would make it so public-school educators are banned from teaching so-called Critical Race Theory and, like the “Don’t Say Gay” bill, would pave the way for the district and educators to be sued if they don’t comply.

And as with “Don’t Say Gay,” Christina stresses, “This bill seeks to destroy the trust educators have built with their students, and that connection is so beautiful, unique, and influential to young people.”

On a recent afternoon, Christina held court with several students who are members of the school’s Gay-Straight Alliance club to discuss their feelings about the bill.

Their responses were written down and shared with New Times.

One 17-year-old who’s gender-queer and uses both she and they pronouns, wriote: “The whole point of the bill is to ostracize queer students, because if it isn’t being taught in school, how are they supposed to learn about people who are different? It affects students as a whole and makes them feel wrong about their identity. There is the secondary effect that schools (where most of us spend so much time) will no longer be able to help students who are struggling with their identities in safe ways.”

Another 17-year-old wrote that she worries about a future in which students are too afraid to discuss LGBTQ issues with teachers, creating a culture of silence and stigma.

The bill, she wrote, “stigmatizes the community” and “implies that the community is somehow harmful to children.

“You are taking away an opportunity for children to know different kinds of people.”",https://miamistandard.news/2022/02/28/miami-teacher-prepares-students-for-florida-dont-say-gay-bill/
