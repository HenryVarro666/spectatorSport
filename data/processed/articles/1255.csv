When the Russian military convoys rolled into the town, the local territorial defense, armed only with assault rifles, was quickly overrun.

‘When the column was advancing, they [Russian troops] opened fire at civilians. We had 8 people killed. Then they started to shoot not only with assault rifles but fired from military armored vehicles and tanks, as well’ said Yerko.

Soon the town was targeted with bombardments that left people buried alive in the basements of destroyed 9-story residential buildings.

City services rushed to rescue them, but the effort fell through as airstrikes resumed.

The next rescue attempt was hampered by another Russian military convoy—their tanks and armored vehicles opened fire at people clearing debris at the site.

‘We approached them with a letter, but they didn’t allow us to clear the debris’.

Russian troops also blocked humanitarian convoys—though at first they agreed to an evacuation, this lasted only 80 minutes, during which, fortunately, 400 people were evacuated from the local orphanage. All further attempts to resume evacuation were thwarted, as the town found itself the epicenter of relentless fighting.

‘They didn’t give us loudspeakers and banned us from going out. The cell network was cut off for 10 days. We didn’t know how to inform people that they were going to be saved. We took a risk and sent some people to run along the street to call aloud that evacuation was coming. But, when the evacuation effort got underway, people didn’t know where they were going to be taken to—Gomel in Belarus or native Ukrainian territory,’ said Borodyanka’s mayor.

Meanwhile in Bucha, officials are now working to recover the bodies of those killed by Russian soldiers, as well as to de-mine the town territory. Yerko said that, due to several cases of looting, the town council was forming community patrols to attend to the issue.",https://bykvu.com/eng/bukvy/they-fired-at-houses-and-peaceful-residents-borodyanka-mayor-tells-about-russian-war-crimes/

The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making “the most important decision of their life -- to fight.”

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.”

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the major developments on Russia's invasion, how Kyiv is fighting back, the plight of civilians, and Western reaction. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.

Zelenskiy noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.”

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

Sergiy Gaidai, head of the Lugansk regional state administration, announced Monday that Russian forces are preparing to launch a massive attack on Ukrainian forces in the eastern province.

""We see equipment arriving from different directions. We see the Russians strengthening their ranks and refueling... We know that they are preparing for a massive attack,"" Haidai said in a video message.

He added that the bombing attacks are intensifying, as last night an attempt to enter Robyzhny near Lugansk was witnessed.

He continued, ""Unfortunately, two volunteers were killed yesterday by a mine or artillery shell explosion,"" and ""a church was bombed and two monks were injured.""

""Please do not hesitate. Today, I have evacuated a thousand people. Please do not wait until your homes are bombed,"" calling on residents to evacuate.

In turn, the mayor of Borova, Oleksandr Tertyshnyy, asked the residents of the town to leave, stressing that this was aimed at preserving their safety.

Two days ago, the Ukrainian authorities said that the Russian forces were withdrawing from areas in northern Ukraine, especially in Kiev, with aim to relocate them east and south of the country.

Yesterday evening, Ukrainian presidential advisor Oleksiy Aristovich told reporters: ""The Russian forces are regrouping with the intention of continuing the offensive in Mariupol and Kharkov.""

""The Russian forces will try to encircle our forces [...] and finish Mariupol, but we are all convinced that they will not succeed,"" he added.

On March 23, Haidai announced that an agreement was reached and humanitarian corridors for the evacuation of civilians will be opened.

Authorities in the People's Republics of Lugansk and Donetsk said that the Ukrainian forces continued to target civilian areas to the east, confirming more deaths and injuries.

The week before, Russia's Defense Ministry also announced that the Lugansk People's Republic troops have liberated more than 90% of the territory of the republic with the support of the Russian Armed Forces.",https://english.almayadeen.net/news/politics/russian-forces-preparing-to-launch-major-attack-in-lugansk

KYIV - Russian troops are preparing for a big attack in the Lugansk region of eastern Ukraine, the local governor Sergiy Gaiday said on Telegram Monday, urging a mass evacuation.

""We see that equipment is coming from different directions, they are bringing manpower, they are bringing fuel,"" Gaiday said in a video statement.

""We understand that they are preparing for a full-scale big breakthrough,"" he added.

Gaiday urged residents to leave the region as soon as possible.

""Please don't wait for your homes to be bombed,"" he said in a separate video.

""Do not hesitate,"" he added, specifying that 1,000 people had been evacuated on Monday.

A senior Pentagon official said Russia has removed about two-thirds of the troops it had around Kyi, who were mostly sent back to Belarus with plans to redeploy elsewhere in Ukraine.

""The bombardments are becoming ever denser. Last night there was an attempt to break through at Rubizhne (near Lugansk). (But) our defenders repulsed and put several tanks out of action, there were dozens of (Russian soldiers') corpses, Gaiday said.

""Yesterday, sadly, two volunteers were killed in a mine or mortar explosion,"" he went on, adding ""a church was bombed.""

The mayor of Borova, Oleksandr Tertyshnyy, whose town is midway between Lugansk and the main eastern city of Kharkiv, said local authorities ""had to take a decision to evacuate the population... for citizens' security. Those who can leave in their own vehicle are encouraged to do so,"" he said on Facebook.

Oleksy Arestovitch, a Ukraine presidential advisor, added that ""the enemy is in the process of regrouping its forces with the intention of pursuing the offensive... in the region of Mariupol and Kharkiv.

""The enemy will seek to encircle our troops... and finish off Mariupol,"" already largely destroyed after weeks under siege.
