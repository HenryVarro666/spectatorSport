History

7-th guards Airborne Division was formed on the basis of the 322-guards parachute landing Regiment order of Kutuzov guards 8 Airborne Corps in Polotsk, Belarusian military district. In accord with the instructions of the commander of the 4th Guards Army, the XX Guards Rifle Corps was to take up a defensive line by 1500 hours on 19 August 1943. The configuration of the corps was double-echelon. On the defensive in the first were the 7th and 8th Guards Airborne Divisions and in the second the 5th Guards Airborne Division. The 7th Guards Airborne Division consisting of the 18th, 21st and 29th Airborne Regiments, the 10th Guards Artillery Regiment, the 8th Guards Separate Antitank Battalion and the 466th Mortar Regiment of the RVGK [Reserve Supreme High Command] which had been attached from the army reserve deployed along the line of Veseloye, Prokopenko.

In the evening of 19 August and the night of 20 August, the airborne troops of the 7th Guards Airborne Division under the command of Gen M.G. Mikeladze fought stubbornly against the enemy 7th Panzer Division. Regardless of superiority in tanks and assault guns, the enemy was unable to advance to the east. The men of the antitank artillery and antitank riflemen let the enemy combat vehicles come within range of direct firing and destroyed them with accurate fire, while the airborne troops with small arms fire cut the infantry off from the tanks and caused it great damage. The guardsmen boldly engaged the tanks which had broken through, destroying them with antitank grenades and Molotov cocktails. In the morning of 20 August, the corps received the orders: with the forces of the 7th and 8th Guards Airborne Divisions and cooperating units of the III Guards Tank Corps with support from the attack aviation of the 2d Air Army, to launch a meeting attack against the advancing enemy grouping reinforced by units of the 11th and 19th Panzer Divisions which had been committed to battle.

The successful actions of the airborne divisions from the XX Guards Rifle Corps in the course of the meeting engagements to the southeast of Akhtyrka became possible to the rapid deployment of the units of the 7th and 8th Guards Airborne Divisions and to the skillful configuration of their battle formations. In assessing the actions of the XX Guards Rifle Corps and the 7th Guards Airborne Division in this fighting, MSU G.K. Zhukov wrote in his memoirs: ""In the fierce engagement for Akhtyrka, the formations of the XX Guards Rifle Corps under the command of Gen N.I. Biryukov and units of Gen M.G. Mikeladze particularly distinguished themselves....""(

The fighting ended in Trebon' May 12, 1945 (Czechoslovakia). On April 26, 1945 for the exemplary job command on the front connection was awarded the order of Kutuzov (3rd class), it announced 6 thanks of the Commander-in-Chief, 2065 soldiers, sergeants and officers were rewarded for fighting the orders and medals of the USSR. April 26 by order of the Minister of defence of the USSR set the day.

On October 14, 1948, the Division was relocated to Kaunas and Mariâmpol' of the Lithuanian SSR. In 1956, the Union participated in the Hungarian events, and in 1968, Czechoslovak. Units of the Division were the first in the airborne troops (VDV) mastered making parachute jumps from an-8, an-12, an-22, IL-76, tried out some new parachute systems d-5, d-6. The personnel Division for the first time committed to dropping after the flight at the height of 6-8 thousand. m using oxygen devices.

David E. Johnson, Adam Grissom and Olga Oliker at the RAND Corporation told the story of the 7th in the Prague Spring. In 1968 the 7th Guards Airborne Division was tasked with the critical mission of decapitating the Czechoslovakian government in Prague. The Soviet operational plan for the invasion of Czechoslovakia called for VDV parachute and air-landing operations at multiple locations within Czechoslovakia and cross-border attacks by Warsaw Pact forces. The invasion began on the evening of August 20. At approximately 8:30 p.m., a Soviet Air Force air-control aircraft, in deceptive Aeroflot markings, landed at Pragues Ruzyne airport. This airplane and its crew were on hand to provide air-traffic control for the arrival of the 7th Guards Airborne Division in the event that the airports own control tower was knocked out during the coming military action. At 3:37 am, under the cover of MiG-21 fighters, the 7th Guards Airborne Division started air-landing at the Ruzyne airport. In short order, one of its assault companies sealed off the airport while KGB special operations team took over the airports control tower.

With the airport secured, further elements of the 7th Guards Airborne Division began arriving every 30 seconds. By 4:30 a.m., special assault groups, composed of elements of the divisions reconnaissance company and the 108th Guards Paratrooper Regiment, had taken two objectives. One column took the presidential palace in Prague and arrested Ludwig Svoboda, President of Czechoslovakia. The other column of paratroopers, led by KGB personnel, took the Czechoslovakian Communist Party headquarters in Prague. There, they arrested Secretary Dubcek and some two dozen other top government officials.

Marines connection has been to participate in major exercises and maneuvers as a ""shield-76"", ""Neman"" zapad-81, 84-West», «Dozor-86 "", etc. For their high combat skills during exercises zapad-81 ""Division was awarded the Pennant of the Minister of Defense of the USSR"" for courage and military prowess. During the past three exercises were dropping combat vehicles together with their crews. On May 4, 1985 for successes in combat and political training and in connection with the 40-th anniversary of victory in the great patriotic war, the Division was awarded the order of the red banner of labour.

In the period from 1979 to 1989. the vast majority of divisional officers and warrant officers have conducted international duty in the Republic of Afghanistan. Many of them were awarded State prizes.

A schedule for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Lithuania was signed on 8 September 1992 during the Russian-Lithuanian negotiations. The withdrawal was to be completed by 31 August 1993. This totally applied to the Airborne Troops. Absolutely everyone had been provided with separate apartments. The air field and the parachute jumping area permitted training up to 10,000 men simultaneously. Nearly 250 rail flat cars were required to redeploy each regiment. Nearly 1,200 families resided in the garrison. Units were withdrawn to sites that had not been prepared and, as happened many times, requests for release into the reserve will begin to rain down. There would be practically no compulsory service soldiers or sergeants in the subunits by spring 1993.

Since August 1993, the Division deployed on the territory of the North Caucasus military district. In 1993-1996. military units and units 7 GW. report performing peacekeeping missions in Abkhazia. From January 1995 to April 2004, a combined airborne battalion of the Division with the means of strengthening the task performed to restore constitutional order in the Chechen Republic.

From February 1998 to September 1999, the military manoeuvre Group (VMG) 7th report fulfilled the task to combat terrorists in the Botlikh district of Dagestan, r.. In August 1999, the 7th VMG report first made a hit by Chechen militants, invading the Botlikhsky district. From 1999 to April 2004, the Division had participated actively in the anti-terrorist operation in the North Caucasus. For his courage and heroism while performing combat tasks during the counter-terrorist operation was awarded more than 2.5 thousand. paratroopers Division.

In August 2008 Russian forces coerced Georgia into peace. The decisive role in the operation was played not by the motorised infantry stationed in the conflict zone but by paratroopers. In Abkhazia, the situation in that region was largely stabilised thanks to the paratrooper assault battalion of the 108 Airborne Assault Regiment, which had been flown in from Novorossiysk. When we seized the electronic scenarios envisaged by the Georgian military, the initial plan was to attack not South Ossetia but Abkhazia. The reinforcement of the peacekeeping group with an airborne battalion by agreement with the Abkhazia leadership virtually saved that state.

The 7th Guards Airborne-Assault Division was hastily deployed to southern Dagestan in September 2012. The division includes 6,000 soldiers. The transfer of the division came amid reports that Moscow is considering the possibility of launching large-scale military operations in the Caucasus Emirate.

Mid-March 2014 saw a strengthening of Russian forces in the Crimea (notably with paratroopers from the 7th Guards Airborne Division from Novorossisk) and further pressure on the relatively few Ukrainian forces there.

On 02 February 2019 the commander of the Airborne Forces, Colonel-General Andrey Serdyukov, in Novorossiysk, presented to the command and personnel the new commander of the 7th Guards Airborne Assault Order of the Red Banner Orders of Suvorov and Kutuzov, 2nd degree of the division. During the solemn ceremony, the commander of the Airborne Forces accepted the battle flag of the formation from the hands of the guards, Major General Roman Breus, who had commanded the division since 2014, and handed it over to the new commander - guards colonel Andrey Sukhovetsky.

At a solemn rally, Colonel General Andrei Serdyukov said: Comrade soldiers, sergeants, ensigns and officers, dear veterans and dear guests! By Decree of the President of the Russian Federation of December 25, 2018 No. 743, a worthy, competent, combat-experienced officer - Guards Colonel Andrei Alexandrovich Sukhovetsky was appointed to the position of division commander.

""Throughout their combat path, the guardsmen of the 7th Airborne Assault Division have always been an example of courage and military prowess, more than once proving their devotion to the Motherland in practice. During the Great Patriotic War, in the course of carrying out a special government task in Azerbaijan, in the mountains of Afghanistan, in the North Caucasus, in the course of operations to force Georgia to peace, return the Crimea, the paratroopers of the 7th division showed high professionalism, mutual assistance and unparalleled heroism.""

On February 28, 2022, while performing a combat mission during a special operation in Ukraine, Major General Andrey Sukhovetsky, Deputy Commander of the 41st Combined Arms Army of the Russian Ground Forces, heroically died. Andrei Alexandrovich Sukhovetsky was drafted into the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in 1991. Since then, he devoted his life to serving the Motherland, courageously stood up for its defense, with honor ensured the inviolability of its interests.

Fulfilling his military duty to the Fatherland, Major General Sukhovetsky participated in hostilities on the territory of the Republic of Abkhazia in 1995-1998, on the territory of the North Caucasus region in 1999-2000, on the territory of the Syrian Arab Republic in 2018 and 2019. In February 2019, Andrey Alexandrovich was appointed commander of the 7th Guards Airborne Assault Red Banner, Orders of Suvorov and Kutuzov Division (mountain) and served in this post until November 2021. For military merit, Major General Sukhovetsky was awarded two Orders of Courage, the Order of Military Merit, the Medal for Courage and many other state awards of the Russian Federation.

Excerpted from a February 26 Newsweek article:

“By February 25, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was considering an invitation from Moscow to hold ‘neutrality’ talks in neighboring Belarus. If those talks happen, Putin will then be able to pull back troops and end the conflict—while having dealt the West a humiliating blow.

And that, military and Russia experts agree, may be the real point.“

****

I don’t believe that Putin is primarily motivated to tweak the West. If anything, it’s more the other way around. His primary motivation is to militarily strike before Ukrainemightbecome a strong NATO beachhead, in conjunction with better securing the position of the Donbass rebels. I make this assessment, while being uncomfortable with the action undertaken and some of the responses to it.

The selective outrage is breathtaking, given the lack of attention to the plight of the Donbass rebel inhabitants. These people have endured eight years of reckless shelling from the Kiev regime. (Among other sources, refer to David Hendrickson’s February 22 National Interest article and the content referenced in a same day Aaron Mate tweet.)

Within Russia and​ abroad, there’s the view that Zelensky periodically gets stonewalled by Kiev regime nationalist circles and perhaps the US government. The latter certainly hasn’t helped to calm things down.

Zelensky won the last Ukrainian presidency on a campaign promoting better relations with Russia, including an end to the war in Donbass. Upon assuming office, Zelensky drifted in a noticeably opposite direction from his election platform. In US mass media, Tucker Carlson has exposed what keen Russia-Ukraine observers have already known about Ukraine being democratically challenged.

In the last Ukrainian presidential election, Petro Poroshenko was Zelensky’s main opponent. Poroshenko ran on a nationalist platform. He was once friendly with ex-Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili, who is now imprisoned in Georgia.

During the 2008 war in the Caucasus, Saakashvili regularly appeared on CNN, spouting neocon/neolib out anti-Russian rhetoric. Over the past weekend, Poroshenko has pretty much done the same on that network.

In English language TV media, the CGTN America shows (particularly The Heat show) covering Russia-Ukraine, are generally superior to what France 24’s The Debate, Al Jazeera’s Inside Story and RT’s CrossTalk have put out. A respectfully diverse and knowledgeable panel makes for great viewing.

Lagging behind are the BBC, CNN, PBS, MSNBC and NPR, among numerous others. Some (not all) of the CGTN Western hired reporters and moderators periodically exhibit the inaccurate slants evident in Western mass media.

What follows is an updated message I sent to some of the people who’ve appeared on that network, as well as some others who’re involved with Western mass media and/or think tank circles. I appreciate the private replies. MA

I’ve a response to what Michael O’Hanlon, Serhiy Kudelia and Lincoln Mitchell said on CGTN.

Regarding a thought from Dr. O’Hanlon, NATO is a definite existential threat to Russia, as evidenced by the anti-Russian commentary regularly dished out by key NATO brass over the years. In comparison, someone like a now ex-German naval commander gets pushed out for offering a counter view.

NATO exhibited its bias going back to the 1990s. From that period, compare the reply to Russia’s open inquiry about joining NATO to those granted NATO membership. I’ve provided details on that blatant anti-Russian bias.

Poland presently has a nationalist anti-Russian government which some in the West consider as democratically challenged. Hypothetically, what happens when a noticeably anti-Russian NATO country picks a fight with Russia? Exclusively or otherwise, is Russia always in the wrong? There’s also the matter of how NATO militarily engaged itself on non-NATO territory in 1999.

The Neo-Nazi situation in Ukraine meshes with how the US government and Kiev regime were the only two delegations voting against a General Assembly resolution denouncing the glorification of Nazism. As I’ve noted, the official US explanation for its vote is crock.

Over the decades, the US body politic has been influenced by the activism of pro-Stepan Bandera elements in the Ukrainian American community. Dominating the Captive Nations Committee, these individuals influenced the US Congress to pass the Nazi like Captive Nations Week Resolution, portraying Russia and Russians as the benefactors of Communism at the expanse of others.

This move understandably offended the late Alexander Solzhenitsyn and offends people in the Russian American community, who’re proud of their dual background. Do Russian lives matter? In Ukraine, monuments honoring pre-Soviet figures Alexander Suvorov and Mikhail Kutuzov get disrespected unlike what’s accorded to the memory of Bandera.

Paul Robinson perhaps best sums up this situation by saying that Ukraine isn’t a Nazi state, while having a Nazi problem. This subject has been definitely downplayed in the US.

Note how US mass media recently covered a Ukrainian granny getting a shooting lesson from a group wearing the fatigues with the logo of a Neo-Nazi militia. The coverage didn’t mention that affiliation. Such oversight is common when the black and red Banderite flag is shown in news clips.

The Neo-Nazi elements have been evident among the forces which have killed and displaced many in the rebel Donbass area over the past eight years. Relying solely on Western mass media, some might be duped into wrongly believing that substantial war related deaths and population movement suddenly began on Ukraine’s Soviet drawn boundary.

When belittling the Neo-Nazi role in Kev regime-controlled Ukraine, Dr. Mitchell notes his family’s Russian Empire Jewish roots. I sense that my family’s Russian Empire/Soviet Jewish and Russian Orthodox Christian backgrounds, have given me a broader scope, enabling me to make the following observations.

After WW II, the Banderites de-emphasized their anti-Jewish and anti-Polish activity, as they hyped an extreme anti-Russian message. In the US, this is more likely to be accepted:

The USSR was created to benefit Russians at the expense of others.

As opposed to –

The USSR was created to benefit Jews at the expense of others.

In reality, both are inaccurate. Likewise, with The NYTs’ Juliet Macur distinguishing between “clean athletes” and “Russians” How is that different from categorizing “law abiding citizens” and “Blacks“?

Concerning sports demagoguery, the IOC is advocating for the Russian flag and anthem to be banned from sporting events, as a response to the Russian military action in Ukraine. With the exception of the disingenuous decision against Yugoslavia (then consisting of Serbia and Montenegro) at the 1992 Barcelona Summer Olympics, when did the IOC ever ban another country for involvement in a war that led to many deaths and homeless, whether before, during or after an Olympiad?

Especially sickening, is Wayne Gretzky calling for a ban of Russia from the rescheduled World Junior Ice Hockey Championship. He never advocated banning Team USA to protest the many who died care of US military action. I don’t support such a banning. We’re talking about athletes – in this instance young ones. Russian NHL players are in a difficult position to speak out against Gretzky.

The gross arrogance, ignorance, hypocrisy and bigotry pertaining to Russians is quite evident. Make no mistake about it, many on the territory of Ukraine (in addition to some others elsewhere) are opposed to this deceit.

With the uni-polar world in decline, China is in a prime position to broker a Russia-Ukraine settlement. Beijing has good ties to Moscow and Kiev, with Chinese officialdom exhibiting a more balanced approach than their US and EU counterparts.

What do Winston Churchill, Henry Ford, Emma Goldman, Hitler, Houdini, Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, King Louis XIII and Queen Anne, Christy Mathewson, Franklin Roosevelt, Stalin, Mark Twain, Booker T. Washington, and George Washington have in common?

They are among the many real-life famous people who’ve had cameos — or more substantial supporting roles — in novels starring fictional characters.

It’s fun to see actual notables pop up in historical fiction, and sometimes in fiction that’s not that historical. We’re curious to see how the authors will portray them, and we hopefully get a sense of what those VIPs were like as living, breathing people rather than cardboard-cutout personages. Often, they’re depicted with various quirks and flaws that help make them feel at least somewhat three-dimensional.

Herman Wouk’s The Winds of War and War and Remembrance, both of which I read recently, are brimming with World War II-era officials. Of them, President Franklin Roosevelt gets the most page time because fictional U.S. Navy man Victor “Pug” Henry periodically serves under him as a roving military/diplomatic assistant. But we’re also in the room with a fair number of other leaders such as Churchill, Hitler, and Stalin — the last of whom pops up as well in Kate Quinn’s WWII-era novel The Huntress.

Much of Barbara Kingsolver’s The Lacuna is set just before WWII — in 1930s Mexico — and features extended appearances by three famous people encountered by made-up protagonist Harrison Shepherd. They are artists Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, and Russian-revolutionary-in-exile Leon Trotsky (who was murdered in 1940 on orders from the aforementioned Stalin).

Set earlier in the 20th century, E.L. Doctorow’s Ragtime is well-known for mixing fictional characters with actual notables such as Henry Ford, Emma Goldman, Harry Houdini, and Booker T. Washington.

Also set mostly in NYC around that time is E.R. Greenberg’s The Celebrant — about fictional immigrant Jackie Kapp and his friendship with real-life Hall of Fame pitcher Christy Mathewson of the New York Giants.

Continuing my reverse chronology, another baseball-themed book — Darryl Brock’s time-travel novel If I Never Get Back — has its fictional 20th-century-born main character Sam Fowler meet Mark Twain in 1869 and conduct a secret mission for the iconic author. In Brock’s Two in the Field sequel, Fowler meets General Custer, who is portrayed as negatively as he deserves.

A far-better general, George Washington, turns up in the part of Diana Gabaldon’s Outlander series set in the American colonies during the 1770s. Fictional protagonist Jamie Fraser briefly serves as an officer under Washington during the war with Great Britain.

Alexandre Dumas’ The Three Musketeers, which unfolds in the 1600s, includes real-life personages such as King Louis XIII and Queen Anne.

Getting back to the 20th century, an interesting cameo occurs in John Steinbeck’s East of Eden when we briefly meet…John Steinbeck, as a boy.
