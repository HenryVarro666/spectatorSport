It is worth mentioning Sukhoi-34 is an advanced twin-engine, twin-seat, all-weather supersonic medium-range fighter-bomber/strike aircraft which was first inducted into the Russian Air Force in 2014. Though Russia denied using Su-34 in the war against Ukraine, it was first seen on March 28 near the border of Kharkiv. Subsequently, several media outlets captured the Russian Air Force of using the advanced fighter jet in the war. Earlier on Thursday, the Ukrainian military claimed to have shot down a Su-30 fighter over Irpin near Kyiv.

Notably, Russia initiated a full-fledged war against Ukraine nearly two days after Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree recognizing the independence of breakaway regions Donetsk and Luhansk. Putin‚Äôs action came despite West‚Äôs repetitive warning and speculations about his ill-intention to invade Ukraine. Until then, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had called his Russian counterpart to meet him, seeking a resolution to avert the war. However, on February 24, the Russian troops started a military operation against Ukraine, resulting in the heavy shelling and killing of more than 2,000 Ukrainian civilians.

U.S. sets up hotline with Russia to prevent any ‚Äòmiscalculation‚Äô

According to Ukraine‚Äôs emergency service, the ongoing conflict destroyed hundreds of structures including transport facilities, hospitals, kindergartens and homes. Amid the continuous Russian aggression against Ukraine, the United States has now initiated a fresh move to avert further ‚Äúescalation‚Äù or ‚Äúmiscalculation‚Äù. According to a report by The Guardian, the US has recently established a hotline with Russia‚Äôs ministry of defence with an aim to prevent any miscalculation by Moscow. The well-known ‚Äòhotline‚Äô communication will enable the diplomats and other defence officials to share their critical views or demands related to the ongoing war.

Wreckage said to be of a Russian Su-34 bomber purportedly near Kharkiv ‚Äì Credits: Deez Nutz

According to the aviation-safety database, a Russian Air Force Sukhoi Su-30 is said to have been shot down by Ukrainian armed forces over Irpin and another Russian Air Force Sukhoi Su-34 bomber plane is said to have been shot down by Ukrainian armed forces near Volnovakha.

Sukhoi Su-30 Crash Details

A tweet from Lieutenant General Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, read: ‚ÄúWe have just shot down a Russian SU-30 fighter aircraft over Irpin. The combat crew of the air defense complex worked perfectly!‚Äù

Irpin is a satellite city located on the Irpin River in Kyiv Oblast right next to Kyiv city in northern Ukraine.

The news comes after several large explosions rocked the Ukrainian capital in the early hours of March 3.

Air raid sirens have continued to sound in Kyiv as Ukraine suffered mass casualties on March 2 and confirmed that Ukraine‚Äôs strategic city of Kherson had fallen.

Despite the fact that the BDZ-USK beam holder is used on many VKS aircraft (including the Su-24, Su-27, Su-30 and Su-34), the color scheme suggests it could be the Su-34 (?)

Sukhoi Su-34 Crash Details

Ukraine‚Äôs military announced on Thursday it had shot down a Sukhoi Su-34 light bomber operated by Russia. The Ukrainian General Staff announced on Facebook ‚ÄúA Russian SU-34 fighter-bomber has just been shot down by a Joint forces air defence unit near the town of VOLNOVAKHA.

The pilots of this plane carried out a barbaric bombardment of the civilian population and infrastructure of the city.‚Äù

The Su-34 is an extensively modified version of the Su-27 air superiority fighter and is optimized for long-range air-to-surface attack missions using bombs and missiles.

It has advanced electronics to aid in low-level flying and accurate weapons delivery. The Su-34 is different from other variants of the Su-27 family, due to its larger size and take-off weight and distinctive ‚Äòplatypus-shaped‚Äô nose, which enables the carriage of an advanced radar.

The Ukrainian military announced on Thursday it estimated Russia has lost about 9,000 personnel in the invasion, which began a week ago, as well as 217 tanks and 900 armored vehicles.

There has been variance in reporting of the death toll. On Wednesday, Russia claimed 498 of its soldiers had been killed and 1,597 have been injured in the first week of the invasion. However, western officials believe the casualties are significantly higher.

The Russian President has released an International Women's Day video where he says that conscripts and reservists are not being called up to fight on the frontline.

""Let me emphasise that soldiers who are doing military service do not and will not participate in hostilities... the assigned taks are solved only be professional military men,"" he said.

In contrast, Ukraine's military effort is being heavily staffed by civilian sign-ups.

Putin's message was aimed at allaying supposed concerns from Russian women - the ""mothers, wives, sisters, brides and girlfriends of our soldiers and officers who are now in battle.""

""I understand how you worry about your loved ones,"" he said.

He broadly characterised women by their ""loyalty, reliability and support"" throughout this speech.

""Our dear women, you make the world better and kinder thanks to your sensitivity, compassion and spiritual generosity. You combine charming tenderness and amazing inner strength.""

However, according to a report on 24 February by independent news outlet The Insider, there was evidence that some Russian conscripts had been forced to sign on before the invasion. The BBC has been unable to idependently verify this claim.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-europe-60635927

Day 11 ‚Äì 6 March 2022

There have been renewed attempts to establish ceasefires and humanitarian corridors around Mariupol. Civilian protests in Russian-occupied Kherson continue but the country‚Äôs other major cities remain in Ukrainian hands. The Ukrainian government continues to make calls for either a no fly zone or the transfer of combat aircraft to ensure Russia can‚Äôt attain air domination.

12:40AM (EET) ‚Äì Ukraine‚Äôs General Staff have shared an update on the situation on the ground. They state little has changed with continuing fighting on all fronts and Russian shelling of civilian areas. One piece of good news for Ukraine is that Chuhuiv, 30km east of the besieged city of Kharkiv, is reported to have been cleared of Russian forces (though it was never announced to have fallen). This would suggest in at least one area the Russian attempts to encircle the city have been rebuffed. This claim is difficult to independently verify and the situation the ground is extremely fluid.

12:10AM (EET) ‚Äì OSINT analysts Oryx have shared updated figures for verified losses of both Russia and Ukraine. Ukraine is reported to have lost 45 tanks, 35 armoured vehicles, and at least 8 aircraft.

9:40PM (EET) ‚Äì A No Fly Zone over Ukraine?

Ukraine‚Äôs government continues to pressure NATO to establish a No Fly Zone over Ukraine. President Zelensky, this morning, expressed his exasperation with NATO saying ‚ÄúAll the people who will die starting from this day will also die because of you [NATO]. Because of your weakness, because of your disunity.‚Äù

This evening Ukraine‚Äôs Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov renewed the pressure and released a video message on his Facebook making an ‚Äúappeal to the International community‚Äù. He thanked the West for their assistance so far but then highlighted the recent battle for Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, likening the danger this fighting posed to the 1896 Chernobyl disaster. He concluded:

‚ÄúYou cannot observe a nuclear catastrophe from afar ‚Äì it is not going to work out that way. Your arguments that the current refusal to implement A2/AD is related to the fact that NATO is trying to avoid the nuclear war is not convincing‚Ä¶ the only way for all of us to survive, and I mean the whole world, is the A2/AD [air defense] zone.‚Äù

At a press event this afternoon during a visit to Aeroflot President Putin was asked what Russia‚Äôs response to a No Fly Zone to which he replied: ‚ÄúAny movement in this direct would be considered by us as participation in the armed conflict.‚Äù

At a press conference on Friday Nato‚Äôs secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, again warned that the introduction of a NATO-led no-fly zone could likely lead to a ‚Äúfull-fledged war in Europe involving many more countries and causing much more human suffering.‚Äù

7,94ecb1d2-a2aa-42a5-b9fd-9c2f15a4690f,[],,"Ukraine's military announced on Friday claimed that they had shot down a Russian Sukhoi Su-34 fighter jet near the city of Volnovakha in eastern Ukraine. Taking to Facebook, the Ukrainian General Staff said that the pilots of the plane were involved in carrying out severe bombings on civilians and infrastructures of the city. ""A Russian SU-34 fighter-bomber has just been shot down by a Joint forces air defence unit near the town of VOLNOVAKHA. The pilots of this plane carried out a barbaric bombardment of the civilian population and infrastructure of the city,"" said the top military official.

It is worth mentioning Sukhoi-34 is an advanced twin-engine, twin-seat, all-weather supersonic medium-range fighter-bomber/strike aircraft which was first inducted into the Russian Air Force in 2014. Though Russia denied using Su-34 in the war against Ukraine, it was first seen on March 28 near the border of Kharkiv. Subsequently, several media outlets captured the Russian Air Force of using the advanced fighter jet in the war. Earlier on Thursday, the Ukrainian military claimed to have shot down a Su-30 fighter over Irpin near Kyiv.

Notably, Russia initiated a full-fledged war against Ukraine nearly two days after Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree recognizing the independence of breakaway regions Donetsk and Luhansk. Putin's action came despite West's repetitive warning and speculations about his ill-intention to invade Ukraine. Until then, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had called his Russian counterpart to meet him, seeking a resolution to avert the war. However, on February 24, the Russian troops started a military operation against Ukraine, resulting in the heavy shelling and killing of more than 2,000 Ukrainian civilians.

According to Ukraine‚Äôs emergency service, the ongoing conflict destroyed hundreds of structures including transport facilities, hospitals, kindergartens and homes. Amid the continuous Russian aggression against Ukraine, the United States has now initiated a fresh move to avert further ""escalation"" or ""miscalculation"". According to a report by The Guardian, the US has recently established a hotline with Russia‚Äôs ministry of defence with an aim to prevent any miscalculation by Moscow. The well-known ‚Äúhotline‚Äù communication will enable the diplomats and other defence officials to share their critical views or demands related to the ongoing war.
