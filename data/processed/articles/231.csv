March 8 (Reuters) - Chinese companies that defy U.S. restrictions against exporting to Russia may be cut off from American equipment and software they need to make their products, U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told the New York Times.

The U.S. could ""essentially shut"" down Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (0981.HK) or any Chinese companies defying U.S. sanctions by continuing to supply chips and other advanced technology to Russia, Raimondo said in an interview published on Tuesday.

Washington is threatening to add companies to a trade blacklist if they skirt new export curbs against Russia, as it ramps up efforts to keep a vast array of technology out of the country that invaded Ukraine last month. read more

If the United States were to find that a company like SMIC was selling its chips to Russia, ""We could essentially shut SMIC down because we prevent them from using our equipment and our software,"" Raimondo was quoted as saying.

SMIC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In Beijing, a foreign ministry spokesman said China opposed any unilateral sanctions and curbs by the United States, and urged that Washington's policy towards Ukraine and Russia ""should not harm China’s rights and interests"".

The spokesman, Zhao Lijian, told a regular news briefing, ""China will take all necessary measures to resolutely defend Chinese companies' and individuals' rights.""

Did you spend the weekend reading about the “Two Sessions” proposals, or were you, like me, endlessly doomscroolling about the Russian invasion of Ukraine? Today, we are going to discuss more about how China will be affected by the war, plus: Beijing goes after metaverse crimes, Elon Musk meets the Chinese ambassador, and Alibaba dominates cloud services in China.

The sanctions on Russia have spooked Beijing

The speed with which the U.S. and EU enacted sanctions on Russia took many Chinese observers by surprise. In the public discourse, finance and export sanctions are often grouped with the voluntary withdrawals by tech companies such as Apple and Microsoft as an example of how dependence on American and European products can be fatal to China. Also, the United States could put together the sanctions so quickly partly because it recycled its playbook against Huawei, economics researcher Martin Chorzempa pointed out. Chinese firms are carefully monitoring the situation and, in some cases, silently complying with the sanctions. Chinese tech companies, some of which have expanded their global footprints to Russia or Ukraine, have mostly remained silent. U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo specifically warned SMIC and other Chinese chipmakers they could face targeted sanctions if they keep selling to Russia.

Two of China’s largest state-owned banks have restricted financing for Russian commodities purchases, Bloomberg reported.

Alibaba, which has a joint venture in Russia with three sanctioned companies, has not said a word. DiDi was forced by public pressure to reverse its Russia exit decision.

Chinese companies won’t make independent decisions. They are likely to consult government officials in the first place to root out any political risks, a March 3 note by Eurasia Group pointed out. China sees itself one day becoming the target of Western sanctions as the U.S.-China decoupling discourse continues under Biden. Lists summarizing all Western sanctions and company pull-outs are making the rounds on Chinese social media, where people warn this could be China soon. Spooked by the possibility, “China is likely to intensify its self-sufficiency drive and further limit its technological interconnections with the outside world,” Chris Miller, an international history professor at Tufts University, told Protocol.

On the flip side, China can also be learning from the sanctions and “seeing whether and how China might assimilate some of them into its own coercive arsenal,” Carnegie Endowment VP Evan Feigenbaum told Jonathan Tepperman. But a sanctions alliance against China would be much harder to form. China is far more important to the global economy than Russia, and that would make both the U.S. and multinational companies think twice. Only 1.4% of Apple’s global revenue comes from Russia, but 19% comes from China, according to MarketWatch. Would Apple ever be willing to let 19% of its revenues vanish in one day?

China also has its legal tools to fight back: The Anti–Foreign Sanctions Law, in effect since June 2021, allows the Chinese government to punish foreign entities and individuals that impose sanctions on China. And thanks to years of deliberately building up self-sufficiency, China would be in a better place than Russia to cope with a void of Western tech products. Since the Great Firewall forced out Google in 2010, domestic tech giants have emerged to replace all the important Western tech platforms, software and hardware. China has been working on self-sufficiency since the NSA surveillance scandal pushed the Chinese government and companies to retire their American-made hardware and software.

There are still areas where Western companies largely dominate, like computer and mobile operating systems or high-end semiconductor manufacturing, but you can bet that China will be motivated to invest even more in these areas after the sanctions on Russia.

On Protocol China Alibaba is in a tough spot right now. Russia’s most-visited online marketplace is a joint venture between Alibaba and some of Russia’s largest companies. The Chinese ecommerce giant has invested heavily in the Eastern European market for its globalization ambition, and now the company has to carefully navigate between Russia, Ukraine and China.

Big Brother Beijing Beijing will go after metaverse crimes. An official from the Supreme People’s Procuratorate in China told 21st Century Business Herald that illegal fundraising in the name of the metaverse and NFTs had begun to emerge in recent months. The official said China’s top procuratorate will combat the new concepts and new types of fintech crimes through legislative proposals and judicial interpretations. Anti-war speech was censored at the Paralympics opening. When International Paralympic Committee President Andrew Parsons made a very moderate anti-war speech at the Friday opening of the 2022 Paralympics, his words were not translated in China’s official broadcast, and even his volume was lowered at certain points. IPC said it had asked China to explain the decision, but no response has been made public so far.

China goes global Elon Musk woos the Chinese ambassador. Last week, the Tesla CEO offered a Model S ride to China’s ambassador to the United States, Qin Gang. Qin described the ride as a “smooth” one despite the vehicle’s power. Musk pledged Tesla’s continuing cooperation with China in developing more climate-conscious tech, such as EVs. “The Chinese people are hard-working and intelligent, good at getting things done,” Musk said. “Tesla’s cooperation with China has been smooth and successful.” Chinese smartphone brands are unsure of their future in Russia. Before the war started, Chinese brands were frequently on the list of top-selling smartphones in Russia, but the ongoing war, the Western sanctions and the Russian economic collapse have made the situation more murky now. While Apple leaving the Russian market creates a theoretical window of opportunity for Chinese brands, most of them have stopped shipping new phones to Russia and are now just looking to clear their stock, Chinese tech publication Chuhai Post reported.

US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo has re-iterated that the US will enforce Chinese compliance with chip sanctions against Russia, according to Bloomberg.

“I’m not going to pretend it won’t be hard. We’ve never done anything like this. But we have a plan and we’re serious about it,” Bloomberg reported Raimondo saying during an interview at the White House on Wednesday March 9.

The US had previously indicated that it expected Chinese firms to comply with technology sanctions aimed at Russia (see Report: US expects Chinese firms to uphold Russian tech sanctions).

However, the Chinese government opposes the use of sanctions and expects normal trade cooperation with Russia. Indeed, the sale of broad range of mainstream components to Russia could provide a minor boost to China’s semiconductor industry. Sanctions that are not broadly supported tend to be ineffective.

No evidence of sanctions busting

Raimondo had previously said that the US has the ability to shut down Chinese chip manufacturers – such as Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMIC) – if they don’t comply with US sanctions.

SMIC is itself on a US entity list that has prevented it gaining access to extreme ultraviolet lithography equipment it still relies on US manufacturing equipment and software. SMIC is China’s leading domestic chip maker and might be wary of incurring further sanctions from the US that could hit its medium-term production capability.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo is threatening to “shut down” major Chinese chipmakers like SMIC from accessing critical US manufacturing tools if they violate the sanctions imposed on Russia and Belarus.

After Russia invaded Ukraine, the US, the EU and several key allies sanctioned it heavily, prohibiting the sales of semiconductors to Russia.

On Tuesday, U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo directly named China as a possible way for Russia to circumvent the sanctions placed on importing chipsets.

Before the invasion, Russia bought most of their chipsets from China but also sourced from Samsung and German company Infineon. Russia and China also had strengthened their trade ties in recent years, so the warning is dire.

Essentially, if China circumvents this ban, Chinese chipmakers could end up like Huawei, who was totally isolated from the US market and lost billions in revenue.

“They have their own self-interest to not supply this stuff to Russia. So they’re not doing it out of the goodness of their heart. It would be devastating to China’s ability to produce these chips,” Raimondo said to the Times.

US to “Shut Down” Chinese Chipmakers Who Violate Russian Sanctions",https://techthelead.com/us-to-shut-down-chinese-chipmakers-who-violate-russian-sanctions/
6,6846d1ea-4253-4ebe-b4bf-504a714c4ba8,[],2022-03-09 00:30:48+00:00,"Washington [US], March 9 (ANI): Chinese companies that defy Western sanctions on Russia and Belarus can be subjected to “devastating” actions, US Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said on Tuesday.

On February 24, Russia started the invasion of Ukraine. Since then, dozens of countries, including Japan, South Korea and Australia, have imposed financial sanctions and travel bans against Russia.

“We could essentially shut SMIC [Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation] down because we prevent them from using our equipment and our software,” Raimondo said told The New York Times (NYT) in an interview about Chinese firms that continue working with Russia.

US Commerce Secretary added that SMIC or any Chinese companies breaching US export control measures can be shut down should they deliver chips and other high-tech items to the sanctioned countries.

The NYT report said the export controls prohibit the sale of certain high-tech products, including advanced semiconductors, to Russia and Belarus.

According to the report, the export controls apply not just to US firms, but also to companies that use American software or technology to manufacture their products.

Raimondo’s remarks come a day after the US had issued a warning saying, Washington has the means to “take steps” against China if Beijing does not abide by the sanctions on Russia amid the conflict in Ukraine.

“We have also seen China abide by the sanctions that have been put in place. They obviously abstained, also from the UN Security Council vote, and have made some comments about the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. If they don’t abide by the sanctions we always have, you know, we clearly have means to take steps but that’s what we have seen today,” White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said during a press briefing.
