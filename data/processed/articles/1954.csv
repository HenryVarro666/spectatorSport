160,000 people still trapped in Mariupol - mayor

Russians turn effort towards separatist areas

LVIV/KHARKIV, Ukraine, March 28 (Reuters) - Ukraine said it was hoping that the first face-to-face peace talks with Russia in over two weeks, set for Tuesday, could lead to a ceasefire, but a U.S. official said President Vladimir Putin did not appear ready to make compromises to end the war.

The more than month-long invasion, the biggest of a Western nation since World War Two, has seen over 3.8 million people flee abroad, left thousands dead or injured, and brought the isolation of Russia's economy.

Nearly 5,000 people have been killed, including about 210 children, in the port city of Mariupol amid heavy Russian bombardment, according to figures from the mayor. Reuters was unable to immediately verify the numbers.

Survivors have told harrowing tales of people dying from lack of medical treatment, bodies being buried wherever space could be found, and women giving birth in basements.

A Ukrainian delegation arrived in Istanbul for the negotiations, TV footage showed.

""The minimum programme will be humanitarian questions, and the maximum programme is reaching an agreement on a ceasefire,"" Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said on national television.

""We are not trading people, land or sovereignty.""

Putin does not appear ready to make compromises to end the war, a senior U.S. State Department official told Reuters on Monday on condition of anonymity. read more

And Ukrainian interior ministry adviser Vadym Denysenko said earlier that he doubted ""there will be any breakthrough on the main issues.""

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said talks so far had not yielded any substantial breakthroughs but that it was important that they continued in person. He declined to give more information, saying that to do so could interfere with the process.

In besieged Ukrainian cities where conditions are desperate, the threat of Russian attacks blocked exit routes for civilians, two Ukrainian officials said.

In Mariupol, the mayor said some 160,000 people are trapped.

""There is no food for the children, especially the infants. They delivered babies in basements because women had nowhere to go to give birth, all the maternity hospitals were destroyed,"" a grocery worker from Mariupol who gave her name only as Nataliia told Reuters after reaching nearby Zaporizhzhia.

The United Nations said it had been able to bring food and medical supplies into Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-biggest city and one of its hardest hit.

The mayor of Irpin, near Kyiv, said Ukrainian forces were back in full control and a U.S. defence official said the Ukrainians had also recaptured the eastern town of Trostyanets, south of Sumy, and were continuing to try to take back ground.

Russia's defence ministry said its troops had destroyed ammunition depots in the Zhytomyr region west of Kyiv and had hit 41 Ukrainian military sites in the past 24 hours. Reuters could not immediately verify any of the reports.

Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation"" to disarm and ""denazify"" its neighbour. Kyiv and the West consider this a pretext for an unprovoked invasion to try to topple the elected Ukrainian government.

'CHANGE THEIR GOALS'

Tuesday's talks will be the first in person since an acrimonious meeting between foreign ministers on March 10, a sign of shifts behind the scenes as Russia's invasion has stalled and sanctions have hit home.

""We have destroyed the myth of the invincible Russian army. We are resisting against the aggression of one of the strongest armies in the world and have succeeded in making them change their goals,"" Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said.

He said 100 people had been killed in the capital, including four children, and 82 multi-storey buildings had been destroyed. It was not possible to verify the figures.

Russia's military signalled last week it would concentrate on expanding territory held by separatists in eastern Ukraine, but Ukraine said it saw no sign Russia had given up a plan to surround the capital.

When the sides last met in person, Ukraine accused Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov of ignoring pleas to discuss a ceasefire, while Lavrov said a halt to fighting was not even on the agenda.

Since then, they have held talks via video link and publicly discussed a formula under which Ukraine might accept some kind of formal neutral status.

But neither side has budged over Russia's territorial demands, including Crimea, which Moscow seized and annexed in 2014, and eastern territories known as the Donbas, which Moscow demands Kyiv cede to separatists.

British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said talks should not end up ""selling Ukraine out"", noting the ""uneasy settlement"" which left it vulnerable after Russia annexed Crimea.

Britain's defence ministry said there had been no major change in Russia's positions in the past 24 hours, with most Russian gains near Mariupol and heavy fighting underway there.

Elsewhere, Russia's armoured columns are bogged down, with trouble resupplying and making little or no progress.

""As of today, the enemy is regrouping its forces, but they cannot advance anywhere in Ukraine,"" Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Malyar said.

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

Russia’s most significant battlefield achievement in south Ukraine has been the capture of Kherson in the first week of March – seen as the first important gain towards a possible offensive against Odesa, the country’s third largest city.

But in recent days, CNN has reported on Russia’s struggles to hold its front line northwest of the city, as well as Ukrainian successes targeting Russian attack helicopters at nearby Kherson airport.

Now, Ukrainian officials are reporting potentially significant gains elsewhere in the south, pushing Russian forces back as much as around 31 miles (50 kilometers) in fighting near the city of Kryvyi Rih.

""The enemy is no longer just stopped in all directions - but has actually been pushed back from the distant approaches to the city,"" Oleksandr Vilkul, the top official in Kryvyi Rih, said late Monday.

""Today, several more settlements in the Kherson region have been liberated. The invaders are at a distance from Kryvyi Rih of at least 40 kilometers (25 miles), in some directions as much as 60 kilometers (37 miles).""

Previously, Ukrainian officials said Russian troops were within 10 kilometers (6 miles) of the city, which has a population of more than 500,000 and lies between Kherson and Dnipro.

""The contact line is no longer on the border with the Dnipropetrovsk region, and it is already in the Kherson region. Our military shows real bravery and inflicts serious damage on the enemy,"" Vikul said.

Most residents had remained in Kryvyi Rih since the start of the war, Vikul added. ""You can see for yourself that the city lives and works,"" he said on a video statement posted on Facebook.

In a reminder of the ongoing threat posed by Russian attacks, regardless of any changes in control of territory, the top official in the nearby city of Nikopol reported a missile strike close to his city.

Germany could ration power if a standoff over a Russian demand to pay for fuel with roubles disrupts or halts supplies.



Germany’s economy minister, Robert Habeck, on Wednesday implemented the “early warning phase” of an existing gas emergency plan, where a crisis team from the economics ministry, the regulator and the private sector will monitor imports and storage.

Habeck told reporters Germany’s gas supplies were guaranteed for now but urged consumers and companies to reduce consumption, saying that “every kilowatt hour counts”.

If supplies fall short, Germany’s network regulator can ration gas, with industry first in line for cuts and preferential treatment for private households, hospitals and other critical institutions.

Paying in Russia’s currency would undercut the effectiveness of western sanctions on the Kremlin for its invasion of Ukraine and Germany, which depends on Russia for much of its natural gas, is under pressure not to accede to the demand.

Moscow is expected to make public its plans for rouble payments on Thursday, Reuters says, although it said it would not immediately demand that buyers pay for gas exports in the currency.

As analysts waited for more clarity on the situation and whether Russia would cut off supplies, figures showed that March was the most expensive month for power prices in European history, analysts at Rystad Energy said on Thursday, breaking the record set in December for the big five European markets (Germany, France, Italy, UK, Spain).



Italy will end up with highest average prices, above €300 for the month of March.

UK, France and Spain are not far behind, all close to €300, and then a sizable gap down to Germany around €250 and the Nordics around €140.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/mar/30/russia-ukraine-war-latest-news-russian-troop-withdrawal-designed-to-mislead-says-ukrainian-military-live

Biden announces release of 1 million barrels of oil to control energy prices

The US president has ordered the release of one million barrels of oil per day from the nation’s strategic petroleum reserve for six months, in a bid to control energy prices that have spiked following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

“The bottom line is if we want lower gas prices we need to have more oil supply right now,” Biden said. “This is a moment of consequence and peril for the world, and pain at the pump for American families.”

He also invoked the Defense Production Act to encourage the mining of critical minerals for batteries in electric vehicles as part of a broader push to shift toward cleaner energy sources.

The US president warned the oil industry not “to sit on record profits” during the current price surge, adding that he wanted “to lay a new foundation for true and lasting American energy independence.”

A Russian victory in Ukraine will put other countries in peril: Polish official

Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Pawel Jablonski has told Al Jazeera that allowing Russia to make gains in Ukraine will encourage Moscow to adopt an aggressive stance towards Eastern European countries.

“Putin is not attacking other countries today because he doesn’t have adequate resources. He certainly would be willing to attack if he knew he would succeed,” Jablonski said in an interview at the Doha Forum.

The official added that in recent days members of the Russian parliament discussed the “de-Nazification” of six more countries, including Poland.

“If we allow Russia to win this war, they will regroup, they will resupply and they will be attacking more countries and starting more wars,” Jablonski said.

Russia’s Gazprombank is the intermediary for rouble gas payments, Putin order says

President Vladimir Putin’s decree says that foreign buyers of Russian gas will have to use special accounts at the country’s Gazprombank to pay for the import of the energy source, the Reuters news agency reports.

A foreign buyer is now obliged to transfer foreign currency to one special, so-called “K”, account, Reuters reported, citing the order. Gazprombank would then buy roubles on behalf of the gas buyer to transfer roubles to another special “K” account.

Gazprombank would then transfer the rouble funds of the foreign gas buyer to Gazprom’s rouble accounts. The bank can open such accounts without the presence of a foreign buyer’s representative, according to Reuters.

Kremlin decree indicates foreign currency can still be used to buy gas

A Kremlin decree, published by state media, says “unfriendly countries” can continue to pay for natural gas in foreign currency through a Russian bank that will convert the money into roubles.

It sets out that a designated bank will open two accounts for each buyer, one in foreign currency and one in roubles.

The buyers will be able to pay in foreign currency and authorise the bank to sell that currency for roubles, which are placed in the second account, where the gas is formally bought.

Putin says Russian gas must be paid for in roubles from Friday

Putin says he has signed a decree saying foreign buyers must pay in roubles for Russian gas from Friday, and contracts would be halted if these payments were not made.

“In order to purchase Russian natural gas, they must open rouble accounts in Russian banks. It is from these accounts that payments will be made for gas delivered starting from tomorrow,” the Russian leader said in televised remarks.

“If such payments are not made, we will consider this a default on the part of buyers, with all the ensuing consequences. Nobody sells us anything for free, and we are not going to do charity either – that is, existing contracts will be stopped.”

Russian forces ‘regrouping’ before new Donbas offensive, Ukraine says

Russia is “regrouping” its forces in Ukraine to intensify its offensive in the country’s eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, Ukraine’s General Staff of Armed Forces has said.

The eastern territories are already partly controlled by Russian-backed separatists who seized swaths of territory in the Donbas in early 2014.

“The main efforts of the enemy are focused on maintaining the occupied borders, preparing for the resumption of offensive operations in certain areas and establishing full control over the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions,” the department said on Facebook.

OPEC sticks to modest boost in oil despite war jitters

OPEC and allied oil producers, including Russia, have decided to stick to a modest increase in the amount of crude they pump to the world despite Western pressure to step up production as a result of the war in Ukraine.

The group, known as OPEC+, said it would add 432,000 barrels per day in May, as it works to gradually restore production cuts made during the depths of the coronavirus pandemic. That’s slightly up from 400,000 barrels in previous months.

The alliance has been unmoved by pleas from oil-consuming countries to pump more oil as energy prices soar, fueling inflation worldwide. High prices have helped Russia – the world’s largest exporter – offset some of the impacts of Western sanctions.

“At the same time, Russia maintains pressure on Kyiv and other cities. So we can expect additional offensive actions, bringing even more suffering,” he added.

UK unveils new sanctions on ‘shameless’ Putin ‘propagandists’

The United Kingdom has announced a new wave of sanctions against “Russian propagandists and state media”.

The measures are aimed at 14 individuals and entities – including TV presenter Sergey Brilev and Kremlin-funded TV-Novosti, which owns the Russia Today news channel – and follow several previous rounds of sanctions over Moscow’s incursion into Ukraine.

“Britain has helped lead the world in exposing Kremlin disinformation, and this latest batch of sanctions hits the shameless propagandists who push out Putin’s fake news and narratives,” Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said in a statement.

“We will keep on going with more sanctions to ramp up the pressure on Russia and ensure Putin loses in Ukraine. Nothing and no one is off the table.”

Putin likely ‘not fully informed’ on Ukraine, former UK ambassador says

Tony Brenton, the United Kingdom’s former ambassador to Russia, says it is “likely” that Putin has not been “fully informed” on the state of Russia’s offensive by his aides.

“Putin has been in withdrawal from the details of day-to-day government in Russia for the last two years, while he’s been worrying about COVID,” Brenton told Al Jazeera.

“So I think the likelihood is that he’s not been fully informed on the Russian military situation,” he added.

“And the subordinates around him – he has a rather limited number of people who have access to him – are almost certainly quite cautious about giving him the full details about how bad Russians are doing militarily, although he obviously knows enough that he has substantially altered Russia’s war aims.”

‘Hundreds’ of South Ossetians fighting in Ukraine: ex-separatist leader

The former leader of South Ossetia, a breakaway province in ex-Soviet Georgia, said “hundreds of fighters” have joined Russian forces in Ukraine, complaining they were treated as “cannon fodder”.

“I don’t doubt that the boys who already returned home could go back to the special operation zone and help complete the liberation of Donbas IF THEY FIND IT NECESSARY,” Eduard Kokoity wrote on Telegram on Wednesday.

South Ossetia broke away from Georgia in the 1990s. Its leaders said Georgia’s post-Soviet nationalist government violated the rights of Ossetians to use their language that is distantly related to Farsi.

Russia fought a brief war with Georgia in 2008 and recognised the “independence” of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. It now has large military bases there.

Ukraine says convoy of buses on its way to Mariupol

A convoy of Ukrainian buses has set out for the besieged, southeastern port city of Mariupol to try to deliver humanitarian supplies and bring out trapped civilians, the country’s deputy prime minister has said.

Iryna Vereshchuk said 45 buses were on their way to Mariupol after the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) confirmed Russia had agreed to open a safe corridor. Seventeen buses had already left for Mariupol from Zaporizhzhia, about 220km (136 miles) to the northwest, she added.

Another 28 were waiting for authorisation to pass the Russian checkpoint in Vasylivka, near Zaporizhzhia.

Mariupol’s mayor said this week that up to 170,000 residents were trapped there with no power and dwindling supplies. Previous attempts to organise safe corridors for civilians to evacuate from the city have failed.

UK intelligence chief says some Russian soldiers disobeying orders in Ukraine

The head of one of the UK’s intelligence agencies has said that some Russian soldiers in Ukraine have refused to carry out orders, adding Putin had “misjudged” the invasion.

Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) chief Jeremy Fleming said there was evidence that Moscow’s troops had low morale and were poorly equipped.

“We’ve seen Russian soldiers – short of weapons and morale – refusing to carry out orders, sabotaging their own equipment and even accidentally shooting down their own aircraft,” he said during a speech in the Australian capital Canberra.

“It’s clear he [Putin] misjudged the resistance of the Ukrainian people. He underestimated the strength of the coalition his actions would galvanize. He underplayed the economic consequences of the sanctions regime, and he overestimated the abilities of his military to secure a rapid victory,” Fleming added.

Although Putin’s advisers were believed to be too afraid to tell the truth, the “extent of these misjudgments must be crystal clear to the regime,” he said.

British intelligence director: Putin's 'Plan B' is more attacks on civilians The head of British intelligence agency GCHQ says it appears Russian President Vladimir Putin ""has massively misjudged the situation"" in Ukraine, but that his backup plan is more attacks on civilian areas. ""We’re now seeing Putin trying to follow through on his plan. But it is failing. And his Plan B has been more barbarity against civilians and cities,"" GCHQ Director Jeremy Fleming said Thursday. Fleming also said in a speech in Australia that ""it increasingly looks like Putin has massively misjudged the situation"" — both the impact of punishing sanctions and the ability of his military. ""We’ve seen Russian soldiers — short of weapons and morale — refusing to carry out orders, sabotaging their own equipment and even accidentally shooting down their own aircraft,"" Fleming said, according to a copy of the speech posted online by GCHQ.

Biden meets with parents of Trevor Reed, ex-Marine 'wrongfully detained' in Russia President Joe Biden met Wednesday with the parents of Trevor Reed, a former Marine who the White House said is being wrongfully detained in Russia on assault charges. In a statement, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden “reiterated his commitment” to continue pushing for the release of Reed and other Americans who she said are being wrongfully held in the country. “We are grateful for their partnership and feedback. We will continue to work to ensure we are communicating and sharing information in a way useful to these families,” Psaki said. Joey and Paula Reed, of Granbury, Texas, who said their son is innocent of the 2019 charges, publicly pushed the administration to help bring their son home. They met with the president Wednesday after they traveled to Washington this week and initially lobbied him from afar, NBC Dallas-Fort Worth reported. They stood on the route of Biden’s motorcade hoping it would stop — it didn’t — and they stood near the White House holding a sign bearing their son’s name. The couple eventually met with Biden and other officials in the Oval Office for more than a half-hour, the station reported. “He was very gracious,” Paula Reed told the station. “He gave us more time than we thought he would give us, but we said we would keep the conversation private.” Another former Marine, Paul Whalen, was also sentenced to 16 years in a Russian prison in 2020 after he was convicted of spying. His family has said he is innocent and that he was in the country for a wedding. Share this -







Biden said to be weighing plan to release 1 million barrels of oil for 6 months The Biden administration is weighing a plan to release about 1 million barrels of oil a day from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for about six months, totaling as many as 180 million barrels, a source familiar with the matter told NBC News. An announcement could come as soon as Thursday. President Joe Biden is expected to deliver remarks about the administration's ""actions to reduce the impact of Putin's price hike on energy prices and lower gas prices at the pump for American families."" Oil prices surged by 3 percent Wednesday, to $113 per barrel, as investors worried about new Western sanctions against Moscow and as Russian forces continued to bomb the outskirts of Ukraine's capital, Kyiv. Russia promised Tuesday to scale down operations around Kyiv in what the West dismissed as a ploy to regroup by invaders suffering heavy losses.

The chief of Ukrainian military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, said Sunday the change of focus could reflect Putin’s hope to break Ukraine in two, like North and South Korea. “He can’t swallow the entire country,” Budanov said, adding that Russia appears to be trying “to pull the occupied territories into a single quasi-state structure and pit it against independent Ukraine.”

3:30 a.m.: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country’s “sovereignty and territorial integrity” are a priority as Ukraine and Russia head into a new round of peace talks.

“We are looking for peace, really, without delay,” Zelenskyy said in a video address late Sunday. “There is an opportunity and a need for a face-to-face meeting in Turkey. This is not bad. Let’s see the outcome.”

Earlier Sunday, in call with Russian journalists, Zelenskyy said Ukraine was open to adopting neutral status as part of a peace deal, if it came with third-party guarantees and was put to a referendum.

1:40 a.m.: In its battleground intelligence report, the U.K. defense ministry said Monday that there has been “no significant change to Russian Forces dispositions in occupied Ukraine,” in the last 24 hours.

“Ongoing logistical shortages have been compounded by a continued lack of momentum and morale amongst the Russian military, and aggressive fighting by the Ukrainians,” the statement said, adding that “Russia has gained most ground in the south in the vicinity of Mariupol where heavy fighting continues as Russia attempts to capture the port.”

12: 20 a.m.: Actress and Ukraine native Mila Kunis made a plea to support Ukrainians during the Academy Awards telecast.

One cannot help but be in awe of those who find [the] strength to keep fighting through unimaginable darkness.”

Kunis and her husband Ashton Kutcher have raised more than $35 million to support humanitarian efforts in the region. They also participated in a video call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss the conflict.

During the show other presenters made reference to the war including co-host Amy Schumer who calledthe conflict a “genocide.”",https://www.voanews.com/a/latest-developments-in-ukraine-march-28-/6504303.html
