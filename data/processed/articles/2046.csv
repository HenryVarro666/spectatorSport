Investors criticised Deutsche's Russia presence

CEO's 2021 pay up 20%

FRANKFURT, March 11 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), which faced stinging criticism from some investors and politicians for its ongoing ties to Russia, said on Friday in a surprise move that it would wind down its business in the country.

Deutsche joins the ranks of Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N), which were the first major U.S. banks to exit after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Those moves put pressure on rivals to follow. read more .

But on Friday evening in Frankfurt, the bank suddenly reversed course.

""We are in the process of winding down our remaining business in Russia while we help our non-Russian multinational clients in reducing their operations,"" the bank said.

""There won't be any new business in Russia,"" Deutsche said.

A day earlier, Deutsche Bank's Chief Executive Christian Sewing explained to staff why the bank was not withdrawing.

""The answer is that this would go against our values,"" he wrote. ""We have clients who cannot exit Russia overnight.""

Bill Browder, an investor who has spent years campaigning to expose corruption in Russia, said that Deutsche Bank staying was ""completely at odds with the international business community and will create backlash, lost reputation and business in the West.""

""I would be surprised if they are able to maintain this position as the situation in Ukraine continues to deteriorate,"" Browder told Reuters earlier on Friday.

The criticism came as Russian forces bearing down on Kyiv were regrouping northwest of the Ukrainian capital and Britain said that Moscow could now be planning an assault on the city within days. read more

Fabio De Masi, a former member of the Bundestag and a prominent campaigner against financial crime, said that Deutsche Bank had close ties to the Russian elite, many of whom faced sanctions and that the relationship, where it involved criminal Russian activity, had to end.

'MONITORING'

Deutsche Bank has said that it has pared down its Russian footprint in recent years. This week it disclosed 2.9 billion euros in credit risk to the country, and said exposure is ""very limited"". read more

It also operates a technology centre with about 1,500 employees in Russia and opened a new main office in Moscow in December, which it said at the time represented ""a significant investment and commitment to the Russian market"".

Russia has landed Deutsche Bank in hot water in the past.

The U.S. Department of Justice has been investigating it for years over trades that authorities said were used to launder $10 billion out of Russia, which has led to the German bank being fined nearly $700 million.

Deutsche Bank said on Friday that the DOJ probe ""is understood to be ongoing"".

The row over Russia came as Deutsche Bank disclosed in its annual report that it paid Sewing 8.8 million euros ($9.68 million) in 2021, a 20% increase from a year earlier.

Overall, the lender paid 14% more, or 2.1 billion euros, in bonuses for 2021, rewarding staff for the bank's most profitable year in a decade.

European banks operating in Russia are preparing to separate those business from their main computer systems to reduce their vulnerability to cyber attacks following the invasion of Ukraine.

Commerzbank AG is preparing to cut off its Russian unit from its system and already has the ability to rapidly sever the connection through what’s internally known as “kill switch,” people familiar with the matter said. Deutsche Bank is transferring essential information technology tasks from the country to other locations, another person said. BNP Paribas already cut off staff in Russia from its systems, Reuters reported.

Officials for the banks declined to comment. The people familiar asked for anonymity to discuss internal matters.

Cyber warfare has become a major concern in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, particularly at banks, which rely on massive IT infrastructure to conduct business. Deutsche Bank has seen “increased cyber attacks” since the start of the war, it said it in its annual report published Friday. Societe Generale SA is asking staff for extra vigilance in online communications, according to a memo seen by Bloomberg News.

While the two German banks plan to exit Russia, that process will take time, leaving them exposed for now. Deutsche Bank has a big tech center in Russia with about 1,600 staff.

Chief Financial Officer James von Moltke told Bloomberg TV on Thursday that the lender is “proactive” on cyber risks emerging in the country. It took steps in the years before the invasion to reduce cyber risks at the unit, including by getting rid of external staff, von Moltke said in the interview.

Apart from seeking to insulate the Russian units, many lenders have increased the general internal alert level for IT threats and asked staff to be vigilant. They’ve also set up teams to work on contingency plans and stress-tested their IT infrastructures.

Ukraine accounted for 0.05% of Hong Kong’s goods exports last year, while Russia made up 0.78%, Chan said. Sharp increases in global energy prices will have a “relatively mild” effect on Hong Kong inflation because the city’s economy is dominated by the services industry and is not highly dependent on energy, according to Chan.

According to a report published on Saturday night, there are Russian offensives on the northern city limits near Sasymja and to the south near Wyschenky. Some of these offensives have been successful.

Attacks are also reported from other regions of the country. According to Ukrainian sources, the Russian air force shelled the cities of Dnipro, Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk. Corresponding information is also available from the British Ministry of Defence. Accordingly, combat aircraft used so-called unguided ammunition in Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk. The two cities are close to the metropolis of Lviv in the westernmost part of Ukraine, not far from the Polish border.

Mykolayiv clinics attacked

The Russian army also attacked several hospitals in Mykolaiv in southern Ukraine. As a reporter from the AFP news agency reported, the port city was shelled almost continuously on Saturday night. Among other things, a day clinic for cancer patients and an eye clinic were hit. Most of the residents of Mykolaiv, which is around 100 kilometers from Odessa, can no longer heat their homes, and many are trying to leave the city.

However, the “humanitarian corridors” repeatedly announced by the Russian side do not materialize in some regions because safe conduct is not possible. Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine Iryna Vereshchuk explained that the shelling of Mariupol by Russian troops on Friday again prevented residents of the port city from being evacuated to safety.

The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry announced that a mosque was also hit there, in which more than 80 children and adults – including those from Turkey – had sought refuge. Information on possible victims is not yet available. According to Ukrainian information, more than 1,500 civilians have been killed in the strategically important metropolis on the Azov Sea since the fighting broke out.

Appeal to soldiers’ mothers

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed an appeal to the mothers of Russian soldiers. “Don’t send your children to war in a foreign country,” Zelenskyj said in his recent Internet video. His message is aimed primarily at the mothers of conscripts.

“Check where your son is. And if you have even the slightest suspicion that your son could be sent to war against Ukraine, act immediately” to prevent him from being killed or captured, he said the Ukrainian President. “Ukraine never wanted this terrible war,” he added. But his country will defend itself against the Russian attack.

Zelenskyi also demanded the release of the mayor of the city of Melitopol, which was occupied by Russian troops. Pressure on mayors or their “physical elimination” will not help Russia take over Ukrainian cities. Such an approach is a “sign of weakness”. Kyiv said on Friday that the mayor of the southeastern Ukrainian city, Ivan Fedorov, had been kidnapped. This could not be verified either. A video fragment showed hooded people taking a man away from a central building.

sanctions expanded

Meanwhile, the US is increasing the pressure on those close to the Russian President. The government in Washington decided on further sanctions against Russian oligarchs and members of Vladimir Putin’s inner circle. They included 10 members of the board of directors of VTB-Bank, 12 members of the Duma and members of the family of Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, the US Treasury Department said.

“The Treasury Department will continue to hold Russian officials accountable for supporting Putin’s unjustified and gratuitous war,” Yellen said. Their assets in the US would be frozen and they would be banned from doing business with US citizens and organizations.

Meanwhile, Italian authorities arrested another mega yacht attributed to a Russian billionaire. The “Sailing Yacht A” is moored in the port of Trieste. She is considered the largest sailing yacht in the world. The ship, built by the German shipyard Nobiskrug, is valued at around 530 million euros. According to media reports, it belongs to the Russian coal billionaire Andrei Melnichenko, who was put on an EU sanctions list after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Italian financial police arrested a suspected Russian oligarch yacht last week.

Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank are moving

After severe criticism, Deutsche Bank is now phasing out its business in Russia because of the Ukraine war. Deutsche Bank has substantially reduced its involvement and presence in Russia since 2014, the bank said. “Like some of our international competitors, we are in the process of ramping down our remaining business in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements.” At the same time, the financial institution is helping its existing non-Russian international clients to scale back their business operations in the country. “We are no longer doing new business in Russia,” the bank added.

Shortly thereafter, Commerzbank also announced that it would stop its new business in Russia. “We have stopped new business in Russia, we are only processing existing transactions,” said a spokeswoman.

Against the background of the Ukraine war, Deutsche Bank had come under criticism. The American investor Bill Browder, who has been working to uncover corruption in Russia for years, told the Reuters news agency that Deutsche Bank’s remaining in Russia is at odds with the international business community and will lead to backlash, a loss of reputation and business strains in the West.

Deutsche Bank recently described its involvement in Russia as very limited. In an earlier statement, the lender put its gross credit exposure in Russia at €1.4 billion. The bank also operates a technology center in Russia, which employs 1,500 computer specialists.

Berlin plans airlift to Moldova

According to Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, Germany is working with international partners on an airlift for Ukrainian refugees from Moldova. Such an airlift is “absolutely sensible,” said the Green politician after a meeting with her Moldovan counterpart Nicu Popescu in Chisinau. At the same time, she announced that the federal government would bring 2,500 Ukraine refugees from Moldova directly to Germany as a first step.

At the moment, Chancellor Olaf Scholz is making a new attempt at mediation together with French President Emmanuel Macron: According to the Élysée Palace, a telephone exchange between the two and Russian President Vladimir Putin has begun.
