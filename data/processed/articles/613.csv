The Kremlin on Wednesday pushed back on Biden's characterization of Putin as a ""war criminal.""

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Biden's rhetoric is ""unacceptable and unforgivable.""

Biden's comments marks his harshest condemnation yet of the Russian leader.

President Joe Biden on Wednesday called Russian President Vladimir Putin ""a war criminal,"" prompting a heated response from the Russian government.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called Biden's comments ""unacceptable and unforgivable rhetoric on the part of the head of a state whose bombs have killed hundreds of thousands of people around the world,"" according to Russian state news agency TASS.

Last week, Biden said it was ""too early to say"" whether Putin had committed war crimes, but he told reporters at a press conference on Wednesday afternoon that Putin is ""a war criminal.""

The statement marks Biden's harshest condemnation of Putin since Russia invaded Ukraine three weeks ago. The Biden administration had previously not characterized Russia's invasion of Ukraine as a war crime due to ongoing investigations.

The Russian military has killed hundreds of Ukrainian civilians and attacked hospitals, schools, and residential buildings, among other civilian targets, prompting human rights groups and world leaders to accuse Putin's regime of committing war crimes. A war crime is a violation of the laws of war as defined by international law and treaties.

Biden doubled down on his criticism of Putin on Thursday, calling the Russian leader's actions ""inhumane."" The White House has imposed a slew of sanctions against Russia to weaken its economy and Putin's position. The US has also delivered arms to Ukraine, and plans to send more military and humanitarian aid to the country through a recently passed $13.6 billion package.

Biden's comments also came after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave an emotional address to Congress on Wednesday morning during which he requested more help in the country's fight against Russia.

2,0bacce22-c24d-4b06-823e-a9a2ecc88412,[],,"Russia's Defense Ministry warned on April 15 that it will intensify attacks on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, after accusing Ukraine of targeting Russian border towns.

The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making “the most important decision of their life -- to fight.”

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.”

Zelenskiy noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.”

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

4,0bacce22-c24d-4b06-823e-a9a2ecc88412,['David E. Sanger'],2022-03-17,"But it comes at a moment when Washington’s biggest concern is that Mr. Putin will escalate the war — and reach for weapons of mass destruction.

Just hours before Mr. Biden’s declaration, his national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told Nikolai P. Patrushev, Mr. Putin’s main national security adviser, that “any possible Russian decision to use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine” would result in an even harsher Western response. Several of Mr. Biden’s aides have been concerned that if the Russian leader feels cornered or believes the United States is trying to foment opposition, the chances that he will reach for such weapons could be heightened.

So the debate underway in Washington now is what, exactly, might trigger Mr. Putin. Some believe he could lash out if dissent in Russia, already visible in street demonstrations, poses a real threat. Others believe that his trigger point might be a more direct entry into the war by NATO countries. They are already providing antitank and antiaircraft weapons that have contributed to what the Pentagon now estimates is a Russian death toll of at least 7,000 troops.

One former intelligence official noted that it was Hillary Clinton’s support for anti-Putin street demonstrations in Russia that prompted him to order the hacking of the Democratic National Committee when Mrs. Clinton was running for president in 2016. Mr. Putin is a believer, the official said, in retribution.

Mr. Putin would have good reason to think the Biden administration is looking forward to his exit, though American officials choose their words carefully to avoid the implication that Washington’s policy is to speed the process. Mr. Blinken, speaking to reporters on Thursday, said that “when all is said and done, an independent Ukraine will be there, and at some point Vladimir Putin will not.”

The last time an American president went head-to-head with a Russian or Soviet leader with so much at stake was 60 years ago, during the Cuban missile crisis, widely regarded as the closest the world came to Armageddon. And yet at that moment, in October 1962, President John F. Kennedy’s instinct was to avoid personalizing the conflict — and to help his Soviet counterpart, Nikita S. Khrushchev, find a way out of direct confrontation.

“I think it is the most natural comparison to this moment,” said Fredrik Logevall, a Harvard historian and Kennedy biographer.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/17/us/politics/biden-putin-war-criminal.html

This marked a change in Washington’s rhetoric which condemned the atrocities committed by Russia in Ukraine but stopped short of labelling them “war crimes”, citing ongoing investigations by international organizations.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said in a briefing: “I think he is a war criminal,” adding that Biden was “speaking from the heart.”

“[Biden] was answering a direct question that was asked and responding to what he has seen on television.

Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Biden’s description of Putin was “unacceptable and unforgivable rhetoric”.

“We believe such rhetoric to be unacceptable and unforgivable on the part of the head of a state, whose bombs have killed hundreds of thousands of people around the world,” Russian state news agency TASS cited Peskov as saying.

Biden’s statement regarding Putin came after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy delivered an impassioned video address to US Congress, asking for more support for his country which is struggling to hold off the Russian onslaught.

The US President announced an additional $800 million in security assistance to Ukraine, including anti-aircraft systems and drones.

""I think he is a war criminal,"" Biden said.

Biden initially said ""no"" when asked whether Putin was a war criminal, but returned to a group of reporters immediately to clarify what had been asked. When asked again whether Putin was a war criminal, he answered in the affirmative, reported Sputnik.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Wednesday that US President Joe Biden's remarks on Russian President speak for themselves.

""The President's remarks speak for themselves,"" Psaki said. ""He was speaking from his heart and speaking from what he's seen on television which is barbaric actions by a brutal dictator through his invasion of a foreign country. There is a legal process that continues to be underway at the State Department.""

Biden's designation reflects a shift from the administration's previous stance. Officials, including Biden, had previously stopped short of saying war crimes were being committed in Ukraine, citing ongoing investigations into whether that term could be used, reported CNN.

But officials have been clear they believe atrocities are underway and that the intentional targeting of civilians would constitute war crimes.

KYIV/LVIV, Ukraine, March 16 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday called Russian leader Vladimir Putin a war criminal in comments the Kremlin said were ""unforgivable"" as it insisted the war in Ukraine was ""going to plan"" amid talk of compromise at peace talks.

Kremlin forces kept up their bombardments of besieged cities, including intensified shelling of the capital Kyiv, and civilians waiting in line for bread and sheltering in a theatre were killed, according to U.S. and Ukrainian officials

Moscow has yet to capture any of Ukraine's biggest cities following its invasion that began on Feb. 24, the largest assault on a European state since World War Two, raising fears of wider conflict in the West.

Putin on Wednesday said he would discuss neutral status for Ukraine and that what he calls a ""special military operation"" to demilitarize the country was ""going to plan"". Kyiv and allies say his actions are an unprovoked incursion, and more than 3 million Ukrainians have fled and hundreds have died.

The United States announced an additional $800 million in security assistance to Ukraine to fight Russia, with the new package including drones, anti-armour and anti-aircraft systems.

""More will be coming as we source additional stocks of equipment that ... we are ready to transfer,"" Biden said, later condemning Putin.

""He is a war criminal,"" he told reporters.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the comment was ""unacceptable and unforgivable rhetoric"", according to Tass news agency.

Ukraine still hopes for a diplomatic solution. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said negotiations were becoming ""more realistic"" and Russia said proposals under discussion were ""close to an agreement.""

The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv said Russian forces had shot dead 10 people waiting in line for bread in Chernihiv, northeast of Kyiv. Russia denied the attack and said the incident was a hoax.

Emergency services said rescue workers had found the bodies of five people during searches of shell-hit buildings.

In the besieged southern port of Mariupol, the city council said Russian forces bombed a theatre where civilians were sheltering. The number of casualties was not known.

Russia denied it had carried out an air strike against the theatre. Reuters could not independently verify the information.

Maxar Technologies, a private U.S. company, distributed satellite imagery that it said was collected on March 14 and showed the word ""children"" in large Russian script painted on the ground outside the red-roofed Mariupol Drama Theatre.

The governor of Zaporizhzhia region said Russian forces had fired artillery at a convoy of evacuees from Mariupol, wounding five people on Wednesday.

Three people were killed and five wounded after shelling caused a fire at a market in eastern Kharkiv, Ukraine's second city, emergency services said.

Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said 400 staff and patients were being held hostage at a Mariupol hospital that Russian forces captured on Tuesday.

Moscow denies targeting civilians.

Kyiv's Mayor Vitali Klitschko said Russian shelling caused a fire and damaged private homes and a gas line in the evening after early morning barrages.

Russian troops have halted at the gates of the capital after taking heavy losses.

Ukraine handed over nine captured soldiers to secure the freedom of the mayor of the city of Melitopol, who was detained last week, the Interfax Ukraine news agency quoted a senior official as saying on Wednesday.

And as an information battle goes on alongside fighting, Facebook on Wednesday removed official Russian posts that falsely claimed reports of Russia bombing a children's hospital in Ukraine were a hoax.

Russia has shifted its stance over the bombing that caused outrage around the world with a mix of statements that veered between aggressive denials and a call to establish clear facts.

'DARKEST TIME'

In a speech to the U.S. Congress by video link, Zelenskiy repeated a request for a no-fly zone over Ukraine, something the West won't introduce.

""In the darkest time for our country, for the whole of Europe, I call on you to do more,"" he said.

NATO defence ministers meeting in Brussels pledged more arms supplies to help Ukraine.

The U.N. Security Council is due to vote on Friday on a Russian-drafted call for aid access and civilian protection, but diplomats say the measure is set to fail because it does not push for an end to the fighting or withdrawal of troops.

Delegations from the two sides were meeting via video conference, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday as efforts continued for a diplomatic solution.

The Kremlin said negotiators were discussing a status for Ukraine similar to that of Austria or Sweden, both members of the European Union that are outside the NATO military alliance.

Ukraine's chief negotiator said Kyiv was still demanding a ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian troops, with guarantees.

Zelenskiy has said Ukraine could accept international security guarantees that stopped short of its longstanding aim to join NATO. That prospect has been one of Russia's primary concerns.

""Neutral status is now being seriously discussed along, of course, with security guarantees,"" Lavrov said. ""There are absolutely specific formulations which in my view are close to agreement.""

Vladimir Medinsky, Russia's chief negotiator, told state TV: ""Ukraine is offering an Austrian or Swedish version of a neutral demilitarised state, but at the same time a state with its own army and navy.""

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the idea ""could really be seen as a compromise"".

Austria and Sweden, the biggest of six EU members outside NATO, both have small militaries that cooperate with the alliance.

DAMAGE TO RUSSIA'S ECONOMY

Ukrainian forces have withstood an assault by a much larger army but the humanitarian toll is rising.

Ukraine said about 20,000 people had escaped besieged Mariupol in cars, but hundreds of thousands remain trapped.

The economic fallout is also being felt around the world.

The Biden administration has authorized additional exports of liquefied natural gas from Texas-based Cheniere Energy in a move that could help Europe deal with a worsening crunch.

Meanwhile, Russia was due to pay $117 million in interest on dollar-denominated sovereign bonds but may pay in roubles instead, amounting to its first default on foreign debt since the Bolshevik revolution.

Moscow said it had the money, and Washington would be to blame if it cannot pay.

In his most explicit acknowledgment of the pain inflicted by Western sanctions, Putin said inflation and unemployment would rise, and structural changes to the economy would be needed.

It was the first time Biden has publicly branded Putin with that phrase.

Biden's comment came hours Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other top officials met virtually with the International Criminal Court's top prosecutor, who two weeks ago opened an investigation into possible war crimes by Russia.

And it came after Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., earlier Wednesday said Biden ""absolutely"" should call Putin a war criminal.

Kelly cited Russia's attacks on ""hospitals, maternity wards, apartment buildings"" in Ukraine and its military's ""direct fire on civilians.""

In an exchange with a reporter in a loud, crowded room in the White House following an event, Biden was asked, ""Mr. President, after everything we've seen, are you ready to call Putin a war criminal.""

Biden initially replied, ""No,"" as he walked by the journalist.

The reporter then asked if Biden will ""go to Poland,"" where many Ukraine refugees have fled the Russian invasion.

Biden then returned to the journalist asking, ""Did you ask me whether I should call?""

""Oh, I think he is a war criminal,"" Biden said.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki later said Biden was speaking from his heart about what he has seen on the news about the ""barbaric actions by a brutal dictator.""

Psaki noted that there is a separate legal process to determine whether Putin has violated international law and committed war crimes. That process currently is underway at the State Department, she said.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, in response to Biden, said, ""We consider unacceptable and unforgivable such rhetoric of the head of the state, whose bombs killed hundreds of thousands of people around the world,"" according to the Russian news agency Tass.
