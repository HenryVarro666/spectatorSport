Putin flags nuke alert after Ukraine dimissed peace talks offer in Belarus

On Sunday, Ukraine was forced to accept an offer of peace talks with Russian representatives in Belarus. The talks, which were initially called on by Ukraine, were first rejected by Russia, however, later Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Moscow will send a delegation to Minsk in order to move ahead with the said discussions. However, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky refused the proposition, saying that Belarus is allegedly ""complicit"" in abetting Putin's actions against Ukraine.

Meanwhile, in separate reports, Russian state-owned media informed that Putin has ordered nuclear deterrent forces on ""high alert"" against what he termed as ""aggressive statements"" by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) powers. Putin also warned Kyiv against wasting ""an opportunity"" offered for negotiations in the wake of a full-scale attack on its ex-Soviet neighbour.

Meanwhile, recent information via a Facebook post by Ukrainian Defence Staff revealed that fierce resistance from Ukraine has forced Russian occupiers to reduce the pace of their offensive, ""but are still trying to develop success in some areas."" During the escalating assault, the enemy also continued to ""inflict fire on military and civilian airfields, military command points"" and more. Speaking at the UN Security Council (UNSC) on Sunday, Ukraine's permanent representative Sergiy Kyslytsya noted that at least 352 people, including children and civilians, have been killed in the embattled nation with over 1,000 more injured, while Russian troops continued to crawl closer to Kyiv.
