Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has officially signed an application for Ukraine's membership in the European Union, according to a post from his verified Facebook page.

""[Zelenskyy] has just signed a historical document — Ukraine's application for European Union membership,"" tweeted Andrii Sybiha, the deputy head of the president's office. Ukraine's prime minister and head of parliament also signed a joint statement, he added.

The move comes hours after Zelenskyy released a video appealing to the EU for membership and calling on Russian forces to go home. He urged the EU to allow Ukraine's immediate entry under what he described as a ""new special procedure,"" on which he did not elaborate.

""Our goal is to be with all Europeans and, most importantly, to be equal,"" he said, according to a translation from The Guardian. ""I am confident that it is fair. I am confident we have deserved it. I am confident that all this is possible.""

Ukraine is not currently recognized as an official candidate for EU membership, though it's been part of an association agreement with the EU (in which both parties agreed to align their economies in certain areas and deepen political ties) since 2017, as Politico notes.

Zelenskyy discussed membership with European leaders

Zelenskyy's plea echoes remarks he made over the weekend when he pushed publicly for Ukraine's accession into the EU and discussed the subject with European leaders.

Zelenskyy tweeted on Saturday that he had spoken with European Council President Charles Michel, writing: ""It is a crucial moment to close the long-standing discussion once and for all and decide on Ukraine's membership in the #EU.""

Michel responded in a tweet of his own: ""#Ukraine and its people are family. Further concrete support is on its way.""

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told Euronews on Sunday that Ukraine is ""one of us and we want them in"" the European Union.

But she suggested its entry wouldn't be immediate, saying the process would involve integrating Ukraine's market into that of the EU and noting that the two cooperate closely in areas such as energy.

Indeed, the EU's own website stresses that ""becoming a member of the EU is a complex procedure which does not happen overnight.""

The process involves time-consuming negotiations

A country can only apply once it satisfies certain conditions, including having a free-market economy and stable democracy and accepting all EU legislation as well as the euro. Then it submits its application to the European Council, which asks the European Commission to assess the country's ability to meet those criteria.

If the commission's assessment is favorable, the European Council must unanimously agree on a formal framework for negotiations, which then take place between ministers and ambassadors of EU governments and the candidate country.

""Due to the huge volume of EU rules and regulations each candidate country must adopt as national law, the negotiations take time to complete,"" the EU explains.

Five countries are currently in the process of integrating EU legislation into national law: Albania, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia and Turkey. Two others — Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina — are classified as ""potential candidates"" because they do not yet meet the criteria to apply for membership.",https://www.npr.org/2022/02/28/1083528087/ukraine-european-union

His remarks follow an appeal this morning by his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, for Ukraine’s potential membership of the bloc to now be “decided once and for all”.

“Poland supports an express path for Ukraine’s membership of the EU,” tweeted Duda this afternoon. “Candidate status should be granted immediately and accession negotiations initiated at once after that. Ukraine should also have access to EU funds for reconstruction.”

Polska opowiada się za ekspresową ścieżką członkostwa Ukrainy w Unii Europejskiej. Status kandydata powinien być udzielony natychmiast, a rozmowy o członkowstwie rozpoczęte niezwłocznie po tym. Ukraina ma mieć też dostęp do środków z UE na odbudowę. To się Ukrainie należy.

🇵🇱🇺🇦🇪🇺 — Andrzej Duda (@AndrzejDuda) February 26, 2022

Ukraine currently has an association agreement with the EU, signed in 2014. But it is not among the five countries – Turkey, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Albania and Serbia – that are official candidates to join the bloc, and which have all begun accession negotiations.

Public support in Ukraine for EU membership has grown rapidly since Russia’s previous aggression in 2014, according to polls, and stood at around 60% before the current crisis.

In 2019, Zelensky’s predecessor, Petro Poroshenko, signed an amendment to the constitution that committed Ukraine to becoming a member of the EU and NATO. Zelensky has subsequently supported that goal and, in a tweet this morning, said it was now a “crucial moment” to “decide on Ukraine’s EU membership once and for all”.

It is a crucial moment to close the long-standing discussion once and for all and decide on Ukraine's membership in the #EU. Discussed with @eucopresident further effective assistance and the heroic struggle of Ukrainians for their free future. — Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa) February 26, 2022

Previously, in the early hours of this morning, Zelensky had announced that he had spoken with Duda, whom he described as “a real friend of Ukraine”. He also thanked the Polish people “for their effective concrete help in such a difficult time”.

Poland has so far received over 100,000 people leaving Ukraine since Russia’s invasion. The Polish authorities have committed to supporting those and future refugees, and have also sent military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine.

Over 100,000 people have entered Poland from Ukraine since Thursday.

Poland has long been a supporter of expanding the EU eastwards. On visits to Tbilisi and Chișinău last year, Duda expressed support for Georgia and Moldova’s hopes of joining the bloc. He has also backed Turkey’s bid for EU membership.

This week, a group of leading public figures – including former NATO secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen, former Polish president Aleksander Kwaśniewski, and former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt – wrote that “the time has come to offer Ukraine an EU membership perspective”.

I just talked with a real friend of Ukraine – President of Poland @AndrzejDuda. I am personally grateful to him, to the Polish people, for their effective concrete help in such a difficult time. Together 🇺🇦 🇵🇱 stronger. Thank you — Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa) February 26, 2022

What is the European Union?

The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union, consisting of 27 member states that are subject to the obligations and the privileges of the membership.

Every member state is part of the founding treaties of the union and is subjected to binding laws within the common legislative and judicial institutions. In order for the EU to adopt policies that concern defence and foreign affairs, all member states must agree unanimously.

Brief History of the European Union

The European Union’s aim back in the days was to end the frequent bloody wars between neighbour states that culminated in the Second World War.

In 1950, the European Coal and Steel Community began the uniting of European countries economically and politically to gain lasting peace. In 1957, the Treaty of Rome created the European Economic Community (EEC) or the ‘Common Market’.

This brought a good period for the economy, as the EU countries stopped charging customs duties when trading with each other.

In 1973, Denmark, Ireland, and the United Kingdom formally decided to join the European Union, becoming nine member states altogether.

Later, in 1986 the Single European Act was signed, which also created the ‘Single Market’.

In 1993, the ‘Single Market’ was completed with the four freedoms:

Movement of goods

Movement of services

Movement of people

Movement of money

The 1990s were also a decade of treaties: the ‘Maastricht’ Treaty on the European Union in 1993 and the treaty of Amsterdam in 1999.

In 1995, the EU further enlarged with three more members joining: Austria, Finland, and Sweden.

During the 1990s, a small village in Luxembourg gave its name to the ‘Schengen’ agreements that would gradually allow people to travel without having their passports checked at the borders within the area.

In the 2000s, the euro became the new currency for many Europeans, and during the following decade, more countries adopted the euro (€).

The political divisions, during the 2000s, between the east and west Europe finally healed and 10 more new countries joined the EU in 2004, followed by Bulgaria and Romania which joined in 2007.

In 2008, a financial crisis hits the global economy. Therefore, the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force in 2009, providing the EU with modern institutions and more efficient working methods.

In 2013, Croatia became the 28th member to enter the EU.

In June 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum, letting the people decide whether they want to leave or remain in the European Union, after a few years of political debate on the topic. 33,577,342 people participated in the referendum, a turnout of 72.2%. The referendum resulted in 52% opting to leave while 48% remaining.

On January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom officially left the European Union, starting the 11-month transition period.

Presently the increase of religious extremism in the Middle East, as well as in various other countries and regions around the world, has led to wars and turmoil, which has pushed many people to flee their home countries and seek refuge in Europe. The EU has recently found itself as the target of several terrorist attacks while facing the dilemma of how to take care of the refugees.

EU countries are those European countries that are a part of the European Union and have signed the treaties of the European Union. EU countries have to maintain their own national military and foreign policies but are bound to the judicial and legislative institutions of the EU.

Schengen countries are those European countries that have signed the Schengen Agreement. These countries operate as a single state with no border controls required when travelling within the countries but have the same international border control rules.

What is The European Economic Area (EEA)?

The EEA includes all EU countries and also Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.

What is EFTA?

EFTA stands for the European Free Trade Association. It is a regional trade organization and free trade area consisting of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. None of these countries are part of the European Union, but aside from Switzerland, others are all part of the European Economic Area.

Its free trade agreements foresee the elimination of import duties on industrial goods and fish.

Ukraine

The Association Agreement, including a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) between the EU and Ukraine, was negotiated between 2007 and 2011 and signed on 21 March and 27 June 2014.

The DCFTA has been provisionally applied since 1 January 2016 and the Association Agreement formally entered into force on 1 September 2017 following ratification by all EU Member States.

The Association Agreement is the main tool for bringing Ukraine and the EU closer together: it promotes deeper political ties, stronger economic links and the respect for common values.

The EU granted Autonomous Trade Measures (ATMs) for Ukraine, topping up the concessions included in the Association Agreement/DCFTA for several industrial goods and agricultural products from October 2017 for a period of three years.

EU and Ukraine

The AA/DCFTA aims to boost trade in goods and services between the EU and Ukraine by gradually cutting tariffs and bringing Ukraine's rules in line with the EU's in certain industrial sectors and agricultural products.

Export ban on unprocessed wood The EU-Ukraine Association Agreement prohibits any form of export restrictions. The EU considers therefore that keeping in place since 2005 a permanent ban on exports of sawn wood violates the terms of the agreement. More information

The AA/DCFTA aims to boost trade in goods and services between the EU and Ukraine by gradually cutting tariffs and bringing Ukraine's rules in line with the EU's in certain industrial sectors and agricultural products.

To better integrate with the EU market, Ukraine is harmonising many of its norms and standards in industrial and agricultural products. Ukraine is also aligning its legislation to the EU's in trade-related areas such as:

Competition

Technical barriers to trade (TBT)

Sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS)

Customs and trade facilitation

Protection of intellectual property rights

The EU has banned the import of goods originating in Crimea and Sevastopol, as well as investments and a number of directly related services there until at least 23 June 2020. This is in line with its policy of not recognising the Russian Federation's illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol.

Committees and Dialogues

The EU and Ukraine meet regularly to discuss issues and best practices when applying the agreement. The committees meet regularly.

Any country that satisfies the conditions for membership can apply. These conditions are known as the ‘Copenhagen criteria’ and include a functioning market economy, a stable democracy and the rule of law, and the acceptance of all EU legislation, including of the euro.

A country wishing to join the EU submits a membership application to the Council, which asks the Commission to assess the applicant’s ability to meet the Copenhagen criteria. If the Commission’s opinion is positive, the Council must then agree upon a negotiating mandate. Negotiations are then formally opened on a subject-by-subject basis.

Due to the huge volume of EU rules and regulations each candidate country must adopt as national law, the negotiations take time to complete. The candidates are supported financially, administratively and technically during this pre-accession period.

Kramer']",2022-02-25 00:00:00,"KYIV, Ukraine — The Ukrainian defense forces, outmanned and outgunned, waged a ferocious resistance to the Russian invasion on Saturday, battling to keep control of the capital, Kyiv, and other cities around the country.

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine posted a video on Twitter, telling the public not to believe false reports.

He was alive. Kyiv had not fallen. Any reports of Ukraine laying down its arms was a lie, Mr. Zelensky said.

“I’m here,” he said. “We are not putting down any arms. We will protect our country, because our weapons are our truth. The truth is that this is our land, our country, our children, and we will protect them all.”

“That is it. That’s what I wanted to tell you. Glory to Ukraine.”

His comments, released before 9 a.m., came as fighting intensified in Kyiv. What until three days ago had been a thriving European metropolis has been transformed into a battle zone. Russian troops pressed in from all directions.

There was intense street fighting, and bursts of gunfire and explosions could be heard across the city, including its heart, Maidan square, where in 2014 Ukrainian protests led to the toppling of a pro-Moscow government.

The Russian military has a decisive edge in cyberwarfare, tanks, heavy weaponry, missiles, fighter planes and warships. In sheer numbers, its military dwarfs that of Ukraine.

Russia has established attack lines into three cities — Kyiv in the north, Kharkiv in the northeast and Kherson in the south — and Ukrainian troops are fighting to hold all three. The Pentagon reported late Friday that the Russians did not appear to be in control of a single major population center. Significantly, a senior U.S. defense official said, Ukrainian command and control remains intact.

The Ukrainian government reported that hundreds of Russian soldiers had been killed in the war, along with scores of their own soldiers, while the Russian defense ministry issued a statement on Saturday morning that made no mention of any casualties or anything about the fight for Kyiv.

The Russian invasion started with targeted airstrikes before dawn on Thursday, but on the third day of the war, bloody battles were often being waged in close quarters. Ukrainska Pravda, a Ukrainian news site, citing witnesses, reported combat 400 yards from Maidan Square in central Kyiv.

All Ukrainian men of fighting are being drafted into service, and tens of thousands are signing up. Ukrainians were asked to make Molotov cocktails. And there were tearful scenes at airports in western Ukraine as wives kissed their husbands goodbye before they headed to front.

The nation has rallied around its president, Mr. Zelensky, a former comedian.

To him and other officials, the objective of the Russian invasion of a neighboring country that possessed no military threat is to topple the government.

Mr. Zelensky has said that he is “target no. 1.”

As battles were waged around the city on Saturday morning, there were reports of clashes near the city’s train station and along a central thoroughfare, Bohdan Khmelnitsky Street, leading from Victory Square toward the city center, according to the witness accounts. Along that street, closer to the city center, bursts of gunfire could be heard through the night.

“We are stopping the horde, so far as we can,” the secretary of the Ukrainian Security and Defense Council, Oleksy Danilov, said around 7 a.m. “The situation is under control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and citizens of Kyiv.”

In dozens of interviews in the tense hours before the invasion and in the days after, Ukrainians struggled to understand how a country at peace so suddenly found itself at war. For many Ukrainians, the answer was found in Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin.

This is Mr. Putin’s war. But what frightened people perhaps as much as the threat of missiles and bombs was that they did not know what he wanted.

The fear was evident in the drive from Kyiv to a small village outside the city. Military convoys had replaced families going on vacation or visiting friends. Where once Kyiv was known as a city where the music played a touch too loud in its cafes, the incessant wail of air raid sirens drowned out all joy.

The fear was evident in the faces of the people seeking safety in Western Ukraine, after they emerged from 20-hour train rides in packed carriages that were kept pitch-black to avoid being targeting by Russian rockets.

From Lviv in the west to Odessa in the south and Kharkiv and nearly all points in between, people huddled in air raid shelters and lined up and bank machines and stocked up on essentials.

While the Russians, for the moment, were not in control of any city, it was only the first phase of a conflict that could stretch into weeks or longer.",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/02/25/world/russia-ukraine-war
