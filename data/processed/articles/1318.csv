Russia signaled a possible recalibration of its war aims in Ukraine on Friday as the Kremlin faced spreading global ostracism for the brutal invasion, hardened Western economic punishments and a determined Ukrainian resistance that appeared to be making some gains on the ground.

A statement by Russia’s Defense Ministry said the goals of the “first stage of the operation” had been “mainly accomplished,” with Ukraine’s combat capabilities “significantly reduced,” and that it would now focus on securing Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, where Russia-backed separatists have been fighting for eight years.

The Defense Ministry statement was ambiguous about further possible Russian territorial ambitions in Ukraine, where its ground forces have been mostly stymied by the unexpectedly strong Ukrainian military response.

But on a day when President Biden was visiting U.S. soldiers in Poland near the Ukrainian border, the statement suggested the possibility that the Russians were looking for a way to salvage some kind of achievement before the costs of the war they launched a month ago became impossibly onerous.

While Russia “does not exclude” that its forces will storm major Ukrainian cities such as Chernihiv, Mykolaiv and the capital, Kyiv, the Defense Ministry statement said that taking them over was not the primary objective.

“As individual units carry out their tasks — and they are being solved successfully — our forces and means will be concentrated on the main thing: the complete liberation of the Donbas,” Col. Gen. Sergei Rudskoi, a senior Russian military commander, said in the statement, his first since Russia’s invasion on Feb. 24.

Whether General Rudskoi’s statement was sincere or simply strategic misdirection was difficult to assess. But the statement amounted to the most direct acknowledgment yet that Russia may be unable to take full control of Ukraine and would instead target the Donbas region, where Russia has recognized the independence of two Kremlin-backed separatist areas that it calls the “Donetsk People’s Republic” and the “Luhansk People’s Republic.”

Russia has also insisted that Ukraine recognize its control of Crimea, which President Vladimir V. Putin’s forces seized from Ukraine in 2014.

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has ruled out ceding those regions to stop the war.

Pavel Luzin, a Russian military analyst, cautioned that the public pronouncements of Russian military commanders should be regarded skeptically. While Russia could indeed be narrowing its war aims, he said, General Rudskoi’s statement could also be a feint as Russia regroups for a new offensive.

“We could say that this is a signal that we’re no longer insisting on dismantling Ukrainian statehood,” Mr. Luzin said. “But I would rather see it as a distracting maneuver.”

General Rudskoi’s statement came as Ukraine acknowledged that Russian forces had been “partially successful” in achieving one of their key objectives — securing a land corridor from Russia to the Crimean Peninsula.

While Russia already controlled much of the area, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said the route allowed Russian troops and supplies to flow between Crimea and Russia.

But some Ukrainian officials said the significance of such a route might be overstated. Oleksandr Danylyuk, a former secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine under Mr. Zelensky, described the land bridge as a minor Russian victory and said the Kremlin was moving to secure Donetsk and Luhansk to “sell to the Russian public as a potential victory.”

In Moscow, Mr. Putin, who has made any criticism of the war a potential crime, used a televised videoconference with the winners of a presidential arts prize on Friday to deliver a diatribe about “cancel culture” that made no mention of the war in Ukraine.

In embracing a term that has become a favorite of the American political right to reprise his contention that the West is trying to erase Russian culture and history, Mr. Putin cited J.K. Rowling, author of the “Harry Potter” books, whose comments about transgender women have been criticized as transphobic.

“Not so long ago, the children’s writer J.K. Rowling was also ‘canceled’ for the fact that she — the author of books that have sold hundreds of millions of copies around the world — did not please fans of so-called gender freedoms,” Mr. Putin said.

Ms. Rowling responded on Twitter that, “Critiques of Western cancel culture are possibly not best made by those currently slaughtering civilians for the crime of resistance, or who jail and poison their critics.” She added the hashtag #IStandWithUkraine.

As Mr. Putin spoke, there were indications that Ukrainian forces were making some progress in the second week of their counteroffensive. A senior Pentagon official said that Russian forces no longer had full control of the southern port of Kherson and that the city, the first major urban center to be captured in the Russian invasion, was now “contested territory.”

The Pentagon assessment contradicted General Rudskoi’s claim on Friday that the Kherson region was “under full control.”

In another sign of the bloody stalemate in Ukraine, Russian soldiers have adopted “defensive positions” near Kyiv, the Pentagon official said, adding that Russia appeared to be “prioritizing” the fight in eastern Ukraine, as General Rudskoi had indicated.

“Clearly, they overestimated their ability to take Kyiv and overestimated their ability to take any population center,” the Pentagon official said.

Mr. Biden, on the second day of his three-day visit to Europe because of the Ukraine crisis, traveled to Rzeszow, Poland, about 50 miles from the Ukrainian border, where he met with members of the 82nd Airborne Division who are serving as part of NATO’s efforts to protect Poland and other member states from Russian aggression.

Greeting American service members who were eating pizza in a cafeteria, Mr. Biden called them “the finest fighting force in the history of the world,” and added, “I personally thank you for what you do.”

Later, Mr. Biden met with President Andrzej Duda of Poland and officials managing the humanitarian response to the more than two million Ukrainian refugees who have fled to Poland to escape the shelling and deprivation.

Mr. Biden also announced a deal to increase U.S. shipments of natural gas to help wean Europe off Russian energy. But it remained unclear exactly how the administration would achieve its goals.

The deal calls for the United States to send an additional 15 billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas — roughly 10 to 12 percent of current annual U.S. exports to all countries. But it does not address the lack of port capacity to ship and receive more gas on both sides of the Atlantic.

Still, American gas executives welcomed a renewed emphasis on exports as a sign that the Biden administration was now seeking to promote the U.S. oil and gas industry rather than punish it for contributions to climate change.

“I have no idea how they are going to do this, but I don’t want to criticize them because for the first time they are trying to do the right thing,” said Charif Souki, executive chairman of Tellurian, a U.S. gas producer that is planning to build an export terminal in Louisiana.

Robert Habeck, the vice chancellor and economic minister of Germany, said his country expected to halve imports of Russian oil by midsummer and nearly end them by year’s end — sooner than many thought possible. He estimated that Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, could be free of Russian gas by mid-2024.

Images and videos from Ukraine that emerged on Friday underscored the escalating death toll and destruction.

Newly surfaced security camera footage, verified by The New York Times, showed an attack on people in line for emergency aid outside a post office and shopping center in the battered northeastern city of Kharkiv on Thursday. Oleg Sinegubov, the head of the regional government there, said that at least six civilians had been killed and 15 wounded.

Photographs out of Kharkiv on Friday also showed a large fireball and nearby cars and buildings on fire, as residents fled on foot and bicycle, carrying whatever belongings they could grab in the aftermath of the attack.

In the central city of Dnipro, Russian missile strikes on a military facility destroyed buildings late Thursday night, according to Ukrainian officials, who said that casualties were still being assessed.

And in Mariupol, the southern port savaged by Russian attacks, Ukrainian officials said that an estimated 300 people had been killed in a March 16 strike on a theater used as a bomb shelter.

It was unclear how officials had arrived at that estimate. Ukrainian officials have said that about 130 people were rescued from the theater, which was attacked even though “children” had been written in giant letters on the pavement on both sides of the building.

The United Nations said on Friday that more than 1,000 civilians have been killed, including 93 children, since Russia’s invasion began, many in what appeared to have been indiscriminate bombardments that could constitute war crimes.

The United Nations cautioned that it had not been able to verify the death toll in areas of intense conflict, including Mariupol, and said the actual number of injured and dead was likely to be considerably higher.

In a sign that diplomatic efforts were struggling, Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, rejected comments by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, who had suggested that Ukraine was open to concessions in four key areas.

In an interview released Friday, Mr. Erdogan, who is hosting talks between Ukrainian and Russian delegations, said that Ukraine was willing to drop its bid for NATO membership, accept Russian as an official language, make “certain concessions” about disarmament and agree to “collective security.”

But Mr. Kuleba said the negotiations had proved “very difficult” and that Ukraine had “taken a strong position and does not relinquish its demands.”

“We insist, first of all, on a cease-fire, security guarantees and territorial integrity of Ukraine,” he said, adding that there was “no consensus with Russia on the four points mentioned by the president of Turkey.”

“In particular,” he said, “the Ukrainian language is and will be the only one state language in Ukraine.”

Follow our live news updates on the Russia-Ukraine war.

BRUSSELS — President Biden and leaders of more than 30 nations convened Thursday to demonstrate united opposition to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, announcing new economic sanctions, aid for refugees, deployment of additional forces to Eastern Europe and grim preparations in case Russia uses chemical, biological or nuclear weapons.

But the historic gathering of world leaders in a series of three summits on Thursday underscored how the United States and its allies have in some ways reached their self-imposed limits in crafting a united global response to the largest European conflict in more than a half-century. While they are sharpening the tools they are using against Russia, they appear to have few new ones to reach for.

Mr. Biden and the allies have moved with unexpected speed and authority over the past four weeks, rallying much of the world against President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.

And yet, the sense of stalemate on the battlefield is now also felt in the halls of diplomacy, where taking dramatic new steps to counter Mr. Putin’s aggression is proving difficult. Europeans have said they are not willing to bear the consequences of new limits on the Russian energy that they depend on. And Mr. Biden has said he is not willing to commit troops to Ukraine and risk going to war against Russia.

As the allied leaders met in Brussels, the Ukrainian military, entering the second week of a counteroffensive, claimed on Thursday to have destroyed a Russian military landing ship in the southern port of Berdyansk. In the embattled towns around the capital, Kyiv, intense fighting had set so many fires on Thursday that the city was shrouded in a ghostly haze of white smoke.

Mr. Biden said the United States would accept 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, and he and his counterparts announced a new round of weapons shipments for Ukraine, but not the fighter jets that President Volodymyr Zelensky has pleaded for.

They expressed in one voice their “resolve to counter Russia’s attempts to destroy the foundations of international security and stability.” But they again declined to enforce a no-fly zone in the skies over Ukraine, which would mean readiness to shoot down Russian planes.

They vowed to tighten sanctions on Russia, but the Europeans stopped short of blocking imports of Russian oil and gas, as the United States has done. Europe is hugely dependent on Russian energy, paying Mr. Putin the vast revenues needed to support his military — and giving him the power to wreak havoc on Europe by disrupting supplies.

“I think we’re seeing a coordinated divergence between the European Union and the United States,” said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at Eurasia Group. “There’s no rupture or even a split. Rather, there is an agreement that the U.S. will go more aggressively than the E.U. because they can afford to do so.”

Speaking to reporters Thursday evening, Mr. Biden said that he had requested the emergency meetings — with leaders of NATO, the European Union and the Group of 7 industrialized nations — to show Mr. Putin that the allies will not “crack” in their determination to keep economic pressure on Russia over days, weeks, months and more.

“We have to stay fully, totally, thoroughly united,” he said, adding that he favors ejecting Russia from the Group of 20 industrialized and developing nations.

For Mr. Zelensky, though, none of it was enough. He has become more pointed in his criticism of Western restraint on military aid as Russian forces have savaged Ukrainian cities and towns, especially in the south.

Speaking by video to NATO leaders behind closed doors, Mr. Zelensky thanked them for their support but chided them for not doing more. He described his battered country, which is not a NATO member, as trapped “in the ‘gray zone’ between the West and Russia,” according to a transcript released by the Ukrainian government.

“On Feb. 24, I addressed you with a perfectly clear, logical request to help close our skies,” he said of his request for a no-fly zone over Ukraine to keep Russian planes away. “In any format. Protect our people from Russian bombs and missiles. We did not hear a clear answer.”

“And you see the consequences today,” he added a moment later. “How many people were killed, how many peaceful cities were destroyed?”

He repeated his appeal for warplanes, though the White House and the Pentagon have said that supplying them could give Russia a pretext for drawing NATO into a direct conflict. “You have thousands of fighter jets! But we haven’t been given any yet,” Mr. Zelensky said. “To save people and our cities, Ukraine needs military assistance — without restrictions.”

For NATO leaders, the high stakes of their meeting were evident in the joint statement issued at its conclusion. The 72-year-old alliance warned Russia against deploying “chemical, biological and nuclear weapons” in Ukraine, signaling a growing concern that Mr. Putin is willing to use them to advance his aggression or to falsely implicate Ukraine’s government.

Mr. Biden was cautious Thursday in his response to questions about the warning. He declined to say whether the United States or NATO would respond militarily if Russia used chemical weapons, which are banned by international treaty.

“We would respond if he uses it,” Mr. Biden said. “The nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use.”

But in warning about the threat from weapons of mass destruction, NATO’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said the organization was “enhancing allies’ preparedness and readiness for chemical, biological and nuclear threats.” It will provide detection equipment, protection and medical support to Ukraine, he said, along with training for decontamination and crisis management to deal with the impact of any use of weapons of mass destruction.

The alliance’s top military commander, Gen. Tod D. Wolters, “has activated NATO’s chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defense elements,” Mr. Stoltenberg added, placing on increased alert NATO teams that specialize in detecting and responding to contamination after a chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear attack. Member nations are taking similar steps.

Mr. Stoltenberg noted that the use of such weapons inside Ukraine could contaminate neighboring NATO countries.

“Many people fear that Russia will use such weapons and accuse Ukraine of doing it, so it is important to precisely determine who, where and when did it so there’s no ambiguity,” said Gustav Gressel, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.

The United States hit Russia with a new round of sanctions on Thursday, targeting more than 300 members of its Parliament and dozens of defense companies, while moving to restrict Russia’s ability to use gold reserves to prop up its currency. It also imposed sanctions on Herman Gref, a Putin ally and the president and chairman of Sberbank, one of Russia’s largest banks; the bank itself was sanctioned last month.

The economic actions, which came in conjunction with new sanctions from Western allies, were the latest attempt to inflict economic pain on Mr. Putin. The United States also moved to curtail Russia’s ability to evade existing restrictions on its central bank and major financial institutions, responding to concerns that Russia was finding ways to stabilize the ruble and rebuild its foreign currency reserves.

The Treasury Department is taking aim at alternative assets that Russia could use to support its economy. It issued new guidance on Thursday to make clear that transactions involving Russia’s $130 billion of gold reserves were also subject to U.S. sanctions. Russia built up its gold war chest in recent years to help blunt the impact of earlier sanctions by using the precious metal to buy currency or secure loans.

The U.S. is working to close that loophole by threatening penalties for anyone who facilitates such transactions.

Mr. Biden and European Union leaders are expected to announce an agreement to provide significant amounts of American liquefied natural gas to Europe this year, according to two European diplomats. They said the shipments could limit Europe’s reliance on Russian energy in the near term, and boost confidence in its ability to become less dependent over time.

“The question of course isn’t whether Europe has enough oil and gas for right now, but what happens next winter,” said Jacob F. Kirkegaard, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.

In addition to accepting 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, Mr. Biden announced that the United States would donate $1 billion to help European countries deal with the surge of people fleeing Russia’s invasion, White House officials said on Thursday.

A senior administration official said special efforts were being made to welcome Ukrainians who have family members in the United States.

An estimated four million Ukrainians have poured into Poland and other countries as Mr. Putin’s forces have bombarded civilian areas across Ukraine. Mr. Biden’s commitment would significantly increase the United States’ role in dealing with the unfolding humanitarian crisis.

On the battlefields, Ukrainian fighters have had some success this week in pushing Moscow’s much larger forces farther away from Kyiv and other cities, according to Western intelligence agencies, even as the bloody siege gripping the port of Mariupol has tightened. But many Ukrainian claims of gains have been impossible to verify, and brutal street fighting still echoes through some towns that Ukrainian forces claim to have recaptured.

Russia did not immediately comment on Ukraine’s claim to have destroyed a warship in Berdyansk, whose port Moscow has used to funnel reinforcements to Mariupol and across Ukraine’s eastern front. But British and U.S. officials confirmed that it was a strike by Ukrainian forces, and videos and photos reviewed by The New York Times confirmed that a Russian ship was ablaze in the port, and showed smoke rising from others.

“The destroyed ship in Berdyansk could carry up to 20 tanks, 45 armored personnel carriers and 400 paratroopers,” the Ukrainian deputy defense minister, Anna Malyar, said in a statement on Thursday. “This is a huge target that was hit by our military.”

The United Nations says that the war has forced more than 10 million Ukrainians, about one-fourth of the population, from their homes, including the “internally displaced” who have fled to safer parts of the country — Europe’s largest refugee crisis since World War II. The U.N. children’s agency reported on Thursday that they include 4.3 million children, more than half the children in Ukraine.

On Friday, Mr. Biden is expected to travel to Poland, in part to witness the surge of people taking refuge there. In his remarks to reporters, Mr. Biden hinted that he might travel to the border with Ukraine — something that officials have been unwilling to confirm.

“I’m not supposed to say, but anyway,” he said. “I hope I get to see a lot of people.”

The Russian Defense Ministry on April 16 said it had cleared the Mariupol urban area of Ukrainian troops and had trapped a few remaining fighters in the Azovstal steel plant, according to Russian state-run media.

A Russian Defense Ministry spokesman was quoted by Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency as saying that Ukrainian forces have lost a total of 4,000 troops during the long fight for the city -- a battle that has caught the world’s attention for its brutality.

Casualty figures from both sides have proved impossible to independently confirm during the conflict, which began with Russia's unprovoked invasion on February 24.

Ukraine has not commented on the latest Russian claims but in recent days has indicated the situation in Mariupol was desperate, with deaths mounting among the trapped civilian population and many experts predicting the city would soon fall to the Russians.

In an interview published earlier on April 16 with Ukrayinska Pravda, Zelenskiy warned Russia against committing atrocities against Ukrainian soldiers in the city.

""The elimination of our troops, of our men [in Mariupol] will put an end to any negotiations,” he said.

""That will bring an impasse as we don't negotiate on either our territories or our people,"" he added.

Peace talks have taken place between the two sides since Russia's invasion began, with little or no progress.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Reports early on April 16 said heavy fighting continued in several parts of Mariupol as Ukrainian troops attempted to fend off Russian soldiers who have been bolstered by reinforcements in recent days.

""The situation is very difficult [in Mariupol],"" Zelenskiy said early in the day. ""Our soldiers are blocked, the wounded are blocked. There is a humanitarian crisis.... Nevertheless, the guys are defending themselves.""

As the battle for the ruins of Mariupol appeared to be near its bloody end, air-raid sirens could be heard in many other parts of Ukraine on April 16, including in Kyiv, after Russia said it would seek revenge on the capital for what it claimed, without evidence, was Ukrainian targeting of Russian border towns.

Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko said at least one person was killed and several others wounded in early morning attacks.

""For those Kyivites who left and are already thinking of heading back to return to the capital, I ask you to refrain from this and stay in safer places,"" Klitschko said in a message on his Telegram channel.

Russian troops have faced tougher-than-expected resistance -- both from the Ukrainian military and from ordinary citizens -- forcing them to retreat from areas in the north and to focus on eastern and southern regions of Ukraine, including Mariupol.

In his nightly address to the nation, Zelenskiy said the success of Ukraine's military and that of international sanctions against Russia will determine how long the war will last.

""The success of our military on the battlefield has been really significant. Historically significant. But it's still not enough to clear our land from the invading forces,"" he said.

""The sanctions against Russia are very serious, economically painful. But it is not enough to starve Russia's military machine. We need to promote stronger, more destructive sanctions. This will determine how long this war will last,"" he added.

Russia's warning to inflict more damage on Ukraine came a day after it suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, the Moskva, which sank while being towed to port on April 14 after suffering heavy damage under circumstances that remain in dispute.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on the Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

The National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) has rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Kyiv did claim, however, to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Meanwhile, the United States and its Western allies continued to pile pressure on Moscow over its campaign.

The German government said on April 15 that it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.



The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Russia's Foreign Ministry on April 16 said it was banning British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Foreign Minister Liz Truss, and several other cabinet ministers over British measures aimed at isolating Moscow and crippling the country's economy.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Meanwhile, the United States and its Western allies continued to pile pressure on Moscow over its campaign.

The German government said on April 15 that it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.



The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Russia's Foreign Ministry on April 16 said it was banning British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Foreign Minister Liz Truss, and several other cabinet ministers over British measures aimed at isolating Moscow and crippling the country's economy.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

The UN refugee agency said as of April 16 that 4,836,445 million Ukrainians had left the country since the Russian invasion -- up by 40,200 from the previous day’s total.

All of them. They must support the struggle for life. We are waiting for meaningful steps. From Nato, the EU and the G7. We know that the Russians have already begun to lobby their interests.

We have not received aircraft and modern anti-missile weapons. We have not received tanks, anti-ship equipment. Russian forces can keep killing thousands of our citizens, destroying our cities. Just because there are too many invaders. Just because Russia has been preparing for such a war for decades. We asked to close our sky.

We asked the Alliance to say it will fully help Ukraine win this war, clear our territories of the invaders and restore peace in Ukraine.”

24 Mar 2022 23.58 The United States Embassy in Moscow on Wednesday received a list of its diplomats that were declared “persona non grata”, a state department spokesperson said, in what Russian media said was a response to a US move ousting Russian staff at the United Nations. Washington last month said it was expelling the Russian diplomats at the country’s UN mission in New York over national security concerns, and later announced it would oust an additional Russian at the UN who it claimed was a spy. Russia, which denies the allegations, told the United States on Wednesday it would throw out an unspecified number of American diplomats in response to the moves, Interfax news agency said. “The American side was told very firmly that any hostile U.S. actions against Russia would provoke a decisive and comparable response,” the agency said. It is not clear how many US diplomats will be affected by the order, and when they will be expelled from Russia.



24 Mar 2022 23.35 For weeks the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol has been under constant bombardment from Russian artillery. With the city in ruins, residents who risked everything to escape can now tell their stories. As Isobel Koshiw tells Hannah Moore, the story of Mariupol in the past month has been one of siege, bombardment and almost unimaginable hardship. Residents tell of having to drink water from their radiators and cook over fires in the street, as electricity, gas and water supplies have all been cut off. And with the internet and phone lines down, the city has become not only unreachable but also uncontactable, for the most part. Listen to the Guardian’s latest Today in Focus episode below.

24 Mar 2022 23.14 Martin Farrer We have reported on what Putin’s rouble gambit might mean for Europe and gas - and the Japanese government has also weighed in, saying that it did not understand how the change would work in practice. “Currently, we’re looking into the situation with relevant ministries as we don’t quite understand what is (Russia’s) intention and how they would do this,” finance minister Shunichi Suzuki said in a parliament session.

24 Mar 2022 22.59 Repeated attempts by the United States’ top defence and military leaders to speak with their Russian counterparts have been rejected by Moscow, leaving officials in the dark about explanations for military movements and raising fears of a major miscalculation or battlefield accident, the Washington Post reports. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, defense secretary Lloyd Austin and Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, have tried to set up phone calls with Russia’s defense minister Sergei Shoigu and Gen. Valery Gerasimov but the Russians “have so far declined to engage,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said in a statement Wednesday. James Stavridis, who served as the supreme allied commander at Nato from 2009 to 2013, said: There is a high risk of escalation without the firebreak of direct contact between the most senior officials. Very young people are flying in jets, operating warships, and conducting combat operations in the Ukrainian war. They are not seasoned diplomats, and their actions in the heat of operations can be misunderstood. We must avoid a scenario of Nato and Russia sleepwalking into war because senior leaders can’t pick up a phone and explain to each other what is happening.”

24 Mar 2022 22.45 Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy earlier called for the world to show solidarity with Ukraine by marking one month since Russia’s invasion began by gathering in their city centres and making themselves heard. “Come with Ukrainian symbols to support Ukraine, to support freedom, to support life.” Speaking in English, Zelenskiy also said that he would be watching to see which nations “sell out” on the issues of bolstering sanctions and energy. “Life can be protected only in unity. Freedom must be armed,” he said. Watch the video of Zelenskiy’s remarks below. 01:12 'We will see who is a friend and who has betrayed us', Zelenskiy says of summits – video



24 Mar 2022 22.39 Russia’s deputy ambassador to the UN has said Russia retains the right to use nuclear weapons if the country is “provoked” by Nato. In an interview with Sky News, Dmitry Polyanskiy was asked if Putin was right to hold the prospect of nuclear war over the rest of the world. He replied: If Russia is provoked by Nato, if Russia is attacked by Nato, I don’t know ... we are a nuclear power, why not? When pressed if his remarks were a “legitimate thing to be saying” Polyanskiy responded: I don’t think it’s the right thing to be saying. But it’s not the right thing to threaten Russia, and to try to interfere. So when you’re dealing with a nuclear power, of course, you have to calculate all the possible outcomes of your behaviour.”



24 Mar 2022 22.27 White House 'Tiger Team' strategises nuclear scenarios and attacks on Nato territory The White House has quietly assembled a team of national security officials to sketch out scenarios of how the United States and its allies should respond if Russian President Vladimir Putin unleashes his stockpiles of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons, the New York Times is reporting.

The group, known as the Tiger Team, is also examining responses if Putin reaches into Nato territory to attack convoys bringing weapons and aid to Ukraine, according to several officials involved in the process. The team is also looking at responses if Russia seeks to extend the war to neighbouring nations, including Moldova and Georgia, and how to prepare European countries for the refugees flowing in on a scale not seen in decades, the Times reports. These plans are expected to be discussed in Brussels on Thursday, when US President Biden meets leaders of the 29 other Nato nations. As Biden flew to Europe on Wednesday, both he and Stoltenberg warned of growing evidence that Russia was in fact preparing to use chemical weapons in Ukraine. One major issue the Tiger Team is reportedly looking at is the threshold that could prompt the alliance to use military force in Ukraine. Biden has made clear that he is reluctant to to do so, fearing that direct confrontation with Russia could escalate the conflict beyond control. “That’s World War Three,” he said recently.

24 Mar 2022 22.19 Martin Farrer The rouble has recovered more ground against the US dollar on Thursday in the wake of Vladiumir Putin’s decision to make “unfriendly countries” pay for Russian gas in the country’s currency. It rose 1.5% to 96.7 to the dollar in early trade on Thursday after closing up 6% at 97.7375 per dollar on Wednesday. The value of the rouble plummeted to as lows as 154 to the dollar in the first couple of weeks of the war after the US and its allies imposed sanctions on Russia and banned its central bank for intervening to prop up the currency. A protest in Brussels this week calling on EU leaders to ban imports of Russian gas. Photograph: Johanna Geron/Reuters Putin’s move is clearly intended to ensure that the rouble rises again as other countries use their currencies to buy roubles to pay for the natural gas. (Nearly all Russian gas purchases are made in euros and dollars by the way.) They may also have to ignore their own sanctions and sell things to Russia in order to earn roubles. However, analysts painted some different scenarios for what might happen, including noting that the Russian gambit might just incentivise European countries to cut the umbilical cord of gas supplies more wquickly than they had already planned. Rystad Energy’s senior analyst Vinicius Romano said: Gas supply agreements are generally considered sacrosanct: and in an extreme scenario, insisting on rouble payments may give buyers cause to re-open other aspects of their contracts – such as the duration - and simply speed up their exit from Russian gas altogether. At face value this appears to be an attempt to prop up the Ruble by compelling gas buyers to buy the previously free-falling currency in order to pay. What is clear however, is that this has added another element of uncertainty to the already chaotic European gas market by complicating gas purchases that many countries have been reluctant to cut. It may also accelerate attempts by the EU to strike a deal with the US to supply more liquefied natural gas when leaders meet in Brussels today. US president Joe Biden may announce more details on this on Friday. Russia supplies 40% of the EU’s collective gas needs, 27% of its oil imports and 46% of coal imports.

24 Mar 2022 22.01 Risk of coup against Putin 'growing every week', whistleblower says The risk of coup by Russia’s federal security service (FSB) against President Putin is growing every week that the war in Ukraine continues, a whistleblower at the heart of Russian intelligence has said. The whistleblower claims that chaos and discontent have engulfed the security services after Russia’s botched invasion of Ukraine. Letters written by an anonymous Russian intelligence analyst to Vladimir Osechkin, an exiled Russian activist and founder of the human rights group Gulagu.net, have since been published online. The risk of coup by Russia’s federal security service (FSB) against President Putin is growing every week, a whistleblower at the heart of Russian intelligence has said Photograph: Mikhail Klimentyev/AP Osechkin told The Times that the risk taken by intelligence agents in speaking out was a sign of their growing anger towards Putin and discontent from the effect that sanctions have had on FSB officers who will no longer be able to “go on holidays to their villas in Italy and take their kids to Disneyland Paris”. Speaking from his home in France, where he has lived in exile since 2015, Osechkin told the newspaper: For 20 years Putin created stability in Russia. FSB officers, policemen, state prosecutors — those people inside the system — were able to live good lives. But now that has all gone. They recognise that this war is a catastrophe for the economy, for humanity. They don’t want to go back to the Soviet Union. For every week and every month that this war continues, the possibility of a rebellion by those in the security services increases.”

24 Mar 2022 21.14 Ukraine is using facial recognition software to identify the bodies of Russian soldiers killed in combat and to trace their families to inform them of their deaths, Ukraine’s vice prime minister told Reuters. Ukraine’s ministry of defence this month began using technology from Clearview AI, a US facial recognition provider that finds images on the web that match faces from uploaded photos. Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine’s vice prime minister who also runs the ministry of digital transformation, told Reuters Ukraine had been using Clearview AI software to find the social media accounts of dead Russian soldiers. From there, authorities are messaging relatives to make arrangements to collect the body, he said. Fedorov tweeted late on Wednesday: A month ago, we all worked on FaceID and CRM systems to process calls for eServices. Now, we work on automatic identification of occupiers’ corpses and autodial RU subscribers to tell the truth about the war.” “As a courtesy to the mothers of those soldiers, we are disseminating this information over social media to at least let families know that they they’ve lost their sons and to then enable them to come to collect their bodies,” Fedorov added in an interview. A month ago, we all worked on FaceID and CRM systems to process calls for eServices. Now, we work on automatic identification of occupiers' corpses and autodial RU subscribers to tell the truth about the war. We have all changed. And we all do different things. Glory to Ukraine! — Mykhailo Fedorov (@FedorovMykhailo) March 23, 2022 Fedorov declined to specify the number of bodies identified through facial recognition but he said the percentage of recognised individuals claimed by families has been “high.” Opponents of facial recognition, including civil rights groups, have decried Ukraine’s adoption of Clearview, citing the possibility of misidentification. Fedorov said Ukraine was not using the technology to identify its own troops killed in battle. He did not specify why. Ukraine’s ministry of internal affairs has been overseeing the country’s Look For Your Own project, a Telegram channel where it posts images of unidentified captured or killed Russian soldiers and invites claims from relatives.

The Ukrainian government has an online form where Russian relatives can submit a claim to collect a body.

The latest: The weeks-long resistance in besieged Mariupol appeared to be cracking as Russian forces moved closer to capturing the seaside port city in southeastern Ukraine, with a Russian-imposed deadline for Ukrainian forces in the city to surrender passing early Sunday local time. Meanwhile, officials in the capital Kyiv and the western city of Lviv reported explosions Saturday. Moscow has withdrawn its forces from those regions to focus on eastern Ukraine, but airstrikes have continued.

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

6,638db385-66f1-48a5-9189-aaec8aa070f7,[],2022-03-24 00:00:00+00:00,"In Russia, it was a different story. In the 68,000 capacity Gazprom Stadium in St Petersburg, fans of local football team Zenit stood to their feet too. Singing, chanting and unfurling a giant banner saying ""Football is no place for politics"". A protest against their club's exclusion from UEFA's Europa League and FIFA's decision to throw Russia out of the World Cup.

But whether the Zenit fans like it or not, right now sport and politics are tied together more than ever before.

And on the war in Ukraine, the sporting world is taking sides.

Russia's President Vladimir Putin has long used sport to project an image of strength on the world stage. He loved nothing more than seeing Russian athletes topping the podium, seeking to benefit politically from victory while the world was watching. From the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, the 2018 football World Cup, to the Russian state sponsored doping programme throughout his reign - Putin's hand has been all over Russian sporting success.

As Russian troops and tanks began to mass along the Ukrainian border in early February, teenage figure skater Kamila Valieva made headlines at the Winter Olympics in Beijing. Another doping scandal blighting top level sport. Another made in Russia. But it soon faded, as Putin turned his thoughts to war. Waiting to invade his neighbour, it is suggested, until the games had finished so as not to upset China.

As the world recoiled at the horror unleashed in Ukraine, sanctions were quick to follow. Political, economic, cultural and, eventually, sporting.

The International Paralympic Committee was the first to face a difficult decision. Their Winter Games were about to begin in China and they faced calls, including from Paralympics Ireland, to ban Russian and Belorussian athletes. Despite initial hesitation, citing that old favourite legal reasons, they eventually reversed course and imposed a ban. In contrast, the small Ukrainian team was welcomed with open arms and, as luck would have it, won the first medal of the games.

One-by-one the world's sporting bodies followed suit. Most significantly, the International Olympic Committee recommending its sports ban all Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials from competing. Football was next, throwing Russia out of the World Cup, excluding Russian clubs from European competition and moving this year's Champions League final from St Petersburg to Paris. The F1 Grand Prix planned for Sochi was sidelined. And Putin himself was stripped of his role as honorary president of the International Judo Federation. A personal blow to a leader whose love of sport is a key part of his projected strongman image.

All the while Ukrainian athletes having been doing what they can too. Some like World Champion boxer Vitaly Klitschko, now mayor of Kyiv, leading the resistance to the Russian invasion. Others including champion boxer Vasily Lomachenko signing up for the Ukrainian armed forces. While many more, like Premier League footballers Andriy Yarmolenko of West Ham and Oliksandr Zinchenko at Manchester City and tennis star Elina Svitolina have continued to compete and use their profile to raise the plight of their country.

The economic sanctions imposed on Russia have impacted sport too. Most notably at Chelsea, where owner Roman Abramovich, once a close ally of Putin, has been forced to sell the club. The current European Champions have basked in glory since he took charge of the club almost 20 years ago. His largesse bankrolling a golden era of success for the club. But now, its future is uncertain. One Chelsea fan, speaking outside Stamford Bridge when the news broke, spoke with a nuance not normally found in football. ""I know he sort of used the club for his own ends. Sports-washing, if you want to call it that,"" he said. ""But I still kinda love him.""

It's a sentiment that holds little weight in the real world. But most sports fans will identify. It's precisely why leaders like Putin put so much emphasis on sport and using it to forge a national identity and bond with so-called ordinary people.

The hope in the West and beyond is that if everyday sports fans in Russia can no longer enjoy their nation's sporting success on the world stage, then their attitude towards their government might change. A long shot perhaps. But there are already small signs that it may be having an effect. The captain of Russia's national football team, Artem Dzyuba, a Zenit player who has family in Ukraine, has rejected a call-up to play for his country. A brave move perhaps. And a sign that standing ovations in support of Ukraine on this side of the world can have ripple effects that may yet reach the heart of the Kremlin.",https://www.rte.ie/news/2022/0324/1287788-one-month-war-in-ukraine/

STORYLINE:

On April 23rd 2014 commanding officer Jan-Kjetil Folland gives the order for ""battle stations"" on board the Norwegian NATO flagship the Valkyrien.

An alarm sounds and gunfire from a .50 calibre machine gun echoes over the waters of the Baltic Sea.

April 23rd's simulated ""battle stations"" exercises are part of a ""show of strength"" deployment for eastern members of the alliance.

Five battleships took part in the exercises, and crew members fired weapons off the deck of the Valkyrien - the flagship of the Standing NATO Mine Counter-Measures Group ONE.

Lieutenant Commander Dave Benham, NATO's chief public affairs officer, said that the group's deployment is ""one of those measures designed to assure our allies in the Baltic of NATO's resolve and solidarity and preparedness to meet any challenge"".

The exercises come amid the West's ongoing dispute with Russia over Ukraine.

***

Ukraine's ousted president, Viktor Yanukovych, said on April 2nd that he was ""wrong"" to invite Russian troops into Crimea, and vowed to try to persuade Russia to return the Black Sea peninsula.

In his first interview since fleeing to Russia in February 2014, Yanukovych told The Associated Press and Russia's state NTV television that he still hopes to negotiate with Russian President Vladimir Putin to get back the coveted region.

Russia annexed Crimea in March following a hastily called referendum held after Russian troops took control of the region.

Ukraine and the West have rejected the move as illegal.

""Crimea is a tragedy. It is a great tragedy,"" Yanukovych told The AP, insisting that Russia's takeover of Crimea wouldn't have happened if he had stayed in power.

He fled Ukraine after three months of anti-government protests against his rule.

The 63-year-old said he has personally met with Putin since he arrived and hopes to have more meetings with the Russian leader to negotiate Crimea's return.

***

On April 7th Pro-Russian protesters set tyres and plastic barriers on fire in front of the regional assembly building in Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine.

The building was seized by separatists after demonstrations on Sunday but the Ukrainian police have since regained control.

Earlier on April 7th pro-Russia and pro-Ukraine demonstrators clashed in front of the regional assembly building and police struggled to keep the two groups apart as sticks and stones were thrown by protesters on both sides.

Eastern Ukraine was the heartland of support for President Viktor Yanukovych, who fled to Russia after months of protests.

About half of the region's residents are ethnic Russians, many of whom say Ukraine's acting authorities are nationalists who will oppress Russians.

***

On April 16th tension was high in the eastern Ukrainian city of Slovyansk as pro-Russia armed militia patrolled the streets.

One man was seen being punched and kicked by unidentified assailants. He was later led away by members of the pro-Russia militia.

Dozens of masked gunmen, backed with at least six armoured vehicles waving Russian flags, surrounded the main administrative building in Slovyansk.

The troops were enthusiastically greeted in the largely pro-Russian city.

""We've managed to defeat fascism back in 1945 and they wanted us to forget about this triumph. But we don't want to forgive or forget,"" said one man.

He said they came from Crimea to help the people of Donbas region, where Slovyansk is located.

Armed men in Slovyansk have seized the local police headquarters and the administration building, demanding broader autonomy for their eastern Ukraine region and closer ties with Russia.

Their actions have been repeated in at least eight other cities in eastern Ukraine.

Eastern Ukraine was the support base for ousted President Viktor Yanukovych, who fled to Russia after months of protests over his decision to back away from closer relations with the European Union and turn toward Russia.

Opponents of the government that replaced him allege the new authorities will repress eastern Ukraine's large Russian-speaking population.

On April 17th the Prime Minister of Ukraine accused Russia of orchestrating unrest in eastern Ukraine.

Arseniy Yatsenyuk was addressing journalists following a meeting between Ukrainian ministers and business representatives in Kiev.

""There is only one person in the world who believes that Russian troops are not present in the east of Ukraine. This person is Vladimir Putin,"" Yatsenyuk said.

He added that despite admitting that Russian troops had been involved in a military intervention in Crimea, Putin was denying that ""saboteurs"" who had ""created a terrorist network on Ukraine territory"" were following his orders.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on April 17th rejected claims that Russian special forces are fomenting unrest in eastern Ukraine, but recognised for the first time that the troops in unmarked uniforms who overtook Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula before its annexation by Moscow were Russian soldiers.

The well-armed, Moscow-backed insurgency sowing chaos in eastern Ukraine scored a new victory on Wednesday, seizing armoured vehicles and weapons from underequipped government forces, then rolling through two cities to a hero's welcome.

Meanwhile, officials from the US, Russia, Ukraine and the European Union were meeting in Geneva on Thursday for negotiations aimed at persuading Russia to back off in Ukraine following its annexation of Crimea.

Yatsenyuk said he did not have ""exaggerated expectations"" of the Geneva talks.

On May 2nd pro-Russians clashed with Ukrainian government supporters in the Black Sea port city of Odessa.

Supporters of the government in Kiev armed themselves with rocks and other projectiles.

Police tried to separate both sets of demonstrators.

Police said one person died from gunshot fire and another was wounded.

Odessa is some 550 kilometres (330 miles) from the turmoil in Ukraine's east.

It has remained largely untroubled by unrest since the February toppling of pro-Russia President Viktor Yanukovych, which ignited tensions in the east.

On May 11th almost 90 percent of voters in a key industrial region in eastern Ukraine voted in favour of sovereignty, according to pro-Russian separatists as they announced preliminary results of a twin referendum that is certain to deepen the turmoil in the country.

Roman Lyagin, election chief of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, said around 75 percent of the Donetsk region's 3 million or so voters cast ballots, and the vast majority backed sovereignty.

With no international election monitors in place, it was all but impossible to verify the claims.

Lyagin said they understood the outcome would fall on deaf ears, but that the people of Donetsk have spoken.

""European organisations and international governments will not recognise it, but through this referendum we want everyone to listen to us and the power of the people.""

The preliminary vote count was announced just two hours after the polls closed in an election conducted via paper ballots.

A second referendum that was also organised by pro-Russian separatists was held in eastern Ukraine's industrial Luhansk region, but no immediate results were released.

Ukraine's central government and the West had condemned the balloting as a sham and a violation of international law.

They have accused Moscow of orchestrating the unrest in a possible attempt to grab another piece of the country weeks after the annexation of Crimea.

The results of the two referendums could hasten the break-up of the country and worsen what is already the gravest crisis between the West and Russia since the end of the Cold War.

On May 22nd at least eleven Ukrainian troops were killed and about 30 others were wounded when pro-Russian insurgents attacked a military checkpoint, the deadliest raid in weeks of fighting in eastern Ukraine.

AP journalists saw 11 bodies scattered around the checkpoint on the edge of the village of Blahodatne, about 30 kilometres (20 miles) south of the city of Donetsk.

Witnesses said that more than 30 Ukrainian troops were wounded when the insurgents attacked the checkpoint, and some of them were in grave condition.

""Three of my friends have fallen, and I cannot even collect their bodies. Their combat unit has been lying there in the field for over 30 minutes already,"" said one Ukrainian soldier standing just metres away from the scene.

The attack came three days before the country's presidential vote.

Three charred Ukrainian armoured infantry vehicles, their turrets blown away by powerful explosions, and several burned trucks stood at the site of the combat area. A military helicopter landed on the site, carrying officials who inspected the scene.

The Ukrainian Defence Ministry confirmed the attack, but wouldn't comment on casualties. There was no report of casualties on the insurgent side.

""At first the vehicles came and cleared (destroyed) the scene. After that, the helicopters cleaned what was left of the place"", said a paramedic, standing outside the local Volnovakha hospital.

The Volnovakha hospital was closed to the media, as Ukrainian soldiers rushed in and out, and guarded the entrances.

In the town of Horlivka, a rebel commander claimed responsibility for the raid and produced an array of weapons they said they had seized.

Scores have been killed in fighting between pro-Russian insurgents, who have seized government buildings and engaged in clashes with government troops in eastern Ukraine.

May 22nd's carnage cast a shadow over Ukraine's presidential vote on May 25th, which insurgents in the east have pledged to derail.

US President Barack Obama said on June 4th that the Ukrainian people had made a ""wise selection"" in electing their new leader.

Obama was speaking during a meeting with Ukraine's President-elect Petro Poroshenko in Warsaw, Poland.

He said he had been ""deeply impressed"" with Poroshenko's vision, and called on the international community to support Poroshenko in his efforts.

Obama described recent events in Ukraine as an ""incredible outpouring of democracy in the face of actions by Russia, as well as armed militias in certain portions of the East"" and said the US was committed to standing behind Ukraine.

In tandem with June 4th's meeting, the US announced it would send Kiev an additional 5 million US dollars in equipment, as Ukraine's military continues to suffer casualties in its confrontation with pro-Russian insurgents, especially in the country's east.

More significant than the dollar amount was the nature of the new aid, with the White House saying for the first time that the assistance would include body armour and night vision goggles: tools that could directly help Ukraine's troops as they battle separatists.

Until now, the US has only provided other nonlethal forms of aid such as clothes, food and radios.

On June 7th Ukraine's new president attended a ceremony in central Kiev after taking the oath of office at Ukraine's parliament in the morning.

Petro Poroshenko was greeted by an honour guard at St Sophia Square in the capital as crowds waved national flags and cheered for their new leader.

The 48-year-old Poroshenko replaces an interim leader who had been in office since Russia-friendly president Viktor Yanukovych fled the country in February.

Poroshenko assumed power a day after meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin at D-Day commemoration ceremonies in France.

On June 13th Ukrainian government troops, reinforced by volunteers from a paramilitary battalion, fought pro-Russia separatists in the southern port of Mariupol, Ukraine's interior minister said.

Arsen Avakov said that four government troops were wounded as forces retook buildings occupied by the rebels in the centre of the city and that troops destroyed a light armoured vehicle used by the separatists.

About a hundred members of the Azov Battalion militia forces, controlled by Kiev were seen at the scene of clashes, singing the national anthem, cheering and shouting ""Azov, Azov"", as they were leaving the scene in military trucks.

Remnants of a destroyed and burned out military truck and APC were seen at the spot where the heaviest fight took place.

The APC had DNR sprayed on it, which is the abbreviation for the Donetsk People's Republic in Russian.

The renewed fighting came as rebel leaders confirmed they have three tanks.

Ukrainian officials have said the tanks crossed from the Russian side of the porous border and were attacked by Ukrainian troops, but there has been no independent confirmation the tanks came from Russia.

As a shaky cease-fire in the east entered its final hours on June 26th, thousands of Ukrainians in cars stuffed with their belongings lined up at the border to cross into Russia, some vowing never to return.

Many of them queued at the Izvaryne crossing, their cars laden with household items, including refrigerators.

One local commander at a rebel-controlled border post outside the city of Luhansk said 5,000 people had left by evening, joining a stream that has continued unabated during the weeklong truce that has failed to end the gunfire and shelling.

""It's scary. We are afraid for the kid,"" said a young woman called Anastasia, who had come to the border with her husband and small child.

Russia says tens of thousands of Ukrainians have arrived in the two and a half months since Ukraine's government began fighting separatists in the east, a heavily industrial region with a large population of ethnic Russians, many of whom feel strong ties to Moscow.

Air strikes and artillery attacks by the Ukrainian military have killed more than 400 people since mid-April, according to a United Nations estimate.

The fleeing Ukrainians who talked to the Associated Press did not indicate whether or not they supported the armed separatists, who have seized government buildings, declared independence and asked Russia to annex the region.

""We don't have any relatives in Russia, only friends. We are going to claim refugee status and then it depends on how the Russian Federation treats us,"" said Dimitriy, who was waiting in his car to cross into Russia.

Russia's migration service said last week that it had registered the arrival of 90,000 Ukrainians, but few asked for refugee status, which would oblige them to stay in Russia at least six months.",http://www.aparchive.com/clipbin/AB29CD4CB135B1343137B3AC4903320D8D4D0CCD8C01
