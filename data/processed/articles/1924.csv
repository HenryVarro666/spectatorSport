The latest: The weeks-long resistance in besieged Mariupol appeared to be cracking as Russian forces moved closer to capturing the seaside port city in southeastern Ukraine, with a Russian-imposed deadline for Ukrainian forces in the city to surrender passing early Sunday local time. Meanwhile, officials in the capital Kyiv and the western city of Lviv reported explosions Saturday. Moscow has withdrawn its forces from those regions to focus on eastern Ukraine, but airstrikes have continued.

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

How you can help: Here are ways those in the U.S. can help support the Ukrainian people as well as what people around the world have been donating.

(Manuel Balce Ceneta/Pool/AFP/Getty Images)

State Department spokesperson Ned Price hinted at additional US action against Russia coming “very soon” when asked about Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky's request for greater G7 sanctions in response to the latest atrocities in Bucha.

""When it comes to our sanctions, we've always said that we will continue applying pressure on President Putin, on the Kremlin, on all of those around him including oligarchs and cronies who are empowering this war of choice against Ukraine, until and unless the Kremlin deescalates, until and unless the violence diminishes, and until and unless these kinds of atrocities come to an end. So I suspect you will very soon see additional pressure applied,” Price told MSNBC Sunday.

""When it comes to these images out of Bucha, we have already assessed that Russia's forces have committed war crimes. What we're doing, we are collecting information. One, to shine a spotlight on precisely what they're doing, but two, to ensure that all of those who have perpetrated these atrocities and all of those who ordered these atrocities are held to account. That's our mission,"" he continued.

Shocking images came to light from Bucha, Ukraine Saturday by Agence France-Presse of at least 20 civilian men dead and lining a single street. The photos were released the same day Ukraine declared the town liberated from Russian troops. Accounts of alleged Russian atrocities are emerging as its forces retreat from areas near Kyiv following a failed bid to encircle the capital.

CNN has not been able to independently confirm the details around the men's deaths and has requested comment from the Russian defense ministry regarding allegations of the execution of civilians in the Kyiv region and other parts of Ukraine.

Asked about peace talks, Price said, ""We have not seen any indication yet that the Russians are truly serious about deescalating this war.""

Price also dismissed reports that the Russian ruble is recovering from the sanctions, saying, ""This is almost entirely artificial. The ruble is on life support with draconian measures that the Kremlin has been forced to take to artificially prop up the value of the ruble.”

Price noted that the government is preventing Russians and others from selling rubles “precisely to establish this floor and ensuring that the value we see reflected on the market isn't actually the actual worth of the ruble today.”

“When it comes to the Russian economy, 30 years of economic integration have been undone in the past five weeks alone,” Price said.",https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-04-3-22/h_a8cb60b58ccfcaeb1ebc19ab406b5404

Blinken says US supporting Ukraine to increase pressure on Moscow

The United States wants to see the war in Ukraine “come to an end as quickly as possible” and is supporting Ukraine to increase pressure on Russia, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said.

“That’s exactly why we’re making sure that we’re doing everything we can to support Ukraine and to give them the assistance that they need to put pressure … on Russia,” Blinken said.

Blinken said he believed Ukraine can also win the war because “success” and victory is “holding on to the sovereignty and independence of their country”.

“The problem is it may take time, and in the meantime, tremendous death and destruction. But what is so powerful here is that the Ukrainians have made it very clear that they will not subjugate themselves to Vladimir Putin’s will.”

Mariupol’s mayor has accused Russia of attempting to cover up what he said was the killing of possibly “tens of thousands of civilians” in the city by using mobile crematoriums to burn corpses.

“One week ago, cautious estimates put the death toll at 5,000. But given the size of the city, catastrophic destruction, the duration of the blockade and fierce resistance, tens of thousands of civilians from Mariupol could have fallen victim to the occupiers,” Vadym Boychenko said in a post on Telegram.

“The world has not seen the scale of the tragedy in Mariupol since the Nazi concentration camps,” Boychenko said, accusing Russia of turning the city into a “death camp”.

Russia and Ukraine are the world’s largest wheat producers. The disruption of exports from Ukraine is likely to drive grain prices up, benefitting Russian farmers.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is the culmination of its increasingly militarized foreign policy centered around a small cast of decision-makers primarily in the military and security services close to the president. Its approach is aggressive, risk-tolerant, and deeply revisionist, spanning domains and leaning heavily on brutal tactics to achieve victory.

NATO is now forced to return to its original mission—to defend Europe against an aggressive and highly militarized Russian foreign policy. NATO-Russia relations relatively normalized in the immediate post-Cold War context, resulting in waning European investments in defense capabilities. NATO only began reversing this trajectory in 2014, when Russia first invaded Ukraine, and must now significantly speed up its efforts.

Key priorities include transitioning from forward deterrence to forward defense, augmenting NATO’s capabilities in Europe and creating a greater role for Europe, strengthening regional partnerships, reestablishing risk-reduction mechanisms to manage a potential escalation between NATO and Russia, and considering long-term stabilization scenarios.

Introduction

Over the past seven decades of NATO’s history, Russia has gone from the center of NATO strategy to the periphery, and back again. With Russia’s war in Ukraine, NATO must return to its original mission: defending its member states in Europe against a Russian adversary. In grand strategic terms, Russia and its relationship with NATO will remain highly consequential. But relations will become much more volatile as the war in Ukraine continues and Russia persists in its efforts to destabilize Euro-Atlantic security.

Allies preparing for the upcoming summit in Madrid and a new Strategic Concept must fundamentally rethink the security situation in Europe. This includes addressing shortfalls in capabilities and repositioning NATO along the eastern flank, while preventing escalation between NATO and Russia. At the same time, NATO must reconcile competing demands, especially those facing its largest member, the United States, which will continue to focus heavily on the challenge posed by China.

The question of how NATO deals with an aggressive, escalatory Russia alongside other competing demands is not new. Allies always had to adjust to the reality of having the United States as a lead power with commitments across multiple theaters. But this question is now more urgent as it interacts with the increasingly aggressive trajectory of Russian and Chinese foreign policy. Russia is the more immediate challenge and will therefore require the most significant attention in NATO’s short term. This must be reflected in the Strategic Concept.

How should NATO respond to Russia’s threat in Europe? This brief examines the development of Russian foreign and security policy with the Ukraine war as an inflection point and suggests a concrete action plan for NATO over the next five years. It addresses what kind of threat Russia poses to NATO specifically and what type of posture, policies, and capacities are needed to counter the threat and meet potential escalation risks. The militarization of Russian foreign policy will continue beyond the war in Ukraine. NATO’s mission has never been more relevant.

The Militarization of Russian Foreign Policy

The war in Ukraine is the consequence and culmination of a longer-term trend in Vladimir Putin’s Russia: the militarization and securitization of its foreign policy. This is evident in Russia’s ever-increasing militarized and aggressive approach that enabled it to play a major role in conflicts around the world in the last decade, such as Syria. But the war in Ukraine demonstrates the extent to which the military, security services, and defense ministry took control of Russian foreign policy making at the behest of the Russian president, completely sidelining more traditional institutions, such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Those institutions were already weakened over the past decade with the increasing dominance of the siloviki [strongmen] in Russian foreign policy making. But the irrelevance of the traditional institutions reached new heights and became glaringly visible to the outside world during the Ukraine war, revealing an even more centralized decision-making in foreign and security policy than previously assumed.

The basis for Russia’s militarized foreign policy has been a continuous process of modernization of its armed forces, which rocketed after its successful but militarily weak campaign in Georgia in 2008. Since then, Russia has invested around $159 billion per year (based on purchasing power parity) in preparedness, equipment, and mobility for its military. The Russian military doctrine from 2014 reflects this development and the offensive nature of Russia’s understanding of warfare, which seeks to “decisively engage and resolve conflicts on terms favorable to Russia.” The most important development in Russia’s military thinking after the war in Georgia—as well as Moscow’s increased obsession with color revolutions—is the widening of the concept of conflict to include non-military means, such as cyber, and political tools, emphasizing the information environment. As such, Russia’s approach grew across domains, and it placed a larger emphasis on non-military and asymmetric tools of warfare. Russia’s campaigns in Syria, Crimea, and eastern Ukraine are examples of this “cross-domain coercion” and warfare. However, in Ukraine today, Russia continues to lean heavily and foremost on brutal conventional tactics and kinetic means, while still trying to fight across the information, political, and cyber domains, albeit unsuccessfully.

Russia has also developed and/or deployed several new weapons systems after their initial announcement in March 2018, such as the Avangard nuclear-capable hypersonic glide vehicle, the Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile, the air-launched ballistic missile Kinzhal, the long-range, nuclear-powered underwater drone Poseidon, and the heavy intercontinental ballistic missile Sarmat. The strategic stability talks in July 2021 were designed to regulate some of these systems, but these efforts ended with Russia’s invasion. In addition, Russia’s non-strategic nuclear weapons arsenal is concerning particularly to NATO, as its reading of Russian strategy suggests that Moscow believes these capabilities can be deployed in conventional contexts to precipitate the end of a conflict—a scenario many observers of the war in Ukraine are worried about.

A document crucial to understanding Russia’s integrated conventional-nuclear approach is the Basic Principles of State Policy on Nuclear Deterrence from June 2020, the counterpart to the US Nuclear Posture Review. The June 2020 document states that Russia’s nuclear forces are exclusively defensive and will only be used for deterrence purposes. However, it leaves ambiguity for the use in conventional contexts. In cases where the existence of the state is threatened from an outside “aggression,” the use of nuclear weapons could be considered. Another provision states that “nuclear deterrence should prevent the escalation of hostilities and allow their termination on conditions acceptable to Russia and its allies,” again reinforcing Western concerns about Russia’s willingness to employ tactical weapons to de-escalate conflict. This has sparked debate about a Russian “escalate to de-escalate” strategy, which would use Russian nuclear forces not only for deterrence, but also to coerce de-escalation by threatening to escalate to nuclear use. The worrisome nuclear signaling by Moscow in the first week of the Ukraine war underscored these concerns and demonstrated that Russia’s nuclear forces—and the threat of their use—are a fundamental element in Russia’s militarized foreign policy.

Russia’s National Security Strategy, released in July 2021, presented a step further in an increasingly adversarial stance toward Europe and the United States, compared to the previous strategy from 2015. It also demonstrated the dominance of the military and security establishment in foreign policy thinking. The strategy lays out a worldview which perceives Russia as threatened externally and internally by the West. For Moscow, the internal threat is evidenced by color revolutions and Western “ideology” in contrast to traditional Russian values. Externally, the Kremlin asserts an allegedly menacing Western military posture. Therefore, becoming a self-sufficient power and securing the information space plays a prominent role in the strategy. The way Russia conducts its war in Ukraine and its failures reflect the thinking behind this strategy.

Putin’s speeches recognizing the so-called people’s republics of Donetsk and Luhansk and declaring war against Ukraine are the latest verbalized evidence of the military takeover of Russian foreign policy, commanded by a centralized system of decision-making for the purpose of restoring Russia’s control over Ukraine and thereby allegedly its historical greatness. The speech was a turning point in Western thinking about Russia’s foreign policy aims. Whereas the draft agreements provided by Moscow still convinced some observers that Russia’s aims in Ukraine are limited to foreign and security policy goals, such as Ukraine’s non-NATO membership, the speech confirmed that Putin’s thinking about Ukraine—and thus Russian foreign policy—is rooted in a deep revanchism and ideological understanding of Russians and Ukrainians as one people, denying Ukraine the right to exist as a nation-state. Russia’s foreign policy has thus not only been overtaken by the military, but the military is also a priority instrument to achieve broader political and ideological goals.

The war in Ukraine and the full militarization of Russian foreign policy is an entirely new category of challenge for NATO in the post-Cold War era. It suggests that Russia is on war footing with not only Ukraine and the European security order, but with the Euro-Atlantic partners. It also understands war as encompassing geopolitical, economic, information, and military warfare. Even more, Russia’s leadership is willing to sacrifice the state’s stability and foundation for the pretext that Russia is allegedly threatened and must defend itself through aggression against other sovereign states. Russia’s military is not as proficient as NATO forces. But Russia’s approach of integrating nuclear threats to coerce and compel rather than to deter, together with an increasingly indiscriminate way of warfighting in its conventional warfare, presents NATO with new conceptual challenges for thinking about the Russian military threat.

Returning to its core mission of defending Europe as it did during the Cold War is to some extent well-known terrain for NATO. But today’s Russia is not the same adversary as the Soviet Union. While drawing upon lessons from the history of NATO-Russia relations, NATO must understand that this is a new era with a new opponent and a new set of goals. This will require looking back, but also creatively thinking ahead to address this challenge.

NATO-Russia Relations in Perspective

The alliance’s raison d’être is collective defense and that has always been, at least in large part, about Russia. This started with the alliance’s founding purpose, which was to protect Western European nations from the Soviet threat. Throughout the Cold War, the Soviet challenge remained a catalyzing feature of relations between Western Europe and the United States.

In the immediate post-Cold War context, US and alliance engagement with Russia was ambivalent. NATO looked for a new purpose as Russia emerged from the Soviet period. Russia no longer seemed like the challenge it once was, with President Boris Yeltsin signaling that Russia might one day join the alliance. Even short of that, things were fundamentally different. Conversations at NATO, albeit difficult, were about how to establish a new relationship with Russia and incorporate it into partnership structures, not necessarily how to deter it. As NATO reassessed its role in the post-Cold War era, Russia-NATO relations aimed at normalization. This included the NATO-Russia Founding Act in 1997, which would draw the contours of NATO-Russia cooperation among former adversaries.

While relations with Russia were no longer adversarial in the strict sense, there were tense moments early on. This was particularly true around NATO enlargement and engagement in the Balkans. 1999 was a pivotal year with three significant events: the NATO intervention in Kosovo, admission of the first wave of new alliance members, and Yeltsin’s exit from the Russian presidency, to be replaced by Vladimir Putin.

Putin emerged as a far more vigorous critic of NATO. A year and a half after taking office, Putin made it clear he no longer saw the need for NATO, arguing that Russia should either join NATO, effectively giving Russia veto power due to NATO’s consensus-based decision-making model, or NATO should be disbanded.

Even against this more contentious backdrop, the early Putin years saw an upgrade of the Permanent Joint Council (created by the NATO-Russia Founding Act) to the NATO-Russia Council (NRC) in 2002. At the NRC, consultations and cooperation focused on risk reduction, including arms control and crisis management, as well as counterterrorism and missile defense. Here, NATO also worked with Moscow on Afghanistan, which facilitated NATO’s most significant supply route during the initial International Security Assistance Force mission that ran through Russia. But on other issues like theater missile defense, relations hit another rough patch. In 2001, in order to reportedly deploy systems to defend against Iranian missiles, President George W. Bush announced the United States would withdraw from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. While unhappy with the move, Putin initially suggested this decision posed no threat to Russia as Russian missiles could overcome any subsequent defense systems deployed by NATO. But over time, Putin increasingly decried the missile defense project as anti-Russian in nature.

Meanwhile, Putin’s own suspicion grew as color revolutions swept through various post-Soviet states. The liberalization and Western integration of former Warsaw Pact countries was unpleasant for Moscow, but popular uprisings challenging unfair elections and the oligarchy in places like Ukraine and Georgia hit close to home. These developments had nothing directly to do with NATO, but given that Georgia and Ukraine were both actively and adamantly pursuing NATO membership, it married with an overarching narrative of Euro-Atlantic overreach. Considered by Moscow as a part of a sphere of privileged interests, anything that would move the two closer to NATO’s orbit challenged Moscow’s own foreign policy vision and regional hegemonic ambitions.

Over time, Putin’s public antagonism toward NATO only increased, which often correlated with dynamics in US-Russia relations. This culminated in 2007 when President Putin delivered remarks at the Munich Security conference deriding what he saw as a tendency to substitute NATO for the UN and calling NATO enlargement a provocation. He also claimed that by strengthening anti-missile defenses, the United States was making it possible that the “threat from our [Russia’s] nuclear forces will be completely neutralized…the balance of powers will be absolutely destroyed and one of the parties will benefit from the feeling of complete security.”

From there on, a cascade of events further soured NATO-Russia relations. Events like the 2007 cyberattack against Estonia and the Russo-Georgian war a year later fueled broader concerns about Russian foreign policy and NATO-Russia relations, and NATO’s intervention in Libya alarmed Moscow. Things drastically worsened in 2014 when Russia invaded Ukraine—the annexation of Crimea took NATO-Russia discord to new post-Cold War heights. Russia’s interference in various electoral processes, alongside assassination attempts in NATO members states like the United Kingdom and Germany, damaged relations. For NATO, Russia’s actions made clear its willingness to employ a range of political and military tactics to undermine NATO members and partners, and in the case of Ukraine, change borders by force.

The annexation of Crimea drove allies toward strengthening deterrence and adding capacity for territorial defense in the Baltics and elsewhere. Enhancing readiness initiatives, increasing defense spending, and rethinking the necessary capabilities to effectively deter Russia became core tenets of NATO’s Russia policy and NATO’s purpose. The focus was once again on Russia and collective defense, but in a more limited sense. Today, Putin’s expanded invasion of Ukraine—and the brazened aims and tools of Russia’s militarized foreign policy—demonstrate how broad-reaching Russia’s challenge to NATO is and how NATO’s strategy and posture toward Moscow must change.

Just before the outset of the war, Russia’s ultimatums to NATO would require NATO to reset its posture—rotational or permanent—to 1997, alongside the demand that NATO close its open-door policy. These demands demonstrate how incongruent NATO and Russia views of Euro-Atlantic security are today. It also shows how emboldened Putin is to offer such a maximalist position.

Russia’s actions in and around Ukraine confirm that Putin has abandoned all notional attachment to the principles that have governed the Euro-Atlantic security order, from the Helsinki Final Act to the Budapest Memorandum. A unilateral disarming of NATO is the opposite of what the current security environment demands. And it is also the opposite of what NATO is doing. In the wake of Russia’s invasion, several NATO members—including France, Germany, and the United States—are adding additional military personnel and equipment to NATO states nearest Russia, through additional deployments or by bolstering efforts through vehicles like the Enhanced Forward Presence. This will also include new battlegroups in southeastern Europe. NATO has also deployed components of the NATO Response Force, including the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force.

As Putin tries to assert a new chapter of Russian foreign policy and revise the post-Cold War reality, efforts within NATO to deter Russia and defend NATO territory will remain central. At some point, so will finding ways to decrease tensions, if possible. But it is increasingly difficult as the space for trust and dialogue, already minimal before Russia’s most recent intervention in Ukraine, is all but gone.

For allies, it is important to understand Russia’s motivations and find ways to de-escalate. This is challenging because Putin’s logic is clearly driven by a multitude of overlapping and expanding concentric circles of perceived interests. To start, Russia’s challenge to NATO’s open door is motivated by Russia’s belief that it has a privileged claim to and interest in the region. As already discussed, Putin’s speech justifying the need to recognize the independence of Luhansk and Donetsk exposed how deep-seated this sentiment is, to the point of suggesting that Ukraine lacks sovereignty, a suggestion echoed by other Russian officials. Accompanying such sentiment is the will to use military force to impose quick de facto realities, which it is trying to do in Ukraine. This creates difficult questions for the future of NATO’s open-door policy and engagement in the region. It also raises significant questions for those in Europe that are not currently part of the alliance.

Beyond the open door, allies along Eastern Europe perceive these attempted revisions by Putin as threatening to their own security, particularly for those who are seen as part of the category of former socialist republics, but also any members of the Warsaw Pact. Putin continually recalls 1997. Rather than drawing down forces in these places most threatened, Putin’s aims have catalyzed additional NATO presence as an immediate reaction.

But where does NATO go from here? Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the absence of any trust is the defining element of NATO-Russia relations. Defense and deterrence are of primary importance, and NATO will need to frame the threat posed by Russia for its new Strategic Concept in Madrid.

An Action Plan to Meet NATO’s Russia Threat

The war in Ukraine has changed NATO’s understanding of Russia’s priorities, risk tolerance, and ultimate foreign policy aims. This forces NATO to not only return to its core mission—the defense of Europe—but also to adapt its posture accordingly as quickly and sustainably as possible. The militarization of Russian foreign policy and its revisionist aims in Ukraine will prompt NATO to transition its existing strategy of forward deterrence in Eastern Europe to forward defense. NATO must also take seriously Russia’s use of nuclear coercion and ensure the efficacy of NATO nuclear policy and capabilities. In the short term, NATO will be required to resolutely and carefully handle any escalatory risks emanating from the war in Ukraine for European security broadly.

NATO should hold fast to key areas of risk reduction where possible and think about long-term avenues to enhance stability. But allies should have no illusion about the likelihood of these scenarios unfolding under Putin. NATO-Russia relations will be defined by confrontation for the foreseeable future. The following action plan should guide NATO policy in the next five years.",https://www.gmfus.org/news/nato-and-russia-after-invasion-ukraine

The images over the weekend from the Ukrainian suburb of Bucha outside Kyiv — bound and battered bodies strewn in the streets, bags of corpses lining muddy trenches, limbs protruding from mass gravesites — have produced perhaps the most profound moment of “moral outrage” among the international community since the start of Russia’s bloody invasion.

But do the atrocities — uncovered amid Russian forces’ retreat from northern Ukraine — constitute genocide? It depends on who you ask.

Ukrainian President VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY has been unequivocal. “Indeed, this is genocide, the elimination of the whole nation and the people,” he told CBS News’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday. Kyiv Mayor VITALI KLITSCHKO concurred, telling German newspaper Bild that “what happened in Bucha and other suburbs of Kyiv can only be described as genocide.”

In interviews Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” however, both Secretary of State ANTONY BLINKEN and NATO Secretary General JENS STOLTENBERG declined to use that term. Blinken pledged that U.S. officials “will look hard, document everything we see” and “put it all together” for the “relevant institutions and organizations.” Stoltenberg said only that the massacre was “a brutality against civilians we haven’t seen in Europe for decades.”

President JOE BIDEN weighed in Monday, telling reporters that “what is happening in Bucha is outrageous,” and calling Russian President VLADIMIR PUTIN “brutal” and “a war criminal.” But pressed on whether he agreed with Zelenskyy’s assessment of genocide, Biden replied: “No, I think it is a war crime.”

National security adviser JAKE SULLIVAN also addressed the distinction at the White House news briefing Monday: “This is something we of course continue to monitor every day. Based on what we have seen so far, we have seen atrocities. We have seen war crimes. We have not yet seen a level of systematic deprivation of life of the Ukrainian people to rise to the level of genocide.”

The semantic debate between Ukraine and the West is reminiscent of other dust-ups in recent months over what kind of language to use with regard to Russia’s aggression. Zelenskyy’s government memorably broke with the Biden administration in the days before Moscow’s declaration of a “special operation” on the White House broadcasting that a Russian invasion was “imminent.” On the other hand, Biden has been slower than some of his fellow world leaders to accuse Russia of war crimes.

On the genocide question, though, it’s Zelenskyy who’s in the right, according to GREGORY STANTON, the founding president and chair of Genocide Watch. “My view is that these are crimes of genocide, as well as war crimes and crimes against humanity,” he said.

While war crimes and crimes against humanity refer to prosecutable crimes by individuals that are covered by the Geneva Conventions, genocide is typically a group crime — one that can be committed by a state against its own people or the people of another state, Stanton explained. In this case, he said, the invading Russian forces “have the intent to destroy, in part, a national group, and that’s the Ukrainian group.”

ALEXANDER HINTON, director of the Center for the Study of Genocide and Human Rights at Rutgers University, has a different view. While it’s apparent that Russia is committing war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine, he said, it’s not exactly provable that genocide is taking place there — although such a possibility remains a “very real threat.”

The legal definition of genocide is the intent to destroy one of four types of protected groups — ethnic, national, racial or religious — “because of who they are,” Hinton said. Perpetrators of genocide “want to destroy a people as opposed to defeat an army,” and they operate with “an intent and a systematicity.”

Putin’s past statements about seeking to denazify Ukraine, for example, represent statements of intent, he said. But it’s unclear whether those sentiments have trickled down through the ranks, and “we don’t have the evidence yet” of a systematized, genocidal campaign in Ukraine.

So, apart from good-faith disagreements on technical definitions, how should natsec observers interpret the Biden administration’s reluctance to label the barbarity in Bucha as genocide? One reason for U.S. officials’ hesitation is that the word is “sort of a legal term” and “considered by lawyers to be their property,” Stanton said. But more importantly, he continued, “genocide is a powerful word,” and a declaration of genocide “places upon a nation greater duties” than a declaration of war crimes or crimes against humanity. “When you use the word, it has consequences.”

Indeed, the U.S. has historically been resistant to designate genocides; only two weeks ago did the Biden administration formally determine that Myanmar's military committed genocide and crimes against humanity against the country’s minority Rohingya population in 2016 and 2017.

Hinton said that although the use of the term genocide is “starting to bubble up” outside Ukraine, it’s still a crime under international law — and one with “moral connotations” that “suggest you need to take a stronger form of action.” He added: “I think in this case … there’s a high risk of genocide. There’s a possibility that it’s begun. But it’s not really possible at this point to say for sure it has.”

SITUATION REPORT: We will only cite official sources. As always, take all figures, assessments and statements with a healthy dose of skepticism.

War in Ukraine:

— Since the war began on Feb. 24, Russia has lost roughly 18,300 personnel; 647 tanks; 1,844 armored combat vehicles; 330 artillery systems; 107 multiple-launch rocket systems; 147 warplanes; 134 helicopters; seven ships; and 92 drones. (Ukrainian Ministry of Defense)

— “The Russian occupiers were defeated near Kyiv. Ukrainian defenders won the first battle for the capital. Kyiv region was liberated from the enemy. [Russian forces are] also retreating in Chernihiv and Sumy regions to regroup forces and change the direction of strikes.” (Ukrainian Ministry of Defense)

— “Heavy fighting now continues in Kharkiv, Luhansk and Donetsk regions. Our troops are pushing back the occupiers in the Kherson region. Chernihiv remains in a difficult situation. The defenders of Mariupol, who have already become legends of today, are fighting heroically.” (Ukrainian Ministry of Defense)

Global Response:

— Austria: Finance Minister MAGNUS BRUNNER ruled out any European sanctions targeting Russian oil and gas, saying “you have to stay cool” despite the “extremely horrible” reports of war crimes around Kyiv.

— France: President EMMANUEL MACRON called for new sanctions against Russia, “especially on coal and oil,” to respond to the atrocities in Bucha.

— Germany: Economy Minister ROBERT HABECK announced that the German subsidiary of the Russian gas company Gazprom will be put under trusteeship with immediate effect.

— Lithuania: Foreign Affairs Minister GABRIELIUS LANDSBERGIS said Russia’s ambassador was asked to leave the country, and that Lithuania’s ambassador to Ukraine is returning to Kyiv.

— U.S.: Federal agents aided by Spain’s Civil Guard seized a megayacht owned by VIKTOR VEKSELBERG, an oligarch with close ties to the Kremlin.

PUTIN’S PALS WIN REELECTION: Russian President VLADIMIR PUTIN’s two closest regional allies amid the invasion of Ukraine, Hungarian Prime Minister VIKTOR ORBÁN and Serbian President ALEKSANDAR VUČIĆ, coasted to reelection over the weekend after pledging during their campaigns to remain out of the war, per Bloomberg’s MARTON KASNYIK, VERONIKA GULYAS and MISHA SAVIC.

Orbán, who’s already ruled for 12 years and is Europe’s longest-serving head of government, won a fourth consecutive term. Vučić won another five years as president, and his ruling Serbian Progressive Party appears positioned to form a majority-backed government. Putin congratulated them both.

A day before Hungary’s election, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy described Orbán as “virtually the only one in Europe to openly support” Putin. After the vote, Orbán said his “huge victory” was “visible even from the Moon, but certainly from Brussels.”

In Serbia, Vučić has declined to join Europe’s sanctions against Russia. He said Sunday that “the most important” for his country “is to have good relations in the region and to continue on its European path, without ruining its ties with traditional friends.”

RUSSIA DRAFTS UNTRAINED FIGHTERS IN DONBAS: In the Donbas region of Ukraine, held by Moscow-backed separatists, Russia has drafted civilians to battle Ukrainian forces despite providing “no training, little food and water, and inadequate weapons” to the conscripts, per Reuters.

Several Donbas conscripts “have been issued with a rifle called a Mosin, which was developed in the late 19th century and went out of production decades ago,” Reuters reports, and a student conscript described having to “drink water from a fetid pond because of lack of supplies.”

In addition, some of the conscripts “were given the highly dangerous mission of drawing enemy fire onto themselves so other units could identify the Ukrainian positions and bomb them.” Roughly 135 conscripts reportedly laid down their arms after being pushed to the war’s front line near the port of Mariupol, and military commanders kept them in a basement as punishment.

Flashpoints

FIRST IN NATSEC DAILY — POSSIBLE TERRORISTS AT SOUTHERN BORDER: Two Turkish men with links to ISIS are trying to travel from Mexico to the United States, according to an intelligence product distributed by a regional intelligence-sharing hub based in El Paso, Texas.

The product, which was read to POLITICO, is titled, “BOLO - ISIS Terrorists Possible Attempt to Enter the United States.” It’s dated April 1, and says the two men are traveling from Cancún to Ciudad Juárez. From there, they plan to enter the U.S. through El Paso. The bulletin did not detail the nature of the intelligence nor specify how they may plan to enter the U.S. A fusion center headquartered in El Paso distributed the intelligence product to its law enforcement partners. Fusion centers are regional hubs for intelligence-sharing. They work with federal law enforcement officials but are controlled by state and local law enforcement.

Attempts by terrorists to enter the U.S. via the southern border are rare but not unheard of. Axios reported in March 2021 that Customs and Border Protection officials had arrested four people at the southern border since October 2020 who were on the FBI’s Terrorist Screening Database. A CBP spokesperson told Voice of America that encounters with known and suspected terrorists at U.S. borders “are very uncommon.”

News of El Paso’s ISIS-related concerns come as Republicans have targeted the Biden administration over border security. The Biden administration is slowly rescinding a Trump-era policy — known as Title 42 — that let law enforcement officials quickly expel most migrants from the U.S. because of the coronavirus pandemic. Because of that change, the Department of Homeland Security says it is bracing for “a potential increase in the number of border encounters.”

HONG KONG LEADER WON’T SEEK SECOND TERM: CARRIE LAM, Hong Kong’s fourth chief executive, announced Monday that she won’t pursue a second term, per The Associated Press’ ZEN SOO and VINCENT YU. Her successor is set to be picked in an election on May 8.

“I will complete my five-year term as chief executive on the 30th of June this year, and I will also call an end to my 42 years of public service,” Lam said at a news conference, adding that her decision was met with “respect and understanding” by the Chinese government when it was conveyed last year.

As the AP notes, Lam “presided over a period in which Beijing firmly established control over the former British colony that was returned to China in 1997.” Lam’s popularity sharply declined during her tenure, which saw “huge protests calling for her resignation, a security crackdown that has quashed dissent and most recently a COVID-19 wave that overwhelmed the health system.”

Chief Secretary for Administration JOHN LEE, the city’s second-ranking leader, is likely to enter the race to succeed Lam, according to Hong Kong media. Lee previously served as secretary of security, taking a tough stance against demonstrators during Hong Kong’s 2019 protests.

POLITICAL TURMOIL IN PAKISTAN: Pakistan’s Supreme Court adjourned Monday after hearing a challenge to Prime Minister IMRAN KHAN’s machinations to stay in power, and it plans to pick the case back up Tuesday, per The New York Times’ CHRISTINA GOLDBAUM, SALMAN MASOOD and ZIA UR-REHMAN.

Khan declared the National Assembly dissolved Sunday when his allies blocked a no-confidence vote that he was likely to lose, prompting opposition leaders to bring the case to the court. Khan repeated his accusation Sunday that the U.S. government was acting in coordination with the opposition to oust him from office.



Keystrokes

UKRAINE WARNS AGAINST ‘ARMAGEDDON’ GROUP: The Ukrainian Computer Emergency Response Team warned Monday that a group Ukrainian authorities have previously attributed to Russia is targeting government agencies in Kyiv with malicious emails amid a steady increase of cyberattacks, reports our own MAGGIE MILLER.

According to UA-CERT, the effort involved a group known as UAC-0010, or Armageddon, sending emails with malicious links to government agencies masquerading as containing information on Russian war criminals. The Ukrainian Security Service last year attributed Armageddon to Russian intelligence efforts.

The effort is the latest in a string of Russian-linked cyberattacks against Ukrainian government agencies and critical infrastructure since the invasion began. These have included distributed denial of service attacks that temporarily took down Ukrainian government websites, with one attributed by the Biden administration to Russia in February. Ukrainian authorities announced last month that over 3,000 DDoS attacks had been directed against the nation since mid-February.

Last week, Ukrainian authorities confirmed that a “massive cyberattack” was launched against state-run telecommunications provider Ukrtelecom, with the confirmation coming days after The Washington Post reported that Russia was behind a cyberattack on satellite provider Viasat in February, which disrupted Ukrainian military communications. The stepped-up efforts prompted YURII SHCHYHOL, the chair of the Ukrainian cyber agency, to declare last week that “cyberwar is underway” during a press briefing.

The Ukrainian State Service of Special Communications said in a statement Monday that in the last week there has been an “increase in the number of cyberattacks on state information resources and objects of critical information infrastructure in Ukraine,” with a top Ukrainian official scheduled to brief the press Tuesday morning on the latest intelligence.



The Complex

INDO-PACOM’S $1.5 BILLION WISHLIST: U.S. Indo-Pacific Command has outlined over $1.5 billion in needs that weren’t included in the fiscal 2023 budget request, reports our own CONNOR O’BRIEN (for Pros!) The unfunded requirements list is one of several furnished to lawmakers by the military services and combatant commands as they weigh the Biden administration's budget request.

The list includes $643 million in operations and maintenance efforts. Another $496 million would go toward procurement and $322 million to research and development programs. The command also outlines just over $47 million in unfunded construction projects.

The Pacific region is a priority for the Pentagon and Congress as the U.S. looks to boost its presence to deter China — the “pacing threat” to U.S. national security. Indo-Pacom separately sent lawmakers a five-year, $76 billion plan to fund an array of missile defense systems, long-range precision weapons and new and upgraded airfields across the region.



On The Hill

ON RUSSIA, IT’S HOUSE VS. SENATE: House Democrats are growing frustrated with their Senate counterparts over the upper chamber’s continued stalling on overwhelmingly bipartisan legislation to suspend normal trade relations with Russia. The House cleared the bill with a whopping 424 votes last month, but the Senate has been unable to come to an agreement for a quick vote. It takes consent from all 100 senators to speed up floor consideration, and Majority Leader CHUCK SCHUMER doesn’t have time to jump through all of the necessary procedural hoops given the Supreme Court nomination votes this week.

“Nearly a month has passed since the House voted to ban the import of Russian energy products, and nearly three weeks have gone by since our chamber approved the suspension of normal trade relations with Russia and Belarus,” House Ways and Means Chair RICHARD NEAL (D-Mass.) said in a statement. “The Senate must consider and pass this legislation before breaking for recess at the end of the week.”

WHERE THINGS STAND… It’s complicated. Senate leaders bowed to pressure from Sen. RAND PAUL (R-Ky.) to change the underlying bill’s language related to Magnitsky Act sanctions for human rights abusers, and other senators have since piled on with their own demands. One of those is the establishment of a World War II-style lend-lease program for Ukraine, as our own ANDREW DESIDERIO detailed. Sen. JOHN CORNYN (R-Texas) is pushing for a lend-lease provision to be added to the legislation, pointing to broad bipartisan support and a recognition by lawmakers in both parties that the U.S. will need to be in the Ukraine fight for the long-haul.

BARDUFOSS, Norway, April 4 (Reuters) - The sound of gunfire echoed around the Norwegian fjords as a row of Swedish and Finnish soldiers, positioned prone behind banks of snow, trained rifles and missile launchers on nearby hills ready for an enemy attack.

The drill, in March, was the first time forces from Finland and Sweden have formed a combined brigade in a scheduled NATO exercise in Arctic Norway known as ""Cold Response."" Neither country is a member of the NATO alliance. The exercise was long planned, but Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 added intensity to the war game.

""We would be rather naive not to recognise that there is a threat,"" Swedish Major Stefan Nordstrom told Reuters. ""The security situation in the whole of Europe has changed and we have to accept that, and we have to adapt.""

That sense of threat means President Vladimir Putin, who embarked on what he calls a ""special operation"" in Ukraine partly to counter the expansion of the NATO alliance, may soon have a new NATO neighbour.

Finland has a 1,300 km (810 mile) border with Russia. In a March 28 phone call, the country's President Sauli Niinisto asked NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg for details on principles and steps for accepting new members, he wrote on Facebook. Finland's leaders have discussed possible membership with ""almost all"" NATO's 30 members, and will submit a review to parliament by mid-April, Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto told Reuters.

Sweden – home of the founder of the Nobel Peace Prize and a country which has not fought in a war since 1814 – is more hesitant. But a recent opinion poll for a major Swedish TV station found 59% of Swedes wanted to join NATO, if Finland does.

For some in the alliance, the two countries sandwiched between Russia and NATO-member Norway are already partners. U.S. General David Berger, who is the commandant of the U.S. Marines Corps, told reporters at the drill that – putting the politics of membership aside – they were brothers-in-arms during training.

""For marines, at the tactical level ... there's no difference,"" Berger said. ""I just have to know that the unit over there, they have my back. They've got me covered.""

Stoltenberg announced in early March that NATO was now sharing all information on the war in Ukraine with Sweden and Finland. Both countries regularly attend NATO meetings. At the exercises in Norway, Stoltenberg said ""no other countries in the world"" are closer partners.

But he noted an important difference: ""The absolute security guarantees that we provide for NATO allies, are only for NATO allies.""

As non-members, Finland and Sweden's combined population of 16 million don't have the protection of NATO's guarantee that an attack on one ally is an attack on all.

Moscow did not respond to a request for comment for this story. It has repeatedly warned both countries against joining NATO. On March 12, the Russian foreign ministry said ""there will be serious military and political consequences"" if they do, according to Russian news agency Interfax.

Stoltenberg has said it would be possible to allow Finland and Sweden in ""quite quickly."" NATO has not commented on what a fast-track process would be; a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Defense said any decision would be taken by the countries themselves but their accession would need to be agreed by all 30 allies.

""President Putin wants less NATO on Russia's borders,"" Stoltenberg said in January, also referring to more allied troops in southeastern Europe, Poland and the Baltics. ""But he is getting more NATO.""

MEMORIES OF WAR

More than 1,000 km to the southeast of the NATO drill, 80-year-old Markku Kuusela knows real war. The pensioner, who lives in Imatra, a town on Finland's border with Russia, was evacuated to Sweden with his brother as an infant after his father was killed fighting a Russian invasion.

They returned to Finland only after the war was over.

""It is always in the back of my mind,"" said Kuusela, visiting the cemetery where his father is buried. Tears welled in his eyes. ""How it would have been to have a father.""

Some 96,000 Finns, or 2.5% of the population, died fighting the Russian invasion, in two wars between 1939 and 1944. A total of 55,000 children lost fathers and over 400,000 people lost homes as territory was conceded.

But the Finns, fighting under cover of dense forest, repelled the Russians and ever since, Finland has had a clear goal: strong defence and friendly relations with Russia.

The country built a conscript army – it has about 900,000 men and women in reserves – and according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, one of the largest artilleries in Europe.

For years, Finns and Russians have interacted extensively. This year, Imatra was planning to celebrate a 250-year history of Finnish tourism since a visit by Catherine the Great, the Russian empress, in 1772.

Now the Imatra border station is deserted, its stalls unused. Finland's security service, known as Supo, says Russia's military resources are currently focused on Ukraine and its own domestic operations, but warns the situation may change quickly.

The Ukraine invasion triggered almost 3,000 applications from Finns to join local associations of reservists as well as almost 1,000 to women's emergency preparedness groups, the groups said.

One applicant was Pia Lumme, a 48-year-old coordinator for the Finnish National Agency for Education who lives near Imatra. She recalled her grandmother's war memories.

""I think we Finns all share ... the will to uphold this country,"" Lumme said.

Finland is one of few European countries to maintain a national emergency supply of fuel, food and medicine. Building emergency shelters beneath every major building has been mandatory since World War Two. The country says its 54,000 shelters have room for 4.4 million of the 5.5 million population.

Finns' backing for joining NATO has risen to record numbers over the past month, with the latest poll by public broadcaster Yle showing 62% of respondents in favour and only 16% against.

Supo, the security service, said on March 29 Finland must guard against potential Russian retaliation to Helsinki's discussions on joining NATO, or interference in the public debate.

""We don't need to make any quick decisions on our own defence, but certainly a possible membership application could lead to making us a target of interference or hybrid actions,"" Haavisto told Reuters in an interview. ""Finland needs to prepare for that and also listen to how NATO countries would react.""

CRISIS KITS

Sweden, which has argued that non-alignment has served its people well, has been slower to see Russia as a threat – for example, it allowed defence spending to slip and emergency shelters to fall into disrepair after the Cold War. But the mood there is also changing.

After Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, the government speeded up rearmament and boosted military strength on the island of Gotland, near the headquarters of Russia's Baltic Fleet. It also reintroduced limited conscription that year.

Stockholm said earlier this month it would almost double defence spending to around 2% of GDP and is refurbishing a network of emergency bunkers, to shelter up to seven million people. It says there are currently around 65,000 shelters, mostly in private homes.

Around 71% of Swedes are worried about an increased military threat from Russia – up from 46% in January – according to a survey by pollsters Demoskop for daily Aftonbladet on March 2.

Three retail chains told Reuters sales of products to prepare for emergencies had accelerated again after picking up at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

""Sales of crisis kits, wind-up radios, water filters and water containers - pretty much everything - have increased,"" said Fredrik Stockhaus, founder of Criseq, a Swedish online store. Sweden's statistics office does not measure sales at this level of detail.

If either country does go for NATO membership, Finland looks set to move first, diplomats and politicians say. Foreign Minister Haavisto said he is in ""almost daily"" talks with his Swedish counterpart on the topic.

""It wouldn't be ideal for Finland to go alone, because then all the risks in the application process would be on Finland,"" said Matti Pesu, a foreign policy analyst at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs.

In Sweden, the government and opposition are conducting an analysis of security policy which is expected in May. Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson stressed on national TV on March 30 it was important to wait and see what conclusions that reaches. The ruling Social Democrats oppose joining, but four opposition parties support it.

Even so, Sweden's non-aligned status is increasingly blurred, said Anna Wieslander, Northern Europe Director at the Atlantic Council think-tank.

""If you look at it, we are preparing to meet the adversary together and I think there is no doubt in which camp we are,"" she said. ""You can see the warnings Russia has given so there is no doubt on their side as well.""

WASHINGTON -- The United States should look at the development of more bases in Eastern Europe to protect against Russian aggression, but rotate forces through them rather than make permanent deployments, the top U.S military officer told Congress on Tuesday.

Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the basing could be funded by other countries such as Poland and the Baltics that want more U.S. troops. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said any effort to expand security in Eastern Europe is a “work in progress” that probably will be discussed at the NATO summit in June.

Milley and Austin were testifying before the House Armed Services Committee on the 2023 budget proposal, but much of the focus of the hearing was the Russian war against Ukraine and what the U.S. can do to better help Ukraine and strengthen security across Europe.

Milley was asked about the need to reallocate forces to Europe's eastern flank, where NATO allies are worried that they may be Russia's next target.

“My advice would be to create permanent bases but don’t permanently station (forces), so you get the effect of permanence by rotational forces cycling through permanent bases,” he said. “I believe that a lot of our European allies, especially those such as the Baltics or Poland and Romania, and elsewhere — they’re very, very willing to establish permanent bases. They’ll build them, they’ll pay for them.”

Austin added that he recently visited and spoke with leaders in the Baltics, noting that they made it clear they value U.S. troops there. “We'll continue to work with NATO to assess what the requirements will be moving forward,” Austin said. “We will be part of that solution.”

The Pentagon is continuing to review its troop numbers across Europe, and whether to add more or shift some of those already there to other locations. Milley said Tuesday that while there are no decisions yet, there's a possibility, if not a probability"" of increase U.S. troops in Europe, and that need could be filled by rotational forces.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg announced last month that NATO is creating four new battlegroups, which usually number between 1,000 troops and 1,500 troops, to send to Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria. NATO allies are set to discuss additional security measures at the upcoming summit.

Milley has advocated using rotational forces more around the globe to defray the costs of permanently stationing troops and their families in allied countries at risk of war, such as South Korea and in the Persian Gulf. He said using this would eliminate some of the costs associated with schools, housing and other such services.

Rotational forces deploy for shorter periods of time. Permanent forces are often deployed for two years to three years.

Milley also agreed that Moscow's aggression in Ukraine, and its ongoing demands that the U.S. and NATO reduce troops and arms in European countries along Russia's borders, signal a lengthy conflict in the region that extends beyond Ukraine.

“I do think this is a very protracted conflict and I think it’s at least measured in years. I don’t know about decades, but at least years for sure,"" said Milley. ""I think that NATO, the United States, Ukraine and all of the allies and partners that are supporting Ukraine are going to be involved in this for quite some time.”

Austin added that the broad Russian demands were not acceptable to NATO, and the U.S. is looking at ways to provide additional aid and training to countries, including non-NATO allies such as Georgia and Finland.

Members of Congress pressed Austin and Milley on what could have stopped Russia from invading Ukraine, and that sanctions did not work as a deterrent.

Both said that the only possible way to deter Russian may have been to put U.S. troops on the ground inside Ukraine, but that option was rejected because it risked a broader U.S. war with Russia. Milley said he isn’t sure Russian President Vladimir Putin was deterrable since invading Ukraine has been a long-term goal for Moscow.

Milley and Austin also told the committee that the U.S. has learned a number of things as it has watched Russia struggle to fight against an unexpectedly fierce Ukrainian defense over the past month. They said Russia has significant military capabilities but has been unable to use them effectively.

Austin said Russian forces lack training among their noncommissioned officers and the Kremlin has been unable to get the supplies and logistics needed to ground troops

Austin said Ukraine has used Stinger and Javelin missiles effectively against Russian troops and weapons. Milley said that Ukraine’s junior officers, many trained by the U.S., have shown initiative and good command and control abilities.",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/top-general-urges-us-troops-eastern-europe-83887161
