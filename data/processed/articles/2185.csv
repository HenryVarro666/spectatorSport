Ukrainian forces kept hold of the capital city of Kyiv Saturday as a senior U.S. Defense official said there were signs the invading Russian forces were frustrated by fiercer-than-expected resistance.

Here's what to know now:

In a major shift, Germany announced it would join the list of countries sending military assistance to Ukraine — and said it was considering a ""targeted"" approach to disconnecting Russia from the SWIFT banking system.

The U.S. continues to see indications of viable Ukrainian resistance, a senior U.S. Defense Department official said Saturday. Moscow was particularly stymied by the fight Ukrainians have put up in the north around Kyiv and Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, the official said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has refused to leave the capital. Instead he has been posting videos from the streets, urging his people to join him in defiance.

As the Russian invasion into Ukraine continues, air raid sirens were sounded across the city of Lviv in western Ukraine. Air raid sirens were sounded in Kyiv on Thursday and shortly after that, Russian missiles began taking over the skies above Ukraine.

Now, with air raid sirens being sounded in Lviv, the possibility arises that Russia is not finished in Ukraine. More aerial attacks could also be inbound. The information was shared on Twitter by news organisation BNO News. Lviv is a city which is around 70 km away from the Polish-Ukrainian border.

On Thursday, news agency AFP stated that Russian forces took over Hostomel (Gostomel) airfield, a cargo airport near Kyiv, which is also known as Antonov airport.

However, Ukraine's armed forces are claiming that the raid by Russia on Antonov International Airport in Hostomel had failed. Officials said that the airport was under the control of the Ukrainian army.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on Thursday, called on citizens who are willing to defend the country from Russian forces to come forward. He said that Kyiv will issue weapons to everyone who wants them.

The Ukrainian army provided 10,000 assault rifles to locals to defend the country, Kyiv media reported on Friday.

The institutions included the University of Notre Dame, St. Patrick’s College Maynooth in Ireland, the Catholic University in Ružomberok, Slovakia, the Jagiellonian University in Kraków, and the Catholic University of Eichstätt-Ingolstadt in Germany.

The Catholic Universities Partnership also issued a statement condemning “the invasion as a gross violation of international law and as a disrespect of standards of decent human morality.”

Sophia Opatska, the founding dean of the Ukrainian Catholic University’s business school, recorded a video with suggestions on how businesses and citizens of other countries can support Ukraine.

Opatska recommended that business organizations “stop all relations with Russian businesses and companies,” particularly cutting off Russia from SWIFT payments.

She also encouraged people to put pressure on governments to enact a no-fly zone over Ukraine to protect civilians from Russian jets, drones, and missiles.

Myroslav Marynovych, the vice-rector of the Ukrainian Catholic University, was a recipient of the Napa Institute’s Charles J. Chaput Award. He spent seven years in a Soviet gulag in the Perm region of Russia from 1977 to 1984.

In an interview with CNA in 2018, Marynovych said that in the labor camp he learned “what ‘love your enemy’ really means.”

Marynovych was among 120 signatories on an appeal to the president of the Council of the European Union on Feb. 19 calling for immediate “negotiations on Ukraine’s accession to the European Union, with the aim of its full integration within 10 years.”

Pope Francis has appealed for a worldwide day of prayer and fasting for peace on Ash Wednesday, March 2.

The city in the far-West of Ukraine, just 75 kilometres from the Polish border, had been considered by many Ukrainians to be a safe haven during an invasion.

""I'll just get in my car and head to Lviv"" was a comment we heard often in Kyiv.

Hundreds of thousands of people had the same thought, judging by the congested roads out of the Ukrainian capital.

Lviv has not been targeted by Russian forces so far, but residents and visitors have been told to prepare emergency plans. The cobbled streets of this popular tourist destination are noticeably quieter today than yesterday.

'If I was younger, I would take a machine gun and go to the front line'

While many businesses are closed, supermarkets were packed. People were buying bottles of water and non-perishable foods. Essentials when there's a risk of utilities being targeted.

We met Ludmilla, whose two sons are on the frontline in the East.

She is one of the many Kyiv residents who travelled here a few days ago, anticipating what was to come. Soon, her three grandchildren will join her.

""I am holding on, I am a strong woman,"" she told SBS News.

""If I was younger, I would take a machine gun and go to the front line. I am willing to give my life, I have lived a full life. I'm ready to protect my Ukraine.""

Ludmilla is furious at Vladimir Putin, but also disappointed in the Russian people. She believes their indifference has enabled his rule.

""The situation is awful, inhuman. I had friends and business relationships with many Russians, but I have ended them. Russians, they’re silent on these matters. Blind, deaf and mute.""

Across Lviv, there are lengthy queues outside banks and automatic teller machines.

While card payment systems are still working here, many businesses have begun to ask for cash payments. Hard currency is King when war breaks out.

A psychologist who worked with refugees from the 2014 conflict, she expects she will soon be assisting a new wave of arrivals from Kyiv and the East.

Despite being so close to Poland, she will not abandon Ukraine.

On Thursday morning, air raid sirens sounded in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv for the first time — outside of regular drills — since World War II. Like clockwork, the picturesque city transformed from a tourist hotspot to a place preparing for war.

Even as TV screens flashed warnings of an imminent attack on the country in recent days, tour groups continued to flock the city’s cobblestoned streets, where dazzling baroque-style architecture stretches for miles. Diplomatic missions and international groups fled to the relative safety of Lviv from the capital Kyiv shortly after.

But that bubble burst when Russia attacked three locations — military facilities — in the Lviv region on Thursday morning.

""It was very tough this morning,"" Lviv Deputy Mayor Andriy Moskalenko told CNN on Thursday morning. ""This morning, we had sirens and it was a sign for people to move to underground shelters ... the explosions were far away from the city.""

Most shops in the city were shuttered. Long queues extended outside the few open stores— pharmacies, supermarkets, and even pet stores. The wait is over two hours long at most petrol pumps, or gas stations, where fuel is being rationed in an attempt to prevent fuel shortages.

Svetlana Locotova lets out a hearty laugh from a long queue outside a cash machine. She’s on the phone with her relatives in the heavily shelled eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, where many of the city's inhabitants are taking cover in the city’s subway station.

Next to her is her 12-year-old daughter, Margarita. Speaking to CNN, but also — it would seem — to her daughter, who nervously forces a smile, she says cheerily, “It’s totally normal that this would happen. I expected this queue. This is just how people react.""

She and Margarita have just returned from a shooting range — a common pastime here lately. “We’re confident, but we’re preparing for the worst,” she says.

People here go about the day with a sense of defiance, even as the city seems transformed. “Ukraine is no stranger to war” is the common refrain. The change in mood is almost imperceptible. Many still exchange smiles and jokes, even as they speak about preparing their homes to receive relatives from the significantly harder-hit east of the country.

“Ukrainian society got used to war, not at this scale of course. But we’re used to it,” says Lviv-based Maria Toma, an official at the Mission for Russian-occupied Crimea at the Ukrainian president’s office.

“What I would like to see is [Russian President Vladimir Putin] at The Hague in court,” says Toma. “I believe he will be convicted as a war criminal.”",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-news-02-24-22-intl/h_e586d58348fbfdc331820961c4a2df6e
