As a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, more and more people are dying every day while many buildings are already unusable. Football stadiums are also being shelled in the course of the war, and two of them have suffered bombing in Chernihiv.

Last week we reported that in Zaporizhzhya, Meralurh fans repelled an aerial attack by an aggressor on their own venue. This time, during the hostilities, a serious damage was made to the stadiums of two Chernihiv teams - the premier league Desna and the third league FK Chernihiv.

Chernihiv is a city of almost 300,000 people, near the border with Belarus, north of Kiev. Desna, named after the nearby river, were placed in a good seventh place in the Ukrainian Premier League at the time of the break. Last season they finished sixth in the table, just three points off the qualification places for the UEFA Conference League.

The Yuri Gagarin Stadium in Chernihiv was built just before World War II, in 1936. It is not the first time that the more than 12,000-seat facility has been severely damaged by war. However, the venue was rebuilt years ago, and this is also the current goal of the club's authorities.

Shakhtar Donetsk, among others, have expressed their support for Desna on social media. The 13-time champion of Ukraine is also suffering the torment, as it has not been able to play its home games at Donbass Arena for many years. As a result of the war, of course.

Chernihiv has suffered twice in terms of football stadiums. The venue of the third-league FK Chernihiv was also damaged. Although the 500-seat arena is not the biggest in the region, for a small local club the serious damage to the facility may be beyond recovery.

The club, which is focused on youth training, commissioned its new arena relatively recently and therefore the damage caused by the Russians may hurt them doubly. FK Chernihiv commented on the situation on their social media. It was reported that the tower, ticket offices and the club shop suffered damage as a result of the shelling, with two shells penetrating the grass.

The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said Friday it remains ""gravely concerned by the rising death toll and human suffering in Ukraine"" and called ""for an immediate end to the attacks.""

""Civilians are being killed and maimed in what appear to be indiscriminate attacks, with Russian forces using explosive weapons with wide area effects in or near populated areas. These include missiles, heavy artillery shells and rockets, as well as airstrikes,"" spokesperson Liz Throssell said in a statement.

The OHCHR said it had recorded 549 civilian deaths and 957 injuries since the invasion began, ""although the actual figure could be much higher.""

Schools, hospitals, and kindergartens have been hit – with hugely devastating consequences,"" Throssell said.

On March 3, 47 civilians were killed when Russian airstrikes hit two schools and several apartment blocks in Chernihiv and on March 9, a Russian airstrike hit a Mariupol hospital injuring at least 17 civilians, she added.

""We are still investigating reports that at least three civilians may have been killed in the airstrike.""

Sources in Mariupol, Throssell added, said the hospital was ""both clearly identifiable and operational when it was hit.""

The OHCHR also received ""credible reports of several cases of Russian forces using cluster munitions, including in populated areas,"" said Throssell.

The use of one cluster munition was reported on February 24 in the Central City Hospital in Vuhledar, in Donetsk, killing four civilians and injuring t10. At least nine other civilians were killed and 37 injured in ""other cluster munition attacks"" in several districts of Kharkiv, she said.

""Due to their wide area effects, the use of cluster munitions in populated areas is incompatible with the international humanitarian law principles governing the conduct of hostilities,"" Throssell said.

""Civilian casualties are rising daily, as is general human suffering. We remind the Russian authorities that directing attacks against civilians and civilian objects, as well as so-called area bombardment in towns and villages and other forms of indiscriminate attacks, are prohibited under international law and may amount to war crimes,"" she added.

The OHCHR, she added, was also concerned by reports of “arbitrary arrests and detention” of Ukrainians who voiced opposition to the Russian attack, including in peaceful protests.

""We believe that those detained are at risk of torture or other ill-treatment and call for their immediate and unconditional release.”

OHCHR is also concerned ""by the pejorative use of labels such as 'saboteurs' and 'mercenaries,' with the intent or effect of exposing certain individuals to higher risks of harm,"" she said.

""We call on the parties to fully respect the rights of everyone under their control,"" Throssell said. ""Those who have laid down their weapons ... including prisoners of war, must be treated humanely, and be protected from any form of torture or degrading treatment.""",https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-11-22/h_3a9fc0898b3fc040b2c8b216ef1fe6ea

A Ukrainian football stadium has been reduced to rubble by a Russian airstrike in the northern city of Chernihiv.

Videos on messenger service Telegram and pictures on Facebook show the scale of the devastation at the city's Olympic sports training centre, home to Ukrainian Premier League side FC Desna Chernihiv.

The images depict a once-thriving 12,060 capacity stadium almost totally destroyed by the impact of the strikes.

One of the main stands has been completely wrecked, with pieces of wood and metal piled on top of each other from where the stand has collapsed in on itself.

A shot from the exterior shows one of the main buildings blown out with wires and material hanging down and the glass windows shattered from the force of the blast.

But the most harrowing image is a panoramic shot of the stadium from the pitch itself.

On what was once a lush green playing surface, there is now rubble and fragments of wood, brick and metal strewn everywhere.

In the centre of the pitch, it is possible to discern several mounds of soil and what appears to be a crater, presumably from where one of the airstrikes has landed.

Images from behind the main stand show similar scenes.

Large holes can be seen blown into a nearby library, where books are scattered across the ground.

Another large crater, similar to the ones discovered in the aftermath of strikes on Mariupol, splits the two sites.

FC Desna Chernihiv, the stadium's tenants, acknowledged the blast on their official Instagram and issued a message of defiance with the Ukrainian people.

""For the third time, the Muscovite occupiers fired on the most dangerous military infrastructure facility in the city -- the stadium of our home team. In the photo -- the consequences of the night bombing"", the statement said.

""But we will be able to rebuild all this, we will only become stronger and better, and you, 'neighbours,' will live with it all your life,"" it added.

The invasion of Ukraine is underway. The invaders regularly fire at civilian targets. Homes, hospitals, schools. The damage after the bombings is huge. Sports facilities are not free of them either. As a result of rocket fire, it was completely destroyed, among others sports hall in Kharkiv. However, it is not the only sports arena to be destroyed.

The Russians destroyed the Desna Chernihiv stadium. “He’s practically gone”

Twitter user “BuckarooBanzai”, an expert on Ukrainian, posted a photo of the stadium belonging to football club Desna Chernihiv. We can see next to each other photos of the object from October 2021, and also taken now, after the attack of Vladimir Putin’s troops. The stadium was clearly damaged. Unfortunately, more photos appeared on Twitter later. “Actually, this stadium is no more,” BuckarooBanzai wrote. He published a photo showing that one of the stands was completely destroyed.

The history of the stadium in Chernihiv dates back to 1936. It has already been bombed once. It happened during World War II. In the 1950s, the building was rebuilt. Since 1961, it has been named after Yuri Gagarin, a Soviet cosmonaut and the first man in space. In the following years, the stadium underwent further renovations. The last of them was just a few years ago to adapt the facility to the requirements.

Desna Chernihiv occurs in Ukrainian. Two years ago she played in the qualifying rounds for the European cups. In the 2020/21 season, in the third qualifying round, she lost 0: 2 to VfL Wolfburg.

After the fall round, the team is seventh in the Ukrainian league table with 25 points. Shakhtar Donetsk is the leader with 47 points. The club of the Polish representative Tomasz Kędziora, Dynamo Kyiv, has two “eyes” less. The games of the Ukrainian league were stopped immediately after the attack of the Russian troops.",https://247newsagency.com/sports/84527.html
