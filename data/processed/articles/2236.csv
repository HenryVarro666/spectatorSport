UNITED NATIONS — The emergency U.N. Security Council meeting was meant as an eleventh hour effort to dissuade Russia from sending troops into Ukraine. But the message became moot even as it was being delivered.

While diplomats at U.N. headquarters were making pleas for Russia to back off — ""Give peace a chance,"" Secretary-General Antonio Guterres implored — Russian President Vladimir Putin went on television in his homeland to announce a military operation that he said was intended to protect civilians in Ukraine.

Putin warned other countries that any effort to interfere with the Russian operation would lead to ""consequences they have never seen.""

The council, where Russia holds the rotating presidency this month, gathered Wednesday night hours after Russia said rebels in eastern Ukraine had asked Moscow for military assistance. Fears that Russia was laying the groundwork for war bore out about a half hour later.

""It's too late, my dear colleagues, to speak about de-escalation,"" Ukrainian Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya told the council. ""I call on every one of you to do everything possible to stop the war.""

In a spontaneous exchange not often seen in the council chamber, Kyslytsya challenged his Russian counterpart to say that his country wasn't at that very moment bombing and shelling Ukraine or moving troops into it.

""You have a smartphone. You can call"" officials in Moscow, Kyslytsya said.

""I have already said all I know at this point,"" Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia responded.

He added that he didn't plan to wake up Russia's foreign minister — and said that what was happening was not a war but a ""special military operation.""

Kyslytsya dismissed that description outside the meeting as ""lunatic sematics.""

At the council's second emergency meeting this week on Ukraine, members found themselves delivering prepared speeches that were instantly outdated. Some ultimately reacted in a second round of hastily added remarks.

""At the exact time as we are gathered in the council seeking peace, Putin delivered a message of war, in total disdain for the responsibility of this council,"" U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said.

She added that a draft resolution would be circulated to the council Thursday.

The resolution would declare that Russia is violating the U.N. Charter, international law and a 2015 council resolution on Ukraine, a European diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the discussions were private. The resolution would urge Russia to come back into compliance immediately, the diplomat said.

Earlier Wednesday, diplomats from dozens of countries took the floor at the U.N. General Assembly to deplore Russia's actions toward Ukraine and plead for dialogue, while Russia and ally Syria defended Moscow's moves.

Echoing a narrative being broadcast to Russians at home, Nebenzia portrayed his country as responding to the plight of beleaguered people in the breakaway areas. Russia claims Ukraine is engaging in violence and oppression, which Ukraine denies.

""The root of today's crisis around Ukraine is the actions of Ukraine itself,"" he told the council Wednesday.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba implored countries to use tough economic sanctions, strong messages and ""active diplomacy"" to get Russia to back off. A lackluster response would jeopardize not only Ukraine but the concept of international law and global security, he warned.

Meeting a day after Western powers and some other countries imposed new sanctions on Russia, the 193-member General Assembly didn't take any collective action. But the comments from nearly 70 nations, with more scheduled for Monday, represented the broadest forum of global sentiment since the crisis dramatically escalated this week.

Russia seized Ukraine's Crimea Peninsula in 2014, and pro-Russia rebels have since been fighting Ukrainian forces in the eastern areas of Donetsk and Luhansk. More than 14,000 people have been killed in the conflict.

After weeks of rising tension as Moscow massed over 150,000 troops on Ukraine's borders, Putin on Monday recognized the two regions' independence and ordered Russian forces there for what he called ""peacekeeping.""

Guterres disputed that, saying the troops were entering another country without its consent.

By the end of the night Wednesday, as explosions were heard in Kyiv and other cities across Ukraine, Guterres' appeal to ""give peace a chance"" had become a darker and more desperate plea.

""President Putin, in the name of humanity, bring your troops back to Russia,"" the secretary-general said in remarks to reporters. ""In the name of humanity, do not allow to start in Europe what could be the worst war since the beginning of this century.""",https://www.npr.org/2022/02/24/1082716731/emergency-u-n-meeting-is-interrupted-by-russias-invasion-of-ukraine

Overview

The security situation in Ukraine deteriorated rapidly following the launch of a Russian Federation military offensive on 24 February 2022. The armed violence escalated in at least eight oblasts (regions), including Kyivska oblast and the capital city of Kyiv, as well as in the eastern oblasts Donetsk and Luhansk which were already affected by conflict.

The escalation of conflict has triggered an immediate and steep rise in humanitarian needs as essential supplies and services are disrupted and civilians flee the fighting. The UN estimates that 12 million people inside Ukraine will need relief and protection, while more than 4 million Ukrainian refugees may need protection and assistance in neighbouring countries in the coming months.

On 1 March 2022, the UN and humanitarian partners launched coordinated Flash Appeals for a combined $1.7 billion to urgently deliver humanitarian support to people in Ukraine and refugees in neighbouring countries.

Within Ukraine, the plan requires $1.1 billion to meet the escalating humanitarian needs of more than six million people affected and displaced by military operations over the next three months. Outside the country, the UN requested $551 million to help Ukrainians who have fled across borders, principally to Poland, Hungary, Romania and Moldova.

Amin Awad, the UN Crisis Coordinator for Ukraine called for an ""immediate humanitarian pause"" , on 5 March, in the fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces, as UN aid supplies continue to arrive in the country.

Russia has not only vetoed a UN Security Council resolution condemning its invasion, but used the council to spread Kremlin disinformation, including widely discredited claims about U.S.-funded biological laboratories in Ukraine, experts say.

Live Briefing: Russia Invades Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the major developments on Russia's invasion, how Kyiv is fighting back, the plight of civilians, and Western reaction. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.

The actions of Russian leader Vladimir Putin, condemned as a ""war criminal"" by U.S. President Joe Biden on March 16, coupled with the Security Council's reaction so far, have sparked calls for reform with one European defense minister even suggesting that the UN be scrapped amid questions whether the world body is up to the task of maintaining global security and peace. And given the showdown in the Security Council, some UN watchers are predicting years of inaction ahead as during the darkest days of the Cold War.

The current crisis is the most alarming episode of a longer-term trend at the Security Council, largely pitting Russia and its ally China against the West, said Richard Gowan, UN director at the International Crisis Group think tank, in an interview with RFE/RL.

""The Security Council has been on a path to irrelevance for quite some time. It's now over a decade since we first started to see the U.S. and Russia deadlock over Syria in the Security Council. Since 2011, Russia has cast its veto 17 times on issues related to Syria and China has often joined in these vetoes,"" Gowan said.

The United Nations, which was established in 1945 in the wake of World War II, is facing its greatest challenge ever, according to Mark Malloch-Brown, a former UN deputy secretary-general and current president of the Open Society Foundations, a private funder of NGOs backed by investor and philanthropist George Soros.

Russia's ""brazen crime of aggression"" is a ""threat to the post-1945 order,"" Malloch-Brown told a virtual conference hosted by the International Peace Institute on March 11. ""This is not just another war. This is a system-shaking, system-breaking conflict with huge consequences that go way beyond even the tragedy of the destruction of life and property in Ukraine itself.""

On February 25, a day after it invaded Ukraine, Russia was alone in the UN Security Council in voting against a resolution condemning its actions. China abstained, which was viewed as a win for Western diplomacy, given it came just weeks after Beijing and Moscow declared a ""no limits"" partnership.

Vetoed in the Security Council, the same resolution passed in the General Assembly, where no country has veto power, but where resolutions are mostly symbolic as they are nonbinding.

On March 2, during a special session dedicated to Ukraine, the resolution deploring Russia's actions was approved by 141 votes to five. Moscow won only the support of Belarus, North Korea, Eritrea, and Syria. Thirty-five countries abstained.

'An Extraordinary Moment'

""The message of the General Assembly is loud and clear,"" said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. ""End hostilities in Ukraine now. Silence the guns now. Open the door to dialogue and diplomacy now.""

""This is an extraordinary moment,"" declared U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield after the General Assembly vote. ""Now, at more than any other point in recent history, the United Nations is being challenged. If the United Nations has any purpose, it is to prevent war, it is to condemn war, to stop war.""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed the outcome as well, saying it showed ""that a global anti-Putin coalition has been formed and is functioning. The world is with us.""

The momentum was short-lived, however. While Moscow suffered a setback in the General Assembly, back at the Security Council on March 11 Russia called for a debate amid claims its military had uncovered evidence of a U.S.-funded military biological program in Ukraine.

Thomas-Greenfield said Russia was playing out a scenario put forth in the council last month by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken -- that Putin would ""fabricate allegations about chemical or biological weapons to justify its own violent attacks against the Ukrainian people.""

Russia's claims were quickly discredited. UN High Representative for Disarmament Affairs Izumi Nakamitsu said the ""United Nations is not aware of any biological weapons programs.""

""The labs are not secret,"" said Filippa Lentzos, a senior lecturer in science and international security at King's College London, in an e-mail to the AP news agency. ""They are not being used in relation to bioweapons. This is all disinformation.""

Since an agreement made in 2005, the Pentagon has assisted several Ukrainian public health laboratories with improving the security of dangerous pathogens and technology used in research.

Describing the March 11 session as ""high farce,"" Malloch-Brown said it highlighted how the Kremlin was using the Security Council to spread its disinformation.

""Obviously a council member must have the right to bring issues to the council, but when the culture of council behavior is reduced to this sort of performative art for Russian prime-time news programs and is completely detached from any plausible truth about chemical activities inside Ukraine and is indeed being used as a rationale and a justification for a potential chemical weapons attack against the people of Ukraine, I think we have to really be concerned as to where this is going,"" Malloch-Brown told the IPI virtual gathering.

The International Crisis Group's Gowan noted that while the claims may have been outrageous, it had been part of the Kremlin's playbook for a while. ""Russia [has] convened a series of informal Security Council briefings, where it brought in essentially propagandists to lay out its version of what was happening in Ukraine and to accuse the Ukrainians of fascism,"" Gowan said.

""And I think the reason that Russia does this is precisely that, in a world of more and more splintered official media and fragmented social media, the Russians can use screen grabs from these council meetings and broadcast their versions of events at home,"" Gowan said, noting that the Soviet Union accused the United States of using biological weapons during the Korean War in the 1950s.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has been described by U.S. defense officials as the largest conventional military attack since World War II, with over 3 million Ukrainians fleeing the country amid Russia's widespread bombardment of civilian targets.

While there have been calls by Ukraine and others for NATO to enforce a no-fly zone, most Western leaders are wary of such a move, fearing a wider conflict with Russia.

Czech Defense Minister Jana Cernochova has called for the UN to step in with peacekeepers, arguing not to do so would question the point of having the UN around. ""When something of this scale is happening and the UN is unable to take firm steps, then it is hopeless. They should find a way to send in blue helmets, that is, soldiers who would oversee respect for human rights and supplies. If the UN is incapable of doing that, then it is time to change it,"" Cernochova told Czech public TV on March 13.

But such a force would need the approval of the Security Council, said Farhan Aziz Haq, deputy spokesman for the UN secretary-general, in written comments to RFE/RL.

""Questions concerning the deployment of a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine are in the hands of the Security Council. The secretary-general doesn't have this type of authority,"" Haq told RFE/RL.

Humanitarian Relief

While sending in peacekeepers is not easy, the UN has stressed that its agencies have been active on several fronts to alleviate the suffering of hundreds of thousands of people impacted by Russia's aggression.

""The UN and our humanitarian partners are committed to staying and delivering, to support people in Ukraine. Our staff are working on both sides of the contact line, always guided by the humanitarian principles of neutrality, impartiality, humanity, and independence,"" wrote Haq. ""We are providing lifesaving humanitarian relief to civilians in need, regardless of who or where they are.""

Haq cited the work of the United Nations' World Food Program, which he said was reaching 3.1 million people ""through the use of cash-based transfers as well as in-kind food distributions.""

""Over the weekend, a UNICEF convoy of 22 trucks arrived in Ukraine with 168 tons of supplies, including midwifery kits, surgical kits, obstetric kits, oxygen concentrators, cold boxes, blankets and winter clothes, water, sanitation and hygiene kits, dignity kits, early childhood education kits, and adolescent kits,"" Haq added.HU

'Performative Black Arts' And 'Deadlock'

Such efforts are what the UN should focus on, argued Malloch-Brown.

""It needs to take stock of what it can do and what it can't do, and perhaps recognize it is in the humanitarian, human rights, information reporting, and possibly coordinating with the IFIs (international financial institutions) the development response to a global economic crisis that will follow this,"" he said. ""[This] is where its comparative advantages lie, and the Security Council is perhaps condemned to remain performative black arts followed by deadlock for years to come.""

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called on the UN on March 2 to reconsider Russia's status as a permanent member of the Security Council.

Kuleba called for a ""thorough and unbiased"" legal review of Russia's permanent membership. ""We are confident that when the analysis is complete, it will be evident that Russia's presence at the UN Security Council is illegitimate,"" Kuleba said.

That would be easier said than done. ""There are clauses in the UN Charter about expelling members that egregiously break the organization's rules, but that requires a recommendation to do so from the Security Council, which Russia could block,"" said Gowan.

""Similarly, there's a lot of talk, as we've seen in the past, over Syria, over rewriting the UN Charter to make it harder for Russia, or other permanent members to use their vetoes during situations like this, but again, Article 108 of the UN Charter says, you can't reform it without the ratification of all five permanent members of the council. So, Russia has a stranglehold on any serious reform proposals,"" said Gowan, adding that expelling Russia from the UN's Human Rights Council could be an option as it only requires two thirds of the General Assembly members to approve.

Expelling Russia from the UN outright, Gowan said, could have unintended consequences.

""Most U.S. diplomats and others recognize that forcing Russia out of the tent, in the long term is going to be more destructive than positive because just as Japan and Germany and Italy stormed out of the League of Nations in the 1930s and then became more destructive, we'd have to assume that Russia outside the UN would feel even less restraint than it does today, Gowan said. ""Although, to be frank, Russia doesn't seem to feel very restrained right now.""",https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-invades-ukraine-un-peacekeeping/31758188.html
3,9544af08-3404-404a-bb97-eda1dfed98c2,[],2022-02-11 00:00:00,"Hours after speakers took the floor in the 193-member General Assembly to denounce Russia’s actions towards Ukraine and appeal for diplomacy, Mr. Guterres said that instead of repeating what he’d stated there, his political chief would update the Council on “a number of events” that had taken place during the day.

But before handing the microphone to her, he drew attention to rumours that were circulating that an offensive against Ukraine was imminent.

About an hour into the Council meeting, President Putin announced in Moscow that a 'special military operation' in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region had commenced, and that he had asked Ukrainian troops to put down their arms.

Guterres 'saddest moment'

Speaking to journalists after the Security Council session ended, Mr. Guterres called what happened the “saddest moment” in his tenure as UN Secretary-General.

In light of this development, the UN chief said, “I must change my address and say: In the name of humanity bring your troops back to Russia. In the name of humanity to not start what may be the most devastating war since the start of the century.”

Rapidly unfolding events

Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs Rosemary A. DiCarlo told the Council that earlier in the day, the “so-called authorities of the Donetsk and Luhansk Peoples Republics” had requested military assistance from Russia.

Meanwhile, the Ukrainian authorities declared a nationwide state of emergency and announced other related defence and security measures, including the mobilization of reservists.

Under the present circumstances, I must change my appeal:



President Putin, in the name of humanity, bring your troops back to Russia.



This conflict must stop now. — António Guterres (@antonioguterres) February 24, 2022

“Throughout the day we have seen disturbing reports of continued heavy shelling across the contact line and civilian and military casualties…the repeated targeting of civilian infrastructure…[and] an ongoing large-scale military build-up and military columns moving towards Ukraine,” she said.

Moreover, Russia has also reportedly shut airspace to civilian aircraft near the border with Ukraine.

“The United Nations cannot verify any of these reports, but if these developments were confirmed, they would greatly aggravate an already extremely dangerous situation,” she said.

The Ukrainian authorities are also reporting a new large-scale cyber-attack targeting several State and financial institutions.

Staying and delivering

UN staff remain on the ground to provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Ukraine, Ms. DiCarlo said, adding, “we are committed to staying and delivering”.

“All parties must ensure the safety and security. Respect for international humanitarian law and international human rights law is also paramount”, she stated.

While the world cannot predict what will happen in the coming hours and days ahead, Ms. DiCarlo said that “what is clear is the unacceptably high cost – in human suffering and destruction – of an escalation,"" concluded the senior UN official.

‘Perilous moment’

US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said that the meeting was being held tonight because, along with Ukraine, “we believe that a full-scale further invasion is imminent”.

She pointed to the closing of airspace by the Russian authorities, as well as moving troops into Donbas and moving other forces into combat-ready positions.

“This is a perilous moment and we’re here for one reason, and one reason only: to ask Russia to stop. Return to your borders. Send your troops, your tanks, and your planes back to their barracks and hangars. And send your diplomats to the negotiating table. Back away from the brink, before it is too late.”

Ms. Thomas-Greenfield reminded the Council that Russia had called previous predictions “hysterical”, saying that US was ""lying and supplying the world with misinformation.""

“But what we said would happen has come to pass, for all the world to see,” the US Ambassador spelled out. “We must confront this threat head-on”.

‘Unjustifiable blow’ to peace

French Ambassador Nicolas de Rivière said that Russia was on the verge of provoking chaos in Ukraine and striking “an unjustifiable blow to peace and security in the heart of Europe”.

He said that President Putin had been planning this assault for months and had consistently and patiently undermined Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.

“Throughout all this, Ukraine has shown remarkable restraint, including restraining from violence,” Mr. de Rivière said.

He reminded that European allies and the United States had consistently expressed commitment to work together with Russia to seek a diplomatic solution and “the international community had made its united voice heard earlier today in the General Assembly, calling for respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty.

The French Ambassador said that “if Russia confirms that its choice is war it will have to take all the responsibility and pay the price.”

‘A gun to Ukraine’s head’

UK Ambassador Dame Barbara Woodward noted that for months, Russia has been holding “a gun to Ukraine’s head”.

Members of the Security Council, General Assembly, and the Secretary-General himself had been calling for an end to Russia’s aggression.

“The world is calling for peace, but Russia is not listening,” she said.

As such, the United Kingdom, she said, will not compromise its commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.

“We will not compromise our commitment to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter…most of all the founding principle that we live together as good neighbors,” concluded Ms. Woodward.

Root of the crisis

Russian Ambassador Vasily Alekseevich Nebenzya, who is serving as the President of the Council for February, said that after listening to the statements tonight and in recent days, it was difficult to explain intensification of shelling by the Ukrainian regime of civilians by in Donetsk and Luhansk.

All the speakers seemed not to care for those people “who are living in basements. They seemed not to care about the refugees that are fleeing to Russia,” he said, as if ""those four million people simply don’t exist.”

“We tried yesterday and the day before to explain the logic by which Russia recognized the regions in the Donbas, but you just didn’t want to hear it; then or now. The people of the Donbas have been living in fear for the past eight years under Ukraine’s shelling and aggressions,” he said.

The Russian Ambassador stated that “the root of today’s crisis around Ukraine is Ukraine itself, which has for years been undermining the Minsk Agreements and calls for de-escalation”.

He told Council members that he had just learned that President Putin had announced a special military operation in the region, but that was all he knew and would need more time to gather specific information.

“I will keep you appraised of the situation,” he said and added that “occupation of Ukraine is not in our plan, our plan is to protect the people [in the Donbas] from the genocide perpetrated by the regime in Kyiv.”

Too late for de-escalation

Ukrainian Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya said that most of his statement was “useless now” after the Russian Ambassador had stated openly from the floor of the Council that President Putin had “declared war on my country”.

He welcomed the intention of some Council members to submit a resolution condemning aggression against Ukraine, saying “there is no purgatory for war criminals. They go straight to hell.”

Mr. Kyslytsya asked the Russian Ambassador to clarify whether Ukraine was being bombed “at this very moment.”

“It's too late, dear collagues, to speak about de-escalation. Too late. The Russian President declared a war. Should I play the video of your President? You declared a war. It’s responsibility of this body to stop the war”, Mr. Kyslytsya said, directing his comments to Russian Ambassador Nebenzya. “You have a smartphone. You can call” officials in Moscow.

Considering this “declaration of war”, the Ukrainian Ambassador said that the Russian Federation should “relinquish the responsibilities of Council President and transfer them to a responsible member of the Council who... respects the UN Charter.""

He also requested that the Secretary-General distribute legal UN memorandums from December 1991, particularly 19 December of that year, including a decision by the Security Council recommending that the Russian Federation be a Member State of the Organization. “It would be a miracle if the Secretariat is able to produce such decisions,” he said.

In the meantime, the Security Council should pause tonight's session to consider all resolutions and recommendations to stop the war.

“I call on every one of you to do everything possible to stop the war,” he concluded.

Before the end of the meeting, several members of the Council took the floor a second time to condemn President Putin's announcement of Russia's so-called “special military operation” in areas of eastern Ukraine.",https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/02/1112592
4,9544af08-3404-404a-bb97-eda1dfed98c2,[],,"NEW YORK (AP) — The UN Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting on Ukraine for Wednesday night, just hours after diplomats from dozens of countries took the floor at the General Assembly to deplore Russia’s actions toward the country and plead for diplomacy as fears of a new war in Europe grew.

Citing an “immediate threat of Russian offensive,” Ukraine requested the council session after Russia said that rebels in eastern Ukraine had asked Moscow for military assistance.

The council, where Russia holds the rotating presidency this month, was meeting just two days after another emergency session saw no support for Russia’s decision to recognize two rebel regions of Ukraine as independent and to order Russian troops there for “peacekeeping.”

Council diplomats are now finalizing a draft of a resolution that would declare that Russia is violating the UN Charter, international law, and a 2015 council resolution on Ukraine, a diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the discussions were private. The resolution would urge Russia to come back into compliance immediately, the diplomat said.

With Russia holding veto power in the council, though, the resolution is doomed to achieve little more than a symbolic show of contempt for Moscow’s moves.

At the General Assembly meeting earlier Wednesday, Russia and ally Syria defended the Kremlin. But even China, which usually takes Russia’s side at the UN, spoke up for the world body’s longstanding principle of respecting countries’ sovereignty and internationally recognized borders, while not mentioning Russia by name.

Meeting a day after Western powers and some other countries imposed new sanctions on Russia, the 193-member General Assembly didn’t take any collective action. But the comments from nearly 70 nations, with more scheduled for Monday, represented the broadest forum of global sentiment since the crisis dramatically escalated this week.

Countries from Guatemala to Turkey to Japan condemned Russia’s embrace of the separatist regions’ independence claims or voiced support for Ukraine.

“Ukraine, you’re not alone,” Bulgarian Ambassador Lachezara Stoeva said.

US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield exhorted countries “to get off the sidelines.”

“There is no middle ground here. Calling for both sides to de-escalate only gives Russia a pass. Russia is the aggressor here,” she said.

Thomas-Greenfield warned that the confrontation could spiral into a refugee crisis, estimating that as 5 million people could be displaced and could make food prices spike in developing countries where Ukraine supplies wheat.

Echoing a narrative being broadcast to Russians at home, Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia portrayed his country as responding to the plight of beleaguered people in the breakaway areas. Russia claims Ukraine is engaging in violence and oppression, which Ukraine denies.

“We urge you today to focus on reining in Kyiv,” Nebenzia said.

Syria accused the West of using the assembly to pressure Moscow.

“The Ukrainian crisis was created by the Western states, led by the United States, to divide people and to undermine Russian security,” Ambassador Bassam al-Sabbagh said.

The Russian-backed Donetsk and Luhansk regions in easter Ukraine has asked Russia for military aid. The US described it as a 'false flag' pretext for a Russian invasion.

Separatist regions in eastern Ukraine ask Putin for help

The leaders of two Russian-backed separatist regions have asked Moscow to help them repel Ukraine.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the leaders of the separatist regions of Donetsk and Luhansk have asked Moscow for military help to fend off Ukrainian ""aggression.""

Peskov said Russian President Vladimir Putin had received a letter from the two rebel leaders, which he recognized as independent this week.

""The actions of the Kyiv regime testify to the unwillingness to end the war in Donbas,"", Peskov quoted the letter as saying.

The US has accused Russia of plotting so-called false flag incidents, provocations staged to create a pretext for action.

Ukraine's parliament approves state of emergency

Ukrainian lawmakers approved a state of emergency for 30 days from midnight on Wednesday.

The move came after Russia recognized two separatist regions of eastern Ukraine as ""independent.""

It allows authorities to impose curfews and restrictions on movement, block rallies and ban political parties and organizations ""in the interests of national security and public order.''

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy proposed introducing a nationwide state of emergency earlier on Wednesday as his country braces for a possible military offensive from Russia.

Ukrainian authorities have repeatedly voiced concern that Russia could try to destabilize Ukraine by relying on Moscow's supporters inside the country.

US slaps sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG

Authorities in Paris also projected Ukraine's national colors onto the French capital's City Hall to show their support.

Russian forces 'ready to go,' says US official

A US defense official has told reporters that Russian President Vladimir Putin is ""as ready as he can be"" for a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official said that 80% of the estimated 150,000-plus Russian forces along the Ukraine border are in ""ready positions"" — spread out in attack formation within a few kilometers of the frontier.

""We assess today that he is near 100% of all the forces that we anticipated that he would move in,"" they added, with the caveat that ""we still cannot confirm that Russian military forces have moved into the Donbas areas.""

Most Germans favor Merkel as mediator, oppose arming Ukraine

Around 68% of Germans are against supplying weapons to Kyiv, a new survey conducted by the INSA Institute has found.

Roughly 22% said they would support such a move.

Additionally, around 43% of Germans favor hitting Russia with economic sanctions over Moscow's recognition of the self-proclaimed ""People's Republics"" of Luhansk and Donetsk. About a quarter of respondents said they favored diplomatic sanctions, and 7% said they favored military sanctions.

A little over half of the respondents said they would like to see former German Chancellor Angela Merkel act as a mediator in the current crisis. Most respondents said current Chancellor Olaf Scholz's response was ""neither good nor bad,"" while around 43% of Germans said Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock's handling of the crisis was ""quite bad.""

Around 1,000 people were surveyed for the poll.

UN chief warns of global impact of a Russian invasion

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned the UN General Assembly on Wednesday that the world is ""facing a moment of peril.""

Watch video 00:22 UN chief says world facing 'moment of peril' over Ukraine-Russia crisis

He said it was time for ""restraint, reason, and de-escalation,"" in dealing with the Ukraine-Russia crisis.

""If the conflict in Ukraine expands, the world could see a scale and severity of need unseen for many years,"" he said.

Guterres was speaking at the start of a General Assembly session on Ukraine.

He called Russia's decision to recognize the separatist-controlled regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine as ""independent states,"" a violation ""of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine.""

""No one will be able to sit out this crisis if [Russian President Vladimir] Putin decides that he can move forward,"" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told the UN meeting.

""Active diplomacy, strong political messages, tough economic sanctions and strengthening Ukraine can still force Moscow to abandon aggressive plans,"" he said.

Russia's UN ambassador Vassily Nebenzia warned the 193-member General Assembly that ""no one intends to go softly, softly with any violators'' of the peace in those eastern areas of Ukraine.

Ukraine targeted by cyberattack

Websites belonging to several Ukrainian government ministries and banks have been hit by an apparent cyberattack.

""Another mass DDoS attack on our state began. We have relevant data from a number of banks,"" said Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukrainian Minister of Digital Transformation.

Ukraine's government, Foreign Ministry and state security service websites were also not accessible on Wednesday.

A DDoS, or denial-of-service attack, overwhelms websites by sending a large number of requests at once, causing them to crash.

The online networks of Ukraine's Defense Ministry and two banks were overwhelmed last week in a separate cyberattack.

EU calls emergency summit and adopts sanctions

European leaders will hold an emergency summit on Thursday to discuss the Russia-Ukraine crisis.

""It is important that we continue to be united and determined and jointly define our collective approach and actions,"" EU Council chief Charles Michel said in a letter inviting EU leaders to Brussels.

""The use of force and coercion to change borders has no place in the 21st century,"" he added.

Europe has adopted its first sanctions package of financial penalties targeting top Russian government officials, several companies and hundreds of lawmakers who voted in favor of recognizing the independence of separatist-controlled parts of southeast Ukraine. It also banned trade with the two regions.

Petraeus: Russian threat 'has unified NATO'

Former director of the CIA and retired general David Petraeus told DW that Russian President Vladimir Putin is the ""greatest gift to NATO since the end of the Cold War.""

""He set out to make Russia great again. What he's really done is make NATO great again by his actions. That threat has unified NATO in a way that it hasn't been again since the Wall came down, the Warsaw Pact in the Soviet Union dissolved.""

He said the US could impose much stronger sanctions, including to ""cut-off of Russia from the Swift financial transaction system,"" blocking critical high-technology exports, and penalizing more Russian elites and their family members.

He praised Germany for halting certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. Petraeus said it was done ""very prompt, very swift (and) very significant in particular for Chancellor Scholz to be the first one to announce this.""

Russia evacuates diplomats from Kyiv

Russia has undertaken evacuations of its embassy in Kyiv, Russian state news agency Tass reported.

Previous evacuations of embassy personnel have been reported. On Wednesday, though, the Russian flag outside the embassy and the consulate in Odessa came down and police surrounded the embassy building.

On Tuesday, Russia's Foreign Ministry announced it planned to evacuate all diplomatic staff from Ukraine.

Last week, video circulated online that showed smoke rising from the Russian Embassy but only on Wednesday did Tass quote an embassy employee saying staff had burnt documents prior to their departure.

Erdogan tells Putin it does not recognize Donbas regions as 'independent'

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in a phone call to Russian President Vladimir Putin that Turkey did not recognize the two regions of eastern Ukraine Russia has tried to claim as ""independent,"" in violation of international law.

Turkey, a NATO member state that shares the Black Sea region with Russia and Ukraine, maintains ties with both nations and has offered to mediate in the past while warning against any intensified military conflict.

In a statement, the Turkish presidential administration said, ""President Erdogan, who renewed his call for the matter to be resolved through dialogue, stated that it was important to bring diplomacy to the forefront, and that (Turkey) continued its constructive stance in NATO as well.""

Zelenskyy joined in Kyiv by presidents of Lithuania and Poland

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was joined in Kyiv by Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda and Polish President Andrzej Duda who signed a joint declaration in support of Ukraine's EU member candidate status, which is currently not on offer.

The three leaders presented a united front with all three nations previously under Moscow's thumb during the Cold War. They vowed to never recognize Ukrainian territories claimed by Russia or its proxies.

Zelenskyy said, ""The future of European security is being decided right now.""

He added Ukraine should receive security guarantees from Moscow.

""I believe that Russia should be among those countries that provide clear security guarantees. I have many times suggested that the president of Russia sit down at the negotiating table and speak,"" Zelenskyy said.

Duda said he hopes that current tensions with Russia will not lead to the outbreak of war, noting, ""We believe that they pose a threat not only to Ukraine but to our entire region, to NATO's eastern flank and the EU as a whole.""

Kyiv pushes for more sanctions on Russia

Earlier Wednesday, Kyiv urged Western nations to impose more sanctions on Russia following a sweeping round of restrictions from the US and other Western nations targeting the economy and Russian President Vladimir Putin's inner circle.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote in a tweet that more sanctions were necessary ""to stop Putin from further aggression."" Kuleba added: ""Now the pressure needs to step up to stop Putin. Hit his economy and cronies.""

The European Union foreign ministers agreed on a package of sanctions targeting individuals and entities that ""undermine Ukrainian integrity,"" the bloc's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Tuesday.

Those sanctions moved one step closer to being finalized Wednesday as EU ambassadors agreed to the package. The full sanctions package is expected to be announced later Wednesday after final approval from foreign ministers.

In a preview of what form those sanctions may take, The Wall Street Journal reports EU sanctions will target Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and the Internet Research Agency, a troll farm. Bloomberg adds the EU is also set to ban the purchase of Russian government bonds as well.

On Wednesday, US deputy treasury secretary Wally Adeyemo said the US is prepared to cut Putin's Russia off ""from Western technology that's critical to advancing the military, cut him off from Western financial resources that will be critical for feeding his economy and also to enriching himself.""

Western nations are using sanctions in part in response to a speech given by Putin on Monday that declared Russia had the right to seize Ukraine as part of the nation's ""spiritual continuum"" while also violating international law by declaring the eastern Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk ""independent.""

DW's Russia affairs analyst Konstantin Eggert said, ""Eventually Putin will say that the newly recognized states need to have their full territory under control and then that means we will have a real confrontation, a real battle between Russian and Ukrainian forces is very much possible.""

Zelenskyy calls up reservists

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed a decree Wednesday calling up reservists between the ages of 18 and 60, Ukraine's armed forces said in a statement.

The border guard in Ukraine also issued new restrictions prohibiting foreigners from accessing the border area at any time as well as restrictions on video and photo recordings of border guard installations amid fears an invasion could be imminent.

Blinken calls off meeting with Lavrov

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday evening that he called off a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov planned for Thursday, in another sign that an immediate diplomatic solution to the tensions in Ukraine is becoming less likely.

Speaking at a press conference alongside Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, Blinken said he agreed to meet Lavrov on the condition that Russia not send troops into Ukrainian territory.

""Now that we see the invasion is beginning, and Russia has made clear its wholesale rejection of diplomacy, it does not make sense to go forward with that meeting at this time,"" Blinken said.

However, Blinken said the US remains committed to diplomacy ""if Moscow's approach changes.""

He added that he would do anything to prevent ""an even worse-case scenario, an all-out assault on all of Ukraine, including its capital.""

""But we will not allow Russia to claim the pretense of diplomacy at the same time it accelerates its march down the path of conflict and war,"" Blinken said.

Blinken condemned Putin's speech on the recognition of eastern Ukraine's two separatist regions, calling it ""deeply disturbing"" and contending that Putin was ""undoing more than 30 years' worth of painstaking diplomacy.""

The White House on Tuesday said plans for a meeting between US President Joe Biden and Putin are currently off the table but added,

""We're never going to completely close the door to diplomacy.""

Japan said Wednesday it will impose sanctions on Russia and individuals linked to eastern Ukraine's two self-proclaimed ""people's republics.""

Japan's measures include a ban on issuing visas to individuals linked to the two regions, as well as freezing their assets and barring trade. The sanctions also ban the issuing and trade of Russian government bonds in Japan.

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that Australia would impose sanctions on eight of Putin's top security advisors, including travel bans. Morrison said that this was ""only the start of this process"" and that subsequent rounds of sanctions are expected.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on Tuesday a first round of sanctions on Russia. Trudeau said that his government will ban Canadians from financial dealings with Ukraine's separatist regions and ban Canadians from purchasing Russian sovereign debt.

Recent developments in the Ukraine crisis

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Tuesday that Germany has taken steps to suspend the process of certifying the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia in response to the developments in Ukraine.

The move was made in consultation with the US, as part of a previous agreement the pipeline would not be activated if Russia ""invaded"" Ukraine.

Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden announced a ""first tranche"" of sanctions against Russia.

The sanctions target Russia's VEB and Promsvyazbank banks. Biden added that sanctions targeting Russia's sovereign debt are aimed at cutting off Russia's government from Western financing.

Also on Tuesday, Russian parliamentarians gave Putin permission to use military force outside the country, after Putin had sent a letter formally asking for approval for the use of military force.

The move formalizes a Russian military deployment to separatist regions in eastern Ukraine, Donetsk and Luhansk, a day after Putin recognized the independence of the two self-proclaimed ""people's republics.""

6,9544af08-3404-404a-bb97-eda1dfed98c2,"['Vladimir Isachenkov', 'Associated Press', 'Dasha Litvinova', 'Yuras Karmanau', 'Jim Heintz']",2022-02-23 20:02:44-04:00,"MOSCOW (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday announced a military operation in Ukraine and warned other countries that any attempt to interfere with the Russian action would lead to “consequences you have never seen.”

Watch the meeting in the player above.

He said the attack was needed to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine — a claim the U.S. had predicted he would falsely make to justify an invasion.

In a televised address, Putin accused the U.S. and its allies of ignoring Russia’s demand to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO and offer Moscow security guarantees. He said Russia doesn’t intend to occupy Ukraine but will move to “demilitarize” it and bring those who committed crimes to justice.

As Putin spoke before dawn, big explosions were heard in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odessa and other cities across Ukraine.

Ukraine’s ambassador at the United Nations has told the Security Council that Putin has “declared war on Ukraine.” He also pressed his Russian counterpart to state that Russia will not shell and bomb Ukrainian cities.

Ukrainian Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya said Wednesday night that if Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia was not in a position to give a positive answer, he should relinquish the presidency of the Security Council, which Russia holds this month.

The Ukrainian then asked for another emergency meeting of the Security Council, calling on the U.N. body “to stop the war because it’s too late to talk about de-escalation.”

Kyslytsya then asked if he should play the video of Putin announcing military operations being launched in Ukraine.

Nebenzia replied: “This isn’t called a war. This is called a special military operation in Donbas.”

U.S. President Joe Biden in a written statement condemned the “unprovoked and unjustified attack” on Ukraine and he promised that the U.S. and its allies “will hold Russia accountable.” Biden said he planned to speak to Americans on Thursday after a meeting of the Group of Seven leaders. More sanctions against Russia were expected to be announced Thursday.

A full-blown Russian invasion could cause massive casualties and topple Ukraine’s democratically elected government. And the consequences of the conflict and resulting sanctions levied on Russia could reverberate throughout the world, affecting energy supplies in Europe, jolting global financial markets and threatening the post-Cold War balance on the continent.

As he unleashed the military action, Putin issued a stark warning to other countries not to meddle.

“I have a few words for those who could feel tempted to interfere with ongoing developments: whoever tries to impede us, let alone create threats for our country and its people must know that the Russian response will be immediate and lead to the consequences you have never seen in history,” he said.

Putin urged Ukrainian servicemen to “immediately put down arms and go home.”

Putin announced the military operation after the Kremlin said rebels in eastern Ukraine asked Russia for military assistance to help fend off Ukrainian “aggression,” an announcement that the White House said was a “false flag” operation by Moscow to offer up a pretext for an invasion.

Putin’s announcement came just hours after the Ukrainian president rejected Moscow’s claims that his country poses a threat to Russia and made a passionate, last-minute plea for peace.

“The people of Ukraine and the government of Ukraine want peace,” President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in an emotional overnight address, speaking in Russian in a direct appeal to Russian citizens. “But if we come under attack, if we face an attempt to take away our country, our freedom, our lives and lives of our children, we will defend ourselves. When you attack us, you will see our faces, not our backs.”

Zelenskyy said he asked to arrange a call with Putin late Wednesday, but the Kremlin did not respond.

In an apparent reference to Putin’s move to authorize the deployment of the Russian military to “maintain peace” in eastern Ukraine, Zelensky warned that “this step could mark the start of a big war on the European continent.”

“Any provocation, any spark could trigger a blaze that will destroy everything,” he said.

He challenged the Russian propaganda claims, saying that “you are told that this blaze will bring freedom to the people of Ukraine, but the Ukrainian people are free.”

At an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council called by Ukraine because of the imminent threat of a Russian invasion, members still unaware of Putin’s announcement appealed to him to stop an attack. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres opened the meeting, just before the announcement, telling Putin: “Stop your troops from attacking Ukraine. Give peace a chance. Too many people have already died.”

Anxiety about an imminent Russian offensive soared after Putin recognized the separatist regions’ independence on Monday, endorsed the deployment of troops to the rebel territories and received parliamentary approval to use military force outside the country. The West responded with sanctions.

Late Wednesday, Ukrainian lawmakers approved a decree that imposes a nationwide state of emergency for 30 days starting Thursday. The measure allows authorities to declare curfews and other restrictions on movement, block rallies and ban political parties and organizations “in the interests of national security and public order.”

The action reflected increasing concern among Ukrainian authorities after weeks of trying to project calm. The Foreign Ministry advised against travel to Russia and recommended that any Ukrainians who are there leave immediately.

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Wednesday the Russian force of more than 150,000 troops arrayed along Ukraine’s borders is in an advanced state of readiness. “They are ready to go right now,” Kirby said.

Early Thursday, airspace over all of Ukraine was shut down to civilian air traffic, according to a notice to airmen. A commercial flight tracking website showed that an Israeli El Al Boeing 787 flying from Tel Aviv to Toronto turned abruptly out of Ukrainian airspace before detouring over Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Poland. The only other aircraft tracked over Ukraine was a U.S. RQ-4B Global Hawk unmanned surveillance plane, which began flying westward early Thursday after Russia put in place flight restrictions over Ukrainian territory.

Another wave of distributed-denial-of-service attacks hit Ukraine’s parliament and other government and banking websites on Wednesday, and cybersecurity researchers said unidentified attackers had also infected hundreds of computers with destructive malware.

Officials have long said they expect cyberattacks to precede and accompany any Russian military incursion, and analysts said the incidents hew to a nearly two-decade-old Russian playbook of wedding cyber operations with real-world aggression.

Even before Putin’s announcement, dozens of nations imposed sanctions on Russia, further squeezing Russian oligarchs and banks out of international markets.

Biden allowed sanctions to move forward against the company that built the Russia-to-Germany Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline and against the company’s CEO.

Germany said Tuesday that it was indefinitely suspending the project, after Biden charged that Putin had launched “the beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine” by sending troops into the separatist regions. The pipeline is complete but has not yet begun operating.

Even before the Russian military attack on Ukraine began, the threat of war had shredded Ukraine’s economy and raised the specter of massive casualties, energy shortages across Europe and global economic chaos.

European Union sanctions against Russia took effect, targeting several companies along with 351 Russian lawmakers who voted for a motion urging Putin to recognize the rebel regions and 27 senior government officials, business executives and top military officers.

The Russian Foreign Ministry has shrugged off the sanctions, saying that “Russia has proven that, with all the costs of the sanctions, it is able to minimize the damage.”

Citing an “immediate threat of Russian offensive,” Ukraine requested the council session after Russia said that rebels in eastern Ukraine had asked Moscow for military assistance.

The council, where Russia holds the rotating presidency this month, was meeting just two days after another emergency session saw no support for Russia’s decision to recognise two rebel regions of Ukraine as independent and to order Russian troops there for “peacekeeping.”

Council diplomats are now finalising a draft of a resolution that would declare that Russia is violating the UN Charter, international law, and a 2015 council resolution on Ukraine, a diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the discussions were private. The resolution would urge Russia to come back into compliance immediately, the diplomat said.

At the General Assembly meeting earlier Wednesday, Russia and ally Syria defended Moscow’s moves. But even China, which usually takes Russia’s side at the U.N., spoke up for the world body’s longstanding principle of respecting countries’ sovereignty and internationally recognised borders, while not mentioning Russia by name.

Meeting a day after Western powers and some other countries imposed new sanctions on Russia, the 193-member General Assembly didn’t take any collective action. But the comments from nearly 70 nations, with more scheduled for Monday, represented the broadest forum of global sentiment since the crisis dramatically escalated this week.

Countries from Guatemala to Turkey to Japan condemned Russia’s embrace of the separatist regions’ independence claims or voiced support for Ukraine.

“Ukraine, you’re not alone,” Bulgarian Ambassador Lachezara Stoeva said.

U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield exhorted countries ?to get off the sidelines.?

“There is no middle ground here. Calling for both sides to de-escalate only gives Russia a pass. Russia is the aggressor here,” she said.

Thomas-Greenfield warned that the confrontation could spiral into a refugee crisis, estimating that as 5 million people could be displaced and could make food prices spike in developing countries where Ukraine supplies wheat.

Echoing a narrative being broadcast to Russians at home, Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia portrayed his country as responding to the plight of beleaguered people in the breakaway areas. Russia claims Ukraine is engaging in violence and oppression, which Ukraine denies.

“We urge you today to focus on reining in Kyiv,” Nebenzia said.

Syria accused the West of using the assembly to pressure Moscow.

“The Ukrainian crisis was created by the Western states, led by the United States, to divide people and to undermine Russian security,” Ambassador Bassam al-Sabbagh said.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba implored countries to use tough economic sanctions, strong messages and “active diplomacy” to get Russia to back off. A lackluster response would jeopardise not only Ukraine but the concept of international law and global security, he warned.

“We need to use this last chance for action and stop Russia where it is,” Kuleba said.

Russia seized Ukraine’s Crimea Peninsula in 2014, and pro-Russia rebels have since been fighting Ukrainian forces in the eastern areas of Donetsk and Luhansk. More than 14,000 people have been killed in the conflict.

After weeks of rising tension as Moscow massed over 150,000 troops on Ukraine’s borders, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday recognised the two regions’ independence and ordered Russian forces there as what he called “peacekeepers.” U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres disputed that, saying they are troops entering another country without its consent.

Putin’s announcement came about midway through the Council meeting. But even as reports of heavy fire in Ukraine were being messaged on Twitter, the Russian ambassador refused, at the end of the meeting and close to midnight, to call his country’s invasion a “war.”

“The statement that I came here with tonight, most of it is already useless,” said Ukrainian Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya in his opening remarks at the meeting, which began at 9:30 P.M. Eastern Standard Time. “The ambassador of the Russian Federation . . . confirmed that his president declared a war on my country.”

Reports of explosions in Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, and Kharkiv, an industrial city 26 miles from the Russian border, were first reported by media outlets on Twitter around 9:50 P.M., roughly 20 minutes into the Council gathering. As the ambassadors read prepared speeches one by one, most of them seemed oblivious to the news flashing across social media that Putin had formally declared war and blood was already spilling in Ukraine. Instead, the diplomats kept imploring Russia and Ukraine to avert such a disaster, revealing how UN ambassadors can often appear to be operating in an alternate universe.

In the Council, UN Secretary-General António Guterres also kept up his pleas for peace, which have been pointedly ignored — and now vilified — by Russia throughout the diplomatic efforts in the last few weeks by the UN leader and dozens of countries in the lead-up to the start of the war last night.

Close to midnight, Guterres told reporters that this is “the saddest moment in my tenure as Secretary-General of the United Nations. I started this meeting of the Security Council addressing President Putin and telling him from the bottom of my heart: Stop your troops from an offensive against Ukraine, give peace a chance because too many people have died.

During the meeting President Putin announced a ‘special military operation’ in the Donbas and required the Ukrainian troops to lay down their arms. So, in the present circumstances I must change my appeal. I must say, President Putin: In the name of humanity bring your troops back to Russia.”

“This war doesn’t make sense,” he added, his voice halting and weary.

Once it became clear that attacks were underway, some Council members spoke up about the news. “At the exact time as we are gathered in the Council seeking peace, Putin delivered a message of war,” US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said. “This is a grave emergency.”

Europeans chimed in. Briton’s ambassador, Barbara Woodward, described Russia’s attack as “unprovoked and unjustified,” while Ambassador Ferit Hoxha of Albania accused Russia of “attempting to destroy European security.” In her final remarks, Ireland’s ambassador to the UN, Geraldine Byrne Nason, grimly noted that “the path for diplomacy” and “the path for dialogue” were closed.

Ukraine had requested the Council meeting on late Wednesday afternoon, apparently aware that the war would start within hours. But in the chamber, Kyslytsya sat composed at first, repeatedly singling out Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia, who is the Council’s rotating president for February. (The United Arab Emirates will take the presidency on March 1.)

Kyslytsya’s tone shifted as more media reports swamped social media about the initial onslaught by Russia on its neighbor. “So now I would like to ask the ambassador of the Russian Federation to say on the record that at this very moment, your troops do not shell and bomb Ukrainian cities,” Kyslytsya said. “That your troops do not move in the territory of Ukraine. You have a smartphone you can call Lavrov [Russia’s foreign minister] now. We can make a pause to let you go out and call him.” Nebenzia stayed silent. (His speech to the Council and other replies to the Ukraine ambassador.)

“If you’re not in a position to give an affirmative answer,” Kyslytsya continued, “the Russian Federation ought to relinquish responsibilities of the president of the Security Council [and] pass these responsibilities on to a legitimate member of [the] Security Council . . . relinquish your duties as the chair. Call Putin, call Lavrov and stop [the] aggression. There is no purgatory for war criminals. They go straight to hell, ambassador.”

In response, Nebenzia eked out a response, saying Russian aggression was against the Kyiv “junta” and not the “Ukrainian people.” He adjourned the meeting, with him and his small delegation slipping out of the UN, avoiding the media standing outside the chamber. (Nebenzia did talk briefly to reporters when he entered the Council earlier, saying that he was “starting to enjoy nightly meetings.”)

After the meeting, Kyslytsya told PassBlue that he had called it because he knew that Russia would invade on Wednesday night.

The evening belied everything Russian diplomats have repeatedly said publicly for weeks: that their country had no intention of attacking Ukraine, even as Russian military was gathering tens of thousands of troops and armor around the border. Dmitry Polyanskiy, Russia’s deputy ambassador to the UN, tweeted on Feb. 20: “The Russian invasion of Ukraine will happen on 30th February this year. Put it in your diaries.”

The week’s tensions began to peak when Putin held a session with his country’s Security Council on Monday, Feb. 21. There, he signed a presidential decree recognizing the independence of the Donetsk and Luhansk territories, which have been occupied by pro-Russian separatists in the Donbas region since 2014. Shortly after signing the decree, Putin gave a lengthy speech on Russian TV, slamming Ukraine’s existence, cursing NATO and characterizing sanctions from the West as a form of “blackmail” designed to “restrain the development of Russia.”

(The US and Europe started slapping sanctions against Russia since the decree, and Germany killed the certification process to open the controversial Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia. More sanctions were imposed on Feb. 24, by the US and allies, described by the White House as “severe and immediate economic costs on Russia in response to Putin’s war of choice against Ukraine.”)

On Tuesday, the Duma, part of Russia’s parliament, signed off on Putin’s recognition of the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk entities, paving the way for troops and military equipment to be sent into Donbas, at Putin’s demand. On Wednesday, in response to alleged threats from Ukraine’s armed forces, Putin greenlighted a “special military operation” into the country, triggering war as most members in the the Security Council were attempting to make a last-ditch gamble to stop the conflict. (Putin actually cited Article 51 of the UN Charter to justify his actions, as it enshrines a nation’s right to self-defense if attacked.)

Earlier on Wednesday, in a broad show of support from UN member states for Ukraine, the General Assembly also met, trying to avoid the on-ramp to war. Many ambassadors bemoaned Russia’s willingness to dismiss the tenets of the UN Charter as well as to violate Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity — its right to exist as an independent country. Some countries suggested that the UN’s own future was at stake, citing the short-lived League of Nations from 1920.

China, which has been inching slowly from its neutral stance on Russia’s recent military actions in Ukraine toward a more reactive posture, said in the UN Assembly: “China’s position on safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states has been consistent. The purposes and principles of the UN Charter should be jointly upheld.”

Guterres has been repeatedly citing the UN Charter in his own peacemaking overtures on the Russia-Ukraine crisis. He emphasized in the Assembly that aspects behind the Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation Among States include “the sovereign equality of states” and the inviolable rights of a state’s “territorial integrity” and “political independence.”

“If the conflict in Ukraine expands,” Guterres continued, “the world could see a scale and severity of need unseen for many years. I urge all sides to allow safe and unimpeded access by humanitarian agencies, including non-government-controlled areas of eastern Ukraine. . . . I’m fully committed to support all efforts to resolve this crisis without further bloodshed. My good offices remain available. We cannot and will not relent in the search for a peaceful solution.”

In a fiery response, Nebenzia of Russia mocked Guterres’s offer of “good offices” in the Assembly.

“To our regret, Secretary-General of the UN recently and also today made several statements regarding the developments in the east of Ukraine,” Nebenzia said. “Those statements do not meet his status and authorities as defined by the UN Charter.”

“Specifically, on Ukraine,” he continued, “the Secretary-General never spoke up to stress the need for implementing provisions of the Minsk Package . . . no one in the West ever mentioned this, and unfortunately, the Secretary-General chose to follow suit. That said, we do not quite understand what good offices that the Secretary-General talked about he can actually offer.”

The Security Council plans to meet on Friday to vote on a draft resolution condemning Russia’s action “in the strongest terms possible,” US senior diplomats said in a Feb. 24 briefing. It’s unlikely to pass because of Russia’s veto power, but it will be a closely watched vote to see which Council members condemn Russia or, as Thomas-Greenfield has said, sit on the fence.
