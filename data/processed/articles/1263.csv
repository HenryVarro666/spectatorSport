This year marks the 50th year since establishing diplomatic relations between the two nations.

The Chinese president said that the trade volume between both nations has increased from $300 million to $100 billion, and the bidirectional investment stock has risen from almost zero to $50 billion. In this regard, he said that such trade achieved a new high in the past year. Chinese investment in Britain increased more than threefold, highlighting the active participation of UK-funded companies in the reform and opening up of China. Xi also said London had become the primary center for overseas RMB trade.

China and Britain have been coordinating and closely cooperating in essential fields, including global development and climate change despite their differences regarding internal conditions and paths of development, Xi said, adding that the two sides should adopt a mutual strategic and far-sighted approach, maintain an open and inclusive mentality, foster dialogue and communication, and broaden win-win cooperation.

Xi said China is willing to carry out dialogue and cooperation with Britain in a forthright, open, and inclusive way and expects Britain to see China and China-Britain relations objectively and impartially and work with China in the promotion of steady development of bilateral bonds.

The British Prime Minister, for his part, held in high regard Britain and China, noting that trade between both countries has seen rapid expansion and that Britain is very proud of the fact that Chinese students in the country exceed those of any other European country. He also said the two countries, which are permanent members of the UN Security Council, have common interests on many issues and can collaborate with each other in many fields.

Boris Johnson also said Britain is committed to holding frank dialogues with China, enhancing bilateral exchanges concerning economic and trade cooperation, and strengthening communication and coordination on global and regional issues such as climate change and biological diversity.

The two leaders took the opportunity to exchange views on the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Xi Jinping said China is willing to continue to play a constructive role in this regard, stressing that it is very important for the international community to promote peace talks, effectively establish conditions for resolving the conflict and encourage Ukraine's speedy return to peace.",https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/Chinese-President-and-British-PM-Have-Phone-Conversation-20220325-0014.html

Downing Street said the two leaders spoke on a range of issues of mutual interest, including the situation as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. It is expected that would have used the conversation to press Premier Xi to proactively work towards a peaceful resolution to the conflict.

The leaders discussed a range of issues of mutual interest including the situation in the Ukraine, a Downing Street spokesperson said, in a readout of the phone call.

It was a frank and candid conversation lasting almost an hour. They agreed to speak again soon, the spokesperson said.

Johnson is said to have started by expressing his sympathy with the victims of the Eastern plane that crashed with 132 people on board in southern last week.

President Xi asked the Prime Minister to convey his best wishes to Her Majesty the Queen on her Jubilee, Downing Street added.

The conversation comes soon after an emergency summit of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) military alliance, where NATO leaders issued a joint statement saying that must uphold the order including the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, as enshrined in the UN Charter, and to abstain from supporting Russia's war effort in any way, and to refrain from any action that helps Russia circumvent sanctions.

We are concerned by recent public comments by PRC (People's Republic of China) officials and call on China to cease amplifying the Kremlin's false narratives, in particular on the war and on NATO, and to promote a peaceful resolution to the conflict, the NATO statement reads.

Ahead of the summit in Brussels on Thursday, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters that western allies are concerned that China could provide material support for the Russian invasion.

The west has been exerting pressure on China, as one of Russia's closest allies, to use its influence over Russian President Vladimir Putin to bring an end to the conflict in Ukraine.

“It was a frank and candid conversation lasting almost an hour. They agreed to speak again soon,” the spokesman said.

In a statement following Thursday’s emergency Nato summit in Brussels, alliance leaders called on the Chinese government “to cease amplifying the Kremlin’s false narratives”.

They include unsubstantiated Russian claims – strongly denied by the US – that the United States is financing biological weapons laboratories in Ukraine.

A No 10 spokesman said: “Obviously, the Prime Minister has been talking with a lot of world leaders and quite regularly throughout the course of what has happened in Ukraine.

“This is part of the Prime Minister’s wider engagement with world leaders so he can set out our position on where we think the current situation is.”

US President Joe Biden, who spoke last week to Mr Xi, said he had pointed out that US and other foreign corporations were already pulling out of Russia because of President Putin’s “barbaric” behaviour.

“I made no threats, but I made sure he understood the consequences of him helping Russia,” Mr Biden told a news conference on Thursday at Nato headquarters.

“I think that China understands that its economic future is much more closely tied to the West than it is to Russia.”

It comes as UK intelligence suggested Ukrainian forces were driving the Russians back from around Kyiv.

The latest assessment from the Ministry of Defence said the Ukrainians were expected to continue to try to push the Russians away from the capital.

“Ukrainian counter-attacks, and Russian forces falling back on overextended supply lines, has allowed Ukraine to reoccupy towns and defensive positions up to 35 kilometres (22 miles) east of Kyiv,” it said.

In the south of the country, it said the Russian advance on the key Black Sea port city of Odesa was being slowed by “logistic issues and Ukrainian resistance”.

In the besieged city of Mariupol, the authorities said about 300 people died in a Russian airstrike earlier this month on a theatre where hundreds of people were sheltering.

If confirmed, it is likely to lead for renewed calls for Western powers to step up military support for the Ukrainian forces.

In an interview with BBC2’s Newsnight on Thursday, Mr Johnson praised their “Churchillian” leader Volodymyr Zelensky and said: “I think Ukraine can certainly win.”

“There’s a sense in which Putin has already failed or lost because I think that he had literally no idea that the Ukrainians were going to mount the resistance that they are, and he totally misunderstood what Ukraine is,” he said.

“And far from extinguishing Ukraine as a nation, he is solidifying it.”

However, Mr Johnson conceded it would be a challenge to give Mr Zelensky the tanks he has demanded to fight the Russian invaders.

The PM accepted Mr Zelensky wanted more from Nato, saying allies felt “agony” about their “inability to do more given the constraints we face”.

Nato leaders agreed on Thursday that Russia using chemical weapons would mark a “fundamental change” in the Ukrainian conflict that would be met with a “very severe response”.

However, a Western official declined to outline what the response would be, saying “we need to keep Putin guessing”.

Later, at a press conference, Mr Biden said there would be a “response in kind” but declined to spell out what that would involve.

“We would respond. We would respond if he uses it. The nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use,” he said.

Mr Johnson warned against allowing the threats over chemical, biological and nuclear weapons to become a “distraction”.

He said: “It’s intended to be a distraction from what is really going on and that is a savage attack with conventional means on innocent people in urban centres in Ukraine, absolutely barbaric use of artillery and mortars and rockets as I’ve described, thermobaric bombs included it now seems, that is what is going on.”",https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/ukraine-boris-johnson-xi-jinping-joe-biden-chinese-b990532.html

China is willing to continue playing a constructive role on this issue, Xi said on Friday afternoon during a phone conversation with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

Chinese President Xi Jinping urged the international community to ""make genuine efforts to promote peace talks"" when dealing with the Ukraine crisis, calling to ""create conditions"" for a political settlement of the matter.

The Chinese president hailed the growing bilateral trade over the decades. The trade volume between the two countries has increased from $300 million to $100 billion dollars, and the two-way investment stock has risen from almost zero to $50 billion, he pointed out.

Last year, bilateral trade reached a new high, and China's investment in Britain more than tripled, Xi said, adding that British-funded enterprises have actively participated in China's reform and opening-up, and London has become the world's largest offshore renminbi trading hub.

The two countries have coordinated and cooperated in such fields as global development and climate change, and have made positive contributions to tackling humanity's common challenges, Xi said.

Noting that China and Britain have different domestic conditions and development paths, Xi said the two sides should bear in mind a strategic and long-term perspective, respect each other, promote dialogue and communication based on openness and inclusiveness, and expand mutually beneficial cooperation.

Xi said that China is willing to conduct dialogue and cooperation with Britain in a frank, open and inclusive manner, and hopes that the British side can view China and China-Britain relations objectively, and work with China in promoting a continuous development of bilateral ties.

For his part, Johnson hailed the importance of the bilateral ties. Trade between Britain and China has been growing rapidly, and Chinese students in Britain outnumber those in any other European country, of which, he said, Britain is very proud.

Britain and China, two permanent members of the UN Security Council, share common interests on many issues and can work with each other on many things, he said.

The UK leader also said that Britain is willing to have candid dialogues with China, strengthen bilateral exchanges and cooperation, expand bilateral economic and trade cooperation and deepen communication and coordination on such global issues and regional hotspots as climate change and bio-diversity.

The two leaders held a 50-minute phone call described as “frank and candid” but apparently failed to reach agreement on how to respond to Vladimir Putin’s behaviour.

Mr Xi has sought to avoid either supporting or condemning the Russian invasion, abstaining in key United Nations votes while allowing state media to spread anti-Western propaganda about the war.

He is understood to be weighing up a request from Mr Putin for military aid to help Russia achieve its war aims.

A Downing Street spokesperson said on Friday: “The Prime Minister spoke to China’s President Xi Jinping earlier today.

On Ukraine, it added: “President Xi expounded on China’s principled position, stressing the need for the international community to make genuine efforts to promote peace talks, create conditions for a political settlement of the Ukraine issue, and facilitate an early return of peace in Ukraine.

UK Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan has suggested China could be hit with sanctions if it supplied arms to Russia, in the same way Belarus had been targeted with economic measures.
