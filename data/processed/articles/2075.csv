For the past two weeks since the Russians invaded, he's been barely sleeping, working 20 hours a day to feed the people of Russian-occupied Kherson. Each day, the 28-year-old bakes thousands of loaves of bread, loads them into his truck or car, and drives them through the deserted streets, delivering them to people who are increasingly being cut off from outside food supplies as Russian forces choke the city of nearly 300,000.

Kherson was the first major city to fall since the war began. Unified against a common enemy, Ukrainians are finding ways to resist — without even carrying a gun.

Before the war, Servetnyk was a successful chef — he won Ukrainian MasterChef in 2019, and ran a pizza restaurant in Kherson. But on Feb. 24, the Russians invaded Ukraine — and his life changed.

As the Russians shelled his country, Servetnyk and his partner drove to his parents' house in a village on the outskirts of Kherson, desperate to flee Ukraine.

So Servetnyk decided to stay and resist. Many of Kherson's bakers had either fled or gone into hiding, so Servetynyk turned his pizza restaurant into a bakery, and began making thousands of loaves of bread. To feed more people, he also roped in other bakers and distributed their bread, too.

LVIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia’s airplanes and artillery widened their assault on Ukraine on Friday, striking airfields in the west and a major industrial hub in the east, as Moscow’s forces tried to regroup from recent losses and their onslaught fast reduced crowded cities to rubble.

American defense officials offered an assessment of the Russian air campaign, estimating that invading pilots are averaging 200 sorties a day, compared with five to 10 for Ukrainian forces, which are focusing more on surface-to-air missiles, rocket-propelled grenades and drones to take out Russian aircraft.

New commercial satellite images appeared to capture artillery firing on residential areas between Russian forces and the capital. The images from Maxar Technologies showed muzzle flashes and smoke from the big guns, as well as impact craters and burning homes in the town of Moschun, outside Kyiv, the company said.

In a devastated village east of the capital, villagers climbed over toppled walls and flapping metal strips in the remnants of a pool hall, restaurant and theater freshly blown apart by Russian bombs.

Russian President Vladimir Putin “created this mess, thinking he will be in charge here,” 62-year-old Ivan Merzyk said. In temperatures sinking below freezing, villagers quickly spread plastic wrap or nailed plywood over blown out windows of their homes.

“We are not going away from here,” Merzyk said.

On the economic and political front, the U.S. and its allies moved to further isolate and sanction the Kremlin. President Joe Biden announced that the U.S. will dramatically downgrade its trade status with Russia and also ban imports of Russian seafood, alcohol and diamonds.

The move to revoke Russia’s “most favored nation” status was taken in coordination with the European Union and Group of Seven countries.

“The free world is coming together to confront Putin,” Biden said.

On the ground, Russia’s forces appeared to be trying to regroup and regain momentum after encountering heavier losses and stiffer resistance than anticipated over the past two weeks. Britain’s Ministry of Defense said Russia is trying to “re-set and re-posture” its troops, gearing up for operations against Kyiv.

“It’s ugly already, but it’s going to get worse,” said Nick Reynolds, a warfare analyst at Royal United Services Institute, a British think tank.

With the invasion in its 16th day, Putin said there had been “certain positive developments” in Russia-Ukraine talks, but gave no details.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy claimed Ukrainian forces had “reached a strategic turning point,” though he did not elaborate.

“It’s impossible to say how many days we will still need to free our land, but it is possible to say that we will do it,” he said via video from Kyiv.

Zelenskyy said authorities were working on establishing 12 humanitarian corridors and trying to ensure food, medicine and other basics get to people across the country. Thousands of soldiers on both sides are believed to have been killed in the invasion, along with Ukrainian civilians.

He accused Russia of kidnapping the mayor of one city, Melitopol, calling the abduction “a new stage of terror.” The Biden administration, citing American intelligence but no evidence, warned before the invasion of Russian plans to detain and kill targeted people in Ukraine. Zelenskyy himself would be a likely top target.

So far, the Russians have made the biggest advances on cities in the east and south while struggling in the north and around Kyiv.

Russia said it used high-precision long-range weapons to put military airfields in Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk in the west “out of action.” The attack on Lutsk killed four Ukrainian servicemen, the mayor said.

Russian airstrikes also targeted for the first time Dnipro, a major industrial hub in the east and Ukraine’s fourth-largest city, with about 1 million people. One person was killed, Ukrainian officials said.

In images of the aftermath released by Ukraine’s emergency agency, firefighters doused a flaming building, and ash fell on bloodied rubble. Smoke billowed over shattered concrete where buildings once stood.

The bombardment continued in Mariupol, where a deadly strike on a maternity hospital this week sparked international outrage and war-crime allegations.

Unrelenting attacks have thwarted repeated attempts to send in food and medicine and evacuate civilians from Mariupol, a city of 430,000. In a statement, the Mariupol mayor’s office said Friday that the toll of people killed during the now 12-day siege had risen to 1,582.

In the face of the unrelenting bombing, “the dead aren’t even being buried,” the mayor’s office said.

Elsewhere, temperatures were forecast to hit -13 degrees Celsius (8 Fahrenheit) in the eastern city of Kharkiv, which has come under heavy bombardment.

About 400 apartment buildings in Kharkiv lost heat, and Mayor Ihor Terekhov appealed to remaining residents to descend into the subway or other underground shelters where blankets and hot food were being distributed.

The latest assaults came a day after satellite photos appeared to show that the huge armored column that was stalled for over a week outside Kyiv had spread out near the capital.

Military analysts were divided over whether the maneuvering by the Russian convoy signaled the imminent start of a siege of Kyiv or was just an effort to disperse some vehicles to more protected positions. The photos showed howitzers newly set up in firing position, and armored units staged near the Antonov Airport north of the city, according to Maxar.

Americans point instead to other forces that are moving toward Kyiv from the northeast and are now about 20 to 30 kilometers (about 10 to 20 miles) east of the city center.

Hundreds of miles to the south of Kyiv, at Mykolaiv, shelling damaged a cancer hospital, according to the head doctor, Maksim Beznosenko. No one was killed.

The United Nations says it has verified 26 attacks on medical centers, medical workers or ambulances since the invasion began, with 12 people killed.

The U.N. political chief said Friday that the international organization had received credible reports that Russian forces were using cluster bombs in populated areas. The bombs scatter smaller explosives over a wide area and are prohibited in cities and towns under international law.

Russians and Ukrainians have held multiple rounds of talks near the Belarus border, and the two countries’ foreign ministers met again Thursday with no apparent progress. Various third countries have also made attempts to broker a stop to the fighting.

Some 2.5 million people have fled Ukraine since the invasion began, according to the United Nations.

Air raid sirens and shelling rang out over Kyiv and other major Ukrainian cities on Saturday morning amid warnings from western defence officials that the Russians were beginning to gain ground around the capital.

There were reports of loud explosions in Dnipro in the country’s east on Saturday, as well as Mykolaiv, Nikolaev and Kropyvnytskyi.

But Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said the capital was “ready to fight”. He called it a “city under siege”, with checkpoints prepared and supply lines in place. “Kyiv will stand until the end.”

Satellite imagery from Maxar Technologies on Saturday has shown homes and buildings on fire and Russian artillery battalions appearing to fire on towns surrounding to the north-west of the Ukrainian capital as forces advance. The Guardian has not independently verified the images.

A senior US defence official said at a Pentagon briefing on Friday: “We do assess that the Russians are beginning to make more momentum on the ground towards Kyiv, particularly from the east.”

The UK Ministry of Defence said on Saturday morning that “the bulk of Russian ground forces” were around 25km from the centre of Kyiv, while the cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Mariupol remain encircled and continued to suffer heavy Russian shelling.

However, the Institute for the Study of War, a US thinktank, said that Russian operations around Kyiv “remained largely stalled over the past 24 hours” to “resupply and refit frontline units” – an assessment shared by Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych, who said on Friday that the Russian advance had been halted over the past day.

Volodymyr Zelenskiy has called on Ukrainians to continue fighting, but said living conditions in the Kyiv region had deteriorated into a “humanitarian catastrophe” with disrupted gas, heating and water. The Ukrainian president said his country had reached a “strategic turning point” in the conflict. “It is impossible to say how many days we still have [ahead of us] to free Ukrainian land. But we can say we will do it,” he said. “We are already moving towards our goal, our victory.”

About 2 million people – half the population of the metropolitan area – had left the capital, the Kyiv mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said on Friday, and those who remained continued to prepare for its defence.

“Every street, every house is being fortified,” he said. “Even people who in their lives never intended to change their clothes, now they are in uniform with machine guns in their hands.”

Ukrainian soldiers described fierce fighting for control of the main highway leading into the capital, while missile strikes were reported hitting just outside Kyiv’s city limits on Friday.

“It’s frightening, but what can you do?” said Vasil Popov, a 38-year-old who works in advertising sales. “There is nowhere to really run or hide. We live here.”

Continuing Russian bombardments and attacks on civilians in cities across Ukraine have prompted warnings of “an unimaginable tragedy” and a new flurry of alarm from the UN that Russia is committing war crimes.

“We are really heading towards an unimaginable tragedy,” Stephen Cornish of Doctors Without Borders told Agence France-Presse, insisting “there is still time to avoid it, and we must see it avoided”.

Hundreds of thousands of civilians remain trapped and under fire in Ukrainian cities, but the situation in Mariupol is especially dire. Ten days into Russia’s siege, its population has no access to electricity or mobile phone networks, and water and food are running out. On Friday 7,144 people were evacuated from four Ukrainian cities, Zelenskiy said in a televised address – a much lower number than managed to leave in each of the two previous days.

Zelenskiy accused Russia of refusing to allow people out of Mariupol and said Ukraine would try again to deliver food and medicines there on Saturday.

Ukraine has repeatedly raised concerns that Moscow’s ally Belarus, which has served as a staging point for Russian forces, will soon have its troops drawn into the invasion. Ukraine’s state centre for strategic communications said Belarus might launch an invasion of Ukraine today, after a meeting in Moscow between the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and the Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko. Ukraine accused Russia of staging “false flag” air attacks on Belarus from Ukraine to provide an excuse for an offensive.

Putin and Lukashenko agreed on Friday that Moscow would supply its smaller neighbour with military equipment and mutual support against western sanctions, including on energy prices, the official Belarus state news agency BelTA said.

Foreign combatants have already entered the Ukrainian conflict on both sides, but the Kremlin has ramped up efforts to bring in reinforcements from Syria. Syria’s military has begun recruiting troops from its own ranks to fight alongside Russian forces in Ukraine, promising payments of $3,000 a month – a sum of up to 50 times more than a Syrian soldier’s monthly salary. A furious Zelenskiy accused Russia of hiring “murderers from Syria, a country where everything has been destroyed … like they are doing here to us”.

As the war continues, Russia faces an expanding net of sanctions. Western governments have announced plans to impose punitive tariffs on Russian trade to further isolate Moscow from the global economy. The G7 group of wealthy nations said it would strip Russia of “most favoured nation” status under World Trade Organization rules. The US president, Joe Biden, announced plans to ban the import of seafood, vodka and diamonds from Russia, and the UK government says it is planning to ban exports of luxury goods to Russia.

Deutsche Bank and Sony Pictures have joined the exodus of western businesses from Russia. In a statement posted on its website, Deutsche Bank said it was “in the process of winding down our remaining business in Russia” and that there “won’t be any new business in Russia”. Russia has moved to block Instagram after its parent company, Meta, said it would allow calls for violence against Putin and Russian soldiers involved in the invasion of Ukraine to appear on the social media platform. Russian prosecutors demanded that access to Instagram be blocked, and authorities moved to recognise Meta as an “extremist organisation”.

The US has also imposed sanctions on a group of Russia’s elite, including billionaire Viktor Vekselberg, three family members of Putin’s spokesman and members of parliament.

As Russian airstrikes and artillery fire continued to pound residential areas across the country, Ukrainian prosecutors said 90 children had now died in the conflict. The UN said it had confirmed 636 civilian deaths, but the real toll would be much higher.

UN data also showed that more than 2.8 million civilians had fled the onslaught since it began on 24 February, with millions more internally displaced. EU officials have said 5 million people may end up fleeing abroad and others have put the figure higher.

Multiple airstrikes again hit residential buildings in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and second city of Kharkiv on Monday, killing at least three people and wounding dozens more, authorities said.

One body was recovered and three people were hospitalised after a missile partially destroyed a nine-storey block of flats in Kyiv’s Obolon district, local officials said, with a second person killed later by falling missile fragments on a nearby street.

In Kharkiv, two people were killed by artillery fire on a residential street and a 15-year-old boy died from shrapnel wounds after shells hit a kindergarten in the nearby town of Chuguiv, approximately 25 miles (40km) south-east of the city.

At least nine people were also reportedly killed and nine more wounded in an airstrike on a television tower in Ukraine’s northern Rivne region. “There are still people under the rubble,” governor Vitaliy Koval said.

Some civilians were able to flee, with frontline towns around Kyiv being partly – if slowly – evacuated for a fifth consecutive day, according to the regional governor, Oleksiy Kuleba, who added that a ceasefire to allow civilians to leave was “holding, albeit it is very conditional.”

A senior official in President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office said more than 1,700 people had also been evacuated through humanitarian corridors in the eastern region of Luhansk, despite what Ukrainian authorities described as constant fire.

After several days of failed attempts to deliver supplies to Mariupol and provide safe passage out for trapped civilians, authorities said a local ceasefire was holding, with more than 160 private cars able to leave in what appeared to be the first successful attempt to evacuate civilians from the encircled and devastated city.

Andrei Rempel, a city council representative, said the southern port “continues to be bombed, but this road is not being shelled.” The council described the situation in Mariupol on Friday as “critical,” while the Red Cross has said conditions there were “apocalyptic.”

A Ukrainian presidential adviser, Oleksiy Arestovych, said more than 2,500 residents of the Black Sea city, many of whose residents have been without power, heat or water for more than two weeks, had died since the invasion began on 24 February.

Robert Mardini, director-general of the International Committee of the Red Cross, said the war had become “nothing short of a nightmare” for those living in such besieged cities. “The situation cannot, cannot continue like this,” he said. “History is watching what is happening in Mariupol and other cities.”

Some of those who have decided to stay in Kyiv said they were doing so because they were determined to help with their country’s defence.

“The sirens are going constantly, but one basically ignores them at this point,” said Maria Koudriavtseva, 37, a former marketing manager who is now a volunteer helping to make body armour and tank traps for the army.

“As we made the decision to stay and help the army until the end, we are staying and doing what we can,” she said. We’re in the centre and it’s relatively quiet. There are cars, the traffic lights are working,” she said. “But as you know there were serious attacks on Obolon and Kurenivka.”



Oleksandr Tanashchuk, a paramedic, said that for him “the situation hasn’t changed in the past week or so.” He said most people who wanted to leave had now done so and those who have stayed had made their choice.

“Either they are people who are active, like us, or people who can’t leave, or people who are like children, closing their eyes to the danger,” he said, adding that he believed Ukraine’s troops would be able to hold off the coming assault. The Russian force’s resources were becoming depleted, he said, and their morale was falling.

A close ally of Russian president Vladimir Putin, national guard chief Viktor Zolotov, said on Monday that Russia’s military operation in Ukraine had not gone as quickly as the Kremlin had wanted, blaming the lack of progress on what he said were far-right Ukrainian forces hiding behind civilians, an accusation repeatedly made by Russian officials.

Zolotov was contradicted by Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, however, who said the invasion was “going according to plan and will be completed on time and in full,” adding: “The defence ministry of the Russian Federation, while ensuring the maximum safety of the civilian population, does not exclude the possibility of taking major population centres under full control.”

Ukrainian authorities, meanwhile, denied Russian accusations that a Ukrainian missile in separatist-controlled Donetsk killed 20 people. The local separatist leader, Denis Pushilin, said the victims were waiting at a bus stop and an ATM.

Ukrainian military spokesperson Leonid Matyukhin, however, denied the allegation, saying the missile was Russian. “It is unmistakably a Russian rocket or another munition, there’s not even any point talking about it,” he said.

Peace talks between the two sides resumed on Monday, with Ukrainian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak stating they would continue on Tuesday via video after a “technical pause” to allow additional work by subgroups and clarification of terms.

While previous rounds had focused on humanitarian issues, the latest talks were aimed at achieving a ceasefire, securing Russian troop withdrawals and establishing security guarantees for Ukraine, Podolyak said, describing negotiations as “hard.”

Both sides had earlier reported progress, with Ukraine saying Russia was “beginning to talk constructively” and results may be possible “literally in a matter of days.” Russian delegate Leonid Slutsky suggested draft agreements may not be far off.

Zelenskiy said one aim was to set up a meeting between himself and Russian leader Vladimir Putin, with the ultimate goal of “Ukraine getting the necessary result for peace and for security,” but Russia said it had received no formal request for a meeting.

Washington and its EU allies have sent funds and military aid to Ukraine and imposed unprecedented economic sanctions on Russia, but ruled out any direct intervention, with the US president, Joe Biden, saying Nato fighting Russia “is world war three.”

The west has imposed sanctions on Russian billionaire oligarchs close to Putin, frozen Russian state assets and cut off much of the country’s corporate sector from the global economy in an attempt to force Moscow to change course.

Russia warned on Monday that while it had approved a temporary procedure for repaying its foreign currency debt, payments would be made in roubles if sanctions prevented banks from honouring debts in the currency of issue.

Several US officials have said Russia has also asked China for military equipment. The US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, who was due to meet China’s top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, in Rome on Monday, said China would “absolutely” face consequences if it helped Moscow evade western sanctions.

A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said US assertions that Russia asked Beijing for military equipment for its campaign in Ukraine were “disinformation” from the US, while the Kremlin said Russia had sufficient military resources to fulfil its aims without any need for help from China.

The UN secretary-general, António Guterres, said on Monday that an earlier decision by Putin to place Russia’s nuclear forces on higher alert was a “bone-chilling development,” adding that the once-unthinkable prospect of nuclear conflict “is now back within the realm of possibility.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/russia-ukraine-kyiv-air-strike-hostomel

Getting planes to Ukraine still under discussion: US

US Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has said the idea of arming Ukraine with warplanes transferred from Poland was still being considered.

“Exactly how to do that is still under discussion,” McConnell told reporters, adding that most senators supported the move.

The US last week rejected an offer by Poland to transfer Russian-made MiG-29 fighter jets to boost Ukraine’s air force in its defence against invading Russian forces.

War in Ukraine takes centre stage at Hungary’s election rallies

The war in Ukraine has taken centre stage in Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s election campaign as the populist leader attempts to win a fourth consecutive term.

“It is in our interests to not be a sacrificial pawn in someone else’s war. We can’t win anything in this war, but we have everything to lose,” Orban said.

Hungary has sought to balance its fraught relationship with its allies in the European Union and the NATO military alliance with its close ties to Russia.

Orban has agreed to back the sanctions imposed on Russia by the EU and condemned Moscow’s violent assault on Ukraine.

At least three million people have fled Ukraine: UN

At least three million people have sought refuge in neighbouring countries, according to a tally by the UN refugee agency (UNHCR).

Poland has taken in the largest share of the refugee population. An estimated 1.8 million people have crossed the border since the beginning of the Russian invasion on February 24.

Biden signs budget bill providing additional aid to Ukraine

US President Joe Biden has signed a bill providing $13.6bn in additional military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine as part of a $1.5 trillion government spending measure.

“Putin’s aggression against Ukraine has uniting people all across America, united our two parties in Congress, and united the freedom loving world,” Biden said.

Roughly half the $13.6bn will arm Ukraine and cover the Pentagon’s costs for sending US troops to other Eastern European nations that might see the war spill past their borders. Much of the rest will be allocated to humanitarian and economic assistance, strengthening regional allies’ defences and protecting their energy supplies and cybersecurity needs.

The Take podcast: Is Russia’s Syria playbook being used in Ukraine?

This week marks the anniversary of Syria’s uprising and there still seems to be no end to conflict in sight. There’s also another date that resonates: September 30, 2015, when Russia intervened on behalf of President Bashar al-Assad’s government.

“You can be 99 percent sure that Mykolaiv region will continue to hold back the advance of the Russian troops. There is the Bug River, which they need to force their way across in order to advance,” he said. “We will not give up the bridges to the invaders.”

Ukraine claims ‘more than 13,500’ Russian servicemen killed

Ukraine claims to have killed “more than 13,500” Russian servicemen since the invasion began on February 24.

The General Staff of the Armed Forces said that 404 Russian tanks, 1,279 armoured vehicles, 81 planes and 95 helicopters have been “destroyed”.

In a Facebook post, it added that the figures are being updated, and the verification is “complicated” by the high intensity of the fighting.

Russia’s Defense Ministry has reported the death toll only once, on March 2, saying that 498 servicemen had died in Ukraine – and claiming that 2,870 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on March 12 that 1,400 Ukrainian servicemen have been killed.

There is no way to verify the claims of both sides.

An adviser to the Ukrainian president’s chief of staff says the war in Ukraine is likely to be over by early May when Russia runs out of resources to attack its neighbour.

“I think that no later than in May, early May, we should have a peace agreement, maybe much earlier, we will see, I am talking about the latest possible dates,” Oleksiy Arestovich said in a video published by several Ukrainian media.

“We are at a fork in the road now: there will either be a peace deal struck very quickly, within a week or two, with troop withdrawal and everything, or there will be an attempt to scrape together some, say, Syrians for a round two and, when we grind them too, an agreement by mid-April or late April.”

A “completely crazy” scenario could also involve Russia sending fresh conscripts after a month of training, he said.

China in ‘tough spot’ amid Russia’s reported request for aid: Analyst

Brett Bruen, a former Obama administration official, says Russia’s invasion of Ukraine poses both risks and opportunities for China.

“China is in a tough spot at the moment because on the one hand, they see an opportunity with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to weaken the West and try to reorder the international order. But at the same time, there’s a whole number of risks … both economic and security,” he told Al Jazeera.

“The fact that this invasion has not gone according to plan is certainly concerning for Beijing and that is going to weigh heavily on their next move.

“China was fine to go along if this was going to be a quick and relatively easy invasion. The more complicated it gets, the more it complicates China’s position. What the Americans are doing right now is to publicly put that pressure on Beijing to force them into making a decision. And I think the near unanimity in the international community on this makes it even more challenging for Beijing to be an outlier.”

Can the UAE be a safe haven for Russia’s oligarchs?

The United Arab Emirates (UAE), and in particular, the emirate of Dubai, has a reputation for being a playground for the rich, and one that does not ask too many questions about how wealth has been obtained.

That looks likely to continue, despite increasing Western pressure to squeeze Russia financially – turning the UAE into an even more attractive proposition for rich Russians seeking a safe haven for their wealth and undermining the effort to force Russia to pull back from its invasion of Ukraine.

US official raises ‘deep’ concern over China’s alignment with Russia

US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has raised “deep” concerns over China’s alignment with Russia in an “intense” seven-hour discussion with China’s top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, a senior Biden administration official said.

In a statement, the White House said the pair discussed a range of issues in US-China relations, “with substantial discussion of Russia’s war against Ukraine”.

“They also underscored the importance of maintaining open lines of communication between the United States and China,” it said.

Welcome to Al Jazeera’s continuing coverage of the Ukraine-Russia crisis.

Read all the updates from Monday, March 14 here.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/14/russia-ukraine-talks-to-resume-amid-moscow-advance-liveblog
8,fbfbe81f-26af-4d82-a384-f374a93d49ce,['Yuras Karmanau'],2022-03-14 00:00:00,"LVIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia and Ukraine kept a fragile diplomatic path open with a new round of talks Monday even as Moscow’s forces pounded away at Kyiv and other cities across the country in a punishing bombardment the Red Cross said has created “nothing short of a nightmare” for civilians.

Shortly before dawn on Tuesday, large explosions thundered across Kyiv as Russia pressed its advance on multiple fronts.

Elsewhere, a convoy of 160 civilian cars left the encircled port city of Mariupol along a designated humanitarian route, the city council reported, in a rare glimmer of hope a week and a half into the lethal siege that has pulverized homes and other buildings and left people desperate for food, water, heat and medicine.

The latest negotiations, held via video conference, were the fourth round involving higher-level officials from the two countries and the first in a week. The talks ended without a breakthrough after several hours, with an aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy saying the negotiators took “a technical pause” and planned to meet again Tuesday.

The two sides had expressed some optimism in the past few days. Mykhailo Podolyak, the aide to Zelenskyy, tweeted that the negotiators would discuss “peace, cease-fire, immediate withdrawal of troops & security guarantees.”

Previous discussions, held in person in Belarus, produced no lasting humanitarian routes or agreements to end the fighting.

In Washington, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday that while the Biden administration supports Ukraine’s participation in the talks with Russia, Russian President Vladimir Putin would have to show signs of de-escalating in order to demonstrate good faith.

“And what we’re really looking for is evidence of that, and we’re not seeing any evidence at this point that President Putin is doing anything to stop the onslaught or de-escalate,” she said.

Overall, nearly all of the Russian military offensives remained stalled after making little progress over the weekend, according to a senior U.S. defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the Pentagon’s assessment. Russian troops were still about 15 kilometers (9 miles) from the center of Kyiv, the official said.

The official said that Russian forces have launched more than 900 missiles but that Ukraine’s airspace is still contested, with Russia not achieving total air superiority.

Overnight, air raid alerts sounded in cities and towns around the country, from near the Russian border in the east to the Carpathian Mountains in the west, and fighting continued on the outskirts of Kyiv. Ukrainian officials said Russian forces shelled several suburbs of the capital.

Ukrainian authorities said two people were killed when the Russians struck an airplane factory in Kyiv, sparking a large fire. The Antonov factory is Ukraine’s largest aircraft plant and produces many of the world’s biggest cargo planes.

Russian artillery fire also hit a nine-story apartment building in the northern Obolonskyi district of the city, killing two more people, authorities said.

And a Russian airstrike near a Ukrainian checkpoint caused extensive damage to a downtown Kyiv neighborhood, killing one person, Ukraine’s emergency agency said.

Kateryna Lot said she was in her apartment as her child did homework when they heard a loud explosion and ran to take shelter.

“The child became hysterical. Our windows and the balcony were shattered. Part of the floor fell down,” she said. “It was very, very scary.”

In an area outside Kyiv, Fox News reporter Benjamin Hall was injured while reporting and was hospitalized, the network said.

In Russia, the live main evening news program on state television was briefly interrupted by a woman who walked into the studio holding a poster against the war. The OVD-Info website that monitors political arrests said she was a Channel 1 employee who taken into police custody.

A town councilor for Brovary, east of Kyiv, was killed in fighting there, officials said. Shells also fell on the Kyiv suburbs of Irpin, Bucha and Hostomel, which have seen some of the worst fighting in Russia’s stalled attempt to take the capital, local authorities said.

Airstrikes were reported across the country, including the southern city of Mykolaiv, and the northern city of Chernihiv, where heat was knocked out to most of the town. Explosions also reverberated overnight around the Russian-occupied Black Sea port of Kherson.

Nine people were killed in a rocket attack on a TV tower in the western village of Antopol, according to the region’s governor.

In the eastern city of Kharkiv, firefighters doused the smoldering remains of a four-story residential building. It was unclear whether there were casualties.

In the southern city of Mariupol, where the war has produced some of the greatest suffering, the city council didn’t say how many people were in the convoy of cars headed westward for the city of Zaporizhzhia. But it said a cease-fire along the route appeared to be holding.

Previous attempts to evacuate civilians and deliver humanitarian aid to the city of 430,000 were thwarted by fighting.

Ukraine’s military said it repelled an attempt Monday to take control of Mariupol by Russian forces, who were forced to retreat. Satellite images from Maxar Technologies showed fires burning across the city, with many high-rise apartment buildings heavily damaged or destroyed.

The Kremlin-backed leader of the Russian region of Chechnya said on a messaging app that Chechen fighters were spearheading the offensive on Mariupol.

Robert Mardini, director-general of the International Committee of the Red Cross, said the war has become “nothing short of a nightmare” for those living in besieged cities, and he pleaded for safe corridors for civilians to leave and humanitarian aid to be brought in.

“The situation cannot, cannot continue like this,” he said. “History is watching what is happening in Mariupol and other cities.”

A pregnant woman who became a symbol of Ukraine’s suffering when she was photographed being carried from a bombed maternity hospital in Mariupol last week has died along with her baby, The Associated Press has learned.

Mariupol residents including Natalia Koldash rushed to shelter inside a building Sunday as an unidentified plane passed overhead.

“We have no information at all,” Koldash said. “We know nothing. It looks like we are living in a deep forest.”

Associated Press video showed debris from a damaged residential building and another building that a young man named Dima described as an elementary school.

“There was no military at this school,” he said. “It’s unclear why it was hit.”

The Russian military said 20 civilians in the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine were killed by a ballistic missile launched by Ukrainian forces. The claim could not be independently verified.

The U.N. has recorded at least 596 civilian deaths since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, though it believes the true toll is much higher. Millions more have fled their homes, with more than 2.8 million crossing into Poland and other neighboring countries in what the U.N. has called Europe’s biggest refugee crisis since World War II.

“All day crying from the pain of having to part with loved ones, with my husband, my parents,” 33-year-old refugee Alexandra Beltuygova said in the Polish border town of Przemysl after fleeing the industrial Ukrainian city of Dnipro.

“I understand that we may not see them. I wish this war would end,” she said.

Russia’s military is bigger and better equipped than Ukraine’s, but its troops have faced stiffer-than-expected resistance, bolstered by arms supplied by the West.

During a meeting in Rome with a senior Chinese diplomat, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan warned China against helping Russia.

Two administration officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information, said China had signaled to Moscow that it would be willing to provide both military support in Ukraine and financial backing to help stave off effects of Western sanctions, which include a fourth set of EU sanctions announced late Monday.

The Kremlin has denied asking China for military equipment to use in Ukraine.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that “Russia has its own potential to continue the operation” and that it was “unfolding in accordance with the plan and will be completed on time and in full.”
