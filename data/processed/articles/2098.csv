7:32 p.m.: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy used his nighttime video address to the country, which marked one month since Russia invaded the country, to urge people around the world to show support for Ukraine by gathering in their city centers and making themselves ""visible and heard.""

Security Council overwhelmingly defeated a Russian resolution that would have acknowledged Ukraine’s growing humanitarian needs -- but without mentioning the Russian invasion that caused the escalating crisis.

The Russian defeat came on the same day that the General Assembly started considering another draft resolution that clearly states Russia’s aggression is responsible for the humanitarian emergency in Ukraine.

“When the reserves of the Central Bank were frozen, no one would think, out of those who made predictions, what sanctions the West might apply,” Moscow’s top diplomat told students and staff at Moscow State Institute of International Relations, while slamming the West’s move as “thievery.”

“Russia must be made to never again be reliant on supplies from abroad,” he said, but added that Moscow would be “ready to cooperate” with the West in the future “if they want.”

11:36 a.m.: Russia will seek payment in rubles for gas sales from “unfriendly” countries, President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday, sending European gas prices soaring on concerns the move would exacerbate the region’s energy crunch, Reuters reported.

9:32 a.m. : NATO warned on Wednesday against Russia’s war in Ukraine sliding into a nuclear confrontation between Moscow and the West, Reuters reported. “Russia should stop this dangerous irresponsible nuclear rhetoric,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told the news conference. “Russia must understand that it can never win a nuclear war,” he said on the eve of a summit of the Western military alliance’s national leaders in Brussels. ""Any use of chemical weapons would totally change the nature of the conflict, it would be a blatant violation of international law and would have far-reaching consequences,"" Stoltenberg also said. “NATO is not part of the conflict ... it provides support to Ukraine but isn’t part of the conflict,” he noted. “But let there be no doubt about our readiness to protect and defend allies against any threat anytime,” he added.

7:08 a.m.: One of President Vladimir Putin's closest allies warned the United States on Wednesday that the world could spiral towards a nuclear dystopia if Washington pressed on with what the Kremlin casts as a long-term plot to destroy Russia, Reuters reported. Dmitry Medvedev, who was president from 2008 to 2012 and is now deputy secretary of Russia's Security Council, said the United States had conspired to destroy Russia as part of a ""primitive game"" since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union. The United States has repeatedly said that it does not want the collapse of Russia and that its own interests are best served by a prosperous, stable and open Russia.

6:30 a.m.: France said it was sending health and emergency equipment along with a group of fire engines and rescue vehicles to the Romania-Ukraine border for Ukraine’s emergency service to use.

Still, the German leader said Ukraine could rely on Germany’s help, citing the financial and military aid already provided, the harsh sanctions on Russia and the reception of hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian refugees.

He said it is being conducted “strictly in accordance with the plans and the purposes that were established beforehand.” He conceded, however, that Russia has not yet achieved its goals in Ukraine which we described as: to “get rid of the military potential of Ukraine,"" to ensure Ukraine is a “neutral country,” to get rid of “nationalist battalions,” and for Ukraine to accept that Crimea is part of Russia and its two breakaway regions are independent states. The interview was conducted by CNN’s Christiane Amanpour on Tuesday.

2,ecd250df-8bd8-4348-94fc-7a2ad47f7bc8,"['Di Francesco Pira', 'Di La Voce Di New York', 'Di Umberto Bonetti', 'Di Massimo Gagliardi', 'Di Elisabetta De Dominis', 'Di Ansa']",2022-03-21,"È tutto pronto per la spedizione europea del presidente statunitense Joe Biden, che questa settimana arriverà nel Vecchio Continente per partecipare ai vertici di NATO e UE e per incontrare il presidente polacco, a fronte di una recrudescenza dell’aggressione russa in Ucraina.

I primi impegni ufficiali di Biden si terranno giovedì 24 marzo a Bruxelles, un giorno dopo il suo arrivo (previsto il 23). Nella capitale belga, l’inquilino della Casa Bianca parteciperà infatti al summit straordinario della NATO, presieduto dal segretario generale dell’Alleanza Jens Stoltenberg. Tema principale dell’incontro sarà il sostegno difensivo-logistico all’Ucraina contro l’invasione russa e lo speculare rafforzamento dei meccanismi di deterrenza propri.

Nelle scorse settimane tanto il presidente Usa quanto il suo segretario della Difesa, Lloyd Austin, non hanno infatti perso occasione per ribadire come Washington “difenderà ogni centimetro del territorio NATO“, laddove i bombardamenti russi a Leopoli – situata ad appena 70 km dal confine con la Polonia, Stato membro – hanno avvicinato drammaticamente il conflitto al fianco est dell’Alleanza Atlantica.

I have convened an extraordinary Summit on 24 March at #NATO HQ. We will address #Russia’s invasion of #Ukraine, our strong support for Ukraine, and further strengthening NATO’s deterrence & defence. At this critical time, North America & Europe must continue to stand together. — Jens Stoltenberg (@jensstoltenberg) March 15, 2022

Nella giornata di giovedì, il capo di Stato di Washington presenzierà inoltre a un incontro tra i leaders del G-7 (incluso Mario Draghi), che si terrà sullo sfondo di un altro vertice, quello del Consiglio europeo che riunirà i capi di Stato e di Governo dei ventisette a Bruxelles.

La portavoce della Casa Bianca, Jen Psaki, ha inoltre rivelato che venerdì 25 il commander-in-chief farà visita al suo omologo polacco Andrzej Duda a Varsavia. “Il presidente – si spiega nel comunicato – discuterà di come gli Stati Uniti, insieme ai nostri alleati e partners, stanno rispondendo alla crisi umanitaria e dei diritti umani creata dalla guerra ingiustificata e non provocata della Russia contro l’Ucraina”.

Dei circa 3,3 milioni di rifugiati ucraini causati dall’attacco russo, infatti, quasi la metà ha trovato rifugio sul suolo polacco, e in particolare nella capitale – il che ha spinto Varsavia a chiedere aiuto all’UE attraverso una redistribuzione eurounionale dei profughi.

We will have additional details of @potus trip to Europe to announce later today. The trip will be focused on continuing to rally the world in support of the Ukrainian people and against President Putin’s invasion of Ukraine,

but there are no plans to travel into Ukraine. — Jen Psaki (@PressSec) March 20, 2022

“Non è in agenda alcun viaggio in Ucraina”, ha infine precisato Psaki, dopo il circolare di alcune indiscrezioni sulla possibilità che il presidente Usa incontrasse di persona gli amministratori di Kyiv – come simbolicamente fatto dai leaders di Polonia, Cechia e Slovenia una settimana fa.

Malgrado il ferreo impegno a “difendere ogni centimetro di territorio NATO”, Washington continua ad escludere l’istituzione di una no-fly zone sui cieli ucraini da parte della NATO (come invece richiesto dal presidente ucraino Volodymyr Zelens’kyj) e l’ipotesi, recentemente emersa, di una missione di peacekeeping a guida occidentale nell’ovest del Paese in guerra.

“Il presidente è stato molto chiaro sul fatto che non schiereremo truppe americane in Ucraina”, ha spiegato l’ambasciatrice statunitense all’ONU, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, ai microfoni della CNN. “Non vogliamo che la situazione degeneri in una guerra per gli Usa. Ma sosterremo i nostri alleati della NATO”.",https://www.lavocedinewyork.com/news/primo-piano/2022/03/21/usa-tutto-pronto-per-la-visita-in-europa-di-joe-biden/

取り急ぎ以下貼っておきます。

As not a small number of people in the world had thought, the first negotiation for ceasefire did not reach an agreement. The invasion continued, and Japanese media’s coverage has become more detailed.

Our company’s websites will basically stop following lines themselves of the invasion from now on, and for now will return to normal – our economy-oriented style including other issues.

We really hope that innocent people of Ukraine – an independent country – will not be damaged anymore, and that all the attacks including military assaults will be stopped as soon as possible.

世界中で少なからぬ人が予想したとおり第一回停戦協議は妥結せず、侵略が継続され、我が国の報道も詳細になってきました。

弊社サイトでは今後、戦線自体を追うことを基本的には止め、他件を含めた経済中心に戻します。

独立国ウクライナの罪無き国民がこれ以上各種被害を被らないよう、攻撃ほか一切の加害行為が一刻も早く止められることを切に望んでいます。

All the human beings need to control ourselves NOT to make fake news, unlaid opinions, etc., at this perilous moment, because human beings are not so smart.

And, of course, if China can mediate appropriately, it must be very welcome.
