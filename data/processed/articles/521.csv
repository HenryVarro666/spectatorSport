This was reported by RBC-Ukraine with reference to an interview with the adviser to the head of the President’s Office Mykhailo Podoliak for wp.pl.

According to him, today the Russian and Ukrainian delegations remain in their positions, and the settlement of disputed issues may take from several days to a week and a half. During this time, the parties must move closer to a peace agreement.

“Once the work on the agreement is completed, we will begin to organize a meeting (Putin and Zelensky – ed.). This will happen in the coming weeks. The place does not matter to us. It can be any place except Russia,” – Podoliak noted.

He also noted that the Ukrainian side is not yet focusing on whether Zelensky will be able to shake hands with Putin.

“Once the foundations of the peace treaty are developed, we will consider the appropriate model of behavior at the meeting of presidents. The issue of handshakes worries us the least,” he added.",https://hindustannewshub.com/russia-ukraine-news/a-meeting-between-putin-and-zelensky-may-take-place-in-the-coming-weeks-podoliak/

After three weeks of all-out war, Ukrainian officials have begun to show “a degree of cautious optimism” about the talks underway with Russia. On March 16, Ukrainian presidential advisor Oleksiy Arestovych even suggested that Kyiv “should reach an agreement with Russia now or within a week or two.” In a special interview for Meduza, Kit journalist Elizaveta Antonova spoke with Mykhailo Podolyak — an advisor to President Volodymyr Zelensky’s chief of staff, who has been taking part in the negotiations. Here’s how he assessed the prospects of a peace deal.

Please note. The following interview has been edited and abridged for length and clarity. You can read the full Q&A in Russian here.

Why is the Ukrainian President’s Office “optimistic” about the negotiations?

The Russian Federation proceeded to wage this war on the basis of specific analysis. After fighting for 21 days, [Russia] is already assessing the damage that it’s inflicting, primarily on itself, in a different way. During this time, [the Russian leadership] has become much more realistic in assessing, among other things, their negotiating platform and those risks they will continue to face. This change in rhetoric and behavior causes us a degree of cautious optimism.

We really see a desire to reach some kind of compromise draft agreement — I’m not saying “peace agreement” yet. They certainly weren’t expecting the standing Russia has acquired in the world, the negative response, or the unified package [of sanctions] that has been imposed on them. All of this brings them back to real politics. Where Ukraine is right and makes completely reasonable demands: a ceasefire and for all [Russian] troops to withdraw to the positions they held before February 24. Then we can discuss certain things — including political and humanitarian [issues].

Meduza

With the standing Russia now has, it’s no longer to discuss these things in terms of ultimatums. Whether we will [reach an agreement] in two days or in two weeks is a tactical question. But there’s an understanding on their side of the correctness of some of our logical arguments.

How has Russia adjusted its demands?

They’ve adjusted them on the whole. Even in public statements. You’ve [probably] noticed how the rhetoric of Russian political figures has changed. At first, they even publicly said, “We’ll bring everyone to their knees in two days, we’ll destroy the Nazis right now.” Of course, we were shocked by this, because it’s a completely distorted view of what was actually happening in Ukraine. These public statements in the first week and a half were some kind of hysterics. Now, we’re hearing much more moderate, restrained, and realistic [statements]. Their general approach has become much more down to earth, so to speak.

At the same time, in the space of 21 days, the invasion has made all of Ukraine totally anti-Russian. This will be a problem for us. If before 30 to 40 percent of the population had a rather neutral or even somewhat positive attitude towards the Russian Federation, and were prepared for some kind of dialogue, then after this “special operation” — that was thought up by very “talented” military leaders and analysts — 99 percent of Ukraine’s population has become totally anti-Russian. Now, of course, all of these humanitarian problems, language problems, and so forth, will be very difficult to discuss.

In general, this [all] looks very strange. The Russian Federation has invaded [Ukraine]. But there’s a paradox: they didn’t bomb Western Ukraine — the main devastating blows have been to cities in Eastern Ukraine, where, before February 24, there really were more or less pro-Russian sentiments. They carried out massive airstrikes on residential neighborhoods where the Russian-speaking population lives. Do you see the absurdity? “We’ll make you fall in love with the Russian language by bombing [you].” It just looks ridiculous.

Which demands has Russia rejected?

Mr. Medinsky [Vladimir Medinsky, Russia’s former Culture Minister and the head of the Russian delegation at the negotiations] has already announced some models. Although we agreed not to announce anything until we have 90 percent agreement on everything. But Russia, as always, is playing some games to its own detriment.

The main thing for us is that it’s fundamentally not just a peace agreement — this doesn’t suit us. And the old security system, where NATO played a dominant role, doesn’t suit us either. We were moving towards NATO, we were, in fact, their junior partner. During the war we needed advisory assistance — or at least the possibility of accelerated weapons purchases. Then, on February 25 [the day after Russia invaded], NATO didn’t even invite us to their summit. They were afraid. And [now] we understand that this entire post-war security architecture doesn’t work in Europe anymore. The OSCE [like NATO] is also failing to provide security.

We have a formula that we’ve put on the negotiating table — a Ukrainian model of security guarantees. It suggests that there will be no bilateral agreement between Russia and Ukraine, but rather a multilateral agreement, a package agreement that a number of countries will take part in — their number is still being discussed. [But it will be] five to seven countries.

How important is it for Kyiv that a future agreement on security guarantees for Ukraine involve nuclear powers like France, the UK, and the United States?

Very important. Unfortunately, today it’s impossible to predict how the Russian political elite are making decisions. So if Ukraine manages to form a new alliance, we want it to accurately respond to all modern risks. After all, we will be at its center as a country that has come under attack. We want our partner countries that sign this agreement with us to have the same capabilities as the Russian Federation. Both in terms of conventional and nuclear weapons.

In addition, we’re suggesting a Swiss model for the army, with a certain number of reserves that undergo continuous training. This is the best model for a country like Ukraine with a neutral status. The details are still being discussed.

Clearly this new alliance is impossible without the involvement of the United States, correct?

Of course. Consultations are underway with a number of countries, and President Zelensky is in constant communication with Joe Biden, among others. Some of our closest partners are really interested in this. I would very much like to note the efforts of Turkey, Poland, and Israel. Despite the fact that there’s a rather difficult situation in the region and that it [would be] very sensitive for Israel if Russia were to increase its support for Iran or Hamas, Israel is nevertheless taking on the role of an active mediator.

Against the backdrop of the war, Ukraine now understands how joint defense should work in such situations. I think that many will like it — and many will join this new type of alliance.

The Financial Times reported that Ukraine and Russia had drafted a 15-point peace plan that includes a ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian troops, Ukraine declaring neutral status and reducing the size of its army, and Kyiv refusing to join NATO.

There aren’t 15 points. There are key, basic points: the end of the war, a ceasefire and the withdrawal of troops, security [guarantees] for Ukraine. Everything else is little extras. There are still territorial discussions, but they will be the subject of [separate] negotiations between the presidents, because these are painful issues.

As for refusing one thing or another — this is some very strange inside information, I don’t know where people get it.

What key aspects are non-negotiable for Ukraine?

The key aspects are a ceasefire, an immediate withdrawal of troops, and the signing of an agreement that has security guarantees — and where a number of countries will act as guarantors. Within the framework of this package, there will be an agreement with the Russian Federation that it also undertakes to guarantee Ukraine that there won’t be future wars. Russia has to understand the risks it will face next time. Without this, it makes no sense to end the war.

If we sign a bilateral agreement with Russia [then what]? After all, what’s the problem with the Russian Federation? Just a few days ago, Mr. Lavrov [Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov] said, in all seriousness, that “Russia never attacks anyone — and never attacked Ukraine either.” These people’s worldview is so warped. He’s on air on a European television channel and says, in all seriousness, “We aren’t attacking Ukraine.”

What we probably need is for people all over the world not to be afraid and to respond to this [and say]: “Mr. Lavrov, you are telling a lie. This means we shouldn’t have direct relations with you. You can’t come here even as foreign minister. Because you’re lying.” This would probably be an effective tool for returning the Russian elite to an honest position.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the topic of sanctions came up at the talks. The head of the Russian delegation, Vladimir Medinsky, also said this is one of the key topics of negotiations at each meeting. Is Moscow asking Kyiv for help lifting Western sanctions?

Moscow’s position is obvious. Undoubtedly, the sanctions packages imposed by European countries, the United States, and adhering states are extremely painful for Russia. I think that the sanctions policy is working brilliantly and really makes [them] think.

But there are two points here. First, Ukraine isn’t the one imposing the sanctions and so we can’t lift them. Second, the war is being broadcast live, there are thousands of foreign journalists working on it, drones are flying, everyone can see that Russian troops are killing civilians. It’s all being recorded. These are already proven, legally recorded crimes. I don’t understand why the world, seeing these crimes, would lift these sanctions.

The Russian Federation has to understand that you can’t simultaneously deploy soldiers who violate the rules of war and fight against civilians, and at the same time calmly demand that the sanctions be lifted tomorrow.

This is a difficult negotiation process. Of course, we’ll take part in it. These sanctions were imposed by the global community, not by Ukraine. In addition, lifting these sanctions should depend on specific actions: even if you withdraw troops, you’ve already destroyed a certain amount of infrastructure, let’s take this into account.

The Kremlin considers Crimea part of Russia, and now it also recognizes the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk “People’s Republics” as independent states. Is Kyiv prepared to make at least some concessions or compromises in this area?

This is the negotiating position they have requested. For us, Ukraine’s territorial integrity is inviolable. For us, these territories are de jure the ARK [the Autonomous Republic of Crimea] and the ORDLO [a Ukrainian abbreviation that stands for “certain areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions”]. We don’t know what “LDNR” [an abbreviation for the self-proclaimed “Luhansk and Donetsk People’s Republics”] is. For us, these territories are still legally part of Ukraine.

But we have temporarily lost effective control of [these territories], and they’re under Russian administration now. This is the status quo, I’m prepared to name it — but, I repeat once again, we can’t voice our positions in the negotiations as of yet. Unlike the Russians, we adhere to agreements.

What do you think about Medinsky as the key negotiator from Russia? Why, in your opinion, did Vladimir Putin choose him?

I’m definitely not ready to talk about the motivations behind the composition of the Russian delegation. But I can say that Mr. Medinsky is extremely constructive, he’s intellectual, and he evaluates [our] arguments, he listens to [our] arguments. Perhaps you’ve historically perceived him differently, as the culture minister — I’m not prepared to give an assessment here, this is your domestic politics. But in the negotiation process I would say he behaves emphatically correctly and properly. He understands [our] arguments — this is very important.

Medinsky said that the key issues for Russia are the status of Crimea and the Donbas, as well as “denazification.” What are your thoughts on this?

These issues can be discussed, they’re on the table, [but] not in this form, of course. The wording differs significantly. However, these are all the negotiating positions of the Russian Federation. Ukraine has its own point of view on all of these points. But these are very subtle matters, we’ll express our vision when the Ukrainian delegation believes that a compromised position has been reached.

Are the humanitarian corridors for evacuating civilians working now?

There’s a subgroup that deals with humanitarian corridors, there’s a subgroup of the Russian Federation [and] there’s the Red Cross, which acts as an intermediary. Some of the corridors are working, we’re taking people out of some places. And some of the corridors — for example, in Mariupol — are not working.

There must be some personal reasons for turning this city into ruins — into total ruins, like Aleppo — and driving people to madness. Probably, it’s some kind of tactical idea from the Russian Defense Ministry’s General Staff. What they’re doing there is beyond comprehension. They encircled the city, invented some story about Nazi battalions. And they’re bombing this city every day. Almost everything has been destroyed already, and people have no opportunity to get out.

REPORT FROM MARIUPOL

‘They bury their neighbors wherever they can’ A Ukrainian journalist describes life under Russian siege in Mariupol.

Our Deputy Prime Minister [Iryna] Vereshchuk is working on the humanitarian corridors very intensively. And on prisoner exchanges, too. Because the number of captured Russian soldiers is also inconceivable. There’s more than 500–600 men. We also can’t give you the bodies of your soldiers, they’re lying in the fields, because the hostilities don’t stop.

The Russian Federation hardly has any concern for either the search for the dead, or the exchange of prisoners, or humanitarian corridors so that people don’t have problems with food, water, and medicines. This is very strange. After all, everything is being recorded. We really can’t understand it. Yes, it’s war, but aren’t there some rules?

Did you offer to exchange these 500 prisoners of war?

We’ve made constant offers within the framework of the working group to remove the bodies and do an all-for-all [prisoner] exchange. The Russian Federation is acting as it always does — it pretends to agree to something, and then it begins…

On March 16, Zelensky addressed the U.S. Congress and asked, among other things, for the establishment of a no-fly zone over Ukraine. Aren’t you afraid that this will provoke Russia to act more forcefully, including by using nuclear forces?

Of course it’s a bit of a fantastic story. We still think that we’ll reach a peace agreement, a package of solutions. Because the war is extremely destructive for Russia. And [it would be] a hundred times more destructive if tactical nuclear weapons were used. In principle, it would be desirable for European politicians to stop thinking that [the Russian Army] is such a big threat. May they make some responsible decisions.

Close the sky, let civilians stop dying, if there’s still war — okay, let there be war. At least it [would be] a war between armies. Let [Russia] prove that it knows how to fight, and not just how to bomb peaceful cities. That’s all we want. Close the sky — let the guys come down to earth at long last! That said, they’re very skillful at fighting with cruise missiles. They probably put a star on their shoulder boards for bombing Kharkiv’s city center.

Everyone who regularly watches Zelensky’s video messages pays attention to his appearance…Is he getting any sleep? And in general, how do you work in a city that’s under fire?

Mr. Zelensky allocates his time very carefully, he’s an extremely effective manager. He, simultaneously, effectively manages defense initiatives and the military economy, for example — and he’s already thinking about how to rebuild the country. He also spends part of time keeping himself in good shape. But we’re all getting little sleep. This is war. [We get] two, three, four hours. Our sirens are constantly going off in the city. We’re always in work mode because operational management in wartime is not quite the same as in peacetime. You can't exactly sit down in a restaurant with a cocktail. Our restaurants aren’t even open.

Finally, a question about Putin. Do you think the invasion of Ukraine was the result of his preoccupation with history?

To be honest, I’m not ready to analyze the motivations behind your leaders’ conduct. I understand that in Russia people often draw conclusions without knowing the facts. But I don’t know what [information] they relied on, I don’t know where they get their analysis, or what they read. For me it’s a completely different reality. All of their assessments were based on initially false operational information. They don’t know Ukraine.

""The time has come for a meeting... it is time to talk,"" he was quoted as saying by news agency Reuters.

Ukraine’s stand on peace talks

“Key questions during the negotiations include security guarantees, a ceasefire, the withdrawal of Russian troops, and the political resolution of disputed territories,” Podolyak, a member of the Ukrainian negotiating group, said on Friday. The presidential adviser also ruled out the question of giving up any Ukrainian land. “This process may drag longer given the number of mutually exclusive positions.There are some concessions that we definitely aren’t going to make. We cannot give away any territories,” Podolyak told Bloomberg.

A few days before Moscow's offensive was launched last month, Russian president Vladimir Putin signed a decree to officially recognise the independence of two separatist regions in eastern Ukraine - Donetsk and Luhansk. However, Ukraine maintains its core position that it retains sovereignty over areas occupied since 2014 by Russian and pro-Russian forces.

Russia’s stand on peace talks

Dmitry Peskov, spokesperson of the Russian president, said on Friday that they are ready to work ""around the clock"" for negotiations and peace talks but the Ukrainian side has failed to ""show such zeel"". ""Our delegation is putting in colossal effort. Our delegation is ready to work around the clock - but unfortunately we don't see such zeal from the Ukrainian side,"" he was quoted as saying by Reuters. Moscow has previously said it was close to agreeing a formula that would keep Ukraine neutral, one of its demands.

A fourth straight day of talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators took place by videolink on Friday, but both sides said that an agreement is yet to be reached. Putin has shown little sign of relenting, even though punitive Western sanctions are damaging his country's economy.

Russia-Ukraine 5 rounds of talks so far

Round 1: Russian and Ukrainian officials held their first ceasefire talks on day five of the war near the Ukraine-Belarus border. Russia continued to target residential areas in Ukraine after first talks on Feb 28 had failed to secure a breakthrough.

Round 2: The second round of talks between Russia and Ukraine was held on March 3. Both sides left several hours of negotiations without a cease-fire agreement and war continuing to rage.

Round 3: Russian and Ukrainian negotiators held the third round of talks on March 7. While the talks, held in Belarus, failed to achieve significant results, Mykhailo Podolyak said that there was some small progress in improving the logistics of humanitarian corridors in Ukraine, ANI reported.

Round 4 of peace talks: The fourth round of talks between two countries were held on March 14, on the 19th day of the Russian invasion. The Russian forces continued the onslaught to capture the Ukrainian capital city of Kyiv. Mariupol, Kherson, Yavoriv and other prominent cities continued to be attacked by missiles and shells as talks failed.

Round 5: As the fifth round of peace talks concluded between Russia and Ukraine on March 15, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said early Wednesday that the position of both countries sounded more realistic but more time was required. ""The meetings continue, and, I am informed, the positions during the negotiations already sound more realistic. But time is still needed for the decisions to be in the interests of Ukraine,"" Zelensky said in a video message.

More than 9,000 civilians were evacuated from combat zones on Friday, reports said, including almost 5,000 from the besieged southern city of Mariupol as the Ukraine war continues. 222 people have been killed in the capital alone since the start of the war, according to rough estimates, including 60 civilians and four children. The UN rights office has reported 816 confirmed civilian deaths in the war-torn nation so far.

On 24 February 2022, Ukraine was suddenly and deliberately attacked by land, naval and air forces of Russia, igniting the largest European war since the Great Patriotic War. The military buildup in preceeding months makes it obvious that the unprovoked and dastardly Russian attack was deliberately planned long in advance. During the intervening time, the Russian government had deliberately sought to deceive the world by false statements and expressions of hope for continued peace.

""To initiate a war of aggression... is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole."" [Judgment of the International Military Tribunal]

Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine in response to the appeal of the leaders of the ""Donbass republics"" for help. That attack is a blatant violation of the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. Putin stressed that Moscow's goal is the demilitarization and denazification of the country.

On 16 March 2022, Putin said ""all diplomatic possibilities were completely exhausted. We were simply left with no options to peacefully solve problems that arise through no fault of ours. And in this regard, we were simply forced to launch a special military operation.... I note that Ukraine, encouraged by the United States and a number of Western countries, purposefully prepared for a scenario of force, bloody massacre and ethnic cleansing in the Donbass. A massive attack on the Donbass and then on the Crimea was only a matter of time. And our Armed Forces thwarted these plans.... They beat indiscriminately, in the squares, with fanaticism and frenzy of the doomed - like the Nazis, who in the last days of the Third Reich tried to drag as many innocent victims as possible with them to the grave....

""And the truth is that the current problems faced by millions of people in the West are the result of many years of actions by the ruling elites of their states, their mistakes, myopia and ambitions. These elites are not thinking about how to improve the lives of their citizens in Western countries. They are obsessed with their own vested interests and super profits. Evidence of this is the data of international organizations, which directly say that social problems, even in leading Western countries, have only worsened in recent years, that inequality is growing, the gap between rich and poor, racial and national conflicts are making themselves felt. The myth of the Western welfare society, of the so-called golden billion, is collapsing....

""I am not at all judging those who have a villa in Miami or the French Riviera, who cannot do without foie gras, oysters or so-called gender freedoms. The problem is absolutely not in this, but, I repeat, in the fact that many of these people, by their very nature, are mentally located precisely there, and not here, not with our people, not with Russia....

""But any people, and even more so the Russian people, will always be able to distinguish true patriots from scum and traitors and simply spit them out like a midge that accidentally flew into their mouths, spit them out on the panel. I am convinced that such a natural and necessary self-purification of society will only strengthen our country, our solidarity, cohesion and readiness to respond to any challenges.""

Russia must immediately stop the military operation in Ukraine, launched on February 24. The corresponding decision was made by the International Court of Justice. The Russian Federation should suspend the conduct of the military operation, ""the purpose and objective of which is the prevention and punishment of the alleged genocide in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions of Ukraine,"" said President of the Court Joan Donoghue, reading out the decision on interim measures. She also called on the parties to the conflict to refrain from actions that could aggravate the conflict, and recalled that court decisions on interim measures are binding.

The International Criminal Court (ICC) will investigate the actions of all parties to the conflict in Ukraine, ICC prosecutor Karim Khan said at a briefing in the city of Medyka in eastern Poland. I opened an investigation because I clearly see that there is every reason to believe that the actions for which liability is provided within our jurisdiction have been committed. They must be investigated, the prosecutor said. ""This applies to all parties to this conflict,"" he stressed. Zbigniew Ziobro, Minister of Justice and Prosecutor General of Poland, who took part in the briefing, said that prosecutors in the republic had already collected more than 300 testimonies from witnesses of the situation in Ukraine.

The USA will supply Ukraine with versions 300 and 600 of Switchblades kamikaze UAV developed by AeroVironment. President Biden announced an additional $800 million in security assistance to Ukraine, bringing the total U.S. security assistance committed to Ukraine to $1 billion in just the past week, and a total of $2 billion since the start of the Biden Administration. The new $800 million assistance package includes 800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems; 2,000 Javelin, 1,000 light anti-armor weapons, and 6,000 AT-4 anti-armor systems. In addition to the U.S.-produced short-range air defense systems the Ukrainians have been using to great effect, the United States has also identified and is helping the Ukrainians acquire additional, longer-range systems on which Ukraines forces are already trained. Reportedly Slovakia had preliminarily agreed to provide Ukraine with the S-300 air defense system. Jim Sciutto reported ""US & NATO allies are sending several surface-to-air missiles systems to Ukraine. A senior US official tells me these systems include Soviet-era SA-8, SA-10, SA-12 and SA-14 mobile air defense systems, w/range higher than Stingers, giving capability to hit cruise missiles"".

According to the US Defense Department, Chernihiv remains isolated, but Ukrainians are working to keep a line of communication open. Mariupol is likewise isolated and still suffering heavy bombardment. Russian forces are still on the outskirts of Kharkiv, where, as before, they face stiff Ukrainian resistance. US Intelligence observed no apparent movement toward or past Mykolaiv. While there are some LSTs operating in the northern Black Sea, the US was not seeing any imminent amphibious movement toward Odesa.

""There are no changes to the air picture to report. The Russians have now fired more than 950 missiles. There are no new strikes into western Ukraine to report. We assess that the Russians have approximately 90% of their combat power available to them; same for the Ukrainians. We have seen no movement of Russian forces stationed elsewhere in Russia being deployed to the west to reinforce the BTGs the Russians already have in Ukraine. And weve seen no evidence of Russian efforts to flow in additional supplies from inside Russia or from elsewhere. But we have reason to believe the Russians are considering their resupply and manning options. We still have no indications of Belarus inserting troops or preparing to do so.

""We have no updates on the convoy. It is still stuck. We have nothing to report with respect to Russian chemical or biological weapons. We cannot confirm Ukrainian reports of the deaths of senior Russian officers. ""Security assistance from the United States and other nations continues, to include over the last 24 hours. We will not detail the specifics, but these shipments did include weapons.""

MilitaryLand.net reported that on the left bank of Dnieper, Russian forces reached the Ukrainian defense line Kropyvnya, Zakharivka, Olyva, Kukharska and also the town of Poliske in the north. Ukrainian staff also reports heavy battles in the vicinity of Irpin and Bucha. The Russians attempted to capture Makariv, but Ukrainian forces repelled the attack. The towns near Makariv, namely Ozershchyna, Lypivka, Sloboda remains contested, and neither side has full control over them.

Ukrainian Territorial Defense units are conducting defensive operations in Talaivka, Nedryhailiv and Oleshnya. Russian forces tried to enter the Sumy outskirts during the night, but the Ukrainian defense repelled the attack.

Ukrainian forces pushed Russians out of immediate outskirts of Kharkiv. Pyatykhatky and Ruski Tyshky is under Ukrainian control and there are clashes in Bezruky and Oleksandrivka. Russian forces maintain position around Chuhuiv, namely in Kochetok and Mylinivka. Ukrainian troops continue to defend the southern part of Izium, Russia controls the northern part. All bridges in the town are destroyed, which limits Russian movement across the river.

The Russians assaulted Rubizhne, Sievierodonetsk, Lysychansk and Popasna. Russian troops didnt reach the assigned goal and retreated to original positions in the evening. Ukrainian troops launched a counter-attack towards Svatove and captured several minor settlements.

Russian forces entered Mariupol and captured a hospital. The Russians reportedly has taken the doctors and patients as hostages and was firing towards Ukrainian positions from the hospital. In the east, Russian troops pushed alongside the sea and forwarded element reached the river of Kalmius.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has given strict orders from the outset to avoid civilian casualties and extensive property damage, retired US Army Colonel Douglas Macgregor told the Grayzone. This has slowed the Russians advance to the point where it has given false hope both to the Ukrainians but seized on by people in the West, to try and convince the world that a defeat is in progress, when in fact the opposite is the case, Macgregor said. The war, for all intents and purposes, has been decided, the retired colonel said. The entire operation from day one was focused on the destruction of Ukrainian forces. Thats largely complete.

The Max Seddon in Riga, Roman Olearchyk in Kyiv and Arash Massoudi in London for the Financial Times reported that Ukraine and Russia had drawn up a neutrality plan to end war. Mykhailo Podoliak, Adviser to the Head of the Office of President of Ukraine said ""FT published a draft, which represents the requesting position of the Russian side. Nothing more. Ukraine has its own positions."" The fifteen-point draft deal would involve Kyiv renouncing Nato ambitions in return for security guarantees. The deal would involve Kyiv renouncing its ambitions to join Nato and promising not to host foreign military bases or weaponry in exchange for protection from allies such as the US, UK and Turkey.  Kyiv would keep its army but can't host foreign bases, and the Russian language would get legal status in Ukraine. Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior adviser to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, told the Financial Times that any deal would involve the troops of the Russian Federation in any case leaving the territory of Ukraine captured since the invasion began.

The goal of Russia in the negotiations with Ukraine has not changed, Moscow needs a peaceful, free, neutral and independent Ukraine, said the head of the Russian delegation, presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky. ""The goal of Russia in these negotiations is exactly the same as the goal of Russia, which was set at the very beginning of the special military operation. We need a peaceful, free, independent Ukraine, neutral - not a member of military blocs, not a member of NATO, a country that is our friend , a neighbor with whom we are developing relations together, building our future, and which is not a springboard for military and economic attacks against our country. Therefore, our goal does not change,"" Medinsky said.

Statements from Kyiv on the exclusion of the item on the denazification of Ukraine from the agenda of the negotiations are not entirely true, said the head of the Russian delegation, presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky. ""No, this is not entirely true. The topic of denazification and tougher punishment, law enforcement, in the first place, punishments for glorifying Nazism, neo-Nazism, extremism based on them, is still an important item on the agenda of the talks,"" Medinsky said.

The Ukrainian authorities expect to receive ""absolute security guarantees"" of the country, obliging the participants in the corresponding possible agreement to protect Ukraine, said Mikhail Podolyak, adviser to the head of the presidential office of Ukraine. The Austrian or Swedish version of a demilitarized state in Ukraine is now being discussed, it can be considered as a compromise, said the press secretary of the President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Peskov. ""This option, which is indeed being discussed now, and which can be seen as a certain compromise,"" Peskov replied.

Anders Åslund suggested that Ukraine should demand from Russia if it succeeds in defeating the Russian troops and drives them out of Ukraine:

Russian guarantees that it will stay out of Ukraine in the future, reinforced by some credible international guarantee. No new Budapest 1994 memorandum! Return of Crimea and Donbass. Very substantial reparations, $200 billion, for the restoration of Ukraine. That could be taken out of the $400 bn of Russian Central Bank reserves that have been frozen by Western countries. Guaranteed access to the Sea of Azov.

President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky called on the US Congress to impose sanctions against all current Russian politicians, and also demanded that all American companies leave Russia. He also urged the US Congress to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine or supply it with S-300s and other air defense systems, as well as military aircraft, as an alternative.

Russia's special military operation in Ukraine is developing successfully and is proceeding strictly in accordance with plans, Russian President Vladimir Putin said. According to the Russian leader, ""Ukraine, encouraged by the United States and a number of Western countries, purposefully prepared for a military scenario, a bloody massacre and ethnic cleansing in the Donbas."" ""Massive attack on the Donbass and then on the Crimea was only a matter of time, and our armed forces thwarted these plans,"" Putin said.

The President of the Russian Federation pointed out that ""in Kyiv they were not only preparing for war, for aggression against Russia, against the Donbass, they were waging it."" Attempts to organize sabotage and terrorist underground in Crimea have not stopped, in recent years hostilities in the Donbass, shelling of peaceful settlements have continued, he listed, adding that almost 14 thousand civilians, including children, have died during this time.

Putin said that if Russian troops stopped at the borders of the Lugansk and Donetsk People's Republics, this would not be the final decision and would not remove the threat to Russia. What I want to emphasize and ask you to pay attention to is that if our troops acted only on the territory of the peoples republics, helped them liberate their lands, this would not be the final decision, would not lead to peace and would not eliminate the threat to our country at the root"" Putin said.

I repeat, we had no other option for self-defense, for ensuring the security of Russia, except for conducting a special military operation. And all the tasks set will, of course, be solved, the president emphasized. Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that the inhabitants of Donbass had been subjected to genocide for eight years. ""We are meeting at a difficult time when our armed forces are conducting a special military operation in Ukraine and Donbass. Let me remind you that at the very beginning of it, in the early morning of February 24, I publicly and openly named the reasons and the main goal of Russia's actions is to help our people in Donbass, which for almost eight years by the most barbaric methods - a blockade, large-scale punitive actions, terrorist attacks and constant artillery shelling - were subjected to real genocide,"" Putin said. And for what? Only because they were seeking elementary human rights: to live according to the laws and traditions of their ancestors, to speak their native language, to raise their children the way they want, the president added.

Aviation and air defense of Russia during the day shot down one Ukrainian Mi-24 helicopter and six drones. This was stated by the official representative of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, Major General Igor Konashenkov. The Russian Armed Forces disabled communications, intelligence, relaying and switching centers in the city of Vinnitsa with a long-range high-precision weapon strike.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that aircraft hit 128 military facilities in Ukraine in a day. Aviation and air defense systems of the Russian Aerospace Forces shot down three Ukrainian aircraft and four drones, said the official representative of the department, Major General Igor Konashenkov. ""Operational-tactical, army and unmanned aircraft hit 128 military facilities of Ukraine. Among them, one Buk-M1 air defense system, one Osa air defense system, four radar stations for detection and target designation, four command posts, seven weapons and ammunition depots and 68 places accumulation of military equipment,"" he said.

The Russian National Guard and military personnel of the Russian Armed Forces successfully repelled the attack of Ukrainian neo-Nazis on the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station, the press service of the department reported. ""The battalion-tactical group of the Russian Guard, together with the military personnel of the RF Armed Forces, successfully repelled the attack of neo-Nazis who were trying to recapture the station, and did not allow any casualties among the personnel,"" the message said.

Servicemen of the Lugansk and Donetsk People's Republics are undergoing special training and retraining courses to master the Javelin and NLAW anti-tank missile systems, the Russian Defense Ministry said. ""The captured Ukrainian military equipment and weapons of Western countries are being transferred to units of the People's Militia of the Luhansk and Donetsk People's Republics for use in combat operations against Ukrainian nationalists. To master the samples of Javelin and NLAW anti-tank missile systems, the military personnel of the Luhansk and Donetsk People's Republics undergo special training and retraining courses,"" - reported in the military department.

More than 20 thousand volunteers, including from other countries, expressed their readiness to participate in hostilities to protect the Donetsk People's Republic, said the head of the DPR, Denis Pushilin. Those volunteers for whom there is complete data that got into the central office so that you can ask for their support at any time are now more than 20 thousand. The list of countries is quite extensive, there is even the United States, he said.

Units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine fired 60 rockets from the Grad multiple launch rocket system at the settlements of the Donetsk People's Republic, including Donetsk, the DPR representative office at the Joint Center for Control and Coordination of the ceasefire regime said.

The Paris edition of l'Humanité recalled that the French Foreign Ministry called on French citizens to refrain from traveling to Ukraine. Nevertheless, the Ukrainian embassy, the newspaper points out, posted a questionnaire online for ""foreigners ready to fight."" According to her, the volunteers are offered to sign ""an indefinite contract for the entire period of hostilities."" Referring to the data of the General Directorate of Internal Security of France and the Directorate of Intelligence and Security of the Ministry of the Armed Forces of the Republic, l'Humanité indicates that there are currently about 70 volunteers from France in Ukraine. According to the newspaper, most of them are ""ultra-radicals who sympathize with such neo-Nazi formations as the Azov battalion.""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke to the United States Congress, thanking its members for the support the US has offered his country and asking for more. The Ukrainian leader called on US President Joe Biden to be a leader for peace. He repeated calls for a no-fly zone over Ukraine, but failing that asked for more defence systems. He also called for continued and widening sanctions to include any Russian politician supporting the invasion of Ukraine, for the US to close ports to Russian goods, and US businesses to leave Russia.

""This is a terror that Europe has not seen, has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for a reply, for an answer to this terror from the whole world. Is this a lot to ask for? To create a no-fly zone over Ukraine to save people? Is this too much to ask? Humanitarian no-fly zone is something that Russia would not be able to terrorise our cities.

""If this is too much to ask, we offer an alternative. You know what kind of defence systems we need; S-300 and other similar systems. You know how much depends on the battlefield on the ability to use aircraft, powerful, strong aviation to protect our people, our freedom, our land. Aircraft that can help Ukraine, help Europe. And you know that they exist and you have them, but they are on Earth, not in the Ukrainian sky. They do not defend our people....

""Today, the Ukrainian people are defending not only Ukraine, we are fighting for the values of Europe, and the world, sacrificing our lives in the name of the future. Thats why today, the American people are helping not just Ukraine, but Europe, and the world to keep the planet alive. To keep justice in history....

""As the leader of my nation, Im addressing to President Biden: You are the leader of the nation, of your great nation. I wish you to be the leader of the world. Being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace. Thank you. Glory to Ukraine.""

Biden for the first time called Vladimir Putin a ""war criminal"" over the Russian president's bloody invasion of neighboring Ukraine. ""I think he is a war criminal,"" Biden told reporters shortly after he announced an extra $800 billion weapons aid package for Ukraine. The U.S. administration had avoided using the phrase until now, even when asked directly.

The Senate of the US Congress unanimously approved a resolution condemning Russia for its actions against Ukraine. The document also calls for holding the leadership of the Russian Federation to account for allegedly committed war crimes on Ukrainian territory. The meeting was broadcast on the website of the upper chamber. The resolution approved by the senators contains ""condemnation of the Russian Federation, President Vladimir Putin, members of the Russian Security Council, the Russian Armed Forces and Russian military leaders for committing outrageous acts of aggression and other acts of cruelty amounting to crimes against humanity and war crimes against the people of Ukraine and other [peoples].""

Ukraine is a member of the European family and is currently the strongest defender of its values, Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jansa said following a meeting in Kyiv between the heads of government of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. ""In my opinion, at the moment it is absolutely certain that Ukraine is the country that most strongly defends European values. You are members of the [European] family, stay brave and you will win. Together we will manage,"" he said.

NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg has said that the alliance is looking to deploy ""substantially more forces"" to its eastern flank in light of Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. ""On land, our new posture should include substantially more forces in the eastern part of the alliance, at higher readiness, with more pre-positioned equipment and supplies,"" Stoltenberg told a news conference at the end of an emergency meeting of the alliance's defense ministers in Brussels. But Stoltenberg said that NATO does not plan to deploy forces to Ukraine.

Two days after China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi met with US national security advisor Jake Sullivan in Rome, Chinese Ambassador to the US Qin Gang reiterated China's stance on the Ukraine crisis and hit back at recent rumors and disinformation spread by some US politicians, whose conducts have showed the country's true face of ""an empire of lies"" by passing the buck to China, despite knowing that the cause of the crisis is the NATO's eastward expansion.

In an opinion piece by Qin published in The Washington Post, the ambassador refuted recent media reports that claim ""China had prior knowledge of Russia's military action,"" demanded that ""Russia delay it until the Winter Olympics ends,"" and Russia was ""seeking military assistance from China."" Qin wrote in the article""Let me say this responsibly: Assertions that China knew about, acquiesced to or tacitly supported this war are pure disinformation. All these claims serve only the purpose of shifting blame to and slinging mud at China"".

One thing that is eye-catching is that the Ukrainian side announced that it had killed four Russian generals, and the Russian side also admitted several of them, which is surprising. Having lost so many generals in one battle, is the Russian army a big victory or a big defeat? According to the Ukrainian side, the four Russian generals they killed were: the deputy commander of the 41st Army Major General Andrei Sukhovitsky, the deputy commander of the 41st Army Major General Vitaly Gerasimov, the Russian Army Major General Andrey Kolesnikov, Commander of the Eastern Military District, and Major General Mehmet Tushayev of the 141st Motorized Column of the Chechen Army.

In this list, the deaths of Major General Andrei Sukhovitsky and Major General Vitaly Gerasimov have been confirmed by the Russian army. Although the Russian side did not say much about this, the death of a general-level person still shows that the Russian army has also suffered certain losses. But so far, the Russian army still occupied the initiative.

Entrepreneur and blogger Veronika Belotserkovsky became one of the first defendants in a criminal case on the public dissemination of deliberately false information about the actions of the Russian Armed Forces. She faces a fine of 3 million rubles to 10 years in prison.

18th March 2022 – (Kyiv) Ukrainian Presidential Advisor Mykhailo Podolyak said on Thursday it would take between a few days and a week and a half for Ukraine and Russia to reach a peace agreement, the Ukrainian online media outlet Liga.net reported.

Kiev wants to fix in detail a specific plan for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine in the peace deal, said Podolyak, who is also a member of the Ukrainian delegation to the peace talks with Russia.

If the agreement is inked, it would allow Ukraine and Russia to end the acute phase of the conflict, he added.

On Wednesday, Podolyak said that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky may hold talks with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in the coming days.",https://www.dimsumdaily.hk/ukrainian-presidential-advisor-says-ukraine-russia-may-agree-on-peace-deal-within-week-and-half/
