WARSAW, April 4 (Reuters) - Germany is the main roadblock to imposing tougher sanctions on Russia, Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Monday during a news conference, adding that Hungary was not blocking them.

His comment comes after Prime Minister Viktor Orban won a national election on Sunday after facing criticism over an insufficiently tough stance on Russian aggression in Ukraine.

""We have to see that, regardless of how we approach Hungary, this is the fourth such win and we have to respect democratic elections ... it's Germany that is the main roadblock on sanctions. Hungary is for the sanctions,"" Morawiecki said.

Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki called on the European Union to take ""take immediate and decisive action"" towards Russia, specifically calling out France and Germany.

Morawiecki during a news conference on Monday said Germany was the main roadblock to tougher sanctions against Russia, Reuters reported.

""We have to see that, regardless of how we approach Hungary, this is the fourth such win and we have to respect democratic elections ... it's Germany that is the main roadblock on sanctions. Hungary is for the sanctions,"" Morawiecki said.

Morawiecki was referencing Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who won his election despite criticism of not being tough enough on Russia. Morawiecki said unlike Germany, Hungary was in support of sanctions.

Reuters reported that German Finance Minister Christian Lindner on Monday rejected calls to sanctions Russian gas, which Germany heavily relies on.

""We are dealing with a criminal war,"" Lindner said before talks with his EU colleagues in Brussels. ""It is clear we must end as quickly as possible all economic ties to Russia. We must plan tough sanctions, but gas cannot be substituted in the short term. We would inflict more damage on ourselves than on them.""

The Associated Press reported that Morawiecki also called out French and German leaders by name for not doing enough including, French President Emmanuel Macron.

""President Macron, how many times have you negotiated with Putin? What have you achieved? ... Would you negotiate with Hitler, with Stalin, with Pol Pot?"" Mateusz Morawiecki asked. ""Chancellor Scholz, Olaf, it is not the voices of German businesses that should be heard aloud in Berlin today. It is the voice of these innocent women and children.""

Morawiecki called Russian President Vladimir Putin's rule of Russia a ""totalitarian-fascist state,"" and described the atrocities in Bucha as a ""genocide.""

In an interview with France-Inter radio on Monday, translated by the AP Macron said there was ""clear evidence"" of war crimes in Ukraine and that he's ""in favor of a new round of sanctions and in particular on coal and gasoline,""

In a Facebook post on Monday, Morawiecki said the West can no longer ""turn their eyes away"" from what Russia is doing in Ukraine.

""Leadership isn't cowardice or calculations. It's an uncompromising fight against evil. It commits us to do everything we can to prevent further genocide crimes,"" he wrote.",https://www.businessinsider.com/poland-slams-france-germany-not-taking-tougher-actions-russia-2022-4

""It is not the voice of German businessmen or of German billionaires, who have surely been trying to prevent more steps being taken [against Russia], which should be heard in Berlin today,"" Mr Morawiecki added.

""It is the voice of all the innocent women and children, the voice of the murdered people who should be heard by the German people, and by all German politicians,"" he added, in an apparent appeal to Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

Mr Morawiecki also appealed to Emmanuel Macron to close diplomatic channels with Vladimir Putin, as the French President's attempts to talk down the Kremlin leader had failed.
