Good morning.

We meet here at the NATO Headquarters facing the most serious security crisis in a generation.

We will address this crisis together and address the threat that means for Ukraine, for NATO and for the whole international rules-based order.

President Zelensky will address the NATO leaders.

The leaders will focus on our support to Ukraine. Allies have provided support to Ukraine for several years and we have stepped up with more military support, financial support, humanitarian support to help Ukraine uphold its fundamental right for self-defence.

NATO's core task is to protect and defend all Allies.

We have increased our military presence in the eastern part of the Alliance.

The NATO leaders will today address the need for a reset of our deterrence and defence in the longer term.

And the first step is the establishment of four new battlegroups in the eastern part of the Alliance in Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia.

We need to do more, and therefore we need to invest more.

There is a new sense of urgency and I expect that the leaders will agree to accelerate the investments in defence to meet the pledge we have made to invest more in defence.

And I welcome that several Allies have already made announcements on investing more in defence.

The meeting today will demonstrate the importance of North America and Europe standing together facing this crisis.

We are the strongest Alliance in the world. And as long as we stand together, we are also safe.

Thank you.

Hadley Gamble (CNBC): I want to get a sense from you of NATO's understanding of President Putin's actual mental state at this point, because what we understand of course, is that even his central bank governor is trying to leave her post and he's being… he's seeing some defection, if you will, from his inner circle. What's your sense of his mental state at this point?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: President Putin has made a big mistake and that is to launch a war, to wage war, against an independent sovereign nation. He has underestimated the strength of the Ukrainian people, the bravery of the Ukrainian people and the armed forces, and therefore they're also meeting much more resistance than they expected. We need, in a way, to address the actions that we see Russia is doing in Ukraine. And that's also the reason why we have significantly stepped up the support to Ukraine, and why we have increased the presence of NATO troops in the eastern part of the Alliance and increased the readiness of our troops. We do so to be able to respond and address any threat, any challenge to our security, and what kind of decisions… and what kind of decisions they make in Moscow, I will not speculate further about that.

Ukrainian media: [inaudible]

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: NATO Allies provide significant military support to Ukraine. NATO Allies have trained tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers who are now on the front line fighting against the invading Russian forces. The Ukrainian army is much better equipped, much better trained, much better commanded now than in 2014. And the combination of the training and support from NATO Allied countries with the bravery and the courage of the Ukrainian Armed Forces is enabling the Ukrainians to really resist and actually fight back the invading Russian Army. We provide Ukraine also with advanced air defence systems, with anti-tank weapons, with ammunition and fuel. So Allies are providing many different types of support. But we have also made it clear that we will not send in NATO troops on the ground, or NATO planes in the air. We do that because we have a responsibility to ensure that this conflict does not escalate beyond Ukraine. That will cause even more suffering, even more death, even more destruction. And to declare a no-fly zone over Ukraine means that we need to impose it, and to impose a no-fly zone means that we need to massively attack Russian air defence systems in Russia, in Belarus and in Ukraine, and also be ready to shoot down Russian planes. And then the risk for a full-fledged war between NATO and Russia will be very high, and that will cause more deaths and more destruction.

Bloomberg: You mentioned yesterday that if chemical weapons are used in Ukraine it could have a direct impact in NATO countries. Could this be considered an attack on a NATO Ally?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: I will not speculate beyond saying the following, that any use of chemical weapons would fundamentally change the nature of the conflict. It will be a blatant violation of international law and it will have widespread and severe consequences. The seriousness of using chemical weapons of course becomes even more obvious knowing that there is a risk always for contamination, for that chemical agents are spread over bigger areas. So this will be a catastrophe for the people of Ukraine, but of course there is also a risk that we can see the spread of chemical agents also into NATO territory. I will not speculate beyond the fact that NATO is always ready to defend, to protect and to react to any type of attack on a NATO Allied country.

ARD: How concerned are you about China’s role in this? And my second question, what does the new military posture of NATO mean in terms of national defence spending?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: On national defence spending, I see a new sense of urgency among Allies. They all understand that since we now need to do more – we face the most serious security crisis in a generation, so therefore, we need to invest more in our security. And the Allies understand that the only way to do that is also to allocate more money for national defence budgets. And I expect Allies to agree to accelerate the implementation of the commitments we have made to invest more in defence. And I welcome the decision, for instance, by Germany to spend 2% of GDP on defence. This will really make a difference because Germany has such a big economy, so the increased investments by Germany makes a different for the whole Alliance.

We call on China to join the rest of the world in clearly condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine and not provide political support. And of course, neither provide any kind of material support to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Question: If Allies were to unanimously ask you to stay on as General Secretary today, would you say yes?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: So I will leave that decision to the 30 leaders to decide. I don't have any further comments.

Danish television: Would you call what is happening in Ukraine now a genocide? And if so, what kind of responsibility does NATO have to prevent a genocide?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: NATO is providing unprecedented support to Ukraine, helping them to defend themselves. NATO Allies are also imposing unprecedented sanctions on Russia to hamper, reduce the capability of Russia to finance this war against Ukraine. And we are also, of course, making sure that we are ready to protect and defend all Allies. What we have seen is attacks against civilians, civilian infrastructure, and this is a clear violation of international law. I therefore also welcome that the International Criminal Court has started an investigation and will look into this, because at the end it has to be this body that decides on issues related to violation of international law.

Georgian public broadcasting: Yesterday, you mentioned that it's important to protect other partners as well. What about Georgia, and do we see some statements about Georgia at the end of the communique of NATO?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: I expected that Allies also today… or today in the meeting, that the leaders today in the meeting will express their support to partners which are under pressure from Russia and that includes of course, Georgia. Georgia has the right to choose its own path. NATO Allies have provided support for Georgia over many years to help them to implement reforms, to modernise the defence and security institutions. And the brutal invasion of Ukraine just highlights, underscores the need to provide support to Georgia.

Pro TV Romania: Mr Secretary General, given the war in Ukraine, what is NATO's view regarding possible permanent NATO bases, presence, in Romania? And regarding the battlegroup, will it be made up of the troops that have already been sent from US, Belgium, France in Romania in the past month, or there will be additional troops from other countries?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: So NATO has already increased its military presence in Romania. We have deployed the elements of the high readiness joint task force led by France. I visited Romania a few weeks ago and I also met with the troops from the United States and from other countries, and they will demonstrate the commitment to stay and to protect and help to defend NATO territory also in Romania. These troops will be there as long as necessary. But this is part of the immediate response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Then I expect at the meeting today that the leaders will start the process that will provide us with advice to make more longer term decisions on our longer term deterrence and defence, because we need to reset our deterrence and defence. These decisions, I expect leaders to take them at the summit later on in June. So these are two different processes, one is what we already have done, and that will be there as long as necessary. And then we are addressing the more longer term changes in our deterrence and defence. The fact is that we face the most serious security crisis in a generation and therefore NATO needs to respond. And that's the reason why we need to reset our deterrence and defence for the long term. Thank you.",https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_193611.htm

Stoltenberg who was speaking at a press conference ahead of a NATO summit in Brussels replied to a question on the organisation's contribution to support Ukraine amid the ongoing war situation. Speaking on the organisation's resistance from sending NATO troops or NATO planes in the war-hit nation, he said that NATO has a responsibility to ensure that the conflict does not escalate beyond Ukraine.

Further speaking on Ukraine's repeated requests of imposing a no ""fly-zone"" over the country, he said,

To declare a no-fly zone over Ukraine means that we need to impose it, and to impose a no-fly zone means that we need to massively attack Russian air defence systems in Russia, in Belarus and in Ukraine, and also be ready to shoot down Russian planes. And then the risk for a full-fledged war between NATO and Russia will be very high, and that will cause more deaths and more destruction.

NATO chief calls Putin's actions a ""big mistake""

Meanwhile, hitting out at Russian President Vladimir Putin, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg accused slammed Putin over his actions in Ukraine and said that he has made a big mistake by invading Ukraine and launching a war against an independent sovereign nation.

Further asserting that NATO will continue to stand in support of the Ukrainian people and their country, he added ""We have increased the presence of NATO troops in the eastern part of the Alliance and increased the readiness of our troops"".

The NATO chief also said that Putin underestimated Ukraine's people and its armed forces.

Mr. Zelenskyy appeared to be bowing to reality in an address to President Biden and other top officials while pressing Western powers for more planes, tanks and missiles “without restrictions.”

“The alliance can still prevent the deaths of Ukrainians from Russian strikes, from Russian occupation, by giving us all the weapons we need,” Mr. Zelenskyy said from Kyiv. His government still controls the capital city a full month after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops across the border.

The Ukrainian leader expressed thanks for Western military aid supplied so far, but he could not hide his frustration that more help was not forthcoming. He said he asked for the no-fly zone on Feb. 24, the day Russia invaded, and that Kyiv has yet to get a definitive answer from the West on requests for tanks, fighter jets and other military assets.

“This is the worst thing about war. We’re not to have a clear answer from the West to requests for help,” he said.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg insisted that NATO would not set up a no-fly zone mission in Ukraine because it would ultimately necessitate direct attacks on Russian assets.

“A no-fly zone means that we need to take out Russian air defense systems in Russia, which are covering their airspace over Ukraine,” Mr. Stoltenberg said. “And it means that we have to be ready to shoot down Russian planes. That will most likely lead to a full-fledged conflict.”

Behind the back-and-forth was a deeper, long-running strategic debate about a relatively new wartime tool that has been used only three times — and never in a conflict involving a major world power such as Russia. Although Mr. Zelenskyy appeared to recognize reality in his remarks to NATO leaders, Kyiv for weeks had argued that the U.S. and its NATO partners must establish and enforce a no-fly zone in its skies. He said a no-fly zone was one of the few ways to give the Ukrainian military a fighting chance to stop Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion for good.

The Biden administration and its European allies have steadfastly rejected passionate pleas from Mr. Zelenskyy and others who say the West’s air power could save tens of thousands of lives and preserve the democratically elected government in Kyiv.

Specialists say a no-fly zone would guarantee that U.S. jets would be forced to shoot down Russian planes or target Russian ground missile batteries that call Washington’s bluff. In Iraq and Bosnia, no-fly zones were contested by the enemy and led to direct confrontations with the U.S. military.

In perhaps the most famous incident, a U.S. F-16 piloted by Air Force Capt. Serbian forces shot down Scott O’Grady while he was patrolling a NATO-enforced no-fly zone over Bosnia in 1995. He survived six days behind enemy lines before he was rescued.

The fallout would be even more significant in Ukraine, critics say. Air combat between the U.S. and Russia would be the likely result of a no-fly zone, and such a confrontation could spark World War III and perhaps even lead to a nuclear exchange.

“As a matter of international law, Ukraine can grant foreign air forces the right to patrol its airspace in collective self-defense. However, if it became necessary for those foreign aircraft to enforce the no-fly zone with lethal force against hostile Russian aircraft breaching it, an international armed conflict would exist between Russia and the foreign nation whose aircraft are involved,” said retired Air Force Gen. Charles J. Dunlap Jr., now the executive director of the Center on Law, Ethics and National Security at Duke University.

“No-fly zones are complex operations requiring expert command and control, deconfliction, logistics and more, including provision for combat search and rescue for aircrew that might be downed in Russian-controlled territory,” Gen. Dunlap told The Washington Times. “We also need to be concerned about the risk of friendly fire as thousands of man-portable anti-aircraft missiles have been provided to the Ukrainians in recent weeks, and we don’t necessarily know how well trained they are on the use of these weapons in a chaotic combat setting.”

From a purely legal perspective, an international body such as the United Nations could establish a no-fly zone, national security law scholars say. Still, that route isn’t an option in Ukraine, given Russia’s veto power as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council.

The other avenue would be a formal request from Kyiv. Such a request would seem to satisfy international legal requirements, though other major world powers — Russia and perhaps China — would likely deem the no-fly zone illegal because it would lack formal U.N. approval. Indeed, a detailed analysis of no-fly zones prepared by the British Parliament this month found “some no-fly zones have a disputed legal basis, especially where they are established without U.N. Security Council approval.”

“In these cases, countries imposing the [no-fly zone] have cited humanitarian concerns,” the House of Commons Library research briefing said.

‘It is combat’

An unfolding humanitarian catastrophe was at the heart of Ukraine’s desperate calls for a no-fly zone. Russian forces have hammered cities across the country, especially the port city of Mariupol, causing untold destruction, killing scores of civilians and sparking a massive migration crisis in Eastern Europe.

“Russia has turned the Ukrainian side into a source of death for thousands of people,” Mr. Zelenskyy told Congress in an emotional speech last week when he was pressing Washington and other Western capitals to approve a no-fly mission.

“This is a terror that Europe has not seen, has not seen for 80 years, and we are asking for a reply to this terror from the whole world. Is this a lot to ask for — to create a no-fly zone over Ukraine to save people? Is this too much to ask … a no-fly zone?” he said.

There is no precedent for a no-fly zone over a country like Ukraine, given its geopolitical importance as a flashpoint between Russia and the West. Nor has such a prohibition ever been enforced on a nation such as Russia, which has one of the world’s largest militaries and the biggest stockpile of nuclear warheads.

The term itself was coined after the Gulf War when the U.S., Britain and France dominated the skies over northern and southern Iraq and prevented Saddam Hussein’s jets from even taking off. Those zones were intended to stop Saddam from carrying out airstrikes on his people, including the minority Kurdish population in northern Iraq and Shiite Muslims in southern regions of the country.

Iraq did not immediately comply with the new concept of a no-fly zone. Iraqi forces fired anti-aircraft weapons at U.S. jets. In 1992, an American plane shot down an Iraqi jet that crossed into the nation’s southern no-fly zone.

Those incidents are fresh in the minds of Pentagon leaders, who have stressed that a no-fly zone by definition requires the use of force.

“‘No-fly zone’ has a nice air policing sound to it, but I participated in one as a young officer on an aircraft carrier way back in the early ’90s. It is combat. You have to be willing to shoot and to be shot at,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told ABC News this month. “President Biden has made it clear that U.S. troops are not going to be fighting in Ukraine, and there’s a good reason for that because the United States getting involved in combat in Ukraine right now or over the skies of Ukraine right now leads to war with Russia. And there’s very little that you can see that would make sense for this war to be escalated between two nuclear powers.”

Despite the U.S.-Iraqi clashes and the daily risk to Western troops, the no-fly zones over Iraq through the 1990s effectively neutralized one of the Iraqi dictator’s biggest weapons to terrorize his own people.

Fresh off that relative success, NATO launched Operation Deny Flight over Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1993. That no-fly zone led to regular clashes for years. Multiple U.S. and NATO aircraft were shot down by Serbian anti-aircraft missiles, including the F-16 flown by Capt. O’Grady.

The Security Council established the world’s most recent no-fly zone in 2011 for a protected air corridor over Libya during the country’s civil war. Russia and China abstained from the Security Council vote. The no-fly zone in Libya, the United Nations said, authorized the international body “to take all necessary measures to protect civilians under threat of attack in the country.”

In Ukraine, military analysts say, a no-fly zone would almost surely lead to a broader war and may not even carry the benefits Mr. Zelenskyy and other proponents anticipated.

“The establishment of a no-fly zone over Ukraine would unquestionably be a major escalation in the conflict and would bring NATO and possibly other European forces into direct conflict with Russian forces. It’s also not clear what military advantage might accrue,” retired Air Force Col. Mike Pietrucha and Marine Corps and Air Force officer Mike Benitez wrote in a recent piece for War on the Rocks.

“The majority of Ukrainian civilian casualties seem not to be inflicted by air power but by artillery,” they wrote. “Russian precision strikes seem to be inflicted by ballistic and cruise missiles, which once fired cannot be interdicted by aircraft in a no-fly zone.”

Mr. Zelenskyy warned the NATO leaders that their reluctance to step up more in Kyiv’s defense now could lead to the larger war they say they fear.

“I’m sure you understand now that Russia isn’t going to stop at Ukraine,” he said. “It will not. It will go further against the eastern members of NATO — the Baltic states and Poland, definitely. Will NATO stop worrying how Russia will respond?”

“President Putin has made a big mistake and that is to launch a war against an independent sovereign nation. He has underestimated the strength of the Ukrainian people, the bravery of the Ukrainian people and their armed forces,” Stoltenberg said ahead of a NATO summit in Brussels.

Stoltenberg said the leaders of the US-led military alliance would “address the need for a reset of our deterrence and defense in the longer term,” starting with agreeing new deployments to eastern members Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Bulgaria.

NATO has already rushed tens of thousands of troops to its eastern flank in the wake of Russia’s invasion to counter the threat of any spillover from the conflict into alliance countries.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whose country is not in NATO, is set to appeal for more weapons and greater intervention in a video address to leaders as he seeks to cajole the West into a tougher response.

“We are waiting for meaningful steps. From NATO, the EU and the G7,” Zelensky said ahead of the day of summits of all three organizations in Brussels.

“At these three summits we will see: Who is a friend, who is a partner, and who betrayed us for money. Life can be defended only when united.”

NATO leaders are vowing to bolster weapons deliveries to non-member Ukraine and supply protection against chemical and nuclear threats from Russia.

But the alliance has rebuffed pleas from Kyiv to impose a no-fly zone to help halt Russia’s onslaught for fear of getting dragged into a “full-fledged” conflict with Moscow.

“We have a responsibility to ensure that this conflict does not escalate beyond Ukraine that will cause even more suffering, even more death, even more destruction,” Stoltenberg said.

US President Joe Biden warned before heading to Europe of a “real threat” that the Kremlin could use chemical weapons in Ukraine.

Stoltenberg told journalists that “any use of chemical weapons would fundamentally change the nature of the conflict”.

“It will be a blatant violation of international law, and it will have widespread and severe consequences.”

As Russia’s war in Ukraine grinds on, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said he thinks it’s unlikely there will be a full-fledged war between Russia and the alliance.

Stoltenberg, speaking to CNN's Christiane Amanpour, credited the NATO countries’ display of unity for lowering the likelihood of a full-scale war.

However, he said the on the ground in Ukraine is “extremely unpredictable,” and that NATO is faced with a new reality and must be prepared for the long haul.

When asked about reports that Russia is not picking up the deconfliction line, Stoltenberg replied that is correct, and that the “Russians have not been ready, as I say, to use those lines, but we assume that if there is a need, they will be able to communicate with us.”

The secretary general, who was meant to become Norway’s Central Bank chief later this year, is now set to stay on as the head of NATO given the situation in Ukraine. “I feel privileged for the third time, actually, to extend my term.”

When asked if the job at NATO was more important than the job at Norway’s Central Bank, Stoltenberg replied “I feel it is more important,” adding that if there is anything he can do to stop this conflict from escalating into a full-fledged war between Russia and NATO, then “I feel that is an extremely meaningful task to do.”",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-24-22/h_59d85042a496b132fbd397578dd4d63e

NATO allies are worried about Russian rhetoric and fears that Moscow might want to create a pretext to use chemical weapons in Ukraine. The leaders are likely to agree to send equipment to help Ukraine protect against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats.

Stoltenberg said the leaders of the US-led alliance would “address the need for a reset of our deterrence and defense in the longer term,” starting with agreeing on new deployments to eastern members Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Bulgaria.

He also said any chemical attack by Russia on Ukraine would change the course of the war, but did not specify whether NATO would take military action.

Asked whether a chemical weapons attack is a red line for NATO, Stoltenberg said, “I will not speculate beyond the fact that NATO is always ready to defend, to protect and to react to any type of attack on a NATO-allied country.”

Stoltenberg said “any use of chemical weapons would fundamentally change the nature of the conflict. It would be a blatant violation of international law, and it will have widespread and severe consequences.”

The meeting of NATO leaders is set to be addressed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who said he would ask the alliance to provide “effective and unrestricted” support to Ukraine — including any weapons the country needs — so it can keep up the pressure on Russia.

NATO officials believe that — armed with an arsenal of Western anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons — Ukrainian forces may have already killed as many as 15,000 Russian soldiers and wounded perhaps 30,000 to 40,000.

Putin’s regime officially puts the number of Russian fallen at under 500, and has introduced draconian censorship laws to prevent independently verified news about what it calls a “special military operation.”

Recent days have brought claims of Ukrainian forces not only repelling attacks from the much larger and much better armed Russian military, but launching counteroffensives and winning back territory around Kyiv.
