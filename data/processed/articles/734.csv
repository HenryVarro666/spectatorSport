Meanwhile dozens of Ukrainian troops have reportedly died in a strike on a military barracks in Mykolaiv.

Here are the latest developments:

Russia hasn't gained air superiority: Britain's military said Russian forces have still not managed to gain control over Ukraine's airspace. An intelligence assessment provided by the UK's Ministry of Defense said Russia has failed to gain air superiority over Ukraine and is largely depending on stand-off weapons, “launched from the relative safety of Russian airspace to strike targets within Ukraine.”

Mariupol residents forced to go to Russia: Residents of besieged Mariupol are being taken to Russian territory against their will by Russian forces, according to the Mariupol City Council. Captured residents were taken to camps where Russian forces checked their phones and documents, the city council said. They were then redirected to remote Russian cities. The besieged city of Mariupol is under almost constant bombardment, according to a major in Ukraine's army, and residents are rationing food and water as bodies are left in the streets. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said what Russian forces have done to Mariupol is an ""act of terror that will be remembered for centuries.""

Ukrainian troops killed in missile strike: Rescue efforts are ongoing in the southern city of Mykolaiv at the scene of a missile strike on barracks housing soldiers, regional official Vitalli Kim said. Dozens of troops are reported to have been killed in the attack by Russian forces, according to journalists from CNN Swedish affiliate Expressen who were at the scene.

Russia uses hypersonic missile: US officials confirmed Russia launched hypersonic missiles against Ukraine last week, the first known use of such missiles in combat. Russia claimed it deployed powerful hypersonic missiles on Friday to destroy an ammunition warehouse in western Ukraine.

Russian bombardment of civilians continues: Two children and a women were killed in the eastern town of Rubizhne after being pulled from the rubble of a residential building pummeled by Russian artillery fire, the emergency services said. In Kyiv, a mother covered her one-month-old baby with her body while their home was being shelled, according to the National Children's Specialized Hospital Ohmatdit. The child was unharmed, but the mother sustained multiple injuries, the hospital said. US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said Russia continues to make ""incremental gains"" in Ukraine's south and has used ""brutal, savage techniques'' in the way it has targeted civilians.

More than 6,600 people evacuated via evacuation corridors: At least 6,623 people were rescued via evacuation corridors from besieged Ukrainian cities Saturday, according to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, a senior official in President Volodymyr Zelensky's office. Tymoshenko said 4,128 people, including 1,172 children, were evacuated from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia. Zelensky said eight evacuation corridors were operating Saturday but due to Russian shelling, authorities were unable to evacuate people from Borodyanka in the Kyiv region. Authorities were also unable to deliver humanitarian aid to the cities in the southern Kherson region.

Zelensky singles out Nestle: Zelensky addressed the Swiss people via video link, calling for Switzerland to take further action against Russia. He singled out Swiss company Nestle, which unlike many other major brands, has not left the Russian market. ""Your company that refuses to leave Russia. Even now — when there are threats from Russia to other European countries. Not only to us. When there is even nuclear blackmail from Russia,"" he said.",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-20-22/h_debf3c28b628baa6b67e82de4b3f3979

Meanwhile, heavy fighting takes place in the south of the country, where the invaders have managed to push deeper in Ukrainian territory and establish a Russian-controlled land connection between the occupied Crimea peninsular and the occupied part of the eastern Donbas region, Ukrainian public broadcaster Ukrinform reports.

The head of the Ukrainian Luhansk Regional Military Administration, Serhiy Haidai, claimed that in the city of Severodonetsk, Luhansk Oblast, Russian troops were purposefully destroying food warehouses.

«In Severodonetsk, the Russian army continues to destroy wholesale food warehouses. They are hitting them because they know where they are located. They managed to inflict losses on local businesses, but the city’s residents will be fed anyway – our supplies have been set up,» Haidai reported.

A total of 14 fires broke out in the region on Monday, March 21, amid Russian attacks. About 25 sites were damaged, including two apartment blocks and 16 private households, a children’s hospital in Severodonetsk, a school in Rubizhne, buildings, garages and infrastructure facilities, according to the head of the Ukrainian Luhansk Regional Military Administration.

Kyiv admits losing key territory

The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has stated that from Tuesday, Russian troops have control over the land corridor connecting the occupied areas of Donbas and Crimea, blocking Ukraine’s access to the Sea of Azov.

Russian troops in Polissia area, northern Ukraine, had tried to intensify offensive operations in several directions, suffered losses, and failed, according to the Ukrainian General Staff.

In the northern direction of Ukraine, the invaders carried out no active offensive operations, restoring their offensive capabilities by bringing additional units into Ukraine, including a battalion tactical group with the 90th Panzer Division, the Ukrainian military wrote.

In the Donetsk and Luhansk directions, the invaders continued their attempts at advancing and gaining a foothold, the Ukrainian General Staff reported

The Swiss company had already halted non-essential imports and exports to Russia and had also stopped all advertising and capital investment in the country and said it would donate profits from Russia to Ukrainian relief efforts.

Zelenskyy said Nestle had not done enough to live up to its “Good Food, Good Life” slogan by continuing to operate in Russia.

US sets some red lines for China over support for Russia

United States national security adviser Jake Sullivan has laid out some broad guidelines about the types of Chinese support for Russia that would warrant a response from the United States, after warning Beijing last week of potential dire consequences.

Sullivan said US sanctions enforcement will look closely at whether China facilitates settlement of Russian payments or attempts to counter export controls passed since Russia invaded Ukraine.

The US is looking out for companies that are “attempting to backfill in response to the export controls that we have imposed,” Sullivan said. If Chinese companies or others “choose to backfill”, the US has tools to ensure that can’t happen, he added.

In terms of payments, Sullivan said, the US and its G7 allies are looking for and will respond to “systematic efforts, industrial-scale efforts to try to reorient the settlement of financial payments and so forth”.

Western official encouraged by resignation of Russian envoy

The resignation of Kremlin special envoy Anatoly Chubais over the invasion of Ukraine is encouraging but is unlikely to shake Russian President Vladimir Putin’s firm grip on power, a Western official has said.

The official said that the resignation of Chubais was a “significant statement” but added he was “relatively high up on the list” of people who might make such a step.

“I think it’s encouraging that there are senior members of the Russian political class that are doing such things, but it doesn’t lead me to a conclusion that this is in any way undermining the security of Putin and his regime, given the iron grip that he holds together with those at the centre of his power,” the official said, on condition of anonymity.

“But nonetheless, I think it is an encouraging statement that such a figure would make this move.”

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has addressed reporters ahead of the US-led alliance’s emergency meeting on Thursday. Here are some of his remarks.

Stoltenberg said he expects NATO will move to strengthen its eastern flank by deploying four new battle groups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia.

He called on China to condemn Russia’s invasion and “to engage in diplomatic efforts to find a peaceful way to end the war as soon as possible”.

Stoltenberg warned Moscow it cannot “win a nuclear war” and urged the Kremlin to stop its “dangerous irresponsible nuclear rhetoric”.

He accused Belarus of being “complicit” in Russia’s invasion by allowing its territory to be used for massing troops.

He also said Minsk continues to enable the offensive by allowing Moscow to use its military airfields in comments that come a day after reports that Belarus was likely to join Russia’s war in Ukraine.

EU loosens state aid rules for firms affected by Russia sanctions

EU companies affected by sanctions imposed on Russia will be eligible for up to 400,000 euros ($442,000) of state support under loosened state aid rules, the bloc’s executive arm has announced.

Companies in the agriculture, fisheries and aquaculture sectors can access up to 35,000 euros ($38,750) while businesses facing a liquidity crunch can get state guarantees on loans and subsidised loans, the European Commission said.

Meanwhile, firms facing soaring energy costs will be eligible for state aid covering up to 30 percent of their costs, capped at two million euros ($2.2m).

The European Commission, which also acts as the bloc’s competition enforcer, had two years ago relaxed its state aid rules, allowing governments to pump trillions of euros into companies hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Our priority right now is to allocate the frozen Russian assets – meant for war – for reconstruction instead,” the adviser said.

He also said: “We strongly believe that our allies in Europe and the US should impose many harsh sanctions on Russia. This is not just related to the economic gains and benefits and it does not just mean that we no longer have trade exchanges like before, but it also should mean that the current status must change. And this is a civil side of things that they must adhere to.”

HIGHLIGHTS

• Civilian casualties across Ukraine continue to rise. As of 20 March, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) reports 2,421 civilian casualties, including 925 killed, figures that are likely much higher. In less than a month, the confirmed civilian death toll has already reached the equivalent of 70 per cent of all confirmed civilian deaths over the last seven years of fighting in eastern Ukraine combined.

• On 19 March, an art school sheltering around 400 people was destroyed by bombing in Mariupol (Donetska oblast, east). This comes after last week’s bombing of the city’s Drama Theatre and Neptune sports centre – where more than 1,000 people had sought shelter amid ongoing hostilities. At the time of writing, the number of civilian casualties remains unclear.

• On 20 March, heavy shelling in the Podilskyi district of Kyiv (Kyivska oblast, north) reportedly left at least eight people dead and another injured. As clashes intensify in the capital and other areas of Kvivska oblast, a 35-hour curfew has been imposed across the oblast from 8:00 p.m. (EET) on 21 March to 7:00 a.m. on 23 March.

• Between 18 and 20 March, more than 13,000 people were evacuated from Mariupol. There are unconfirmed reports that people fleeing areas of the city allegedly controlled by the Russian Federation forces are being forced to evacuate towards non-Government-controlled areas (NGCA) and the Russian Federation with their Ukrainian passports confiscated. These alleged incidents of forced displacement would constitute a serious violation of the Geneva Conventions.

• Donetska oblast authorities (Government-controlled areas, GCA) say thousands who have fled the conflict-ravaged city of Mariupol now face starvation in Manhush and Melekine (Donetska oblast, NGCA), as they are once again trapped without safe passage out of locations where food and water are becoming increasingly scarce.

• As of 20 March, Donetska oblast authorities report damage to at least 10 health facilities, more than 320 educational facilities and nearly 1,110 residential buildings, among other critical civilian infrastructure damaged or destroyed.

SITUATION OVERVIEW

Civilian causalities: Civilian casualties across Ukraine continue to rise. As of 20 March, OHCHR reports 2,421 civilian casualties, including 925 killed, figures that are likely much higher as limited humanitarian access prevents corroboration in the hardest-hit areas. In just 24 days, the confirmed civilian death toll has already reached the equivalent of around 70 per cent of all confirmed civilian deaths over the last seven years of fighting in eastern Ukraine combined – 1,320 civilians were killed between 2015 and 2021.

In Donetska and Luhanska oblasts, OHCHR reports 1,017 casualties (256 killed and 761 injured in GCA, and 55 killed and 190 injured in NGCA), and 1,404 civilian casualties in other parts of Ukraine. These figures do not reflect civilian casualties in the worst-affected cities in eastern Ukraine, including Mariupol and Volnovakha (Donetska oblast). In Mariupol alone, the number of civilian casualties has already reached 20,000 people – including more than 3,000 possibly killed – according to municipal authorities, although the actual figure remains unknown.

Overnight on 19-20 March, at least five civilians were killed, including a child, after attacks in Kharkiv (Kharkivska oblast, east). In neighboring Luhanska oblast, at least two dozen homes and apartment buildings were destroyed by attacks in Rubizhne and Sievierodonetsk that left at least three dead, including two children. Meanwhile, residential homes were allegedly shelled in the strategic southern port city Odesa (Odeska oblast, south-west) on 21 March. Local authorities have not reported any civilian casualties.

On 20 March, heavy shelling of a residential area in the Podilskyi district of Kyiv damaged four schools, six apartment buildings and destroyed a shopping mall, reportedly leaving at least eight people dead and another injured. As clashes intensify in the capital and other areas of Kyivska oblast, a 35-hour curfew has been imposed across the oblast from 8:00 p.m. (EET) on 21 March to 7:00 a.m. on 23 March.

Environmental hazards: Amid ongoing fighting, the potential for an environmental health catastrophe looms on the horizon. As of 21 March, the air pollution level in Kyiv remains categorized as unhealthy, with the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration in the capital currently more than 12 times higher than the World Health Organization’s (WHO) air quality guideline value. In a positive development, nearly half of the Chernobyl nuclear plant’s staff were able to rotate and return to their homes on 20 March after working non-stop for nearly a month after the Russian Federation troops allegedly occupied the plant on 24 February.

On 21 March, another potentially serious environmental health concern emerged when the Sumykhimprom chemical factory in Novoselytsia (Sumska oblast, north-east) – located just 6 km south-east of the city of Sumy – started leaking ammonia after being shelled, contaminating a roughly 2.5 km-zone around the facility. Oblast authorities advised residents near the factory to seek refuge in shelters and basements for protection, as local emergency services responded to the potentially dangerous incident, which they say does not pose a threat to the approximately 250,000 people living in nearby Sumy.

Displacement: To date, nearly 6.5 million people have been forcibly displaced within Ukraine, while almost 3.4 million have fled across international borders – more than 2 million of whom have sought refuge in Poland alone. People on the move are extremely vulnerable to a myriad of potential health and protection risks, while local capacities in host communities receiving growing numbers of displaced people are already stretched to the brink.

Forcibly displaced people urgently need basic shelter and protection. Amid harsh winter conditions and the growing risk of disease outbreaks, including a new wave of COVID-19, the establishment of camp-like settings for displaced people will likely create more challenges for affected people and the humanitarian response than it will create conditions for durable solutions to widescale displacement and needs. As such, UN agencies and humanitarian partners will roll out cash-for-rent assistance as part of the wider multi-purpose cash response strategy, providing affected people with the resources they need to find appropriate accommodations and avoid the mushrooming of displacement camps across the country.

More than 12 million people remain stranded within affected areas across Ukraine, unable to leave due to ongoing clashes, destruction of bridges and roads, and a lack of resources or information on where to find safety and appropriate accommodation. These people are among the most vulnerable in Ukraine, directly exposed to heightened insecurity and almost completely cut off from basic supplies, including food, water and medicine.

Eastern Ukraine: The humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine remains the biggest concern. More than 200,000 people are now without access to water across Donetska oblast, with new localities being affected each day. As the scope and scale of clashes in the oblast increase, there are growing concerns that all of Donetska oblast could be cut off from the water supply in the coming weeks, leaving millions of people without access to water. As of 20 March, Donetska oblast authorities report damage to at least 10 health facilities, more than 320 educational facilities, nearly 1,110 residential buildings, 15 heating and water facilities, 30 gas pipelines, 34 electricity facilities, 21 bridges and 18 railway facilities.

In neighboring Luhanska oblast, constant shelling has destroyed around 80 per cent of some localities, leaving nearly 100,000 users without electricity. Humanitarian needs in communities in and around the so-called contact line have grown exponentially compared to before the recent escalation, as fighting expands into new areas of Donetska and Luhanska oblasts, exacerbating underlying needs accumulated over eight years of armed conflict.

In Mariupol, despite slowly growing evacuations, hundreds of thousands of people have remained trapped inside the encircled city for several weeks, lacking access to the most basic necessities for survival. On 19 March, an art school sheltering around 400 people was destroyed by bombing. This comes after last week’s bombing of Mariupol’s Drama Theatre and Neptune sports centre – where more than 1,000 people had sought shelter amid ongoing hostilities. In both instances, although some survivors have been pulled from the rubble, the number of casualties remains unknown, as hundreds are likely still trapped beneath the rubble while active hostilities hinder search-and-rescue operations.

Evacuations: Between 18 and 20 March, the Government of Ukraine says more than 23,000 people were reportedly evacuated from the hardest-hit areas of the country, including more than 13,000 evacuated from Mariupol via Berdiansk en route to Zaporizhzhia (Zaporizka oblast, south-east). There are unconfirmed reports that people fleeing areas of Mariupol allegedly controlled by the Russian Federation forces are being forced to evacuate towards NGCA and the Russian Federation with their Ukrainian passports confiscated. On 19 March, local authorities reported that between 4,000 and 4,500 Mariupol residents were forcibly moved across the border into the south-west of the Russian Federation. According to the Ukrainian Ombudsperson, such incidents of forced displacement constitute a serious violation of the Geneva Conventions.

Meanwhile, the Russian Federation reported that around 347,000 people have crossed the border from Ukraine towards the Russian Federation since the escalation of hostilities, including 16,054 people during the past 24 hours. This includes people who have reportedly been evacuated and those who have crossed the border seeking refuge on their own. The UN does not have means to verify the actual numbers of people evacuated.

As conditions grow increasingly desperate, there is a growing number of spontaneous evacuations out of Mariupol and other affected cities without any security guarantees for residents fleeing ongoing fighting. Even for those fortunate enough to escape Mariupol, Donetska oblast authorities say thousands who have fled the conflict-ravaged city of Mariupol now face starvation in Manhush and Melekine (Donetska oblast, NGCA), as they are once again trapped without safe passage out of localities where food and water are becoming increasingly scarce.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-impact-situation-report-300-pm-eet-21-march-2022

WASHINGTON – Two House Democrats on Friday urged the Biden administration to do everything in its power to protect the rights and safety of particularly vulnerable communities in Ukraine, highlighting its Jewish and LGBTQI+ populations.

Rep. Ted Deutch and Rep. Mondaire Jones, who represent two of America's largest Jewish districts in Florida and New York respectively, wrote to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken highlighting the ""horrific waves of violence and persecution"" Ukraine's Jews faced under Russian and Soviet rule and Nazi-German occupation in the 20th century.

""In recent months, Russia’s aggressive rhetoric raised fears among members of Ukraine’s Jewish community who still have memories of the antisemitic violence of the last century,"" the lawmakers continued, highlighting Russian President Vladimir Putin's use of the term ""denazification"" to justify its invasion of Ukraine and his instrumentalization of ""antisemitism to influence domestic and foreign public opinion in its conflict with Ukraine.""

Deutch and Jones further warned about the widespread discrimination and persecution the LGBTQI+ community faces in Russia, warning that these risks carry over to the LGBTQI+ community at the hands of Russian forces. They warned that the Biden administration cannot repeat the Trump administration's mistakes in resettling people subject to large-scale ""anti-gay purges"" by Russian forces in Chechnya in 2017. ""Russia’s military presence in Ukraine endangers the lives of LGBTQI+ Ukrainians and reverses the progress that country has made toward equality,"" they wrote.

They implored Blinken to ""ensure close and continued dialogue with organizations that serve Ukrainian members of marginalized groups; fund and support shelters to serve vulnerable that face particular risk at the hands of Russian forces; ensure U.S. embassies in Eastern Europe are equipped to provide immediate assistance to those fleeing the Russian war in Ukraine; and provide assistance for transgender Ukrainian individuals whose visible gender does not match their documents as they cross checkpoints and international boundaries.""

Austria’s Chancellor Karl Nehammer told NBC that he thinks Russia's President Vladimir Putin is ""in his own war logic"" after speaking to him this week.

He said that Mr Putin believes he is winning the war.

Mr Nehammer was the first European leader to meet Putin in Moscow since Russia invaded Ukraine.

He said: “We have to look in his eyes and we have to confront him with that, what we see in Ukraine.’’

Before arriving in Moscow last Monday, Nehammer had visited Bucha, the town outside of Kyiv where graphic evidence of killings and torture has emerged following the withdrawal of Russian forces.

The chancellor said he confronted Mr Putin with what he had seen in Bucha, and “it was not a friendly conversation.”

He added that Mr Putin said “he will cooperate with an international investigation, on one hand, and on the other hand, he told me that he doesn’t trust the Western world. So this will be the problem now in the future.”",https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-russia-war-latest-news-putin-zelenskyy-peace-talks-nato-live-updates-12541713?postid=3591040
