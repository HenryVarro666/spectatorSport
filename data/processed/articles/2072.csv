A few hours ago, a video appeared on the Web showing a powerful attack using multiple launch rocket systems. In the video footage, several launchers can be seen simultaneously inflicting multiple strikes.

On the presented video frames, it was possible to identify at least two Grad MLRS launchers. This documented at least 80 hits, although the video is said to have been more than a hundred hits. This points to the fact that several more launchers simply did not make it to the video.

At the moment, it remains unknown exactly which objects or positions were subjected to such powerful shelling. The source reports that the video could have been filmed in the Mariupol area (it is under the control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, but surrounded by - ed.), although any specifics, including about whose particular equipment in question, are currently moment no.

It should be noted that multiple launch rocket systems are actively used by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Russian military, as well as units of the DPR and LPR, and given the absence of any official statements, it is impossible to establish the ownership of this weapon for certain.",https://avia-pro.net/news/massirovannyy-udar-s-primeneniem-rszo-grad-na-ukraine-popal-na-video

Since 24 February 2022, when Putin’s troops crossed into Ukraine at its northern border with Belarus, at least 437 civilians have been killed and injured across the country by Russian explosive weapons, according to AOAV data. Air strikes and ground-launched artillery shelling on villages, towns, and cities have caused the greatest degrees of harm to civilians, accounting for 52% and 26% of civilian casualties respectively.

In the first two weeks of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, AOAV recorded 60 incidents in which civilians have been killed or injured by Russian explosive weapon use. Air-launched weapons, specifically air strikes, have caused 229 civilian casualties, 144 of whom were killed and 85 injured. Russian use of ground launched weapons have resulted in 206 civilian casualties, 98 of whom were killed and 108 injured. More specifically, these ground-launched weapon types include artillery shelling (124 civilian casualties), missile strikes (67), mortar fire (10), and rocket fire (5).

Drawing heavily on user-generated content from platforms such as Twitter, TikTok and encrypted messaging apps, AOAV has identified some of the primary weapons in Russia’s land and air arsenals, currently being used to wage war in Ukraine. This list has been compiled using open-source information on Russian heavy weapons that have been captured or destroyed in the course of the recent conflict.

Artillery/Howitzers

2S7 Pion/Malka

The 2S7 Pion developed in the late Cold War era is commonly known as the most powerful self-propelled howitzer that has gone through mass production. Based on a modified and stretched T-80 chassis, the 2S7 is fitted with a 56-calibre 203mm 2A44 howitzer that has a range of 37.4km with standard ammunition, a rocket-assisted projectile can be fired slightly further at 47.5 km. With a rate of fire of 1.5 rounds per minute, four rounds of ammunition are carried on the 2S7, with the remainder being stored on a support vehicle. The main types of ammunition include high-explosive, rocket assisted, concrete-piercing and tactical nuclear rounds (although the latter are yet to be seen in battle). Steel armour protects the crew against small-arms fire and shell splinters while moving, in the firing position the crew members are critically exposed as the ordnance is mounted in the open. Like many Soviet-era designed military vehicles, the 2S7 is also fitted with an NBC (Nuclear, biological, and chemical) protection system

2S19 Msta-S

Entering service with the Russian Army in 1989, the 152mm 2S19 is a self-propelled howitzer designed to destroy unsheltered and covered manpower. The weapon comprises a turret mounted on a tracked armoured 6×6 chassis based on the elements of the T-72 and T-80 main battle tanks (MTB’s). The 152mm gun is accompanied by a 12.7mm anti-aircraft machine gun that is remotely controlled by the commander and three smoke grenade dischargers mounted on either side of the turret. Generally, 50 rounds of ammunition for the howitzer are carried onboard alongside 300 cartridges for the auxiliary machine gun.

The Msta-S can fire a variety of munitions, conventionally using a high-explosive fragmentation round but can also be fitted with cluster projectiles with fragmentation submunitions and the Krasnopol laser-guided 152mm projectile. The howitzer can also fire the 3RB30 jammer carrying projectiles that set up radio interference and disrupt enemy communications. These have a range of 22km and can jam frequencies to a radius of 700m. Meanwhile, the laser-guided weaponry, designed to defeat armoured vehicles and weapons placements, has a projectile range up to 20km. With ammunition and gun loading being highly automated, this allows a maximum firing rate of eight rounds a minute.

Two new variants, the 2S19M (with a computerised fire control system) and the 2S19M1 (fitted with a NATO standard 155mm gun) have also been produced.

Multiple Launch Rocket System

A Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) is a type of rocket artillery system containing several launchers fixed to a single platform, firing its ordnance in a similar fashion to a volley gun. Rockets are self-propelled and generally have longer effective range than conventional artillery shells. Each system can even carry multiple warheads.

BM-21 Grad

Truck-mounted BM-21 systems in use by Russian forces are the most numerous and widely-deployed multiple launch rocket system (MLRS) in the world. They are less precise than some of Russia’s other missiles but are capable of firing 40 122mm rockets singly or in a salvo lasting six seconds, causing significant destruction to urban areas. The standard rockets have a maximum firing range of approximately 20km, but with more recently developed munitions, this can often be increased to up to 40km. The system can be armed with various types of rocket, including high explosive fragmentation rockets and high explosive anti tank rounds. Although usually trained on infantry and heavy armour, there have been a number of reports of GRAD missiles being deployed against civilian populations during the conflict.

TOS-1A

Based on the chassis of a T-72 Main Battle Tank (MBT) but with the turret removed, the TOS-1A is a heavy flamethrower system designed to provide fire support for tanks and infantry, operating from an unconcealed environment for incapacitation of light armoured transport and vehicles – although these have also been deployed against civilian populations in some cases. The TOS is the main source of the infamous ‘Thermobaric Bombs’ being weaponised against Ukraine.

The weapon can fire unguided 220mm 30-barrel or 24-barrel incendiary or thermobaric rockets used effectively to clear out entrenched personnel in buildings, field fortifications and bunkers. Much like other MLRS, the TOS differs in the types of ammunition being fired, but also in a shorter firing range of up to 6km.

Thermobaric Weapons

A thermobaric bomb is a two stage explosive device. It consists of a container of fuel and two separate explosive charges. The first explosion bursts the fuel container (carbon-based fuel or fine metallic particles). Fuel mixes with oxygen in the air and a resulting cloud flows around objects and into target structures. A second charge then ignites the cloud causing a large shock wave which can destroy buildings. Surrounding oxygen is consumed by the explosion which creates a partial vacuum that can kill by rupturing lungs. Thermobaric bombs are often used on underground targets in confined spaces, such as bunkers or entrances to caves or tunnels, due to their ability to penetrate small areas. There have been fears over its widespread use in battle, particularly with its ability to ‘vaporise’ enemy infantry.

BM-27 Uragan

The Uragan, also known as the Hurricane 9K57 or the 9P140 is a 16-round 220mm multiple launch rocket system used to defeat troops and combat material in concentrated areas. The rocket uses a range of projectiles: the 9M27F rocket projectile fitted with the high-explosive fragmentation (HE-Frag) warhead, and the rocket projectiles 9M27K, 9M59, and 9M27K2. The Uragan MLRS can also fire spin-stabilised rockets loaded with chemical, high-explosive, cluster and incendiary payloads up to a range of 40km.

The 9M27K 220mm rocket projectile is fitted with fragmentation submunitions scattering cluster warhead. It can engage manpower and soft-skinned targets in concentration areas – often being used during the invasion of Ukraine against civilian populations as well as military targets. The 270kg rocket projectile is armed with a 90kg warhead and carries fragmentation submunitions of 30kg.

The 9M59 rocket projectile holds an 89.5kg cluster warhead fitted with antitank mines for remote mine laying in front of enemy combat material units in the battle zone and concentrated areas.

The 9M27K2 rocket projectile carries an 89.5kg cluster warhead fitted with 24 anti-tank mines for remote mine laying. These area denial mines can be fired at distances up to 35km.

BM-30 Smerch

A heavy multiple rocket launcher, the BM-30 Smerch is designed to counter tactical missile systems, aviation, rocket, artillery and mortar battalions and batteries alongside concentrated areas of manpower. Equipped with 12 launcher tubes, the Smerch can fire the 9M55K 300mm rocket with an approximate range of 20-70km. This weapon is most commonly used to fire cluster munitions, with the 9M55K warhead containing 72 high-explosive fragmentation submunitions. The Smerch can also fire the 9M528 projectile with an effective range up to 90km, and an additional warhead that can scatter up to 25 anti-tank mines. These have also been used to line so-called ‘humanitarian corridors’ out of besieged Ukrainian cities.

Cluster Munitions

Cluster bombs are typically a large munition, i.e. a ballistic missile, which carries a cluster warhead holding a large number of much smaller explosive fragmentation bombs, which are scattered during the initial main explosion and detonate on impact. Due to the wide harm they can cause, cluster munitions are widely criticised as weapons that pose an immediate threat to civilians during conflict and for the long-lasting problems they can cause if sub-munitions do not explode upon first impact.

The anti-tank missiles have an approximate range of 8-10km. The Alligator can also be armed with IGLA-V anti aircraft guided missiles.

The Ka-52 is fitted with a number of sensors and radars including a mast mounted radome housing a Phazotron FH-01 Millimetre Wave Radar (MMW), with two antennas for aerial and ground targets.

Countermeasures are supported by active infrared and electronic jammers, radar warning receivers, laser detection systems, infrared missile approach warning sensors and UV-26 flare and chaff dispensers in wing tip fairings.

Mi-24 (NATO: Hind)

The Mi-24 entered service with the Soviet Union in the late 1970’s and has since been deployed by 40 countries. The original model was designed to carry eight combat troops, but later reconfigured to take on more of a gunship role. The design is based on a conventional pod and boom, with a five-blade main rotor and three-blade tail rotor. The two crew (the pilot and weapons operator) are placed in tandem armoured cockpits with individual canopies and bulletproof windscreens.

The helicopter has six suspension weapon units on the wingtips. The Mi24D (Mi25) and the Mi-24V (Mi-35) are equipped with a YakB four barrelled, 12.7mm mounted machine gun with a firing rate of 4,000-4,500 rounds per minute. The Mi24-P is fitted with a 30 mm built in, fixed gun mount and the Mi-24VP with a 23mm, flexibly mounted gun.

The Mi-24P and Mi24V have four underwing pylons for up to 12 anti-tank missiles, as well as long-range Ataka anti-tank missiles – these are guided by a narrow radar beam with a maximum range of 8km. This missile comprises a 7.4kg warhead, with a tandem charge for penetration of 800mm thick explosive reactive armour.

The Mi-24V is also armed with the Shturm anti-tank guided missile system. This 5.4kg high explosive warhead is capable of penetrating up to 650mm of armour with a maximum range of 5km.

All Mi-24 helicopters can also be armed with rockets and grenade launchers.

Mi-35

An export variant of the Mi-24 Hind attack helicopter, the Mi-35 is a multi-role combat helicopter primarily designed for attack and military transport missions – offering superior flight performance and manoeuvrability compared to previous incarnations. Integrating modern, high-precision weaponry for destroying ground-based armoured targets and providing air support for ground missions, it is one of the more modern combat helicopters in the Russian Air Force today.

Alongside the weaponry that can be attached to the Mi-24V, the helicopter can also wield a chin-mounted turret can be installed with the twin-barrel Gsh-23V 23mm cannon, armed with 450-470 rounds of ammunition. The gun can fire between 3,400 and 3,600 rounds a minute, while the stub wings can carry other weapons systems such as anti-tank missiles, rocket pods or fuel tanks. Additionally, the military helicopter can be armed with up to eight 9M114 or 9M120 Ataka-V SACLOS (Semi-automatic command to line of sight) radio-guided anti-tank missiles, up to 80 80mm unguided rockets and 20 122 unguided aircraft rockets.

Countermeasures include a radar warning receiver, laser range finder, location finder, chaff and flare launch system, infrared jamming systems and an engine-exhaust infrared suppressor.

Ballistic Missiles

Cruise missiles (3M14 Kalibr)

Having previously been tested in the Russian bombardment of Syrian cities, the Kalibr is a Russian land attack cruise missile (LACM) with an estimated range of between 1,500 and 2,500km. Being a mainstay of the Russian Navy’s ground-strike capabilities, the missiles are launched from warships or submarines and comprise of a 450kg high-explosive warhead with the potential to include a nuclear payload. The missiles fly at subsonic speeds while achieving supersonic speed as they near their proposed target, reducing the time by which defence systems have to react.

A Russian version of the US’s Tomahawk cruise missile, the Kalibr has been continuously used in the conflict to damage Ukrainian radar installations, command and control centres and airfields in north and eastern Ukraine. For convenience, all missiles can be fired from a common vertical launch system that can be fitted to a variety of warships and submarines.

9K720 Iskander

The Iskander is a mobile short-range hypersonic ballistic missile system that can travel at speeds of 2100-2600 metres/second. Invented to replace the previous OTR-21 Tochka systems, the missile has a range of 500km (310 miles), allowing it to be fired from within the borders of Russia and Belarus respectively. They can hit with great precision, allegedly between 2-5 metres of the intended target, and without warning, being used to take out vital targets in advance of a lightning assault. Warheads range from 480-700kg bombs, but also can comprise of cluster munitions, bunker busters, smart submunitition, thermobaric explosives and even EMP’s. Some reports have also suggested its potential use to carry nuclear warheads should the conflict escalate. Other reports have stated that the Iskander is often fitted with a stealth coating to make it difficult to spot on radar. According to Russian claims, the area of destruction from a single warhead is 25,000 square metres, meaning an Iskander strike in a densely populated civilian area would be devastating.

The M variant of the Iskander has the ability to manoeuvre continuously in flight to evade missile-defence systems.

The Iskander has been used widely during the Ukrainian invasion, used to target key infrastructure in major cities while also targeting key strategic military points such as a number of airfields, anti-missile defences, command posts and communication nodes.

4,8dc9842d-9077-456d-b420-2b07208bbc8c,[],2022-03-12 14:50:35+00:00,"Pushing into the third week of the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, the whole world witnessed how the Russian Armed Forces hace stumbled and bumbled into a seeming stalemate with Ukraine, which experts predicted would fall in mere days. The invasion was conducted with an estimated 150,000 to 200,000 Russian troops, attempting to advance into various Ukrainian cities accompanied with tanks, armored vehicles, and artillery.

So far, their campaign has not gone well, to say the least. They have allegedly sustained casualties of 12,000 troops, lost over 57 aircraft and helicopters, 353 tanks, and 1,165 armored personnel carriers, according to Ukrainian media (the numbers differ when compared to Russian sources and independent monitoring sites). While these numbers may be off, they can’t be way off given the lack of progress of the Russian army so far. Taking these kinds of casualties would stall an invasion pretty quick.

SOFREP has attributed the Russian army’s lack of success so far to poor operational planning (not accounting for weather) that relegates them to use the roads, too few troops, logistics issues, lack of coordination and communications, as well as a general lack of morale among the Russian troops with numerous reports of soldiers sometimes walking away from armed and fueled tanks and vehicles and surrendering to the Ukrainians.

Obliterating Russian Tanks

With Russia being the 5th largest army in the entire world with over 900,000 active servicemen, 13,000 tanks, 20,000 armored fighting vehicles, 1,300 military aircraft, 500 helicopters, and 6,000 artillery pieces, many thought that Ukraine would fold up like a lawn chair. Its own 196,600 active military personnel along with 900,000 reservists, thousands of local volunteers, and international fighters have so far successfully reduced Russian advances into Ukraine to a snail’s pace, resulting in Putin shelling civilian areas indiscriminately in what seems to be a fit of spite and impotence.

With all of the videos of shelling, explosions, gunfire, and general warfare being posted online through various social media platforms, it would be safe to say that majority of the general public has seen photos or videos of Russian tanks being pulled away by farmers on their tractors, or even civilians driving away with tanks and armored vehicles and selling them online.

If you’re a serious military observer, then you must have been busy with tracking all of the military movements from both sides, perhaps taking note of casualties on both sides, as well as monitoring all active units involved in the war through independent online sources.

As the video below and others like it show, Ukrainian forces have been very successful in slipping into the rear areas of the Russian advance and ambushing convoys of tanks, trucks and fighting vehicles to prevent them from reaching the front.

Much has been said about the Russian tank units in Ukraine, with many people, including Ukrainians themselves, fearing the sheer number of main battle tanks ravaging their cities. However, it seems that the Ukrainians are doing fairly well with defending against missiles. In fact, they were so successful in using their western-supplied Javelin anti-tank guided missile system (FGM-148 Javelin) and Next Generation Light Anti-tank Weapon (NLAW) anti-tank weapons that a cult following has developed within the general public.

These weapons have been so praised and prized by the Ukrainian Armed Forces that a “St. Javelin of Ukraine” was created on social media depicting a Christian Mary Magdalene holding the weapons. More so, the Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 drones have also helped destroy large amounts of armored vehicles, with a song written for it by Ukrainians.

According to independent military tracker Oryx, Russia has lost over 65 tanks, with 85 units captured by Ukrainians, 38 abandoned, and two damaged. Here’s a summary of the listed statistics for Russian tanks:

1 T-64BV captured

1 T-64BV damaged

2 T-72A destroyed

5 T-72A captured

9 T-72B destroyed

2 T-72B damaged (1 damaged and abandoned)

6 T-90A captured

6 Unknown tanks destroyed

1 Unknown tank damaged

2 Unknown tanks abandoned

With these numbers in mind, here are the Russian army units that seem to be taking the brunt of the beating right now trying to advance into Ukraine. Here’s what we managed to dig up. As a primer, the Guards Divisions of the Russian army constitute the bulk of their offensive strike capability. Their ranks are not filled by conscripts serving a single year in uniform but by professional soldiers serving contracts of three years or longer. They are generally equipped with the most modern weapons the Russian state can offer.

Guard’s Armies are built around the tank, armored fighting vehicle, artillery, and helicopter gunships. Their role would be to smash through enemy defenses creating a gap that infantry units can then rush into and expand on by pushing on its flanks. The armored formations would then fan out in the rear of the enemy army to encircle them and cut them off, forcing either their surrender or annihilation. In order to be employed effectively, a Guards Tank Division needs to advance over open ground to maximize its frontal firepower and maneuverability, so being stuck on roads severely limits its abilities as a fighting unit. The Mechanized Infantry that travel with the tanks in armored personnel carriers are employed as shock troops to fighting infantry encountered at the breach and to take and hold positions until follow-up infantry units arrive. Some of the problems the Russian army is having in Ukraine is probably related to the training of this type of infantry which as a matter of doctrine do not go very far from their tracked vehicle, staying within 50 yards of it to protect it and to be covered by its cannon and heavy machine guns in a fight. With Ukrainian forces employing Javelins that can reach out a mile, you see the problem. If attacked on a road, Russian tanks can’t go off-road in pursuit for fear of being bogged down in the mud and the mechanized infantry with them will not go more than 50 yards from their APCs. The more Russia advances into Ukraine, the more infantry they have to leave behind to secure towns and cities and their routes of supply.

And they don’t appear to have enough troops to do that.

1st Guards Tank Army

The 1st Guards Tank Army is one of the more famed divisions in the Russian Ground Forces as Vladimir Putin reassembled it to neutralize threats from Baltic countries. Historically, they were known for obliterating the Nazis’ 1st Panzer Division in World War II. They played a vital role in the Battle of Kursk and fought in (ironically) Ukraine, Poland, and Berlin.

27th Guards Motor Rifle Brigade, otherwise known as the 27th Separate Guards Sevastopol Red Banner Motor Rifle Brigade “60th Diamond Jubilee Anniversary of the formation of the USSR was historically known as the 535th Rifle Regiment formed in the city of Chuhuiv (now in Ukraine) in 1940. It was later integrated into the 1st Guards Tank Army in 2014 and is now headquartered in Mosrentgen, Novomoskovsky Administrative Okrug of Moscow, led by Dmitry Aksyonov. It was notably seen in Ukraine operating in locations somewhere in between Sumy and Verkhnia Syrovatka using T-90As and 2S3 Akatsiya self-propelled howitzers.

64th Motor Rifle Brigade, 35CAA

The 64th Motor Rifle Brigade was spotted in videos that appear to be near Kyiv using the T-80BVM tanks. The brigade is headquartered at Knyaze-Volkonskoye, Russia, and is part of the Eastern Military District’s 35th Army. Its roots reportedly took place with the 882nd Motor Rifle Regiment, which was converted into a brigade in 2009. They were seen to be operating with the Russian Airborne Forces (VDV). Its size and all its equipment are largely unknown.

31st Guards Air Assault Brigade and 76th Guards Air Assault Division

The 31st Guards Air Assault Brigade, an airborne infantry brigade, was seen to be operating in Hostomel and Irpin, Ukraine, along with the 76th Guards Air Assault Division. It is also known by its official name, “31st Separate Guards Order of Kutuzov 2nd class Air Assault Brigade.” Originally formed in 1998, it had combat experience during the Chechen War, the Russo-Georgian conflict, and in the 2014 annexation of Crimea.

It is currently led by Colonel Dmitry Ovcharo of the Southern Military District. Its exact size and equipment are unknown. However, it was seen to be operating various BMD 4M Airborne IFV and BMD-2 Airborne IFV in the aforementioned regions.

The 76th Guards Air Assault Division, on the other hand, is headquartered in Pskov, with its lineage tracing back to the 157th Rifle Division. It spearheaded the 2014 annexation of Crimea and was subsequently awarded the Order of Suvorov by Vladimir Putin. They were deployed to Ukraine during the invasion, reportedly suffering tremendous losses. However, the casualties could not be independently verified.

The division is comprised of the following units:

Division headquarters

175th Reconnaissance Battalion

124th Tank Battalion

7th Maintenance Battalion

656th Engineering Battalion

728th Communications Battalion

1682nd Logistics Battalion

3996th military hospital

104th Air Assault Regiment

1140th Artillery Regiment

4th Air Defense Regiment

242nd Military Transport Aviation Squadron

35th Motor Rifle Brigade, 41st CAA and the 90th Guards Tank Division, 41st CAA (OPCON)

The 41st Army, which was said to be headquartered in Novosibirsk, was deployed to the west to provide support to the Western and Southern Military Districts along with the 55th Mountain Brigade and the 74th Guards Motorized Rifle Brigades. The 41st Army was notably commanded by Major-General Andrei Sukhovetsky, who was the deputy commander, and Major-General Vitaly Gerasimov, who was the army’s first deputy commander serving under Sukhovetsky — both of whom died last week.

It can be remembered that Sukhovetsky was killed via a sniper shot while he had been visiting frontlines in an attempt to regain the momentum of the invasion as the army reportedly was suffering from low morale. However, he was left so exposed in the frontlines of the war that he was shot and killed by Ukrainian operatives.

The exact numbers of the soldiers serving under the 41st CAA are unknown. However, it is comprised of the following:

35th Separate Guards Motor Rifle Brigade from Aleysk

55th Mountain Motorized Rifle Brigade from Kyzyl

74th Guards Motor Rifle Brigade from Yurga

119th Rocket Brigade from Yelansky

120th Guards Artillery Brigade from Yurga

61st Anti-Aircraft Rocket Brigade from Biysk

35th Headquarters Brigade from Kochenyovo

106th Separate Logistic Support Brigade from Yurga

The 35th Motor Rifle Brigade was tracked operating in Chernihiv with their OBR. 1989 tanks. This specific brigade hails from the Central Military District with the 41st Army stationed in Aleysk in Rostov.

On the other hand, the 90th Guards Tank Division, 41st CAA (OPCON), was also seen in Chernihiv operating their units of T-72A and T-72B tanks. Their garrison is said to be located in Chebarkul, utilizing the aforementioned units: T-72A, T-72B, T-72B3, BMP-2s, BTR-82As, Grad MLRS, TOS-1, 2S12s, and 2S3s. Major General Denis Lyamin currently leads them.

200th Arctic Motor Rifle Brigade, 6th CAA (OPCON)

The 6th Combined Arms Army is from St. Petersburg and comprises nine brigades and regiments. Each brigade was said to have just one tank battalion, with its maneuver forces being the 25th and 138th Motor Rifle Brigades which are based in Pskov and Kamenka. They’re supported by the 9th Artillery Brigade and the 26th Missile Brigade, both from Luga. Experts have said that the 6th CAA is least developed and looks more like a division than a CAA. It is currently led by General-Major Sergey Kuralenko.

#Ukraine: T-80BVM, which is one of the most modern Russian tanks, was destroyed by the Ukrainian forces. pic.twitter.com/NNchZjM7I1 — 🇺🇦 Ukraine Weapons Tracker (@UAWeapons) March 10, 2022

The 200th Arctic Motor Rifle Brigade, 6th CAA (OPCON), was spotted in Kharkiv sporting some T-80BVM tanks, 2S3 Akatsiya Self-Propelled Howitzers, and 2K22M1 Tunguska SPAAWs. The units were reportedly part of the war in Donbas and were redeployed to Ukraine, fighting mainly in the Battle of Kharkiv, which saw some of its members being captured. They were previously led by Colonel Denis Kurilo, who died during said battle in Kharkiv. According to journalist Yuri Butusov, he had seen Ukrainian Javelins destroying some 2SK Akatsiyas (and around 30 more vehicles) and apparently saw Kurilo abandoning his soldiers before getting himself killed.

The brigade was operating some 41 T-80BVM main battle tanks, 36 2S19 MSTA self-propelled howitzers, 18 BM-21 Grad MRLS, 9P149 tank destroyers, 9K35 Strela-10s, 9K33 Osa, 2K22 Tunguskas, and some Barnaul-T air defense systems.

Air and Missile Defense Forces, VKS and 7th Guards Air Assault Division

The Air and Missile Defense Forces, VKS, and the 7th Guards Air Assault Division were spotted operating in Mykolaiv and Bashtanka with their Pantsir-S1 SPAAWs and their BMD-4M Airborne IFV units, respectively. The Air and Missile Defense Forces, led by Lieutenant General Yury Grekhov, is one of three sub-branches that comprise the new Russian Aerospace Forces, with the other two being the Air Force and the Space Forces.

It is comprised of the following:

1st Order of Lenin Air Defense and Anti-Ballistic Missile Defense Army (Special Purpose)

4th Air Defense Division “Hero of the Soviet Union Lt.-Gen. B. P. Kirpikov” – uses the S-300PM/PS and the S-400)

5th Air Defense Division (uses the S-300PM and the S-400)

9th Anti-Ballistic Missile Defense Division (Armed with A-135 anti-ballistic missile systems).

Probably 7th guards air assault division. They will be moving up with a sizable number of BTGs from 58th CAA behind them, elements of 22nd Corps, and probably 20th division from 8th CAA. In short, it looks like we're very near the beginning of offensive operations. https://t.co/4tGUZd0tsc — Michael Kofman (@KofmanMichael) February 24, 2022

The Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) in general were notably criticized by military observers and strategists as they noted that over 300 combat aircraft were stationed nearby northern, eastern, and southern Ukraine and could have been used to weaken the Ukrainian Air Force, but they chose not to. This led the Ukrainian forces to use low-level defensive counter-air (DCA) ground attacks to down Russian helicopters. Specifically, they used SAMs, MANPADS, and Stinger missiles to destroy these Russian attack helicopters with minimal casualties. The lack of air support also led the Ukrainian Bayraktar TB-2 armed UAV to destroy Russian vehicle columns.

On the other hand, the 7th Guards Air Assault Division, which was seen to be operating BMD-4M Airborne IFV units, is known to be one of the most elite guard divisions from the Russian Airborne Troops, which were vital components for the Battle of Mykolaiv. It currently operates an unknown number of 2S9 “Nona” 120 mm self-propelled artillery vehicles, 1В119 reconnaissance, and fire-control vehicles, BMD-1, BMD-2 and BTR-D, anti-aircraft BTR-ZDs, and anti-tank BTR-RDs which are equipped with 9М111 “Bassoon” anti-tank rocket systems. It is currently led by Guards Colonel Anastasia Vladimirovna Shevchuk.

Unknown Units

We were also able to determine some MB-21 Grad rocket artillery and T-90s operating in Mariupol. However, we were not able to identify which units they came from. TIGR-M infantry mobility vehicles were also seen in Kharkiv; however, we could not determine what unit they were from.
