It is by no means certain of the exact relationship of one with the other or with Watford & District congregation ultimately established in 1946.

Congregation organised by Rev. Freeman

Rev. E. Freedman of Abbots Langley in January 1941 appears to have organised Sabbath morning services in the Watford area(xxix) although it is uncertain which, if any, or the congregations listed below developed from Rev. Freedman's efforts.

Congregation at The Gables, Heathfield Road, Bushey

In May 1941, services were first held by the recently-inaugurated Watford & Bushey Hebrew Congregation (no apparent relationship with previous congregation of same name) at The Gables, Heathfield Road, Bushey, the home of a Mr. Bard.(xxx) After 1942, there is no further mention of this congregation.

Congregation at Methodist Hall (later Spiritualist Hall), Queen's Road

In June 1941, sevices were first held at the Methodist Hall 91 Queen's Street, Watford by the (subsequently named) Watford & District Hebrew Congregation (Hon. Secretary L. Dunitz).(xxxi) Based upon press reports this congregation continued to hold weekly services until at least 1945.

Garston and North Watford Hebrew Congregation

It would appear that in 1942, High Holy Day services were held both in North Watford (St Peter’s Hall, 58 Tudor Drive) and Garston (The Hall, 3 Horseshoe Lane)(xxxii) as well as at the Methodist Hall. In June 1944, there is the first reference to the Garston & North Watford Hebrew Congregation, with services taking place in Parkgate School, Parkgate Road, Watford.(xxxiii) Thereafter, there are frequent references to the congregation in press report, holding weekly services until late 1946. This congregation is also listed for the first and only time in the Jewish Year Book 1947 (the only Watford congregation listed that year), with Mr. Garelick as secretary. In December 1946, Mr.Garelick is the person who convenes the meeting for formation of the Watford & District Synagogue and is elected the newly formed congregation's first hon. secretary.",https://www.jewishgen.org/jcr-uk/Community/watford/index.htm
