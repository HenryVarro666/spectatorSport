Ukraine is a major exporter of corn (maize), much of it destined for China and the European Union. It also competes with Russia to supply wheat to major buyers such as Egypt and Turkey.

Industry estimates currently put Ukraine's grain exports at about 5 million to 6 million tonnes a month, comprising about 4.5 million tonnes are corn, 1 million tonnes of wheat and a remaining share of mainly barley.

Main grain export ports include Chornomorsk, Mikolayiv, Odessa, Kherson and Yuzhny.

Egypt's state grains buyer cancelled an international purchasing tender for wheat on Thursday amid reports that no offers of either Russian or Ukrainian wheat had been received.

""The market is still struggling to get a clear picture of the actual military situation on the ground. The ports in the Azov and Black Sea so far seem not to have been damaged according to the initial shipping agency reports,"" one European grain trader said.

The trader said the market was looking out for any declarations of force majeure, meaning suppliers will not fulfil contractual obligations because of extreme circumstances.

2,7c6e97ba-2665-4c9d-a24b-5d6c76467f7e,['Aurora Almendral'],,"Russia says it is closing shipping in the Azov Sea, according to reports from Agence-France Presse (AFP) on Thursday (Feb. 24) and Russian news agency Interfax. The Azov Sea is one of Ukraine’s two access points to sea trade, via the main ports of Berdyansk and Mariupol. The move further fuels uncertainty about the impact of the conflict on global trade.

Ukraine is one of the world’s leading exporters of steel, grain, and sunflower oil. Seventy percent of Ukraine’s trade goes by sea, with about two-thirds passing through the ports near Odessa, on the Black Sea.

Since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, trade from eastern Ukraine passing through the Azov Sea had collapsed, with port throughput at Mariupol, a port near separatist areas as well as steel and grain producers, halving between 2013 and 2019. Ukrainian sea patrols say that Russian warships have been lurking in the Azov Sea since 2014.

While Ukraine and Russia have equal rights to the Azov Sea, Russia claims control of the Kerch Strait, the sea’s only entry point to the Black Sea. Russia raised concerns about the closure of the waterway during military exercises conducted in the Black and Azov Seas that was to begin on Feb. 11. By Feb. 15, however, the Ukraine Sea Ports Authority confirmed that all ports at the Azov Sea were open for global trade and the Russian authorities had cancelled the military exercises.

On Feb. 16, the Joint War Committee, made up of London marine insurers, convened a special meeting to assess tensions between Russia and Ukraine, and deemed the Black and Azov Seas high risk.

Neil Roberts, head of marine and aviation for Lloyd’s Market Association, which represents insurance companies, told Reuters on Feb. 16 that adding the seas to the high risk list was “a precautionary notification so that insurers and shipowners will be able to properly negotiate their exposure as it develops.”

The sanctions issued in an executive order by US president Joe Biden on Feb. 21 may also result in prohibiting ships from calling at the port of Mariupol, according to legal advice provided to marine insurance provider West of England.

According to Luke Coffey of the Washington-based Heritage Foundation think tank, control of the Azov Sea is vital for Russia’s resupply of troops in Crimea, as well as its longer-term strategy for the Black Sea.",https://qz.com/2132774/moscow-bars-ships-from-azov-sea-between-russia-ukraine/

MARIUPOL, Ukraine — When the Ukrainian navy command ship was close enough to Russia’s shore to get the country’s state television channels, Capt. Oleksandr Hryhorevskyi switched on the news and wondered: Why all the fuss about his rusty old boat? Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight The appearance of his more-than-50-year-old vessel — aptly named Donbas, for the eastern region locked in an eight-year conflict between Ukraine’s armed forces and Moscow-backed separatists — dominated Russian broadcasts one night this month. With an estimated 100,000 Russian troops massed on Ukraine’s border, the near-confrontation between Russian forces and the Donbas in the Sea of Azov could have been the spark for war on the ground.

Russia’s main domestic intelligence agency, the FSB, accused the Donbas of navigating toward the Kerch Strait, the waterway between mainland Russia and annexed Crimea, which the ship hadn’t filed for permission to pass. The FSB said the Donbas ignored its instructions to correct course — and Kremlin propagandists quickly labeled the ship’s action a “provocation.”

Margarita Simonyan, editor in chief of the government-funded television channel RT, banged the war drum loudest on Twitter. “Has it started? Mother, don’t let me down,” she wrote.

The flare-up ended when the Donbas turned around, less than three nautical miles from the Kerch Strait. But the incident, though ultimately harmless, underscored a strategic weakness for Ukraine’s military in a tinderbox for war.

The Sea of Azov, a shallow internal body of water, smaller than Lake Michigan and bounded by Russia and Ukraine, is the one place the two countries’ forces risk direct conflict daily. It’s packed with Russian ships — there are about four times as many of them as there are Ukrainian vessels, according to Andrii Klymenko, the Kyiv-based editor in chief of the Black Sea News. And because there is no maritime border in the sea, the Russian fleet can get as close to the Ukrainian shore as it wishes, arguably making Ukraine’s southeastern seaside cities the most vulnerable in the country.

U.S. intelligence has warned that the Kremlin could be planning a multipronged military attack against Ukraine as soon as early next year. For all the international attention paid to the concentration of Russian troops on Ukraine’s land borders, if an invasion originates from the sea, Ukrainian forces are largely powerless. They cannot legally take any action against until the first Russian soldier steps on land.

Meanwhile, Ukraine’s fleet is limited in its movement on the Azov by what Kyiv says is Russia’s regular practice of restricting some zones at little notice for what it claims are artillery training exercises. The Ukrainian navy said this month that nearly 70 percent of the Azov was blocked for transport because of navigation warnings from Moscow.

“In terms of security, the Sea of Azov is dominated by Russia,” Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told The Washington Post. “And in case of war, it will be heavily used by them to put pressure on our southern cities on the Azov shore.”

“Under the current circumstances,” Kuleba said, “of course Russia dictates the situation in the Azov and basically uses it as a war theater.”

Hryhorevskyi said the Donbas was anchored on Dec. 8 when he received a Russian navigation warning that the zone it was in was closing. That left him nowhere to go but in the direction of the Kerch Strait, he said. At around 1:30 p.m. on Dec. 9, a Russian ship contacted the Donbas to remind it that passage through the waterway required 48 hours’ notice. Hryhorevskyi said the Donbas responded that it did not plan to sail through the Kerch Strait. He said the vessel was unarmed.

The Russian ship then asked for the Donbas’s plans. Hryhorevskyi said he declined to reveal them. They repeated the exchange four times, he said. By evening, the Donbas was flanked by three Russian ships with little room to maneuver, Hryhorevskyi said. He warned the Russians to back off as the Donbas turned around.

Hryhorevskyi said a Russian attack aircraft flew over the Donbas and one of the Russian ships tailing it threatened to open fire if it didn’t reverse course.

The next day, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told state television that the Donbas represented a “new provocation at sea” that was part of a string of “provocative actions that are being carried out around our borders.” In recent weeks, Russian officials have claimed that it is Ukraine and NATO that are threatening Russia at its border.

Since early December, U.S. intelligence agencies have warned that Russia was planning a massive military invasion of Ukraine. Here’s why Moscow would do that. (Video: Jason Aldag/The Washington Post)

Ukrainian officials have accused Russian ships of harassing their fleet in the Azov for years. Maritime border guards who patrol the sea in camouflage-patterned speedboats have documented actions by the Russians they deem “provocations” to present as evidence in international court filings.

Sometimes, a Russian ship will launch an aggressive course toward a Ukrainian one before making a last-second turn away, said Lt. Cmdr. Volodymyr Yarovyi, acting deputy chief of staff for the Ukrainian Maritime Border Guard. More often, he said, the Russian coast guard will attempt to hinder Ukrainian commercial ships by blocking their predetermined routes or conducting time-consuming searches of the cargo.

One armed guard, standing on the stern of a Ukrainian Maritime Border Guard patrol boat, described an attempt to check a foreign cargo ship. His team informed the crew over radio dispatch, but then a Russian coast guard boat closer to the cargo ship moved between the vessels and threatened to consider it an attack if the Ukrainians came within two nautical miles.

“This is war, too,” said Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defense council. “This is an element of their military strategy of how to beat our country.”

Other behaviors are more petty, Ukrainian naval officials said: Crew members on Russian ships occasionally point a laser light into a Ukrainian boat’s cabin.

Though those alleged actions by Russia aren’t new, other, perhaps more troubling, ones are. Klymenko, the analyst, said Russia has started issuing navigation warnings to close sectors nearer to the shore, sometimes just three miles away, “where you don’t need binoculars” to scout the location, Klymenko said. Russia has declared three such areas, near the Ukrainian ports of Mariupol and Berdyansk and the Azov coast of the Genichesk district of the Kherson region, which directly borders Crimea, closed from Dec. 8 to Jan. 8, Klymenko said.

“What they have in mind, only time will tell,” Klymenko added. “Maybe it’s just psychological pressure, or maybe it’s really preparation for a possible war landing on the shore.”

There’s a case to be made that the Azov’s shoreline is of more strategic and economic value to Russia than Ukraine’s war-battered eastern border regions. The Ukrainian land along the sea is what divides mainland Russia from annexed Crimea. The Ukrainian port cities of Mariupol and nearby Berdyansk on the sea’s western shore export products from the region. Just 60 miles up the coast, the Russian port of Taganrog is a hub for trade through Russia’s southwest.

Danilov, of the national security and defense council, called the Azov “a very difficult spot for us.” Ukraine lost 70 percent of its naval fleet in 2014 when Russia seized Sevastopol, the Black Sea port on the Crimean Peninsula. Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said last month that construction of a new naval base in the Azov port of Berdyansk would be accelerated to “repel Russian aggression in that region.”

Danilov warned that any attempt to invade Ukraine through the sea would be countered by Ukraine’s arsenal of Neptune anti-ship missiles, a batch of which the country ordered last year.

The trickle-down effects of tension at sea can also be felt on the shore, 15 miles east of Mariupol. There, the small village of Berdyanske, a separate place from the port of a similar name, used to be a cozy vacation spot and a hub for fishers. Now, because it’s close to territory controlled by Russia-backed separatists, cars have to pass at least three Ukrainian military checkpoints to get there.

The flow of tourist money has stopped. So has fishing. The Ukrainian military fortified the shoreline several years ago by deploying land mines throughout the water. Though locals say a winter freeze long ago caused all of the mines to explode, signs still warn people against entering the water.

There’s no longer a fishing base in the village, which means permits for those in the area aren’t issued.

In Fydor Pahomov’s sea-facing yard, tangled bundles of fishing nets hang off clotheslines. He used to have five fishing boats working under him. His main source of income has been stunted for years now.

Pahomov said he’s worried about a looming war with Russia. But most of all, he’d like to get back on the sea.

“How am I supposed to feed two kids?” he asked. “This is nonsense. But this is how we live.”

4,7c6e97ba-2665-4c9d-a24b-5d6c76467f7e,"['Megan Eckstein', 'Tayfun Ozberk']",2022-02-25 00:00:00,"WASHINGTON and MERSIN, Turkey — A Russian amphibious assault is underway in Ukraine, pushing thousands of Russian naval infantry from the Sea of Azov onto land west of port town Mariupol, according to a U.S. defense official.

It’s a scenario for which Russia has been laying the groundwork for years. Ukraine has been training to defend against such an event since its naval fleet was decimated in 2014 after Russia took Crimea, the peninsula that separates the Sea of Azov from the larger Black Sea.

But an attack from the sea was something Ukraine was particularly vulnerable to — even if Russian forces have so far relied primarily on sending land forces across borders to attack Ukrainian cities.

Wading in

There’s only one way in and out of the Black Sea. Russia regularly sends its ships and submarines in and out of the sea, surging forces there or sending its Black Sea Fleet into the Mediterranean Sea for local operations. Ukraine, unlike Russia, has no other fleets elsewhere, so there’s no backup coming from outside the Black Sea.

Which leads to the question: Who else may come and go from the Black Sea?

Due to Montreux Convention rules regarding the Bosporus and Dardanelles that connect the Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea, countries that sit on the Black Sea have unlimited access. Nonresident countries may only send ships in for short stints and are limited by ship size. So although NATO is not intervening militarily on Ukraine’s behalf, the Black Sea was always going to be a vulnerable spot for Ukraine.

In other words, if there were ever a body of water well suited for bullying your neighbor, it would be the Black Sea.

Encircling the waterway are Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Georgia and Russia — three NATO members, two who want to join the alliance and then the nation currently invading Ukraine.

That political dynamic was always bound to create tension. But since 2014, the Black Sea has become increasingly strategic and contested. Crimea, located in the northern part of the sea, formerly housed the main hub of Ukraine’s naval force.

Ukraine’s depleted naval force

Russia’s annexation of Crimea caused several challenges: first and foremost, about three-quarters of Ukraine’s naval fleet was based there at the Sevastopol Naval Base, and Russia took the ships, their repair yards, helicopters and any sailors willing to fight for Moscow.

Second, it gave Russia control of both sides of the Kerch Strait, which leads from the Black Sea to the Sea of Azov. Ukraine still has legal claims to the Sea of Azov and controls much of the northwestern shores of the sea; but Russia controls land on the east and west sides of the strait, making it easier for the Kremlin to harass, block or take as hostage Ukrainian ships in the area.

And third, it significantly complicated claims to territorial waters within the Black Sea, with the Russian-controlled Crimean Peninsula jutting out into waters that would otherwise be clearly Ukrainian territorial waters under other circumstances.

Last summer, when U.S. Navy destroyer Ross was in the Black Sea for Ukraine-hosted naval exercise Sea Breeze 21, the ship hewed to Ukrainian and international waters only. Defense News embarked on the ship for three days to observe the drills. Despite the ship’s careful course, Russian naval forces near the Crimean Peninsula radioed to the ship — an unusual move in and of itself — to tell Ross to turn around. It was approaching Russian waters, they claimed, and a Russian naval exercise was taking place.

Ross continued its operations, though with three to four Russian ships tailing it at any given time and Russian jets flying overhead.

Ukraine has done its best to rebuild its naval power since 2014, though it was left with one frigate as its only “large” warship. It’s taken a “mosquito fleet” approach, trying to build up a number of small vessels that can protect the waters close in to the shore. Eventually, the Navy planned to grow in size and skill set, buying larger ships that could patrol the more open waters of the Black Sea.

While the mosquito fleet patrols close-in waters, alongside the Sea Guard that falls under the State Border Guard Service (akin to the U.S. Coast Guard under the Department of Homeland Security), Russia freely deploys amphibious warships, missile frigates and more throughout the Black Sea.

Ukraine is at both a significant disadvantage and a significant threat right now as it relates to the Black Sea. It lacks the firepower to engage the Russian fleet in any meaningful way. The U.S. Navy and its European partners tried to help Ukraine learn to create maritime domain awareness by netting together sensors; the exercises were still focused on creating a common operating picture shared across at-sea and ashore personnel, not using that picture to pick out and prosecute targets.

Although Russian President Vladimir Putin hasn’t made his final intentions known, Ukraine’s coastal areas seem to have a target on their back. He has already pushed forces from Crimea into the Ukrainian town Kherson. From there, it’s not far across the coast to a naval base in Ochakiv and then onto port city and naval base Odesa. Putin has also pushed forces from the Sea of Azov toward Mariupol — and from there, it would be just a short push northward to connect to Russian forces and Russian-backed fighters in Donetsk and Luhansk.

Pursuing all these lines of effort would connect Russian-held areas in such a way that Putin’s forces could easily resupply themselves from the sea, whereas Ukraine would be cut off from maritime commerce and military opportunities. It would also give him nearly half the Black Sea coastline and allow him to claim significantly more area as territorial waters.

The rules of the sea

Part of Putin’s advantage in the Black Sea is that his ships can come and go as they please, when few other navies have the right or ability to do so.

Ukraine’s ambassador to Turkey asked that the NATO member close the pair of straits to Russian ships to prevent Moscow from bolstering its Black Sea Fleet. Under the Montreux Convention, Turkey manages the movement of commercial and military ships in and out of the Bosporus and Dardanelles.

Turkey said it cannot stop Russian ships accessing the Black Sea due to a clause in the rules that allows vessels to return to their home base, according to Reuters. The country has carefully implemented the Montreux Convention of 1936, which is a critical component of Black Sea security and stability, for more than seven decades. While the convention governs the transit regime across the straits, the most important aspect is defining the principals of military ships transiting the straits and deploying to the Black Sea.

The convention adds to Russia’s advantage there because it prohibits non-Black Sea states’ aircraft carriers and submarines from passing through. Only submarines from bordering, or riparian, states are permitted to pass through the straits, either to rejoin their base in the Black Sea for the first time after construction or purchase, or to be repaired in dockyards outside the Black Sea. However, though Russia has bent these rules in the past to deploy its Black Sea Fleet submarines to Mediterranean waters off Syria and elsewhere.

The Montreux Convention also limits non-riparian states’ naval power in the Black Sea in terms of deployment duration and armada tonnage. Non-riparian states may have a maximum aggregate tonnage of 45,000 tons in the Black Sea. In this regard, one non-riparian state may have a maximum aggregate tonnage of warships in the Black Sea of 30,000 tons. Furthermore, warships from non-riparian countries are not permitted to stay in the Black Sea for more than 21 days.

While the convention generally promotes freedom of navigation through the straits, Turkey retains the right to close the straits to warships from belligerent countries in the event of war or the threat of war. In wartime, Turkey is required by Article 19 of the treaty to close the straits to belligerent warships: “In time of war [v]essels of war belonging to belligerent Powers shall not, however, pass through the Straits except in cases arising out of the application of Article 25.”

Turkey arguably has the authority to close the straits under the principles outlined in the convention. However, there are some political issues. Turkey holds the convention in high regard and has carefully implemented regime rules because it regards the convention as an important component of the security and stability of the Black Sea.

As a result, if Turkey agreed to Ukraine’s request, Russia could make requests of its own, or even accuse Turkey of breaching its neutrality and retaliate.

According to Reuters, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu argues the country can’t stop Russian warships from coming back to their home base — meaning it could stop Russia from sending ships into the Mediterranean, which is a non-issue right now, but it couldn’t stop Russia from flowing more ships to the Black Sea in the name of sending them back to their home port.

Russia could also further bolster its Black Sea Fleet by sending its Caspian Flotilla through the Don-Volga waterway. That force consists of two frigates and seven corvettes, the majority of which are armed with Kalibr missiles.

Because closing the straits is likely to have little impact on Russian capabilities in the Black Sea but would put Turkey at risk of retaliation, or at least lose the appearance of neutrality, it’s unlikely Turkey will take action under the rules of the Montreux Convention.

With a maximum depth of only about 46 feet (14 m), the Azov is the world’s shallowest sea. Vast quantities of silt are brought down by the Don and Kuban rivers, so that in the Taganrog Gulf in the northeast, the sea’s depth is 3 feet (1 m) or less. The discharge of these rivers ensures that the sea’s waters are low in salinity, being almost fresh in the Taganrog Gulf. The Syvash is highly saline, however. The Sea of Azov’s north, east, and west shorelines are low and have long sandspits and shallow gulfs and lagoons in various stages of silting up. Its southern shore is mainly high and jagged, however. The topography of the sea’s floor is generally level.

The climate of the Sea of Azov’s basin is continental and temperate. Heavy frosts alternate with thaws, and there are frequent fogs. There is normally stationary ice along the sea’s northern coasts from late December to early March. The currents in the sea flow in a counterclockwise rotation along the coasts. The mean water level of the sea varies as much as 13 inches (33 cm) from year to year, according to the river influx. Tidal oscillations of the water level may reach 18 feet (5.5 m).

The Sea of Azov is rich in marine life as a result of its shallowness, the excellent mixing and even warming of the water, and the input of great quantities of nutrient material by the rivers. The sea’s fauna includes more than 300 species of invertebrates and about 80 species of fish, including sturgeon, perch, bream, herring, sea-roach, gray mullet, minnow, shemaja, and bullheads. Sardines and anchovies are particularly abundant.

As per TASS News, FSB stated that the SGV-Flot and the Serafim Sarovsky Russian civilian cargo ships were hit by a missile strike by the Ukrainian Armed Forces at 11 am on February 24, 2022, at the sea of Azov.

It further stated that the missiles were launched from Mariupol, Ukraine, and the oil transport ship SGV-Flot was damaged, and a fire broke out. It was also announced that one of the crew members was seriously hurt and the onboard fire was put out, and both ships continued their journey. Border patrol ships were dispatched to the incident site to assist in the evacuation of the injured crew member.

Russian maritime traffic officials previously banned any travel in the Sea of Azov

Due to Russia's continuing military operations in Ukraine, Russian maritime traffic officials had previously banned any travel in the Sea of Azov. In the meanwhile, Ukraine also has stopped commercial shipping into and out of the country. Ships are not permitted to enter and are required to anchor if in port.

Marine traffic statistics suggest that no ships crossed the Kerch Strait, which joins the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, according to the Wall Street Journal. Hundreds of ships pass through the strait every day, transporting steel, grains, and other goods. The water also serves as a vital transit route for Russian oil destined for European markets. Ships transporting corn, wheat and barley to nations like Egypt, Italy, Lebanon, and Egypt pass through Mariupol, which is Ukraine's largest port in the Azov Sea, and other ports on the Crimean Peninsula.

Russia's attack on Ukraine

In the meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared on Thursday that he had decided to carry out a special military operation in Ukraine stating that Moscow has no plans to invade Ukrainian territory. Russian Defence Ministry stated that Russian forces do not attack Ukrainian cities, but do target military facilities with precision strikes. They also claimed that no civilians are in danger.",https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/russia-ukraine-crisis/russia-ukraine-war-2-russian-cargo-ships-struck-by-ukrainian-missile-in-sea-of-azov-articleshow.html

Ukrainian officials announced within hours of Russia’s attack that they had ordered all the country’s commercial seaports closed while Russian officials also reported that the Sea of Azov in the Crimea was also closed to all commercial traffic. The closing of the ports came as security analysis warned of the dangers to commercial ships and Russia’s Federal Security Service issued an unsubstantiated report that two of its commercial ships had been attacked.

The Krasnodar Department of Russia’s State Border Service issued the report saying that two small commercial ships registered in Russia had been attacked by the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The vessels were identified as a 1981-built oil and ore carrier, the SGC Flot (3,345 dwt), and a 1986-built general cargo ship the Seraphim Sarovskiy (3,878 dwt). AIS data reflects both vessels as underway in the Sea of Azov inbound to ports in the region Russia annexed in the Crimea in 2014. The Russian reports said both vessels were damaged with a small fire starting on the SGC Flot and one crew member injured.

Citing the attacks, Russia said that all commercial shipping was now suspended to the Crimea while emphasizing that its Black Sea ports remained open and were functioning normally. Closing of the Sea of Azov is seen as less consequential as they are smaller, shallow ports used mostly for transshipping. Russia, however, Reuters reports has been shipping wheat, barley, and corn from Crimea to countries including Cyprus, Egypt, Italy, Lebanon, and Turkey.

Global markets are however working to access the full impact of the closing of the Ukrainian ports along the Black Sea. The country is a large exporter of gains as well as metals and steel, all of which will be impacted. Among the major exports coming from Ukraine are corn, wheat, and barley, as well as sunflower oil. The ports also service the metals industry shipping Bloomberg estimates 60 percent of Ukraine’s ferrous metals exports as well as the country’s steel production.

Collective, Reuters estimates that Ukraine and Russian combined account for nearly 30 percent of the global wheat exports and nearly 20 percent of corn exports. The two countries make up the majority of the world’s sunflower oil exports.

Yesterday, the government of Ukraine had reported that it was asking Turkey to close the Bosporus to combatant vessels. Turkey has not officially responded, but analysts warned of the potential dangers for all commercial ships in the region.

Security analysts Dryad Global issued a statement saying, “As the situation develops, there remains a high degree of uncertainty regarding the freedom of navigation throughout the wider Black Sea.” They warned that “Any vessel currently within Ukrainian ports should seek to leave immediately if deemed safe to do so.” Dryad further advised, “all commercial operators to avoid any transit or operation within the EEZ of Ukraine or Russia within the Black Sea.”

The global shipping industry has been quick to respond to the attack and the fears at ports along the Black Sea. Both Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd immediately reported that they had closed their offices in Ukraine with Maersk saying all port calls were suspended on their two service routes at least till the end of the February and greater clarity emerged.

MOSCOW, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Russia has suspended movement of commercial vessels in the Azov sea until further notice, five grain industry sources told Reuters on Thursday.

Russian forces invaded Ukraine with strikes on major cities on Thursday. Russia, the world's largest wheat exporter, mainly ships its grain from ports in the Black Sea.

The Azov sea is home to shallow water ports of smaller capacity.

""All ships are on 'stop' (in the Azov sea),"" one of the sources said.

The ongoing hostilities in Ukraine will have a considerable impact on vessels calling ports in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. The situation remains fluid and is changing by the hour.

Key updates on the maritime situation in Ukraine

According to information received from Gard’s local correspondents, other service suppliers, as well as open sources, the situation in Ukraine, Azov Sea, and Black Sea is reported to be as follows:

The Sea of Azov is closed to commercial vessels, likely to be enforced by Russian naval forces at the Kerch Strait.

Access to the north-western part of the Black Sea, north of 45º 21’ parallel, is prohibited by the Russian Navy.

All Ukrainian ports are reported closed for operation. As per IMO Circular Letter No.4518, the Ukrainian government has advised that all ports are now at MARSEC level 3 and are “closed for entry and exit”.

There are reports of mines being laid in the N n orth- W w estern part of the Black Sea near Ukrainian shores , and more recently, that s ome of the se mines hav e broken loose from their moorings and become adrift , drifting south. A t the time of writing , our correspondents in Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey are not aware that any such m ines have been sighted in their respective territorial waters , or that any related incidents have been reported . Nevertheless, masters of ships navigating in the western parts of the Black Sea are recommended to make their crews aware of this potential threat and keep a sharp lookout for floating objects . Masters are also recommended to obtain the relevant NAVAREA III warnings relating to mined areas and contact the local port authorities and ships agents for additional the latest information.

Combat in or near Ukrainian ports, with strikes against port infrastructure, may occur, with crews and vessels in Ukrainian ports being prone to collateral damage. There are reports that a few vessels have sustained damage due to shelling.

Operation of all Russian ports based in the Black Sea is continuing in a routine manner, although their ISPS Security Level may have been raised. If cargo operations at Russian ports in the Black Sea are absolutely necessary, it is recommended that a Declaration of Security is first carried out with the Port Facility Security Officer (PFSO).

Commercial operations within the EEZs of Turkey, Georgia, Bulgaria and Romania remain unaffected at this time.

Transit of crew into port cities may be affected by combat operations; roads may be blocked, and airports and airspace are closed, further limiting transit.

We will update this section as and when we receive further updates. However, as the situation may change quickly, we strongly recommend that ship operators and masters trading to ports in the Black Sea region make frequent checks with local sources of information, e.g. vessel’s agent, Gard’s correspondent, etc., to obtain the most up to date and reliable security information available at any given time. The shipping company Wilhelmsen also provides regular and useful updates on the latest port restrictions and updates in the Black Sea region.

Navigation related challenges and precautions

The US Maritime Administration (MARAD) in their Advisory 2022-004 has indicated that vessels may encounter GPS interference, AIS spoofing, and/or other communications jamming when navigating in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. Additional guidance for vessels experiencing GPS interference can be found in MARAD Advisory 2022-005. There are also reports that electronic warfare may be employed. If so, then it may affect electronic systems on vessels.

Vessels are also likely to encounter disruption due to navigational restrictions in this region. At the time of writing, AIS data indicates a reduction in traffic since the start of the conflict and decreasing concentrations of vessels. However, there could still be a build-up of vessels either at anchor or drifting, e.g. on either side of Bosporus Strait, and vessels are advised to maintain safe distance from other vessels, keep a sharp lookout and have their engines ready for manoeuvring.

Maritime Security

The situation remains volatile and changing and we recommend all vessels operating in the relevant areas to carefully assess the situation, exercise caution, and review their relevant contingency plans, including the crisis communication plan, in case of an incident. Owners and managers should ensure that seafarers on vessels heading towards the Black Sea region are aware of the security threats in their specific geographical area of trade.

Vessels may have received security information from their flag administrations regarding the ISPS Code security level. As an example, on 24 February 2022 the Norwegian Maritime Authority (NMA) raised the security level to MARSEC/ISPS 3 for Norwegian flagged vessels operating in the northern part of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. Marshall Island did the same for their vessels trading in the EEZ of Ukraine in their Ship Security Advisory 02-22. If such instructions are not received, it is recommended to pursue this with the vessel’s flag administration. Additional instructions and notices from flag administrations can also be downloaded from the Lloyd’s Register website: Latest information received from Flag States relating to Ukraine. However, we strongly advise operators and masters to maintain contact with their flag administrations in order to receive their most recent instructions available at any given time.

On 28 February 2022, we received reports that armed personnel purporting to be Russian immigration officers had come onboard a vessel berthed at a Russian non-Black Sea port and taken ashore part of the Ukrainian crew for questioning. Russian armed personnel stayed on board and the remaining Ukrainian crews onboard were reportedly also questioned. While all Ukrainian crew members are now reported to be safely back onboard the vessel, and this may be a one-off incident, masters should note that vessels manned by Ukrainian crew may experience additional scrutiny by Russian authorities, and possible interrogation of such crew members, when calling at Russian ports.

Vessels should ensure they are broadcasting on AIS and clearly state their intentions across VHF, consistent with provisions of SOLAS and their flag administration, and monitor VHF Channel 16. However, pursuant to IMO guidelines, “if the master believes that the continual operation of AIS might compromise the safety or security of his/her ship or where security incidents are imminent, the AIS may be switched off. The date, location and time the AIS is switched off should be recorded in the ship's logbook together with the reason for doing so and the master should restart the AIS as soon as the source of danger has disappeared”.

In the event of any incident or suspicious activity, vessels should notify its flag administration and the NATO Shipping Center (NSC). Any vessels challenged by military vessels should comply fully with their instructions.

It is worth noting that an existing NATO document on the interaction between naval forces and merchant ships: ATP-02.1 Naval Cooperation and Guidance for Shipping (NCAGS), may be relevant in the current situation. While NATO is not a party to the conflict, the publication contains a lot of valuable information about the many factors to consider when navigating in areas of armed conflict or war. Relevant advice may also be taken from Appendix A of the Global Counter-Piracy Guidance, which outlines non-piracy threats. BIMCO has also established a Ukraine/Russia hub that provides general guidance and resources for the shipping industry.

Ukraine and Russian waters added to JWC listed areas

As a result of the war in Ukraine, Ukrainian and Russian waters in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov have been included in the latest revision to the list of Hull War, Piracy, Terrorism and Related Perils Listed Areas (JWLA-029) by the Joint War Committee (JWC) which was last revised on 7 March 2022. Owners are advised to get in touch with their war risk insurers when calling any port falling within the above-mentioned region.

The Warlike Operations Area Committee (WOAC) comprising of UK Chamber of Shipping, Nautilus International and the RMT union, has declared all Ukrainian, Russian and International Waters north of 44°North in the Black Sea as ‘warlike operations area’.
