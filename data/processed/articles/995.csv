President Joe Biden on Monday called for evidence to be gathered to put Russian leader Vladimir Putin on trial for war crimes related to his nation's invasion of Ukraine.

""This guy is brutal, and what's happening in Bucha is outrageous and everyone's seen it,"" Biden told reporters, a day after video and still images revealed the town's streets littered with dead bodies. ""I think it is a war crime. ... He should be held accountable.""

Biden also said he plans to slap additional sanctions on Russia for its conduct during the war, which began with an invasion on Feb. 24. ""I'll let you know,"" the president replied when a reporter asked him the nature of those expected sanctions.

Biden’s comments to reporters came after Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited Bucha, one of the towns surrounding Kyiv where Ukrainian officials say the bodies of civilians have been found. Zelenskyy called the Russian actions “genocide” and called for the West to apply tougher sanctions against Russia.

Biden, however, stopped short of calling the actions genocide.

The bodies of 410 civilians have been removed from Kyiv-area towns that were recently retaken from Russian forces, Ukraine’s prosecutor-general, Iryna Venediktova, said. Associated Press journalists saw the bodies of at least 21 people in various spots around Bucha, northwest of the capital.

“We have to continue to provide Ukraine with the weapons they need to continue the fight. And we have to gather all the detail so this can be an actual — have a war crimes trial,” Biden said.

Biden lashed out at Putin as “brutal.”

“What’s happening in Bucha is outrageous and everyone sees it,” Biden added.

White House officials said talks about ramping up new sanctions against Russia intensified after reports of alleged atrocities emerged. Biden said Monday that he would continue to add sanctions but did not detail what sectors the U.S. may target next.

After unveiling an avalanche of sanctions in the first weeks of the war, administration officials in recent days have put more focus on closing loopholes that Russia might try to use to avoid sanctions.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, tweeted Monday that he European Union will send investigators to Ukraine to help the local prosecutor general “document war crimes.”

A Russian law enforcement agency says it has launched its own investigation into allegations that Ukrainian civilians were massacred in suburbs of Kyiv that were held by Russian troops, focusing on what it calls “false information” about Russian forces.

The Investigative Committee claims Ukrainian authorities made the allegations “with the aim of discrediting Russian troops” and that those involved should be investigated over possible breaches of a new Russian law banning what the government deems to be false information about its forces.

Biden noted that he faced push back last month when he described Putin as a war criminal for the unfolding onslaught in Ukraine after hospitals and maternity wards were bombed. In his remarks on Monday, Biden made clear that label still applied.

“This guy is brutal and what’s happening to Bucha is outrageous, and everyone’s seen it,” Biden said.

Investigations into Putin’s actions had begun before the new allegations of atrocities outside Kyiv.

""We have to gather the information. We have to continue to provide Ukraine with the weapons they need to continue the fight. And we have to get all the detail so this can be an actual, have a war crimes trial,"" Biden said.

The Kremlin categorically denied any accusations related to the murder of civilians, including in Bucha, where it said the graves and corpses had been staged by Ukraine to tarnish Russia.

Biden's National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters that the United States will seek information from four sources to build a case for war crimes: the U.S. and its allies, including intelligence services; Ukrainian observations on the ground; international organizations including the United Nations; and interviews from global independent media.

He said the United States would build a case at the International Criminal Court or another venue. The United States is not a party to the ICC.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden on Monday called for Vladimir Putin to be tried for war crimes and said he’ll seek more sanctions against Russia after what he described as “outrageous” atrocities around Kyiv. One of the president’s top advisers said the Russians had exacted a horrible toll before making a “pell-mell” retreat from around Ukraine’s capital to regroup for dangerous forays elsewhere.

“We have to gather all the detail” for a war crimes trial, Biden said, referencing one of the towns surrounding Kyiv where Ukrainian officials say the bodies of civilians have been found. “This guy is brutal, and what’s happening in Bucha is outrageous and everyone’s seen it.”

Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, later reminded reporters that the U.S. had unveiled intelligence in the lead-up to the Feb. 24 invasion warning that Russia would seek to imprison or kill dissidents and others it viewed as threats to its attempted occupation of Ukraine. The grim scenes that unfolded around the capital city show that the concern is now coming to pass, he said.

“We do not believe that this is just a random accident, or the rogue act of a particular individual,” Sullivan said of the images of bound civilians who had been killed. “We believe that this was part of the plan.”

Biden made the war crimes allegations to reporters after Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited Bucha, where Ukrainian officials say the bodies of civilians have been found in macabre scenes of brutality. Zelenskyy labeled the Russian actions “genocide” and called for the West to apply tougher sanctions against Russia.

Biden and U.S. officials, however, stopped short of calling the actions genocide.

“We have seen atrocities, we have seen war crimes, we have not yet seen a level of systematic deprivation of life of the Ukrainian people to rise to the level of genocide,” Sullivan said.

The bodies of 410 civilians have been removed from Kyiv-area towns that were recently retaken from Russian forces, according to Ukraine’s prosecutor-general, Iryna Venediktova. Associated Press journalists saw the bodies of at least 21 people in various spots around Bucha, northwest of the capital.

Sullivan warned that the world “should brace” for additional potential war crime revelations.

Sullivan said “the Russians have now realized that the West will not break” in its support of the Ukrainian government. But he warned that Russia was redoubling its offensive in other parts of the country after pulling many troops from around Kyiv.

White House officials said talks about ramping up new sanctions against Russia intensified after reports of the alleged atrocities emerged. Biden said Monday that he would continue to add sanctions but did not detail what sectors the U.S. may target next. Sullivan said the additional sanctions would come this week.

After unveiling an avalanche of sanctions in the first weeks of the war, administration officials in recent days have put more focus on closing loopholes that Russia might try to use to avoid sanctions.

Biden noted that he had faced pushback last month when he described Putin as a war criminal for the unfolding onslaught in Ukraine after hospitals and maternity wards were bombed. In his remarks on Monday, Biden suggested it was clear that assessment had been validated.

Investigations into Putin’s actions had begun before the newest allegations of atrocities.

The U.S. and more than 40 other countries are working together to investigate possible violations and abuses, after the passage of a resolution by the United Nations Human Rights Council to establish a commission of inquiry. There is another probe by the International Criminal Court, an independent body based in the Netherlands. The U.S. Senate unanimously approved a resolution last month seeking investigations of Putin and elements of his government for war crimes over the invasion of Ukraine.

State Department spokesman Ned Price said the U.S. is supporting a multinational team of war crimes experts deployed to the region that are supporting the Ukraine Prosecutor General’s War Crimes Unit.

Biden’s chief envoy to the United Nations, Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, announced Monday that the U.S. plans to seek a suspension of Russia from its seat on the U.N.’s top human rights body after the latest revelations. That would require a decision by the U.N. General Assembly.

Russia and the other four permanent members of the U.N. Security Council — Britain, China, France and the United States — all currently have seats on the 47-member-state rights council, which is based in Geneva. The United States rejoined the council this year.

“My message to those 140 countries who have courageously stood together is simple: The images out of Bucha and devastation across Ukraine require us now to match our words with action,” Thomas-Greenfield said. “We cannot let a Member State that is subverting every principle we hold dear to continue to sit on the U.N. Human Rights Council.”

The US president was responding to harrowing images broadcast around the world after the discovery over the weekend of a mass grave and bodies in civilian clothes, some with their hands bound, in the town of Bucha, near Kyiv.

“You may remember I got criticised for calling Putin a war criminal,” Biden told reporters at the Fort McNair army post in Washington. “Well, the truth of the matter – we saw it happen in Bucha – he is a war criminal.”

“But we have to gather the information. We have to continue to provide Ukraine with the weapons they need to continue to fight, and we have to get all the detail [to] have a war crimes trial. This guy is brutal and what’s happening in Bucha is outrageous.”

On a visit to Bucha, about 30km north-west of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, went further, saying the town had been the scene of war crimes that would be “recognised by the world as genocide”.

“You stand here today and see what happened,” Zelenskiy told reporters, dressed in a bullet-proof vest on a rare trip outside the capital. “We know thousands of people have been killed and tortured with extremities cut off; women raped, children killed.”

The scale of the killings is still unclear. Ukraine’s chief prosecutor, Iryna Venediktova, has said 410 civilian bodies were recovered in the greater Kyiv area after Russian troops withdrew, while the mayor of Bucha, Anatoly Fedoruk, said the town had buried 280 people in mass graves because its cemeteries were under fire.

In nearby Motyzhyn, an adviser to the Ukrainian interior ministry, Anton Herashchenko, showed the partially covered bodies of the village head, her husband and their son to reporters. They had been shot and buried in a shallow grave, he said.

“The occupiers suspected they were collaborating with our military, giving us locations of where to target our artillery,” Herashchenko said. “These scum tortured, slaughtered and killed the whole family. They will be held responsible for this.”

The French president, Emmanuel Macron, called for “very clear measures” against Moscow, including an embargo on Russian oil and coal, while the EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said the bloc was urgently working on a new round of sanctions and stood in solidarity with Ukraine during “sombre hours for the whole world”.

Macron said there was “clear evidence of war crimes” in Bucha: “It was the Russian army that was there. We have told Ukrainian authorities that we were at their disposal to help with the investigation they’re carrying out. International justice must prevail.”

Germany on Monday expelled about 40 Russian diplomats in response to what its foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, called the Kremlin’s “unbelievable brutality” and “boundless will to exterminate” in Ukraine, as well as temporarily taking control of the Russian gas giant Gazprom’s German subsidiary to secure its energy supply.

France later announced it was also expelling a number of Russian diplomatic personnel, saying their actions were “contrary to our security interests”.

As the UN’s security council prepared to discuss Ukraine on Tuesday, its human rights commissioner, Michelle Bachelet, said air strikes and heavy shelling during Russia’s invasion had killed civilians in acts that may amount to war crimes. Zelenskiy announced that he would be addressing the council.

The British mission to the UN, which holds the presidency of the 15-member security council for April, said the council would not be meeting on Monday as requested by Russia to discuss what Moscow has claimed was a “heinous provocation” by Ukraine.

The Kremlin on Monday again rejected all accusations related to the murder of civilians in Bucha, saying Ukrainian allegations should be treated with scepticism and suggesting images of corpses “do not correspond to reality”.

“We categorically reject all allegations,” said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, alleging that Russian defence ministry experts had “identified signs of various fakes” and asking international leaders not to “rush to sweeping accusations and at least listen to our arguments”.

Later on Monday, Vasily Nebenzya, Moscow’s envoy to the UN said that Russia would present “empirical evidence” to the security council that its forces had not targeted civilians.

Jake Sullivan, the US national security adviser, told reporters: “The information from Bucha appears to show further evidence of war crimes. And as the president said, we will work with the world to ensure there is full accountability for these crimes. We are also working intensively with our European allies on further sanctions to raise the pressure and raise the cost on Putin and on Russia.”



Asked why Biden declined to use the term genocide, Sullivan said: “We have seen atrocities, we have seen war crimes. We have not seen a level of systemic depravation of life” that constitutes genocide.

The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said the EU was sending investigators to Ukraine to help local authorities document war crimes.

Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, called for an international investigation into what he termed a “genocide” carried out by Russian troops, saying it was vital to “find out the truth on the extent of Russian fascist crimes”.

Urging more and tougher western sanctions and an end to “negotiations with criminals”, Morawiecki said the “bloody massacres committed by Russian soldiers deserve to be called what they are. This is genocide, and it must be judged.”

The Polish leader criticised efforts over the past several weeks by Macron to keep lines of communication open with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, saying: “Nobody negotiated with Hitler.” He also told the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, that Berlin should be listening not to “German business leaders and German billionaires” over sanctions, but to “the voices of innocent women and children”.

Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, also said the west must do everything in its power to ensure those responsible for “these alleged cases of crimes against humanity, war crimes and – why not say it too – genocide” did not go unpunished.

Asked if he agreed with the characterisation of genocide, Biden replied: “No, I think it is a war crime.” But the US president did confirm he would seek to inflict more economic pain on Russia, saying: “I’m going to continue to add sanctions.”

Scholz said new EU sanctions would be agreed in the coming days, while the foreign minister of Italy – another member which, like Germany, relies on Russian gas imports – said it would not veto energy embargoes.

But the German finance minister, Christian Lindner, warned it was too soon to cut off Russian gas to Europe. “We have to cut all economic relationship to Russia, but at the moment it’s not possible to cut the gas supplies,” he said. “We need some time.”

Europe’s worst conflict in decades, sparked by Russia’s invasion on 24 February, has already killed 20,000 people, according to Ukrainian estimates. The UN refugee agency said on Monday more than 4.2 million refugees had fled the country.

“The humanitarian needs are growing by the minute as more people flee the war in Ukraine,” the International Organization for Migration said, adding that in addition to Ukrainian refugees, nearly 205,500 non-Ukrainians living, studying or working in the country had left and nearly 6.5 million people were internally displaced.

The US also said on Monday it would ask the UN general assembly to suspend Russia from the body’s human rights council. “Russia’s participation on the human rights council is a farce,” Washington’s ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said. “It is time the UN general assembly vote to remove them.”

US President Joe Biden again has condemned his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin as a “war criminal”, saying that a “war crimes trial” could be held as global outrage grows over atrocities committed against civilians in the Ukrainian town of Bucha.

Speaking to reporters on Monday, Biden said he is seeking additional sanctions against Russia in light of reports of massacres in Bucha, on the outskirts of the capital Kyiv.

Photos of corpses lining the streets of the town, which had been under Russian control, have sparked international condemnation and calls for a credible investigation.

“You may remember I got criticised for calling Putin a war criminal,” Biden said. “Well, the truth of the matter, we saw it happen in Bucha … he is a war criminal.”

Biden labelled Putin a “war criminal” last month, drawing rebuke from the Kremlin and a warning that ties between Russia and the United States were on the verge of “rupture“.

Other US officials and agencies also have accused Russia of war crimes, and the US Department of State made a formal determination that abuses had been committed by some Russian forces in Ukraine.

On Monday, Biden suggested that Washington is seeking to hold a war crimes trial for alleged violations committed during the war.

“We have to gather the information,” the US president told reporters. “We have to continue to provide Ukraine with the weapons they need to continue to fight, and we have to get all the details so this could be … a war crimes trial.

“This guy is brutal and what’s happening in Bucha is outrageous and everyone’s seen it.”

It is not clear how a US-backed trial could be held. The US is not a party to the Rome Statute that established the International Criminal Court (ICC). Washington has also previously denounced the court for seeking to investigate alleged war crimes in Israel and the occupied Palestinian Territories, and Afghanistan.

The ICC prosecutor has launched an investigation into possible war crimes in Ukraine.

US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan later said Washington is in discussion with its allies to determine the best avenue to pursue accountability measures in Ukraine.

“Obviously, the ICC is one venue where war crimes have been tried in the past, but there have been other examples in other conflicts of other mechanisms being set up. So there’s work to be done to work out the specifics of that,” Sullivan told reporters.

On Monday, the United Nations also called for an independent probe into the killings in Bucha.

“I am deeply shocked by the images of civilians killed in Bucha, Ukraine. It is essential that an independent investigation leads to effective accountability,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement.

Russia, whose forces are retreating from the Kyiv region as they shift their focus to the east and south of the country, has denied killing civilians in Bucha, suggesting that some of the footage fuelling the outrage is manipulated.

“Experts at the Ministry of Defence have identified signs of video fakes and various fakes,” Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday without elaborating. “We would demand that many international leaders do not rush to sweeping accusations and at least listen to our arguments.”

Later on Monday, US State Department Spokesperson Ned Price dismissed the Russian denial as “baseless and shameless”.

“The images we have seen and reports we have heard suggest these atrocities are not the act of a rogue soldier; they are part of a broader, troubling campaign,” Price told reporters.

He said Washington is backing a “multinational team” of investigators collecting and preserving evidence of war crimes at the request of Ukraine’s prosecutor general.

“Those responsible for atrocities must be held accountable, as must those who ordered them,” Price told reporters. “They cannot and will not act with impunity. We are tracking and documenting atrocities and sharing information with institutions working to hold responsible those accountable.”

Russia launched an all-out invasion of Ukraine on February 24 after a months-long standoff that saw Moscow amass troops near the Ukrainian borders as it demanded an end to NATO expansion into former Soviet republics.

The US and its allies were quick to impose sweeping sanctions on the Russian economy as well as financial penalties on Putin and elites in his inner circle.

Asked on Monday whether he would impose more financial measures against Russia after the apparent massacre, Biden said: “I’m seeking more sanctions, yes.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/4/4/bucha-atrocities-show-putin-is-war-criminal-biden-says

Washington — President Biden on Monday called for war crimes trial against Russian President Vladimir Putin and said he'd seek more sanctions after reported atrocities in Ukraine.

""You saw what happened in Bucha,"" Mr. Biden said, adding that Putin ""is a war criminal.""

Mr. Biden's comments to reporters came after Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited Bucha, one of the towns surrounding Kyiv where Ukrainian officials say the bodies of civilians have been found. On ""Face the Nation"" Sunday, Zelenskyy called the Russian actions ""genocide"" and called for the West to apply tougher sanctions against Russia.

""What's happening in Bucha is outrageous and everyone sees it,"" Mr. Biden added.

At the Pentagon, a senior defense official said the U.S. can't independently confirm the atrocities in Bucha but has no reason to refute them. The official called the images ""deeply troubling.""

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted Monday that the European Union will send investigators to Ukraine to help the local prosecutor general ""document war crimes.""

Mr. Biden noted that he faced push back last month when he described Putin as a war criminal for the unfolding onslaught in Ukraine after hospitals and maternity wards were bombed. In his remarks on Monday, Mr. Biden made clear that label still applied.

President Joe Biden told reporters on Monday that the United States is collecting evidence to support war crimes charges against Putin, working on new sanctions, and continuing to provide weapons to Ukrainian defense forces. “You may remember I was criticized for calling Putin a war criminal,” Biden said. “The truth of the matter, you saw what happened in Bucha—this warrants him…he is a war criminal,” Biden continued. “This guy is brutal, and what’s happening in Bucha is outrageous, and everyone’s seen it.”

Accounts of Russian atrocities have accumulated since Putin launched his Ukraine invasion in February. Last month, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, warned that “war crimes are part of Russia’s deliberate strategy.” But the human toll of Russian attacks has come into even starker view in recent days following the Russian withdrawal from Bucha, a suburb near Ukraine’s capital city. Satellite images have shown mass graves in the town. Reuters journalists on the ground in Bucha also described horrific scenes of bodies in the street and open graves “with hands and feet poking through the red clay heaped on top.” The city’s mayor, Anatoly Fedoruk, told the Washington Post that nearly 300 civilians had been found in mass graves there.

The “Bucha massacre was deliberate,” Kuleba tweeted Sunday, along with images of slaughtered civilians. “Russians aim to eliminate as many Ukrainians as they can.”

Residents in areas occupied by Russian forces in Ukraine described summary executions of civilians, rape by a Russian soldier, and other abuses against Ukrainians in a Human Rights Watch (HRW) report released Sunday. In one instance described to the human rights organization, Russian forces in Bucha forced five men to “kneel on the side of the road, pulled their T-shirts over their heads, and shot one of the men in the back of the head.”

“The cases we documented amount to unspeakable, deliberate cruelty and violence against Ukrainian civilians,” Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director at HRW, said in the report, which documented alleged atrocities in Chernihiv, Kharkiv, and other Russian-occupied areas of the country. “Rape, murder, and other violent acts against people in the Russian forces’ custody should be investigated as war crimes.”

Russia, which has a history of human rights abuses under Putin, including in its aerial bombardment of Syria half a decade ago, is already under International Criminal Court (ICC) investigation for war crimes. ICC prosecutor Karim Khan said in announcing the investigation March 2 that his office “had already found a reasonable basis to believe crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court had been committed, and had identified potential cases that would be admissible.” But the international community has struggled at times to respond to Russia’s aggression, attempting to support Ukraine and hold the Kremlin accountable without further provoking Putin, who has repeatedly issued nuclear threats.",https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/04/he-is-a-war-criminal-biden-calls-putin-brutal-amid-reports-of-russian-human-rights-abuses
