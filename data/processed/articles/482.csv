US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has accused Russia of committing war crimes in Ukraine, echoing comments by President Joe Biden who had labelled his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin a “war criminal“.

Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Blinken said Department of State experts are in the process of documenting and evaluating potential war crimes in Ukraine to help international efforts towards accountability, but he said it is apparent that Russia is committing abuses in the conflict.

“Yesterday, President Biden said that – in his opinion – war crimes have been committed in Ukraine. Personally, I agree,” Blinken told reporters.

“Intentionally targeting civilians is a war crime. After all the destruction of the past three weeks, I find it difficult to conclude that the Russians are doing otherwise.”

Biden had angered the Kremlin on Wednesday when he called Putin a “war criminal” – a comment that Moscow rebuked as “unacceptable and unforgivable rhetoric”. On Thursday, the US president also described his Russian counterpart as a “murderous dictator” and a “pure thug”.

Meanwhile, at the Department of State, Blinken pledged to ensure accountability for abuses in Ukraine.

“When I tell you that there will be accountability and consequences for any war crimes that have been committed, I hope you’ll take my word,” the top US diplomat told reporters. “But actions always speak louder than words.”

Russia launched an all-out invasion of Ukraine on February 24 after a months-long standoff that saw Moscow amass troops near the Ukrainian borders as it demanded an end to NATO expansion into former Soviet republics.

The war has forced more than 3.1 million people to flee Ukraine, according to the United Nations, and devastated areas across the country. Major cities, including the capital Kyiv, have faced Russian bombardment and siege.

On Thursday, Ukrainian officials said a Russian attack killed 21 people in the town of Merefa outside the city of Kharkiv in the east of the country. A day earlier, Ukraine accused Russian forces of bombing a theatre sheltering civilians in the besieged southern city of Mariupol.

Three weeks into the invasion, US officials have said Russia continues to face military and logistic setbacks in its campaign amid fierce Ukrainian resistance.

Blinken said on Thursday that Russia may stage a chemical attack to escalate the war, noting that Washington accurately predicted the invasion weeks before it started.

“We believe that Moscow may be setting the stage to use a chemical weapon, and then falsely blame Ukraine to justify escalating its attacks on the Ukrainian people,” Blinken told reporters.

The top US diplomat also said Washington believes that Moscow will bring in mercenaries from foreign countries to fight in the conflict. He added that Russia will “systematically” kidnap local Ukrainian officials to replace them “with puppets”.

The US and its allies were quick to impose sweeping sanctions on the Russian economy, as well as financial penalties on Putin and elites in his inner circle after the invasion.

Washington has also stepped up military and humanitarian support to Kyiv. After signing a US budget containing $13.6bn in assistance to Ukraine, Biden announced $800m in additional military aid to the country this week.

On Thursday, Blinken called on “all nations” to use any leverage they may have with Russia to get it to end the war, singling out China in his remarks.

“We believe China, in particular, has a responsibility to use its influence with President Putin and to defend the international rules and principles that it professes to support,” Blinken said.

During the past week, US officials have threatened China with “consequences” if it comes to Russia’s aid in Ukraine amid media reports that Moscow requested military assistance from Beijing.

Blinken, in advance of a call between Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday, reiterated those warnings, saying that Washington is “concerned” that Beijing may be considering helping Moscow’s war efforts.

“President Biden will be speaking to President Xi tomorrow and will make clear that China will bear responsibility for any actions it takes to support Russia’s aggression, and we will not hesitate to impose costs,” he told reporters.

In public statements, China has backed diplomatic efforts to end the war, but it has not condemned the invasion. It also abstained from votes at the UN Security Council and General Assembly calling for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine.

While backing diplomatic efforts to secure a ceasefire, Blinken said on Thursday that Moscow does not appear to be serious about ending the war.

“Diplomacy requires both sides engaging in good faith to de-escalate, and I don’t see signs right now that Putin is prepared to stop,” Blinken said.

Blinken also confirmed that an American citizen has been killed in Ukraine without offering further details.

The US Department of State has repeatedly advised Americans against going to Ukraine – including to volunteer in the fight against Russian forces – while also urging US citizens already in the country to leave immediately.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/17/blinken-accuses-russia-of-war-crimes-in-ukraine
1,2b77b303-6d8a-403b-984a-5951bbdd2323,['Michael Crowley'],2022-03-17 00:00:00,"“The reason for all their caution is that for any crime, there’s an evidentiary standard that has to be met,” said Oona Hathaway, a professor of international law at Yale Law School who serves on a State Department legal advisory board. “If you’re having a trial, you can’t just say, Yeah we all pretty much assume that he knew what was going on.”

Ms. Hathaway said prosecutors would have to show that Russian commanders had intentionally targeted civilian structures, or struck them during attacks that failed to discriminate between civilian and military targets. In the case of Mr. Putin, prosecutors would have to demonstrate that he issued specific orders tied to those actions.

Apprehending and trying anyone accused of crimes, not least the sitting president of a nuclear-armed nation, is another matter. “There’s no marshal service that goes with the International Criminal Court,” said Representative Tom Malinowski, Democrat of New Jersey and a former top State Department official for human rights.

But Mr. Malinowski and others said war crimes investigations can have a powerful deterrent effect. While Russian officials might hope that sanctions against them will someday be lifted, an indictment for war crimes brings a permanent stigma and risk of arrest.

With Russia’s military campaign bogged down and Ukraine claiming to have killed several Russian generals, Mr. Putin’s commanders in the field might have a reasonable fear of being captured and eventually tried for what amounts to mass murder. Frontline troops could also be demoralized by the official investigations.

“The hope is that it creates a disincentive for the most exposed people, who also happen to be the people closest to the fighting,” Ms. Hathaway said.

And it is possible that Mr. Putin would be deposed and could somehow fall into foreign hands. The former nationalist Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic, accused of war crimes during the breakup of Yugoslavia, was arrested by Serbian authorities after his 2001 ouster from office and delivered to The Hague for prosecution.

Bloody new attacks on civilians fuelled accusations Thursday that Russia is committing war crimes in Ukraine, as the United States warned it will make China pay for any support given to Moscow's assault.

Three weeks into Russia's devastating invasion, the harsh tally of assaults on civilian targets grew to include a school and a cultural centre in the town of Merefa, pounded by overnight artillery fire with 21 people killed, authorities said.

Despite the mounting carnage, punishing international sanctions and unexpectedly strong resistance from Ukrainians, top US diplomat Antony Blinken said Thursday he saw no sign that Russian leader Vladimir Putin ""is prepared to stop.""

""Intentionally targeting civilians is a war crime. After all the destruction of the past few weeks, I find it difficult to conclude that the Russians are doing otherwise,"" he said, following warnings from the G7 that those behind such crimes ""will be held responsible.""

Blinken was doubling down on the tough language used by President Joe Biden -- who a day earlier branded Putin a ""war criminal"" and on Thursday called him both a ""thug"" and a ""murderous dictator.""

He spoke as authorities were still trying to count the dead at the theatre targeted by a bomb in southern Mariupol a day earlier -- which Ukraine's leader Volodymr Zelensky held up as evidence ""Russia has become a terrorist state"".

In the latest of a series of resonant speeches to Western lawmakers, Zelensky told the German parliament that Moscow was building a new Cold War wall across Europe, ""between freedom and bondage.""

Russia's unrelenting onslaught on Mariupol has drawn particular horror.

Local officials say more than 2,000 people have died so far in indiscriminate Chechnya-style shelling of the strategic port, and 80 percent of its housing has been destroyed.

Under new Russian shelling, rescuers were combing through the smoking rubble of the Drama Theatre, where Ukrainian officials said more than 1,000 civilians were sheltering in a basement bomb shelter when it was bombed. Human Rights Watch believes they numbered at least 500.

Among the 30,000 civilians said to have fled Mariupol so far, evacuees said they were forced to melt snow for drinking water and cook food scraps on open fires, with water and power supplies cut off.

""In the streets there are the bodies of many dead civilians,"" Tamara Kavunenko, 58, told AFP after reaching the central city of Zaporizhzhia.

""It's not Mariupol anymore,"" she said. ""It is hell.""

- US puts China on notice -

Biden and NATO have refused to get directly involved in the conflict, fearing an escalation with nuclear-armed Russia that would trigger World War III.

Instead Biden has successfully marshalled a tight Western alliance against Moscow, piling sanctions on Putin's regime while giving military support to Ukrainian forces.

But one potentially dangerous outlier looms: China.

Beijing has refused to condemn Moscow, and Washington fears the Chinese could switch to full financial and even military support for Russia, transforming an already explosive transatlantic standoff into a global dispute.

A phone call between Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping is planned for Friday, and Blinken said his boss would press Beijing to help end the war, rather than support its fellow authoritarian ally.

Biden ""will make clear that China will bear responsibility for any actions it takes to support Russia's aggression and we will not hesitate to impose costs,"" Blinken said.

The broader economic consequences from the war could cut global growth by ""over one percentage point"" in the next 12 months, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said.

But Russia's finance ministry said Thursday it had made interest payments worth $117.2 million on two foreign bonds, avoiding a default for now.

- 'Tear down this wall' -

With stop-start peace talks ongoing, officials in Kyiv said Russia had agreed to nine humanitarian corridors Thursday for fleeing refugees, including one out of Mariupol.

But Blinken said that Moscow was not sincere, stating: ""I have not seen any meaningful efforts by Russia to bring this war that it is perpetrating to a conclusion through diplomacy.""

As the death count mounts and Russian forces squeeze Kyiv, Zelensky continued his increasingly desperate pleas for more help, particularly for military hardware and a no-fly zone.

He has been making a series of impassioned speeches to lawmakers in Western nations, each one tailor-made by invoking the most stirring moments of their recent histories.

This time, before the German parliament, he drew on a 1987 speech in Berlin by US president Ronald Reagan: ""Dear Mr Scholz, tear down this wall,"" he implored German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

""It's not a Berlin Wall -- it is a wall in central Europe between freedom and bondage and this wall is growing bigger with every bomb.""

In an overnight video message, Zelensky urged Russians directly to lay down their arms.

""If your war, the war against the Ukrainian people, continues, Russia's mothers will lose more children than in the Afghan and Chechen wars combined,"" he said.

- 'It is hell' -

The Ukrainian leader was speaking virtually from Kyiv, which Russian troops are still trying to surround in a slow-moving offensive.

Fresh fighting broke out on the city's edge as Ukrainian and Russian forces traded shell and rocket fire in the northwest, AFP journalists witnessed.

Civilians ran for cover as shelling set fire to a building near a warehouse, across the road from a mall with a multiplex cinema.

Inside the warehouse's car park, a Ukrainian soldier carrying a rifle ran in a crouch as gunshots crackled.

A man carried a prone child in his arms into a nearby block of flats, and at least five ambulances raced towards the scene.

In Odessa, on the Black Sea, civilians were bracing for attack, with tanks deployed at intersections and monuments covered in sandbags.

""Our beautiful Odessa,"" said Lyudmila, an elegant elderly woman wearing bright lipstick, as she looked apologetically at her city's empty, barricaded streets.

""But thank God we are holding on! Everyone is holding on!""

And elsewhere, civilians in bomb shelters did what they could to help forget the war raging outside -- even just for a while.

From her shelter in Ukraine's second city Kharkiv, Vera Lytovchenko has become a social media sensation with her violin performances and used the attention to launch a fundraiser.

""I want to help my friends and music teachers who have lost their homes, their jobs, their instruments,"" said the soloist.

""I don't want to feel helpless,"" she said.

On Wednesday, President Joe Biden called Russian President Vladimir Putin ""a war criminal"" for his unprovoked assault on Ukraine. It was the first time Biden publicly branded Putin with that term.

""After all, the destruction of the past three weeks, I find it difficult to conclude that the Russians are doing otherwise,"" he added.

""President Biden said that, in his opinion, war crimes have been committed in Ukraine. Personally, I agree. Intentionally targeting civilians is a war crime,"" Blinken said during a press conference at the State Department.

WASHINGTON – U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Thursday that he believes Russian forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine, citing numerous instances of attacks on civilians.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Wednesday that Biden was speaking from his heart about what he has seen on the news, which she described as ""barbaric actions by a brutal dictator.""

She noted that there is a separate legal process underway at the State Department to determine whether Putin violated international law and committed war crimes.

The nation's top diplomat described a laundry list of reports in which Russian forces targeted Ukrainian civilians.

""Russian forces bombed a theatre in Mariupol where hundreds of people had taken shelter. The word children had been written in Russian in giant white letters on the pavement outside the building so that you could know from the air that there were children inside,"" Blinken explained.

""Russian forces also opened fire on 10 civilians who were waiting in line for bread,"" he said, adding that the U.S. had so far observed a ""long list of attacks on civilian and nonmilitary locations across Ukraine.""

The United Nations on Wednesday said that since the Kremlin's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, nearly 780 civilians have been killed, with more than 1,252 civilians injured.

Also on Wednesday, the UN's top court ruled in favor of Ukraine and ordered Russia to immediately suspend its ongoing war.

“Today, we have a strong sense of what Russia could do next,” Blinken said in remarks from the State Department. “We believe that Moscow may be setting the stage to use a chemical weapon and then falsely blame Ukraine to justify escalating its attacks on the Ukrainian people.”

The secretary’s remarks are part of the Biden administration’s strategy to declassify intelligence to counter Russia’s disinformation and propaganda, warn the world of potential atrocities and unite a global response.

Blinken continued, saying that the U.S. believes that Russia will bring mercenaries from private military groups and foreign countries to Ukraine.

“President Putin acknowledged as much over the weekend, when he authorized the recruitment of additional forces for the Middle East and elsewhere,” Blinken said, adding that it pointed to a sense that “his war effort is not going as he hoped it would.”

The secretary said he views Russian atrocities in Ukraine as war crimes, citing specifically attacks on civilians and echoing earlier condemnation from President Biden, who called Putin a “war criminal” on Wednesday.

“After all the destruction of the past three weeks, I find it difficult to conclude that the Russians are doing otherwise,” the secretary said, citing some of the most egregious attacks documented so far in Russia’s 22-day war against Ukraine.

Blinken further warned that Russian forces are “likely to systematically kidnap local officials and replace them with puppets,” referencing the reported kidnapping of the Ukrainian mayor of the city of Melitopol, who was released on Wednesday in a prisoner exchange.

The secretary said another mayor was kidnapped in a southern city of Ukraine and has yet to be let go, calling it a “terror tactic.”

“Grab local officials, depose local governments, put proxies in their place,” Blinken said, outlining the Russian tactics.

He further warned that after Russian forces devastate Ukrainian cities, “Moscow may bring in officials from Russia to serve as local government officials and surge what they described as ‘economic support’ in an attempt to make the people dependent on Moscow for survival.”

The United Nations on Thursday issued a statement that it has counted 2,032 civilian casualties, with 780 killed and 1,252 injured — but believes the actual figure to be “considerably higher.”

The U.N. says casualties have been caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems, as well as missile strikes.

Blinken cited attacks on civilian sites this past week including Russian forces targeting a hospital, three schools, and a boarding school for visually impaired kids in the Luhansk region of Ukraine.

The secretary also cited a Russian bombing of a theater in the city of Mariupol where hundreds of people were sheltering from attacks. A sign reading “Children” in Russian was written on the pavement outside the building to warn off possible attacks from the air.

“Russian forces also opened fire on 10 civilians who were waiting in line for bread. These incidences join a long list of attacks on civilian, not military, locations across Ukraine, including apartment buildings, public squares and last week a maternity hospital in Mariupol,” Blinken said.

The secretary said this was part of Russia’s goal of “breaking the will of the Ukrainian people,” and said that the State Department is in the process of “documenting and evaluating potential war crimes being committed” and will share those with international efforts to investigate such crimes.

“I’m not going to get ahead of — for what the outcome will be or what the consequences will be. But I can say with conviction that there will be accountability for any war crimes that are determined to have occurred,” the secretary said.

Ukrainian historian: 'People just don't believe Kyiv will fall'

A historian with the Canadian Institute for Ukrainian studies at the University of Alberta has explained the determination of so many people in Kyiv to remain, despite the ongoing conflict.

Olha Klymenko is currently in Kyiv, having returned to be with her father, who neither wants to leave the city nor is in good enough health to do so. ""He refuses to leave. And this is the case with a lot of people, a lot of my friends,"" she told DW.

She said there were a number of reasons for this, perhaps they had children fighting with Ukrainian forces, or perhaps they simply refused to abandon their homes.

""There are people who just say: We're going to stay. This is our land. This is our home. We're not leaving. And people just do not believe that Kyiv is going to fall. They believe that Kyiv is going to stand. So I'm staying.""

Klymenko spoke from a darkened room on Thursday evening, as authorities had asked residents to keep their lights off to make targeting more difficult for Russian forces.

""Of course it was deliberate. The theater building stands alone and the closest buildings are like 100 meters away.""

Gurin said the word ""children"" was written in very big letters outside the theater [in front and behind] so it could be seen from the air.

""At 2 p.m. one of the survivors from Mariupol, the refugees, told on the Ukrainian television that there is a bomb shelter where women and children are in the basement trying to stay safe from the constant bombardment.""

""And in 20 minutes, a plane went there and dropped a super powerful bomb. So it's intentional and it's it cannot be a mistake. Exactly. And the pilot, he knew what he did.""

Gurin said that Russia was trying to starve Mariupol into submission, comparing it to ""Auschwitz or Treblinka…it’s mass murder.""

""Good news that we need so urgently. The air raid shelter under the theatre of Mariupol has stood up to it. Around 130 people have already been saved,"" Stefanishyna said in a Facebook post.

""It's a miracle,"" she said, adding that the rescuers were still searching for more survivors.

Ukrainian authorities had said that over 1,000 people had been hiding in the theater's bomb shelter when a Russian airstrike hit.

HRW urges Ukraine to stop posting footage of Russian prisoners

Rights group Human Rights Watch called on Ukraine to stop publishing videos of captured Russian soldiers as it violated the Geneva conventions.

""The obligation to protect POWs (prisoners of war) from being objects of public curiosity, as well as protecting them from intimidation or humiliation, is part of the broader requirement to ensure their humane treatment and protect their families from harm,"" said HRW's senior legal advisor Aisling Reidy. ""The Ukrainian authorities should stop posting these videos online.""

HRW noted that it documented numerous violations and apparent war crimes by Russian forces, but stressed that Ukraine still had to uphold ""clear obligations"" of human rights.

""The violations by Russian forces are pervasive and widespread, causing intense civilian harm,"" Reidy said. ""At the same time, Ukraine has clear obligations that it must uphold, including lawful treatment of POWs.""

In a separate statement, HRW reported that Russian forces fired cluster munition rockets into the densely populated city of Mykolaiv in southern Ukraine, killing and injuring several civilians in multiple attacks.

The rights group noted that cluster munitions are subject to an international treaty ban, citing its long-lasting danger to civilians.

Stoltenberg: NATO has 'responsibility' to prevent escalation

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance is determined to stop the war in Ukraine from escalating further.

""NATO has a responsibility to prevent this conflict from escalating further. That would be even more dangerous and cause more suffering, deaths and destruction,"" Stoltenberg told a joint news conference in Berlin with Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

Stoltenberg and Scholz reiterated their support for Ukraine and sharply criticized Russian President Putin for the war.

""This is President Putin's war. He must stop the war, withdraw his forces and engage in diplomacy in good faith,"" Stoltenberg said.

UK says will deploy Sabre missile system in Poland

British Defense Minister Ben Wallace said the UK will deploy its Sky Sabre missile system in Poland as NATO moves to bolster the security of its eastern flank.

""We are going to deploy the Sky Sabre medium-range, anti-air missile system to Poland with about 100 personnel to make sure that we stand alongside Poland, protecting her airspace from any further aggression by Russia,"" Wallace told a news conference, according to the Reuters news agency.

Wallace made the announcement during a trip to Warsaw.

Russia rejects ICJ order to halt invasion

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed an order by the United Nation's highest court, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), to suspend military action in Ukraine.

""We cannot take this decision into account,"" Peskov said, adding that both parties — Moscow and Kyiv — had to agree for the ruling to be implemented.

ICJ judges in The Hague announced their ruling a day earlier in a case raised by Ukraine to challenge the Russian invasion.

Rulings by the ICJ are binding, but the court has no executive means to implement them.

Search for Mariupol theater survivors underway

The bomb shelter underneath the drama theater in the besieged city of Mariupol is said to have withstood a Russian airstrike, city officials said, adding that there may be survivors.

""The bomb shelter held. Now the rubble is being cleared. There are survivors. We don't know about the number of victims yet,"" mayoral adviser Petro Andrushchenko told Reuters.

Ukrainian lawmaker Serhiy Taruta wrote that some survivors had already emerged. ""After a terrible night of uncertainty, on the morning of the 22nd day of the war finally good news from Mariupol! The bomb shelter has held,"" Taruta wrote.

""People are coming out alive!"" adding that the removal of the rubble had begun.

Ukraine war a wall through Europe, Zelenskyy tells Bundestag

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke directly to Germany's lawmakers in a video call on Thursday. The address follows a series of appeals Zelenskyy had been making to world powers, seeking to drum up support after Russia invaded his country.

Zelenykyy warned German MP's that Russia was trying to build a new wall against freedom.

""It's not a Berlin Wall, it is a wall in central Europe between freedom and bondage and this Wall is growing bigger with every bomb"" dropped on Ukraine,"" he said.

""Dear Mr. Scholz, tear down this wall,"" Zelenykyy added, evoking US President Ronald Reagan's Cold War appeal to then Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev in Berlin in 1987.

The Ukrainian president previously addressed the Canadian parliament and the US Congress, calling for tougher economic sanctions on the Kremlin and enablers of the invasion.

Mariupol council will 'never forgive' theater attack

Ukraine claimed on Wednesday that Russia had destroyed a theater in the besieged port city of Mariupol. Russia disputed the claim, as it had with explosions last week at a maternity hospital, claiming that a Ukrainian nationalist regiment, the Azov Batallion, was behind the attack.

A post on Telegram from the Mariupol local council appeared to suggest that as many as 1,000 people were sheltering inside.

""Today, the invaders destroyed the Drama Theater. A place, where more than a thousand people found refuge. We will never forgive this,"" the Mariupol local council said in a Telegram post.

The number of casualties from the incident is still not known.

Ukraine's Foreign Minister said that ""the Russians could not have not known this was a civilian shelter. Satellite images of the building showed the words ""children"" written in Russian on either side of it, presumably in the hope that this could be seen by either pilots or artillery units.

Europeans are defying Putin by helping refugees, says migration expert

An expert on forced migration has told DW that Russian President Vladimir Putin's plan to ""destabilize"" Europe with an influx of refugees from war-torn Ukraine has failed.

Gerald Knaus, chairman of the European Stability Initiative, said: ""I am sure that Vladimir Putin had the intention these people would destabilize Europe. A large number of refugees would scare the Europeans. And it's not happened. If the Europeans mobilize, they can defy his blackmail.""

To give an idea of the magnitude of the migration following the conflict, Knaus used the influx of refugees in Europe in 2015 as an example, where ""the big refugee movement in the Aegean, saw 1 million people"" coming ""from Turkey to Greece in 1 year. Now, 1 million people come from Ukraine to the EU in 1 week.""

Ukraine prosecutor general seeks punishment for 'war criminal' Putin

Ukraine's prosecutor general has welcomed the International Court of Justice's ruling for Russia to ""immediately suspend"" military operations in Ukraine.

Iryna Veneditktova told DW it as an ""important first step"" for Ukraine though ""we understand that such decisions cannot stop the war, can't punish the people who are guilty in the deaths of Ukrainian citizens.""

The prosecutor wants to eventually see proceedings brought against Russian ""soldiers, their top management, and the main war criminal of the 21st century — President Putin"" over the ""brutal and aggressive war.""

Japan: Sanctions on Russia needed

Japanese sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine are necessary, even if they squeeze energy supplies.

That is the view of Taro Kono, a former defense chief and ex-foreign minister. Kono says Japan may one day need to call on allies to help it counter China.

""We need to tell the people in Japan that in order to protect ourselves we need to help the others too,"" Kono told the Reuters news agency. ""If there is any aggression anywhere on this planet, we need to stop them.""

Japan sees neighboring China as its primary national security threat, followed by North Korea and Russia.

Summary of Wednesday's events in Ukraine-Russia crisis

The United Kingdom, United States, Albania, France, Norway, and Ireland requested an emergency UN Security Council meeting, asking for it to take place on Thursday.

Ukraine accused Russia of bombing a theater in Mariupol. Hundreds of people were said to have been sheltering there at the time.

Prosecutors in France opened a war crime investigation into the death of Franco-Irish Fox News cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski.

The Kremlin said US President Joe Biden's characterization of Russian leader Vladimir Putin as a war criminal was ""unacceptable and unforgivable,"" the Tass news agency reported.

Russia released Ivan Fedorov, the mayor of the southeastern Ukrainian city of Melitopol.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said Europe would ""suffer"" over the sanctions it has imposed.

Twenty-one people were killed and 25 wounded Thursday after rockets slammed into the western Ukraine town of Merefa as Russia's bloody, struggling invasion dragged into its fourth week.

Merefa Mayor Veniamin Sitov said the assault destroyed a school and community center. Ten survivors were critically wounded, the local prosecutor’s office reported.

Later Thursday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken became the second high-level U.S. official in two days to accuse Russia of war crimes.

Merefa, a town of 20,000 people, is about 20 miles south of Kharkiv and has been victimized by its proximity to the sprawling regional jewel that Russia's military pounding has failed to vanquish.

Kharkiv has become one of the saddest stories of the war, a city of museums and universities that 1.4 million people call home. Now it is slowly but deliberately being torn apart as Russia's apparently stalled military pounds away at whatever targets its missiles can reach.

Similar storylines were unfolding across much of the country. In the battered southern port city of Mariupol, rescue efforts were underway Thursday following Russian airstrikes that ripped apart a theater. The building, serving as a makeshift shelter for hundreds of women and children, was bombed late Wednesday even though the word ""CHILDREN"" in Russian was laid out in giant letters in front and behind it.

“The building withstood the impact of a high-powered air bomb and protected the lives of people hiding in the bomb shelter,"" Ukraine’s ombudswoman Ludmyla Denisova said Thursday. Ukrainian parliament member Sergiy Taruta added on a social media post that ""people are coming out alive.""

The Kyiv Independent reported at least 130 survivors had been pulled from the wreckage. The rescue efforts were continuing.

“Our hearts are broken by what Russia is doing to our people, to our Mariupol,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.

REDUCED TO RUBBLE:Heartbreaking images explore Ukraine's devastated residential areas

Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for Russia’s Foreign Ministry, denied the bombing and said the military ""does not bomb cities.""

But Vadim Denisenko, an adviser to the Ukraine minister of Internal Affairs, said 90% of Mariupol has been destroyed or damaged and that almost no buildings have been left untouched. Most of the 400,000 residents remain in the city, he said.

""Evacuation and rescue efforts remain extremely difficult due to constant Russian shelling,"" Denisenko said. ""This is beyond a humanitarian disaster.""

Blinken: 'There will be accountability for any war crimes'

Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Thursday that he agrees with President Joe Biden that war crimes have been committed in Ukraine.

“Intentionally targeting civilians is a war crime,” he said at a White House news briefing. “I find it difficult to conclude that the Russians are doing otherwise.”

Blinken’s comments came a day after Biden called Russian President Vladimir Putin a “war criminal.” On Thursday, Biden called Putin ""a murderous dictator, a pure thug who is waging an immoral war against the people of Ukraine.""

Describing the recent attack on Ukrainians waiting in bread lines and the bombing of a theater where children were sheltered, Blinken said the U.S. is helping document potential war crimes for prosecution.

Asked what should happen to Putin if he’s found guilty, Blinken said he won’t get ahead of the investigation, but he promised there will be consequences.

“I can say with conviction that there will be accountability for any war crimes that are determined to have occurred,” he said.

Blinken pushed the Senate to confirm nominees who can help respond to the events in Ukraine, including a position important for refugees and a coordinator for sanctions policy.

Asked about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Blinken said he sees no signs that Putin is prepared to stop.

American killed in Chernihiv seeking medical care for partner

Secretary of State Antony Blinken reported Thursday the death of an American in the war but did not identify the person. The victim's sister provided details in a Facebook post.

“My brother Jimmy Hill was killed yesterday in Chernihiv, Ukraine. He was waiting in a bread line with several other people when they were gunned down” by Russian military forces, wrote his sister, Cheryl Hill Gordon. “His body was found in the street by the local police.”

Ukrainian officials had previously said 10 people in a bread line were killed Wednesday in Chernihiv, a city of 285,000 people in the northern part of the country. Hill was the second U.S. citizen known to die in the war, after the killing of journalist and filmmaker Brent Renaud last week.

Hill, a Minnesota native believed to be 67, identified himself in a Facebook post as a lecturer at universities in Kyiv and Warsaw, Poland, and said he was in Chernihiv with his partner seeking medical treatment for her.

“Nobody in Chernihiv is safe. Indiscriminate bombing,'' he wrote March 2, less than a week into the war. ""Ukrainian forces hold city but are surrounded. It’s a siege here. Nobody in. Nobody out.”

WHO confirms 43 attacks on health care facilities

Among the most condemned attacks of the Russian invasion was last week's airstrike on a maternity hospital in Mariupol that killed three people and left 17 injured.

The World Health Organization says that's just one of 43 confirmed attacks on hospitals and health care facilities by Russian forces since the war began. Those aggressions have killed 12 and injured 34.

“The life-saving medicine we need right now is peace,” WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told the United Nations Security Council in a virtual briefing.

Russian ground advance remains stalled: They 'weren’t ready for pushback'

Russia continues struggling to feed, supply and rearm the troops it sent to invade Ukraine, according to a senior Defense Department official.

Poor planning and stiff resistance from Ukrainians has basically frozen the Russian advance three weeks after their invasion, the official said Thursday on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence assessments.

The official termed the Russian military situation in Ukraine “extraordinary,” noting that commanders are discussing how to resupply and reinforce the more than 150,000 troops that began amassing on Ukraine’s border in the fall.

The stalled invasion indicates the Russians didn’t properly plan for the war, lack good logistics and are facing stiffer resistance than expected, the official said. They “weren’t ready for pushback.”

Anecdotal indications show flagging morale among some Russian troops, the official said, attributing the morale issue to poor leadership, lack of communication with troops and disillusionment from fierce Ukrainian resistance.

Ukrainian fighters have stalled Russia’s advance about 10 miles from Kyiv’s city center, the official said. Russia appears to be moving artillery units closer to that front line, where they are expected to shell the city and try to wear it down, the official said.

Part of the latest military aid package approved by President Joe Biden will aid Ukrainians in attacking Russian forces attempting to besiege Kyiv, the official said. The shipments will include tactical drones.

China should wield its influence on Russia for the better, Blinken says

China has a particular responsibility to use its influence on Russia, Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters the day before President Joe Biden is scheduled to talk with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

But rather than defending the international rules it professes to support, Blinken said, China is instead moving in the opposite direction by refusing to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine while portraying itself as a neutral arbiter.

The U.S. is also concerned that China is considering directly assisting Russia with military equipment, something both China and Russia have denied.

During Friday’s call, Blinken said, Biden will make clear to Xi that China will bear responsibility for any actions it takes to support Russia's aggression.

“And,” he said, “we will not hesitate to impose costs.”

Baltic nations warn they could be next

The three leaders of legislative foreign affairs committees in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania warned U.S. lawmakers Thursday that Russia would remain a worldwide threat for years and could attack their Baltic region after Ukraine. The foreign lawmakers told the Helsinki Commission, made up of U.S. lawmakers and executive branch officials, that the Baltic countries haven’t been attacked yet because they belong to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which the U.S. and Europe have pledged to defend. But the lawmakers urged the U.S. to provide more troops, ground-based anti-aircraft weapons and fighter jets to protect them from neighboring Russia.

“We are not peripheral, we are the frontier where democracy for the entire Western world has to stand or fall,” Latvian lawmaker Rihards Kols said. “This will be a marathon, not a sprint.""

Schwarzenegger posts video urging Putin, Russians to end violence

Arnold Schwarzenegger urged Russia's government, military and citizens to end the war in a nine-minute video shared Thursday to social media. The former governor of California shared his appreciation of the Russian people and aimed to dispel misinformation to Russian citizens and military members by sharing ""the truth"" of why Russia invaded Ukraine.

Schwarzenegger shot down claims from the Russian government that the purpose of their invasion was to ""denazify Ukraine"" and shared heartbreaking images and video of buildings that had been bombed.

""To the soldiers who are listening to this, remember that 11 million Russians have family connections to Ukraine,"" he said. ""So every bullet you shoot, you shoot a brother or a sister. … And to President Putin, I say: You started this war. You are leading this war. You can stop this war.""

DHS chief Mayorkas says Russian cyberattacks on US haven't increased during war

Alejandro Mayorkas, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said Thursday the agency hasn’t detected additional Russian cyberattacks on critical infrastructure in the U.S. after the invasion of Ukraine, but has educated local officials and private businesses about how to protect against potential attacks.

“We have not seen an attack on the homeland that is tied to the Russian invasion of Ukraine,” Mayorkas told reporters during an online news conference, although Russian cyber attacks have been confirmed against Ukraine and other countries. “We continue of course to see cyber activity in the United States, independent of that.”

The department saw a 300% increase in ransomware incidents last year compared with a year earlier, for a combined $300 million in losses.

To educate local officials and private businesses, the department created a web site called Shields Up to distribute information about how to prevent the threat. Some of the advice includes using simple methods such as backing up files, changing passwords often and setting up multi-factor authentication.

Interest is high. The department has held 80 virtual meetings on the subject and one featured 9,000 participants, Mayorkas said.

“We provide tactics and techniques that Russian cyber actors have used in the past, so that people can patch any vulnerabilities, strengthen their defenses and be ready,” Mayorkas said.

The secretary also said DHS has reminded Border Patrol agents that Ukrainian refugees from the war arriving in the U.S. could receive an exception to health restrictions that might otherwise bar their entry into the country.

WNBA star Brittney Griner to remain in Russian custody until May 19

WNBA star Brittney Griner, detained at a Moscow airport last month, will be held until at least May 19, the Russian state news agency Tass reported. Griner was detained after Russian authorities said a search of her luggage revealed vape cartridges. They were identified as containing oil derived from cannabis, which could carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison in Russia.

“The court granted the request of the investigation and extended the period of detention of the U.S. citizen Griner until May 19,” the court said.

The two-time Olympic gold medalist, 31, has played basketball in Russia for the last seven years in the winter, earning over $1 million per season – more than four times her WNBA salary. The WNBA season opens May 6.

Ukrainian men steel for battle as they say goodbye to families

LVIV, Ukraine – As millions of Ukrainian women and children move west to escape Russia's widening war in their country, a largely unspoken frontline – open-ended, full of searing psychological hurt – continues to expand across Ukraine: the men they leave behind.

Many of the women USA TODAY spoke to were too overcome with emotion to address the subject of leaving their husbands behind, but many Ukrainian men showed remarkable stoicism in talking about the pain of family separations that have no foreseeable end. They feel it is their duty to defend their country.

""My family understands that if we don't win this fight, future generations – maybe even the whole world – will not have a good life,"" said Igor Kotz, 37, a property developer turned amateur security chief for a Lviv-based humanitarian aid center that helps supply Ukraine's professional and civilian armed forces. His wife and children fled to Poland while he stayed to fight, and Kotz said, ""I have accepted that I may not ever see my wife and kids again."" Read more here.

The allegations came as Washington sought to intensify international pressure on Moscow by warning China — Putin’s most powerful ally — not to send military aid to Russia. U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken delivered the message ahead of Friday’s expected meeting between President Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

“President Biden will be speaking to President Xi tomorrow and will make clear that China will bear responsibility for any actions it takes to support Russia’s aggression, and we will not hesitate to impose costs,” Blinken told journalists in Washington.

The fighting across Ukraine in recent days has seen Ukrainian counteroffensives slowing Russian advances even as Putin’s forces bombard cities and civilian centers.

Those attacks have led the State Department to begin a legal process to document potential war crimes against Russia, noting that any formal accusations would probably be brought before the International Criminal Court at The Hague.

“Intentionally targeting civilians is a war crime,” Blinken said. “After all the destruction of the past three weeks, I find it difficult to conclude that the Russians are doing otherwise.”

His comments came as civilian deaths across Ukraine were mounting, with bodies in some cities heaped hastily into mass graves. The United Nations said Thursday that at least 726 civilians have been killed, including 52 children, although officials said the true number was probably much higher.

“Most of these casualties were caused by the use in populated areas of explosive weapons with a wide impact area,” Rosemary A. DiCarlo, the U.N. undersecretary for political and peace-building affairs, said at an emergency session of the U.N. Security Council.

Speaking at the meeting, Russia’s ambassador to the U.N. again denied that Russia has targeted civilians, alleging that the bombed theater had been housing Nazi groups that were using the building to store weapons.

The U.N. says 3.1 million people have fled Ukraine since Russia invaded Feb. 24.

The International Rescue Committee said Thursday that at least 20 people were killed and 25 injured in an attack on a school in the city of Merefa.

In eastern Ukraine, a public pool facility where civilians had been sheltering was also hit, officials said, although it was unclear whether there were casualties.

At the same time, rescuers began to pull survivors from the rubble of a nighttime airstrike on the theater in the besieged port city of Mariupol. The death toll at the stately theater, which satellite images showed had the word “children” written on the ground outside in an effort to deter an attack, was still unknown. But an official from the city said there were at least 130 survivors among the many hundreds who had huddled inside for protection.

“After a terrible night of uncertainty on the 22nd day of war, finally good news from Mariupol! The bomb shelter survived,” another official from the area, Ukrainian lawmaker Sergiy Taruta, wrote on Facebook. “People are coming out alive!”

Lyudmila Denisova, the Ukrainian parliament’s commissioner for human rights, said on Facebook that it appeared that the shelter “withstood the impact of a high-powered air bomb and protected the lives of people” inside.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an early-morning video that he believed Russian troops had “purposefully” targeted the building.

“Our hearts are broken by what Russia is doing to our people, to our Mariupol,” he said of the southeastern city on the Sea of Azov, which has been one of the worst hit of the war and is surrounded by enemy forces.

Local officials say more than 2,400 people have died and tens of thousands more are struggling to survive without running water, power or much food. Deputy Mayor Sergei Orlov said this week that “no building is undamaged” in the city of 446,000.

In the capital, Kyiv, residents awakened to what has become a depressing routine: reports of death and damage at another residential building after a Russian assault. This time it was by indirect fire: Ukrainian air defense officials said they intercepted a Russian missile, which then fell in front of high-rises in the southeastern district of Darnytsky.

The blast killed one person and wounded three others, authorities said, and 30 residents were evacuated from the worst-hit tower. The explosion’s impact could be seen all over the block, with at least eight building facades damaged.

By late morning, those who remained fought cold temperatures and powerful gusts as they tried to clear debris. One family carried a load of glass shards and twisted metal in a bedsheet to the nearby trash bin. Others queued to get large sheets of transparent, tarp-like materials to use as temporary cover.

Ukrainian officials were also assessing the war’s toll in Chernihiv, 80 miles northeast of Kyiv, where at least 10 civilians were killed while waiting in a bread line, the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv said Wednesday. In a Facebook post, Viacheslav Chaus, the head of the Chernihiv regional administration, said the overall death toll in the city was far greater.

“The enemy is exposing the city to systematic artillery and airstrikes, destroying the civilian infrastructure of Chernihiv,” Chaus said. “Over the past 24 hours, 53 bodies of victims killed by the Russians have been brought to the morgue.”

Ukrainian officials said a U.S. citizen was among the victims in Chernihiv. Anton Gerashchenko, an advisor to Ukraine’s interior minister, identified him as James Whitney Hill, a Minnesota native.

Hill had been helping oversee the medical treatment of a severely ill friend when the war began, according to a Facebook post by Hill’s sister. The pair became trapped in a hospital amid relentless Russian artillery fire — a harrowing experience that Hill chronicled on his Facebook page.

Amid a constant barrage of artillery and machine gun fire, regular power outages and dwindling supplies of food and water, Hill said, he had been overcome with a “helpless feeling.”

“Bombing has intensified,” he wrote in his final post two days ago. “No way out.”

On Thursday, Hill’s sister Cheryl confirmed her brother’s death, saying he had been “waiting in a bread line with several other people when they were gunned down by Russian military snipers. His body was found in the street by the local police.”

The Ukrainian government said there had been artillery fire and airstrikes elsewhere in the country, including the eastern town of Avdiivka. In the southern city of Mykolaiv, which is controlled by Ukraine, fighting continued as Russian forces attempted to enter in a bid to establish some control along the Azov and Black seas.

The Kyiv suburbs of Kalynivka and Brovary, northeast of the capital, also saw shelling as Ukrainian forces attempted a counteroffensive against Russians around Kyiv and said they had shot down 10 Russian planes and missiles. The claim could not be independently verified.

The fighting came as a fourth day of negotiations between Russia and Ukraine came and went with no announcements. Earlier, representatives for both countries said talks were progressing.

“We have much confidence that we will have a cease-fire in coming days,” Mykhailo Podolyak, an advisor to Zelensky, said in a “PBS NewsHour” interview Wednesday.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said talks have taken on a “businesslike spirit.”

Podolyak said he believes Russia will sign an agreement because its forces have been unable to take Kyiv and have made limited inroads since successfully invading eastern and southern areas weeks ago. On Thursday, the British government echoed part of Podolyak’s analysis.

“Russian forces have made minimal progress on land, sea or air in recent days and they continue to suffer heavy losses,” the assessment from Britain’s Defense Ministry said.

Pentagon officials, in what they call a conservative estimate, say more than 7,000 Russian troops have died in the war — far more than the 500 officially recognized by Moscow. Kyiv has so far acknowledged the deaths of 1,300 Ukrainian troops.

Putin, who has moved to silence dissent in Russia as a barrage of crippling economic sanctions sting the nation’s economy, has insisted that his “special military operation” is proceeding according to plan and that he will not stop it until all of his aims are achieved.

After Zelensky’s impassioned speech to the U.S. Congress on Wednesday asking for further aid, weapons and sanctions on Russia as well as a no-fly zone over Ukraine, Biden pledged $800 million in additional help, including guns and drones, although he excluded a U.S.-led patrol of Ukrainian skies. Biden called Putin a “war criminal” in what administration officials later said was an unguarded moment. Moscow denounced the allegation as “unacceptable and unforgivable.”

Zelensky, who has kept a daily schedule of live video appeals to foreign governments, appeared virtually Thursday before the Bundestag, the lower house of Germany’s Parliament.

After a brief delay caused by an attack close to where he was speaking, Zelensky asked for his country to be admitted to the European Union — a request unlikely to be granted anytime soon — and criticized Germany’s strong economic ties with Russia, including its substantial imports of Russian fuel. Berlin has not followed the U.S. in banning Russian oil and gas, although it did halt a major pipeline project designed to double the flow of Russian gas to Germany.

“We could see your willingness to continue to do business with Russia, and now we’re in the middle” of a war, Zelensky said.

“Why does ‘never again’ not apply? What is Germany’s historic responsibility toward Ukraine today?” Zelensky said in a reference to the Holocaust, drawing a comparison between Russia’s attempted expansion into Ukraine and Germany’s invasions of its neighbors during World War II.

Although it has largely held Russian forces back from most major cities, Ukraine continues to conduct daily burials of the dead.

Funeral services for fallen soldiers from Kyiv and elsewhere are becoming a regular part of life in the western city of Lviv, which otherwise has largely remained out of Russian crosshairs.

At a service Thursday at the church of St. Peter and Paul in Lviv’s Old City, an honor guard of young soldiers carried their fallen comrade’s photo to the church, then awaited the arrival of the van carrying his coffin.

The remains of Ivan Skrypnyk, 37, were taken inside for a funeral Mass. A family friend said Skrypnyk and two others were killed when a land mine exploded and destroyed their armored vehicle outside Kyiv.

City officials in Lviv announced that a moment of silence would be held each day at 9 a.m. to commemorate the growing numbers of victims, military and civilian.

War enters fourth week

KYIV/LVIV, Ukraine, March 17 (Reuters) - Russian forces in Ukraine are blasting cities and killing civilians but no longer making progress on the ground, Western countries said on Thursday, as a war Moscow was thought to have hoped to win within days entered its fourth week.

Local officials said rescuers in the besieged southern port of Mariupol were combing the rubble of a theatre where women and children had been sheltering, bombed by Russian forces the previous day.

""The bomb shelter held. Now the rubble is being cleared. There are survivors. We don’t know about the (number of) victims yet,"" mayoral adviser Petro Andrushchenko told Reuters by phone.

Russia denied striking the theatre, which commercial satellite pictures showed had the word ""children"" marked out on the ground in front before it was blown up.

Mariupol has suffered the worst humanitarian catastrophe of the war, with hundreds of thousands of civilians trapped in basements with no food, water or power for weeks. Russian forces have begun letting some people out in private cars this week but have blocked aid convoys from reaching the city.

Viacheslav Chaus, governor of the region centred on the frontline northern city of Chernihiv, said 53 civilians had been killed there in the past 24 hours. The toll could not be independently verified.

In the capital Kyiv, a building in the Darnytsky district was extensively damaged by what the authorities said was debris from a missile shot down early in the morning.

As residents cleared glass and carried bags of possessions away, a man knelt weeping by the body of a woman which lay close to a doorway, covered in a bloody sheet.

Although both sides have pointed to limited progress in peace talks this week, President Vladimir Putin, who ordered Russia's invasion on Feb. 24, showed little sign of relenting.

In a vituperative televised speech, he inveighed against ""traitors and scum"" at home who helped the West, and said the Russian people would spit them out like gnats.

Dmitry Medvedev, deputy head of Putin's security council, said the United States had stoked ""disgusting"" Russophobia in an attempt to force Russia to its knees: ""It will not work - Russia has the might to put all of our brash enemies in their place.""

Kyiv and its Western allies believe Russia launched the unprovoked war to subjugate a neighbour Putin calls an artificial state. Moscow says it is carrying out a ""special operation"" to disarm and ""denazify"" Ukraine.

Heavily outnumbered Ukrainian forces have prevented Moscow from capturing any of Ukraine's biggest cities so far despite the largest assault on a European state since World War Two. More than 3 million Ukrainians have fled and thousands of civilians and combatants have died.

'STALLED ON ALL FRONTS'

British military intelligence said in an update on Thursday that the invasion had ""largely stalled on all fronts"", and Russian forces were suffering heavy losses from a staunch and well-coordinated Ukrainian resistance.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy addressed the German Bundestag by video link, pulling no punches in a speech that invoked the Holocaust and the Berlin Wall, and seemed intended to shame pro-Russian politicians in Moscow's main energy buyer. read more

""Every year politicians repeat 'never again',"" said Zelenskiy, who is of Jewish heritage, citing a slogan used to mark the Holocaust. ""And now we see that these words are simply worthless. In Europe a people is being destroyed, they are trying to destroy everything that is dear to us, what we live for.""

He accused Germany of helping to build a new wall ""in the middle of Europe between freedom and unfreedom"", by isolating Ukraine with its business ties to Russia and its earlier support for Nord Stream 2, a gas pipeline it has since frozen.

Russia has assaulted Ukraine from four directions, sending two massive columns towards Kyiv from the northwest and northeast, pushing in from the east near the second biggest city Kharkiv, and spreading in the south from Crimea.

Northeastern and northwestern suburbs of Kyiv have been reduced to rubble by heavy fighting, but the capital itself has held firm, under a curfew and subjected to deadly nightly rocket attacks.

Amid the unrelenting fighting, both sides have spoken of progress at talks. Ukrainian officials have said they think Russia is running out of troops to keep fighting and could soon come to terms with its failure to topple the Ukrainian government. Moscow has said it is close to agreeing a formula that would keep Ukraine neutral, long one of its demands.

Moscow said peace talks resumed on Thursday by videolink for a fourth straight day, discussing military, political and humanitarian issues. A top aide to Zelenskiy said Ukraine still maintained its core demand, that it retain sovereignty over areas occupied since 2014 by Russian and pro-Russian forces.

9,2b77b303-6d8a-403b-984a-5951bbdd2323,"['Jen Kirby', 'Jonathan Guyer', 'Mar']",2022-03-12 07:30:00-05:00,"Russia’s war in Ukraine has stretched on for more than three weeks, a relentless bombardment of the country’s cities and towns that has led to more than 800 civilian deaths, destroyed civilian infrastructure, and forced more than 3.3 million people to flee Ukraine, creating a new humanitarian crisis in Europe.

The devastation is far from over.

The scale of the Russian invasion — the shelling of major cities like Kyiv, the capital, and Kharkiv, in the east — hinted at Russian President Vladimir Putin’s larger aims: Seizing control of Ukraine, with the goal of regime change. Though its military is far bigger than Ukraine’s, Russia’s apparently confounding strategic decisions and logistical setbacks, combined with the ferocity of Ukraine’s resistance, have stymied its advance.

That has not stopped a catastrophe from unfolding within Ukraine, even as it has prompted Western allies to effectively wage economic warfare against Moscow with unprecedented sanctions.

It will only get worse as this war grinds on, experts said. “Despite the surprisingly poor military performance of the Russian military to date, we’re still in the early opening phase of this conflict,” said Sara Bjerg Moller, an assistant professor of international security at Seton Hall University.

This toll is expected to climb, especially as the Russian offensive intensifies around Ukrainian cities, where shelling and strikes have hit civilian targets, and as efforts at high-level Ukraine-Russia negotiations have so far failed. All of this is happening as Russian forces appear to be preparing to lay siege to Kyiv.

“This war is about the battle of Kyiv,” said John Spencer, a retired Army officer and chair of urban warfare studies at the Madison Policy Forum.

Taking Kyiv would mean taking control of Ukraine — or at least deposing the government of Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president whose defiance has galvanized the Ukrainian resistance. Most experts believe Russia will prevail, especially if it can cut off Kyiv, and the Ukrainian resistance, from supplies.

Just because Russia may ultimately succeed militarily does not mean it will win this war. A Ukrainian insurgency could take root. The political, domestic, and international costs to Russia could challenge Putin’s regime. The West’s sanctions are throttling Russia’s economy, and they could do lasting damage. Russia’s war has strengthened the Western alliance in the immediate term, but that political will could be tested as energy prices spike and as the war and refugee crisis wear on.

“War is never isolated,” Zelenskyy said in a video address Thursday. “It always beats both the victim and the aggressor. The aggressor just realizes it later. But it always realizes and always suffers.”

The war in Ukraine is likely going to become more violent

Russia’s strategic setbacks have undermined its mission to take Ukraine, but it has only exacerbated the brutal and indiscriminate war, not even a month old.

The longer and harder the Ukrainian resistance fights, the more likely Russia may deploy more aggressive tactics to try to achieve their aims. “This is what we would call a war of attrition. They are trying to grind down the Ukrainian people’s morale, and unfortunately, that includes the bodies of Ukrainians,” Moller said.

Urban warfare is particularly calamitous, as civilians who have not evacuated are often caught in the middle of battles that happen block-by-block. Russia’s military tactics in cities — witnessed in places like Syria and Grozny in Chechnya in 1999 — have shown little regard for civilian protection. Spencer, the urban warfare specialist, said even Putin is limited, to a degree, by the rules of war, and so he is likely to claim that civilian infrastructure — like hospitals — are also military targets.

But urban warfare is, by nature, murky and complex and often far more deadly. Even if Russia attempts precision attacks, it can have a cascading effect — Russia bombs alleged military targets, those operations move, Russia bombs again. “You’re going to use so many of them, the end result is the same as if you just used indiscriminate, mass artillery barrage,” said Lance Davies, a senior lecturer in defense and international affairs at the UK’s Royal Military Academy.

Even in the early days of this war, Russia’s efforts are already having this effect. “They’re causing tremendous damage to civilian infrastructure,” said Rachel Denber, the deputy director of the Europe and Central Asia division at Human Rights Watch. “They’re taking many, many civilian lives.” Denber pointed to the use of weapons in heavily populated areas, including those that are explicitly banned, like cluster munitions. Human Rights Watch documented their use in three residential areas in Kharkiv on February 28. “You put that in a city like Kharkiv, and if it’s a populated area, no matter what you were aiming at, no matter what the target, it’s going to hurt civilians,” she said.

The United Nations has confirmed at least 2,149 civilian casualties, including 816 killed as of March 17, though these numbers are likely undercounts, as intense fighting in some areas has made it difficult to verify statistics.

All of this is exacerbating the humanitarian catastrophe on the ground in Ukraine, as shelling cuts off power stations and other supply lines, effectively trapping people within war zones in subzero temperatures without electricity or water, and with dwindling food, fuel, and medical supplies. In Mariupol, a city of 400,000 that has been under Russian siege for days, people were reportedly melting snow for drinking water. Humanitarian groups say the fighting is making it difficult to deliver aid or to reach those civilians left behind — often elderly or disabled people, or other vulnerable populations that didn’t have the ability to flee.

Ukrainian and Russian officials agreed to a temporary ceasefire to establish humanitarian corridors out of six cities on March 9, but the enforcement of those safe passages has been spotty, at best. According to the United Nations, on March 9, evacuations did happen in some places, but there was “limited movement” in the vulnerable areas, like Mariupol and the outskirts of Kyiv. Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of shelling some of those routes, and have rejected Russia’s calls for refugees to be evacuated to Russia or Belarus. Russian officials have blamed disruption on Ukrainian forces.

The fighting across Ukraine has forced about 9.8 million people to flee so far, according to the United Nations. Nearly 6.5 million people are internally displaced within Ukraine, although tens of thousands of Ukrainians were already forcibly displaced before Russia’s invasion because of the eight-year war in the Donbas region. Many have taken refugee in oblasts (basically, administrative regions) in western and northwestern Ukraine.

Another 3.3 million Ukrainians have escaped, mostly to neighboring countries like Poland, Romania, and Moldova. It is Europe’s largest refugee crisis since World War II, and host countries and aid agencies are trying to meet the astounding needs of these refugees, most of whom are women and children.

“They need warmth, they need shelter, they need transportation to accommodations,” said Becky Bakr Abdulla, an adviser to the Norwegian Refugee Council who is currently based in Poland. “They need food, they need water. Many need legal aid — their passports have been stolen, they’ve forgotten their birth certificates.”

How the war in Ukraine began, and what’s happened so far

For months, Russia built up troops along the Ukrainian border, reaching around 190,000 on the eve of the invasion. At the same time, Russia issued a series of maximalist demands to the United States and NATO allies, including an end to NATO’s eastward expansion and a ban on Ukraine entering NATO, among other “security guarantees.” All were nonstarters for the West.

But the short answer to why Russia decided to follow through with an invasion: Vladimir Putin.

From Putin’s perspective, many historians of Europe have said, the enlargement of NATO, which has moved steadily closer to Russia’s borders, was certainly a factor. But Putin’s speech on the eve of his invasion offers another clue: the Russian president basically denied Ukrainian statehood, and said the country rightfully belongs to Russia.

But Russia’s history of incursions, invasions, and occupations under Putin — including Chechnya, Georgia, and Crimea — have foreshadowed a new, even more brutal war. Seen through this lens, he is not a madman, but a leader who came to power with the lethal siege of Grozny in Chechnya in 1999, who has pursued increasingly violent policy, and who has been willing to inflict civilian casualties to achieve his foreign policy goals.

In 2014, Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine that culminated in the occupation of the Crimea peninsula in the south. Later that year, Russia deployed hybrid tactics, such as proxy militias and soldiers without insignia, to attack the Donbas region, where 14,000 people have died since 2014. On February 22, in the days before Putin launched a full-fledged war on Ukraine, he sent Russian troops into Donbas and declared two provinces there independent.

This time, according to former State Department Russia specialist Michael Kimmage, Putin miscalculated the difficulty of taking over Ukraine. Still, as the days go on, this war could escalate to unimaginable levels of violence. “If Putin really is feeling very threatened, it’s possible that he will dig in his heels, double down and take a lot of risks in order to prevent any potential loss of power,” said Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a former intelligence officer who’s now a senior fellow and director of the Transatlantic Security Program at the Center for a New American Security.

Russia is committing possible war crimes in Ukraine, and Ukrainians are responding with their full military force. They have also developed a strong civil resistance enabled by volunteers of all stripes. “All the nation is involved, not only the army,” said a Ukrainian person who has been supplying medicines.

According to a conservative estimate by US intelligence, around 7,000 Russian personnel have died so far — more troops than the US lost over two decades of fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq.

But Russia’s initial setback could lead to increasingly brutal tactics. “We’re looking at World War II kinds of atrocities. Bombing of civilians, rocket fire and artillery, smashing cities, a million refugees; that what looked impossible before now looks within the realm,” said Daniel Fried, a former ambassador to Poland and current fellow at the Atlantic Council.

How the West has responded so far

In the aftermath of Russia’s Ukrainian invasion, the United States and its allies imposed unprecedented sanctions and other penalties on Russia, acting with a swiftness and cohesion that surprised some observers, including, most likely, Putin himself.

“The US and the Western reaction to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is essentially blowing the lid off of sanctions,” said Julia Friedlander, director of the Economic Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council. “Never in the past have we accelerated to such strong sanctions and economic restrictions in such a quick period of time — and also considered doing it on one of the largest economies in the world.”

There’s a lot of sanctions, and the US and its partners have only increased the pressure since. President Joe Biden announced on March 8 that the US would place extreme limits on energy imports from Russia — the kind of last-resort option that few experts thought might happen because of the shock to energy prices and the global economy. (Europe, far more dependent on Russian energy imports, has not joined these sanctions.) On March 11, Biden pushed Congress to strip Russia of its “most favored nation” status, which would put tariffs on Russian goods, though it’s likely to have limited impact compared to the slew of sanctions that already exist.

Ukraine’s resistance in the face of Russian aggression helped push Western leaders to take more robust action, as this fight became framed in Washington and in European capitals as a fight between autocracy and democracy. A lot of credit goes to Zelenskyy himself, whose impassioned pleas to Western leaders motivated them to deliver more lethal aid to Ukraine and implement tougher sanctions.

Among the toughest sanctions are those against Russia’s central bank. The US and European Union did this in an effort to block Russia from using its considerable foreign reserves to prop up its currency, the ruble, and to undermine its ability to pay for its Ukraine war. Russia had tried to sanction-proof its economy after 2014, shifting away from US dollars, but the EU’s decision to join in undermined Russia’s so-called “fortress economy.”

The US and the EU also cut several Russian banks off from SWIFT, the global messaging system that facilitates foreign transactions. As Ben Walsh wrote for Vox, more than 11,000 different banks use SWIFT for cross-border transactions, and it was used in about 70 percent of transfers in Russia. Even here, though, certain banks were excluded from these measures to allow energy transactions, and EU countries, like Germany, are so far blocking efforts to expand these penalties.

The US has targeted numerous Russian banks, including two of Russia’s biggest, Sberbank and VTB. The US, along with other partners, have put bans on technology and other exports to Russia, and they’ve placed financial sanctions on oligarchs and other Russian officials, including Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Putin himself. Russian oligarchs have had their yachts seized in European vacation towns because of these sanctions, and the US has launched — and, yes, this is real — Task Force Kleptocapture to help enforce sanctions, although oligarchs’ actual influence on Putin’s war is limited.

These penalties are widespread — besides Europe, partners like South Korea and Japan have joined in. Even neutral countries like Switzerland have imposed sanctions (though there are loopholes.) Big Tech companies, cultural institutions, and international corporations, from Mastercard to McDonald’s, are pulling out of the country.

Experts said there are still some economic penalties left in the toolbox, but what’s already in place is massively damaging to the Russian economy. Russia’s economy is expected to dramatically shrink; its stock market remains closed. And even if these sanctions are targeted toward Russia’s ability to make war, the damage done to the Russian economic system will inevitably trickle down to ordinary Russians.

The fallout will not be limited to Russia. Biden’s announcement of an oil embargo against Russia has increased energy prices; what Biden, at least, is calling “Putin’s price hike.” And Russia may still engage in some sort of countermeasures, including cyberattacks or other meddling activity in the West.

How we get out of this

The US is doing almost everything it can without officially being a party to the conflict. The US has funneled 17,000 anti-tank missiles so far, including Javelins missiles, to Ukraine. On March 16, the US announced $800 million in additional military aid, including thousands of anti-armor weapons and small arms, 800 Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, and millions of rounds of ammunition.

Biden rejected the US enforcement of a no-fly zone in Ukraine, a military policy that polls surprisingly well among Americans but essentially means attacking any Russian aircraft that enters Ukrainian airspace. Seventy-eight national security scholars came out against a no-fly zone, saying that scenario would edge the US too close to a direct conflict with Russia.

So far, negotiations between Russia and Ukraine have faltered. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson, has said that the fighting could stop if Ukrainians agreed to neutrality (and no NATO membership), and agreed to recognize Crimea as Russian and the Donbas region as independent. “Is this a serious offer?” said Fried, the former ambassador who had experience working with Peskov. “It could be posturing. The Russians are liars.”

Zelenskyy has signaled some openness to neutrality, but Ukraine is going to want some serious security guarantees that it’s not clear Russia is willing to give.

The US’s absolutist rhetoric has complicated those efforts. Biden, in his State of the Union address, framed this conflict as a battle between democracy and tyranny. Even if a strong argument can be made in favor of that, given Putin’s actions, such language poses challenges for Western diplomats who must forge an off-ramp for Putin to end this war.

“If it’s good against evil, how do you compromise with evil?” said Thomas Graham, a Russia expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. “Putin does need a face-saving way to back down from some of his demands. But if we have a compromise solution to this conflict, we’re going to need off-ramps as well, to explain why we accept that less than a total defeat for Putin.”

In a Politico essay, Graham and scholar Rajan Menon proposed a framework for a negotiated outcome that begins with confidence-building measures between the US and Russia, rebuilding arms control treaties. The US and NATO would pledge that neither Ukraine nor Georgia will join NATO in the next several years or decades, though the possibility may be open someday. This would culminate in a “new security order for Russia,” they write. Russian academic Alexander Dynkin circulated a similar idea in the lead-up to the war.

Gavin Wilde, a former director for the National Security Council who focused on Russia during the Trump administration, says the opportunities for a diplomatic resolution have not yet been exhausted. “The conundrum we found ourselves in quite a lot with Russia is, you have to talk to them. Because lives are at stake. These are two nuclear powers, and you have to keep talking,” he said.

What a Russian victory would mean for the world

The world has been galvanized by Ukraine’s small victories in this conflict.

Still, Ukraine faces long odds. By the numbers, the Russian military budget is about ten times that of Ukraine. The Russian military has 900,000 active troops, and the Ukrainian military has 196,000. Ukrainians may have the tactical advantage and the spirit to persevere, but structural factors weigh in Russia’s favor.

This all presages what could be a long, drawn-out war, all documented on iPhones. “It’s not going to be pretty,” says Samuel Charap, who studies the Russian military at RAND. A siege of major Ukrainian cities means “cutting off supply lines to a city and making it intolerable for people to resist — to engender surrender by inflicting pain.”

Still, Russia’s performance so far has been so poor that the scales may ultimately tip toward Ukraine. Mark Hertling, who was the top commander of the US Army’s European forces before retiring in 2013, says that the corruption within the Russian military has slowed down the advance.

“Unless it’s just a continuous shelling — but I don’t think Russia can even sustain that with their logistics support. They have already blown their wad quite a bit in terms of missiles and rockets,” Hertling said. “They’re having trouble moving, they’re having trouble resupplying. And when you have those two things combined, you’re going to have some big problems.”

However this plays out, the cruel effects of this war won’t just be felt in Ukraine. It’s truly a global crisis. The comprehensive sanctions on Russia will have massive implications for the Russian economy, hurting citizens and residents who have nothing to do with their autocratic leader. There will also be vast knock-on effects on the world economy, with particularly frightening implications for food security in the poorest countries. Those effects may be most visceral for stomachs in the Middle East; Egypt and Yemen depend on Russian and Ukrainian wheat.

The unprecedented sanctions may have unprecedented impact. “We don’t know what the full consequences of this will be, because we’ve never raised this type of economic warfare,” Graham said. “It’s hard to overestimate the shock that the Russian military operation has caused around the world and the fears that it has stoked about wider warfare in Europe.”",https://www.vox.com/22970918/russia-war-in-ukraine-explained
