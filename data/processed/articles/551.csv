Pepsi has sold it products in Russia for more than six decades, even when the company had to trade its soda concentrate for Stolichnaya vodka and warships. McDonald's opened its first location in the Soviet Union in 1990, just months before it collapsed.

In recent days, Pepsi, Coke, McDonald's and Starbucks have drawn criticism for continuing to operate in Russia while other U.S. companies announced suspensions and paused sales.

Yale Professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld compiled and made public a list of U.S. companies that have withdrawn from Russia following President Vladimir Putin's invasion — and those that hadn't. Until Tuesday afternoon, Coke was among the most recognizable names on the spreadsheet.

""Our hearts are with the people who are enduring unconscionable effects from these tragic events in Ukraine,"" Coke said in a brief statement Tuesday afternoon. ""We will continue to monitor and assess the situation as circumstances evolve.""

Russia represents one of the few regions worldwide where Coke's rival PepsiCo has a larger presence. In a regulatory filing, Coke said its business in Ukraine and Russia contributed about 1% to 2% of its consolidated net operating revenue and operating income in 2021.

Pepsi, on the other hand, generates roughly 4% of its annual revenue in Russia, though it is not halting all business in the country. The company said it will keep selling some essential products, like baby formula, milk and baby food.

It said it will suspend Russian sales of its Pepsi-Cola, 7UP and Mirinda brands, along with capital investments and all advertising and promotional activities.

""As a food and beverage company, now more than ever we must stay true to the humanitarian aspect of our business,"" Pepsi CEO Ramon Laguarta wrote in a memo to employees viewed by CNBC.

The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on Tuesday that Pepsi was weighing different options for its Russian business, including writing off its value. Economic sanctions have greatly complicated the process of offloading Russian assets.",https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/08/coca-cola-follows-mcdonalds-starbucks-in-suspending-business-in-russia.html

Coca-Cola said in a statement that it is suspending its business in Russia and will ""continue to monitor and assess the situation as circumstances evolve.""

PepsiCo is reportedly exploring options for its business in Russia, including writing off the value of the unit, according to The Wall Street Journal. CNBC said PepsiCo is suspending sales of its Pepsi-Cola, 7Up and Mirinda brands, along with capital investments and all advertising and promotional activities, but will keep selling some essential products, like milk, baby formula and baby food.

As the fighting intensifies in Ukraine, food and beverage companies are under growing pressure to sell their operations in Russia or suspend activity there. Several businesses have already scaled back their activity.

Dive Insight:

For food and beverage companies desperate for growth, the Ukraine crisis has created challenges and potential headaches if they decide not to reduce their footprint.

In the case of PepsiCo, The Wall Street Journal noted that Russia, where the company has 20,000 employees and 24 plants and three R&D centers, is its third-largest market after the U.S. and Mexico with more than $3 billion in yearly sales. PepsiCo opened its first plant in the Soviet Union in 1974, the paper said, and further expanded its reach in subsequent years. Coca-Cola didn't enter the country until more than a decade later, a major reason PepsiCo is a larger player in the country than its archrival.

A PepsiCo spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. PepsiCo reportedly was reluctant to shut down its entire Russian unit because it employs thousands of people and many of its products, like milk and baby formula, are essential for consumers, The Wall Street Journal said.

“As a food and beverage company, now more than ever, we must stay true to the humanitarian aspect of our business,” Ramon Laguarta, PepsiCo's CEO, wrote in a memo to employees viewed by CNBC.

Coca-Cola's announcement that it was suspending its operations in Russia amounted to three short sentences in a press release. In a regulatory filing, Coca-Cola said Russia and Ukraine contributed approximately 1% to 2% of its consolidated net operating revenues and operating income.

U.S. companies that have continued to operate in Russia have drawn criticism, putting pressure on them to act. Last week, New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli wrote PepsiCo, Mondelēz International and other corporations in the state pension fund's portfolio, urging them to end or pause their business activity in Russia.

“Companies doing business in Russia need to seriously consider whether it’s worth the risk,"" he said following the announcement by PepsiCo and other companies to suspend their operations. ""As investors, we want assurances that our holdings are not in harm's way. I commend the companies that are taking the right steps and suspending their operations in Russia.”

Corporations no doubt are struggling over assuming the loss of billions of dollars in sales if they pull out of Russia, or waiting it out but risk brand dilution or the permanent loss of sales going forward if they decide to maintain the status quo. The longer the war goes on, it appears more companies are making the decision to suspend operations.

Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at Yale, put together a list of public companies and organizations and what their status is in Russia. Kellogg and Kraft Heinz are among the companies that have suspended shipments and/or investments there. Starbucks and McDonald's also announced Tuesday they are halting business activity following the country's invasion of Ukraine.

Sonnenfeld's table showed other food companies that remain include Mars, which has invested more than $2 billion in Russia; Mondelēz, which gets about 3.5% of its revenue, or about $1 billion, from the country; as well as Nestlé, which depends on it for 2.3% of its revenue, worth an estimated $1.7 billion.",https://www.fooddive.com/news/coca-cola-and-pepsico-latest-cpgs-to-suspend-business-in-russia/620066/

""Our hearts are with the people who are enduring unconscionable effects from these tragic events in Ukraine,"" Coca-Cola said in a statement announcing that it was ""suspending its business in Russia.""

Companies from Apple to Visa have already announced curtailed or suspended operations in Russia since the attack began last month.

6,301db188-08dc-42df-9ec2-df7c9b5367f6,[],,"New York [US], March 9 (ANI): US beverage giants PepsiCo and Coca-Cola, along with fast food major McDonald's and coffeehouse chain Starbucks all announced on Tuesday that they were temporarily suspending their business in Russia in response to the country's invasion of Ukraine.

""Given the horrific events occurring in Ukraine, we are announcing the suspension of the sale of Pepsi-Cola, and our global beverage brands in Russia, including 7Up and Mirinda. We will also be suspending capital investments and all advertising and promotional activities in Russia,"" CEO Ramon Laguarta wrote in a letter to PepsiCo associates.

However, PepsiCo added that it will continue to offer its daily essentials such as milk and other dairy offerings, baby formula and baby food in the Russian markets.

The Coca-Cola Company announced in a press release that it was ""suspending its business in Russia,"". ""Our hearts are with the people who are enduring unconscionable effects from these tragic events in Ukraine,"" it said.

Both the US brands produce popular carbonated drinks. PepsiCo produces Pepsi-Cola, 7Up and Mirinda, while the Coca-Cola company produces Coca-Cola, Sprite and Fanta.

American multinational fast food corporation McDonald's too announced the suspension of work of all its restaurants in Russia, along with Starbucks, a coffee-house chain.

""McDonald's has decided to temporarily close all our restaurants in Russia and pause all operations in the market,"" the company's CEO Chris Kempczinski informed through a letter sent to McDonald's employees and franchisees.

""We condemn the horrific attacks on Ukraine by Russia and our hearts go out to all those affected,"" Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson said announcing, ""We have decided to suspend all business activity in Russia, including shipment of all Starbucks products.""

In less than two weeks, multinational companies, media houses and several large scales businesses have announced their plans to leave Russia.

The slew of sanctions and suspensions of businesses come following Russia's invasion of Ukraine after recognising the Ukrainian breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent republics.

Russia continues to maintain that it started the ""military operations"" in Ukraine to save the residents of eastern Ukraine and ""demilitarise"" and ""denazify"" the political leadership of the country.

(Here's a quick primer on the war and how you can help.) Major international corporations are now refusing to do business in Russia in protest of the crisis. In fact, more than 300 companies have suspended or curtailed their business in the country.

Below, some of the largest companies that have made a statement so far.

Amazon

On March 9, Amazon (which had already suspended some activity in Russia, including sign-ups to its web servers) announced in a blog post that Prime Video would no longer be available in Russia. Also, it stated, “We’ve suspended shipment of retail products to customers based in Russia and Belarus, and we will no longer be accepting new Russia- and Belarus-based AWS customers and Amazon third-party sellers.” No word on Russian customers whose packages were in transit when the announcement came out.

Robert Alexander

Starbucks

Kevin Johnson, the CEO of Starbucks, wrote in an open letter, “We have decided to suspend all business activity in Russia, including shipment of all Starbucks products. Our licensed partner has agreed to immediately pause store operations and will provide support to the nearly 2,000 partners in Russia who depend on Starbucks for their livelihood.” All of the Starbucks locations in Russia are licensed franchises, which means Starbucks itself doesn't directly operate them, and sales in Russia accounted for less than 1% of Starbucks's global revenue, per CNBC.",https://www.glamour.com/story/businesses-suspending-sales-in-russia
