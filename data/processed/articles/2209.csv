Summary Mariupol is an important port near separatist areas

Residents fear Russian forces might try to seize it

Many shops are closed, some people flee

MARIUPOL, Ukraine, Feb 24 (Reuters) - A residential area of Mariupol in southeastern Ukraine was hit by shelling on Thursday as residents worried that Russian forces will try to take the strategic port city.

Local authorities said 26 people were being treated for wounds in hospital after an eastern district of Mariupol was shelled and ""an attempt by Russian troops to break through"" into the city was thwarted.

A diplomatic source later told Reuters that the city outskirts had come under heavy fire and that hundreds of explosions had been heard.

Residents are on edge after Russia's invasion of Ukraine because Mariupol, a city of around half a million people, lies only about 10 km (six miles) from areas controlled by pro-Russian separatists. read more

Many shops did not open on Thursday and some people packed their belongings into cars to flee the city.

""We are going into hiding,"" said one middle-aged woman.

Another resident, 17-year-old Yulia, said via the messaging app Telegram: ""We have a shelter in our house but I don't know whether it's big enough and whether it is that safe.""

The separatists did not attack Mariupol when they seized swathes of eastern Ukraine in a conflict that began in 2014 even though it is an important port and home to steel mills.

But capturing it now would let Moscow link Russian-controlled Crimea over land to the separatist enclaves and secure complete control over the coast of the Azov Sea, increasing economic pressure on Ukraine's government.

Reuters correspondents in the area on Thursday saw plenty of signs that the Ukrainian army is preparing to defend Mariupol.

Ukrainian missile launchers could be seen beside roads. When a Ukrainian armoured column thundered along a road outside Mariupol, soldiers on tanks showed victory signs to passing cars which honked their horns in support.

Further along the road, in the towns of Mangush and Berdyansk by the Azov Sea, cars queued at petrol stations, and people stood in line at cash machines.

Ukraine's Azov Sea ports export wheat, barley and corn to Mediterranean importers including Cyprus, Egypt, Italy, Lebanon and Turkey, but an adviser to the Ukrainian president's chief of staff said the Ukrainian military suspended shipping at the country's ports after the invasion began. read more

Reports of explosions or gunfire are coming in from at least five places in Ukraine or near the Russian border, including Kyiv, Kramatorsk, Odess, Kharkhov, Berdyansk, and near the Boryspil Airport.Also Read - Ukraine Imposes Martial Law After Russia Declares War

A CNN reporter who was in the Ukrainian capital Kiev at the time of explosions shared a first-hand experience of the burgeoning crisis. Matthew Chance, Senior International correspondent for the network, said that he heard between seven and eight explosions. ‘I just heard a big bang right here behind me. I’ve never heard anything like it.’

He also shared a picture of the explosion that he received from the Ukrainian President’s office.

”There are big explosions taking place. I can’t see them or explain what they are. but I will tell you the U.S has warned the Ukrainian authorities there could be air strikes and ground attacks as well around the country, including the capital. I don’t know if that’s what’s occurring now but it’s a remarkable coincidence that the explosions come just minutes after Putin gave his speech. This is the first time we’ve heard anything. It has been absolutely silent. This is the first time. It has to be more than just a coincidence,” Chance explained.

Announcing a special “military operation” in the Donbas region, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned other countries that any attempt to interfere with the Russian action would lead to “consequences”.

Delivering an emergency address, Putin said the operation has been launched to demilitarize Ukraine and defend people’s “suffering, persecution and genocide” by the Kiev regime.

“I have taken the decision to carry out a special military operation. Its goal will be to defend people who for eight years are suffering persecution and genocide by the Kiev regime. For this we will aim for demilitarization and de-Nazification of Ukraine,” said Putin, asking Ukrainian soldiers to lay down arms.",https://www.india.com/news/world/picture-captures-explosions-in-kyiv-vladimir-putin-launches-invasion-of-ukraine-5255610/

U.S. President Joe Biden says NATO will meet on Friday to 'map out next steps on Russia,' as Prime Minster Justin Trudeau says Canada will impose stricter sanctions, prioritize immigration applications for Ukrainians who want to come to Canada.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky vowed on Friday to stay in Kyiv as his troops battled Russian forces who were advancing toward the capital in the biggest attack on a European state since the Second World War.

Scores of Ukrainians, civilians and service members alike, were killed in the first full day of fighting, and Kyiv appeared to be increasingly threatened. Zelensky said the government had information that ""subversive groups"" were encroaching on the city, and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Kyiv ""could well be under siege.""

Explosions were heard in the capital in the early hours of Friday and air raid sirens wailed over the city of three million people as Russia continued its assault.

U.S. Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin told lawmakers on a phone call that Russian mechanized forces that entered from Belarus were about 32 kilometres from Kyiv, according to a person familiar with the call.

Anton Herashchenko, an adviser to the interior minister, said Ukrainian forces downed an enemy aircraft over Kyiv in the early hours of Friday, which then crashed into a residential building and set it on fire. It was unclear whether the aircraft was manned.

Herashchenko wrote on instant messaging service Telegram that a nine-storey residential building was on fire.

He said the series of explosions were the sounds of air defences firing at the aircraft.

A missile strike hit a Ukrainian border post in the southeastern region of Zaporizhzhya, killing and wounding some guards, the border guard service said on Friday.

The region has no land border with Russia, which launched a military operation against Ukraine on Thursday, but is located on the coast of the Azov Sea which the neighbours share.

One senior U.S. defence official described the day's assault as the first salvo in a likely multi-phase invasion aimed at seizing key population centres and ""decapitating"" Ukraine's government.

""I will stay in the capital. My family is also in Ukraine.""

After Russian President Vladimir Putin declared war in a pre-dawn televised address, explosions and gunfire were heard throughout the morning in Kyiv, a city of three million people.

By nightfall in Ukraine, a picture was emerging of fierce fighting across multiple fronts.

Zelensky said in that same video address that 137 ""heroes,"" including 10 military officers, had been killed, and 316 people wounded. The dead included all border guards on the Zmiinyi Island in the Odesa region, which was taken over by Russians.

Zelensky said despite Russia's claim it is attacking only military targets, civilian sites also have been struck.

""They're killing people and turning peaceful cities into military targets,"" he said. ""It's foul and will never be forgiven.""

He said Putin's aim was to destroy his state and ordered a full military mobilization that will last 90 days.

An adviser to the Ukrainian presidential office said Russian forces had captured the former Chernobyl nuclear power plant, just 90 kilometres north of the capital.

There was also fighting at Hostomel Airport, just outside Kyiv, where Russian paratroopers landed. A Ukrainian official later said the airfield had been recaptured, while a senior U.S. defence official said Russian forces were advancing closer to Kyiv.

Heavy exchanges of fire were also taking place in the regions near Sumy and Kharkiv in the northeast and Kherson and Odesa, home to Ukraine's most important seaport, in the south.

The highway heading west out of Kyiv was choked with traffic across five lanes as residents fled, fearful of bombardments while stuck in their cars.

Blinken said in television interviews that he was convinced that Russia was intent on overthrowing the Ukrainian government, telling CBS that Putin wants to ""reconstitute the Soviet empire"" and that Kyiv was already ""under threat, and it could well be under siege.""

Fearing a Russian attack on the capital city, thousands of people went deep underground as night fell, jamming Kyiv's subway stations.

The UN High Commission for Refugees said an estimated 100,000 Ukrainians had fled their homes and that several thousand crossed into neighbouring countries, mainly Romania and Moldova.

The day began with missiles raining down on Ukrainian targets and authorities reporting columns of troops pouring across Ukraine's borders from Russia to the east and Belarus to the north, and landing on the southern coast from the Black Sea and Azov Sea.

""Russia has embarked on a path of evil, but Ukraine is defending itself and won't give up its freedom, no matter what Moscow thinks,"" Zelensky said on Twitter.

Calling on Ukrainians to defend their country, he said arms would be given to anyone prepared to fight. He also urged Russians to take to the streets to protest against their government's actions.

""What we have heard today are not just missile blasts, fighting and the rumble of aircraft. This is the sound of a new Iron Curtain, which has come down and is closing Russia off from the civilized world,"" Zelensky said.

In his address, Putin said he had ordered ""a special military operation"" to protect people, including Russian citizens, subjected to ""genocide"" in Ukraine — an accusation the West calls baseless propaganda.

""And for this we will strive for the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine,"" Putin said.

After referring earlier in his speech to Russia's powerful nuclear arsenal, he also warned: ""Whoever tries to hinder us ... should know that Russia's response will be immediate. And it will lead you to such consequences that you have never encountered in your history.""

French Foreign Affairs Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian later said Putin should understand that NATO was also a nuclear alliance.

Biden, Trudeau toughen sanctions

U.S. President Joe Biden called the Russian action an ""unprovoked and unjustified attack."" Saying Putin ""chose this war"" during an afternoon briefing from the White House, he said Russia ""will bear the consequences"" of new sanctions.

The sanctions target Russian banks, oligarchs and high-tech sectors, Biden said, with U.S. allies blocking assets of four large Russian banks, imposing export controls and sanctioning oligarchs. He held off imposing some of the most severe sanctions, including cutting Russia out of the SWIFT payment system, which allows for the transfer of money from bank to bank around the globe, or targeting Russia's energy sector.

Beyond sanctions, Biden said the U.S. will not send troops into Ukraine to fight the Russians but will deploy additional forces to Germany to bolster the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

""NATO is more united and more determined than ever,"" he said. ""There's no doubt, no doubt, that the United States and every NATO ally will meet our Article 5 commitments, which says an attack on one is an attack on all.""

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, meanwhile, said Canada will also impose additional sanctions on Russia, targeting 58 people and entities connected to the country, including members of Russia's elite and their families, the paramilitary organization known as the Wagner Group and major Russian banks.

During a briefing from Ottawa, he said Canada will be prioritizing immigration applications for Ukrainians who want to come to Canada and is launching a dedicated telephone line for anyone who has any urgent questions about the process.

He also said Canada has arranged for the safe passage of any Canadian citizens, permanent residents and their families still in Ukraine through land borders with Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Moldova.

A resident of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city and the closest big city to the Russian border, said windows in the apartment blocks near him were shaking from constant blasts.

Blasts could be heard in the southeastern port of Mariupol, near a front line held by Russian-backed separatists in Eastern Ukraine. Local authorities said 26 people were being treated for wounds in hospital after an eastern district of the port was shelled, and ""an attempt by Russian troops to break through"" into the city was thwarted.

'We are going into hiding'

In the nearby town of Mangush and city of Berdyansk, people lined up throughout the day for cash and gasoline. Civilians from Mariupol were seen packing bags.

""We are going into hiding,"" said a middle-aged woman in a grey sweater.

Initial reports of casualties were sporadic and unconfirmed. Ukraine reported at least eight people killed by Russian shelling and three border guards killed in the southern Kherson region.

However, an adviser to Ukraine's president says about 40 people have been killed so far in the Russian attacks. Oleksii Arestovich said Thursday that several dozen people have been wounded. He didn't specify whether the casualties included civilians.

Russia's Defence Ministry said it had destroyed 83 land-based Ukrainian targets and achieved all of its goals, according to Interfax news agency.

The head of the United Nations refugee agency is warning of ""devastating consequences"" from Russia's military action in Ukraine and calling on neighbouring countries to keep their borders open for people fleeing the fighting.

In a televised declaration of war in the early hours, Putin said he had ordered ""a special military operation"" to protect people, including Russian citizens, subjected to ""genocide"" in Ukraine — an accusation the West calls absurd propaganda.

What's happening on the ground?

Almost all of the world — but not China — condemned the attack and threatened to hit Russian elites with — in the words of the European Union president — ""massive and targeted sanctions.""

Ukraine, a democratic country of 44 million people with more than 1,000 years of history, is Europe's biggest nation by area after Russia itself. It voted overwhelmingly for independence after the fall of the Soviet Union and aims to join NATO and the European Union, aspirations that infuriate Moscow.

Putin, who denied for months that he was planning an invasion, has called Ukraine an artificial creation carved from Russia by its enemies — a characterization Ukrainians call shocking and false.

While many Ukrainians, particularly in the east, speak Russian as a native language, virtually all identify themselves as Ukrainian.

There was also some dissent in Russia. Police detained more than 1,700 people taking part in anti-war rallies in 54 cities, and authorities threatened to block media reports carrying ""false information.""

'We're afraid of bombardments'

In Kyiv, some people who chose to stay stood in long lines outside banks and shops, hoping to withdraw money and stock up on supplies. But others packed bags and suitcases and looked for a way out of the city — by bus, car or plane.

Queues of people waited to withdraw money and buy supplies of food and water in Kyiv. Traffic was jammed going west out of the city of three million people, toward the distant Polish border. Western countries have been preparing for the likelihood of hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians fleeing an assault.

By mid-morning, traffic was at a standstill on the four-lane main road to the western city of Lviv. Cars stretched back for dozens of kilometres, Reuters witnesses said.

""This hideous and barbarous venture of Vladimir Putin must end in failure,"" British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told Parliament, announcing measures targeting banks, members of Putin's closest circle and super-rich Russians who enjoy high-rolling London lifestyles.

Britain will also ban the export of a wide range of high-tech products, including semiconductors, to Russia and prohibit the nation's flagship airline, Aeroflot, from landing at U.K. airports. The slate of sanctions comes days after Johnson was criticized for acting too cautiously in response to Russian aggression earlier this week.

French President Emmanuel Macron said France and its European allies did everything to try to head off the attack.

A cyclist appears to have been hit by an explosive in a city in central Ukraine, as social media footage showed various images of destruction in the country after Russia began military action.

Three videos which the PA news agency has geolocated to Kolomens’ka Street in Uman, a city in central Ukraine and just over 100 miles south of the capital Kyiv, show the person being thrown from their bike after a large, orange flash of light.

CCTV footage shows the individual crawling from his bike before lying still. A second video taken on the ground depicts them in a pool of blood, with a small crater in the road nearby.

In a third clip posted later in the morning on Facebook, the person has been removed from the street but windows on nearby cars can be seen smashed by the apparent blast.

The videos are among many depicting destruction in Ukraine amid the Russian hostility.

Some images depict flashes of light from explosions on the horizon, later followed by billowing smoke, with residents in Dnipro in the east of Ukraine confirming shelling had taken place there.

Another video which PA geolocated to Chuhuiv, near Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine, shows an apartment building which has been severely damaged – with smoke pouring from it and all of its windows smashed.

One of the Russian Navy’s most important warships is either floating abandoned or at the bottom of the Black Sea, a massive blow to a military struggling against Ukrainian resistance 50 days into Vladimir Putin’s invasion of his neighbor.

Russian sailors have evacuated the guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of its Black Sea fleet, after a fire that detonated ammunition aboard, Russian state media reported Wednesday.

State media outlets TASS and RIA, citing the Russian Defense Ministry, said the Moskva had been seriously damaged in the incident and that the cause of the fire was being investigated. The Russian reports gave no information on possible casualties.

But hours earlier, a Ukrainian official claimed the Russian warship had been hit by cruise missiles fired from Ukraine.

Due to large storms over the Black Sea obscuring satellite imagery and sensory satellite data, CNN has not been able to visually confirm the ship has been hit or its current status, but analysts noted that a fire on board such a ship can lead to a catastrophic explosion that could sink it.

Whatever the reason for the fire, the analysts say it strikes hard at the heart of the Russian navy as well as national pride, comparable to the US Navy losing a battleship during World War II or an aircraft carrier today.

“Only the loss of a ballistic missile submarine or the Kutznetsov (Russia’s lone aircraft carrier) would inflict a more serious blow to Russian morale and the navy’s reputation with the Russian public,” said Carl Schuster, a retired US Navy captain and former director of operations at the US Pacific Command’s Joint Intelligence Center.

""Massive blow"": Alessio Patalano, professor of war and strategy at King’s College in London, said losing the warship would be a “massive blow” for Russia.

“Ships operate away from public attention and their activities are rarely the subject of news. But they are large floating pieces of national territory, and when you lose one, a flagship no less, the political and symbolic message — in addition to the military loss — stands out precisely because of it,” he said.
