The thinking among key Republicans is that they want to put on a united front and show solidarity with Ukraine, and they don't want to give any more ammunition to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Another reason they are calibrating their responses: Republicans want to send a clear signal to Biden that he would have bipartisan support if he were to move ahead with more punitive measures. While a bipartisan sanctions package stalled on Capitol Hill this month amid divisions over enacting preemptive sanctions, lawmakers are hoping to revive the issue when they return to Capitol Hill next week.

After a conference call with administration briefers on Thursday, one senator told CNN that ""there was broad bipartisan agreement"" for emergency funding legislation to help shore up the defense capabilities of NATO allies in the Eastern flank and to assist with refugees and humanitarian needs.

Still, Republicans are calling on Biden to enact immediate, stronger sanctions against Russia for its incursion into Ukraine and lamenting that he didn't do more to deter an attack before it occurred — even as they are being careful in how they criticize the President at a critical juncture in US foreign policy.

House Foreign Affairs Committee ranking member Michael McCaul, House Armed Services Committee ranking member Mike Rogers and House Intelligence Committee ranking member Mike Turner said in a joint statement that they were ""committed to enacting the strongest possible sanctions and export controls to cripple Russia's ability to make war, punish its barbarity and relegate the Putin regime to the status of an international pariah.""

""We cannot respond like we did in 2008 or 2014. The world must never forget or forgive this heinous act,"" the Republicans said in a statement.

""This night will be very difficult, and the enemy will use all available forces to break the resistance of Ukrainians,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a late-night video message Friday. ""This night we have to stand ground. The fate of Ukraine is being decided right now.""

Earlier Saturday, videos from eyewitnesses showed explosions taking place in an area north-west of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. There is a military base in the area.

CNN teams in the capital also reported hearing loud explosions to the west and south of the city Saturday. Shortly afterward, Ukraine's State Service of Special Communications said clashes are underway in an eastern suburb as well -- as Russian forces close in on the capital from multiple sides.

Meanwhile, the Ukrainian armed forces reported heavy fighting around the city of Vasylkiv, some 30 kilometers southwest of Kyiv.

""Heavy fighting is currently underway in the town of Vasylkiv in the Kyiv region, where the occupiers are trying to land a landing party,"" the armed forces said.

Russian forces are close to Kyiv, Zelensky confirmed in his message Friday, advancing on the capital from the north and east after seizing control Thursday of an airbase just north of the city. But ""Ukrainians resist the Russian aggression heroically,"" he said.

Russia's military claimed earlier Friday its forces had staged a ""successful landing operation"" to capture Hostomel airfield, viewed as strategically important, on Kyiv's outskirts.

Zelensky's comments came hours after a video was posted on his Facebook page, showing him with a group of men, saying, ""We are here. We are in Kyiv. We are defending Ukraine.""

Before dawn Friday, explosions lit up the sky above the capital as Russia targeted the city with missile strikes, according to a Ukrainian government adviser. A CNN team reported hearing two large blasts in central Kyiv and a third loud explosion in the distance, followed by at least three more explosions to the south-west of the city a few hours later.

""Strikes on Kyiv with cruise or ballistic missiles continued,"" Anton Gerashchenko, adviser to the Head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine told reporters via text message Friday.

Meanwhile, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said Russian reconnaissance troops had entered the Obolon district of northern Kyiv, just a few miles from the city center. Videos from the area showed chaotic scenes as civilians tried to hide from small arms fire.

Ukrainian military vehicles move past Independence Square in central Kyiv on February 24, 2022.

A tweet from the ministry asked citizens of the district to report any suspicious movements, adding: ""Make Molotov cocktails and take down the occupier.""

CNN witnessed a group of Ukrainian security forces leave the city police headquarters with weapons and ammunition -- apparently heading towards Obolon.

Meanwhile, 92 people working at the Chernobyl power plant, the site of the world's worst-ever nuclear disaster, have been taken hostage, the Ukrainian ambassador to the US said Friday. Russian forces took control of the site on Thursday, sparking fears that the fighting could interfere with the operation of nuclear waste facilities.

As Russian troops advance, US intelligence officials are concerned that Kyiv could fall under Russian control within days, according to two sources familiar with the latest intelligence.

However, the latest British defense intelligence assessment said Russia had made ""limited progress"" Friday in its attack.

""Fighting continues in key locations. Russia has made limited progress so far today and Ukraine retains control of key cities. Ukrainian MOD reports that Russian forces have arrived in the suburbs of Kyiv,"" the UK Ministry of Defence tweeted

A senior US defense official told reporters that the Russians have ""about a third of their combat power"" in Ukraine out of the total combat power they have amassed on the country's borders right now, but ""that does not mean that they will not commit more.""

The Ukrainian Defense Ministry earlier said that airborne assault troops blew up a bridge over the Teteriv River at Ivankiv, about 30 miles north of Kyiv, successfully preventing a Russian column of forces from advancing towards the capital, which has a population of close to 3 million.

A Ukrainian firefighter walks between fragments of a downed aircraft in Kyiv, Ukraine, Friday, February 25, 2022. It was unclear what aircraft crashed and what brought it down.

For now, Ukraine's democratically elected government remains intact but President Volodymr Zelensky warned in a video address late Thursday that ""enemy sabotage groups"" had entered this city and he is their No. 1 target. ""They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state,"" he said.

""Russian forces continued to launch missile strikes on the territory of Ukraine. They say that they are only targeting military facilities, but these are lies. In fact, they do not distinguish in which areas they operate,"" he said. ""Such attacks on our capital haven't occurred since 1941.""

In an address Friday morning, Zelensky said Ukrainians were ""showing their true heroism"" but that they were defending their country ""alone."" The sanctions imposed on Russia by Western powers are ""not enough to get these foreign troops off our soil,"" he said.

A few hours later, Zelensky released a message in which he again called for Russian President Vladimir Putin to hold direct talks. ""There is fighting all over Ukraine now. Let's sit down at the negotiation table to stop the people's deaths,"" he said, speaking in Russian.

Shortly afterward, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was ready to send a delegation to Minsk, the capital of Belarus, for talks with Ukraine, Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti reported.

""As you know, today the President of Ukraine Zelensky announced his readiness to discuss the neutral status of Ukraine,"" Peskov said, according to RIA. The talks would concern ""neutral status,"" he suggested. Peskov said later Friday that the Ukrainian side had countered with a proposal to meet in Warsaw and then dropped contact.

Zelensky has not directly proposed neutral status but has signaled a willingness to discuss it, while insisting his country be provided security guarantees.

""Ukraine has been and remains ready to talk about a ceasefire and peace. This is our constant position,"" Sergii Nykyforov, a spokesperson for Zelensky, said late Friday. He also denied what he called ""claims that we have refused to negotiate.""

Meanwhile, Putin called on Ukraine's armed forces to overthrow their government in remarks to his security council Friday.

""Do not let Banderites (Ukrainian nationalists) and neo-Nazis use your children, wives and old people as human shields,"" Putin said in remarks aired on Russian state television. ""Take power into your own hands, it looks like it will be easier for us to come to an agreement than with this gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis that has settled in Kyiv and taken hostage the entire Ukrainian people.""

Putin frequently repeats the baseless and inaccurate claim that the democratically elected Ukrainian government is a ""Nazi"" or ""fascist"" regime. The language has been roundly condemned internationally, especially considering that Zelensky is Jewish.

Asked by CNN at a news conference Friday what Moscow's plans were for the leadership of Ukraine as Russian forces advance on Kyiv, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov replied: ""Nobody is going to attack the people of Ukraine.""

In an interview with CNN on the streets of Kyiv, former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko accused Putin of being ""simply crazy"" in wanting to ""come here to kill Ukrainians"" -- and vowed they would resist. ""We demonstrate a unique quality that we can stand against Russian aggression,"" he said.

Homes damaged

The advance on Kyiv comes only a day after Russian forces entered Ukraine from three sides, by land, sea and air, prompting a barrage of international condemnation and sanctions -- and questions about Putin's wider ambitions for the country and its capital.

It's unclear how long Ukrainian forces can resist the advance of Russian forces who are much better equipped and have superior air power.

Two residential buildings in Kyiv suffered damage in the early hours of Friday, but it's not clear if they were intentionally struck or hit by debris, or if anyone was injured.

Ukrainian Deputy Interior Minister Evgeny Yenin told CNN a Ukrainian Sukhoi Su-27 fighter jet was shot down over Kyiv. Photos tweeted by the emergency forces appear to show a fire at a two-story private house with debris from what looks to be a plane nearby. It is unclear if the house was hit by remnants of the jet.

Separately, images showed firefighters working to put out a blaze at an apartment building on the left bank of the city.

As they approach, many Ukrainians are preparing to fight back. Some 18,000 guns with ammunition have been distributed to reservists in the Kyiv region alone since the Russian invasion began early Thursday, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said, with more weapons on their way.

Outside the Kyiv region, fighting continued in cities including Sumy, in the northeast, Chernihiv in the north and Kherson to the south.

A CNN team that visited a bridge crossing from Russian-held areas into the southern city of Kherson saw four large shell craters, 10 discarded Ukrainian armored vehicles and several bodies, but the Ukrainians appeared to have been able to push Russian forces back.

Low-flying jets could be seen overhead and air raid sirens wailed across the city.

A Russian defense ministry spokesperson said in a statement that a ""counter-offensive"" was underway in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, and that Ukrainian service members had surrendered to Russian troops and pro-Russian separatists. CNN could not immediately check the veracity of those claims.

Makeshift bunkers

Officials in the country believe Russia's plan is to overthrow the Ukrainian leadership and install a pro-Russian government.

Those fears were shared with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, who said Thursday that he's ""convinced"" Moscow is going to try to overthrow the Ukrainian government.

If that happens, Blinken said he believes ""Moscow has developed plans to inflict widespread human rights abuses -- and potentially worse -- on the Ukrainian people.""

The fighting in Ukraine appears to be some of the worst conventional warfare Europe has seen since World War II and the conflicts in the Balkans in the 1990s. Preliminary figures indicate 137 Ukrainian solders have been killed, including every soldier defending an island in the Black Sea that was taken over by Russian troops, according to President Zelensky.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy makes a statement in Kyiv, Ukraine, February 25.

The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said its armed forces had caused around 800 casualties among Russian forces since the attacks started early on Thursday. It was not immediately clear whether the ministry was referring solely to the number killed and CNN is not able to independently verify Ukraine's figures.

By the end of Thursday, Putin's forces had launched ""in total more than 160 missiles for airstrikes,"" a senior US defense official said, prompting a response reminiscent of the late 1930s, with vulnerable children evacuated by train from eastern Ukraine and packed subway stations turned into makeshift bunkers as air raid sirens wailed.

A family takes shelter along with other Kyiv residents in an underground parking garage on Friday. Some areas of the Ukrainian capital were hit by aerial attacks.

In an ominous sign a ground war could escalate, Zelensky barred male citizens between the ages of 18 and 60 from leaving the country, according to the State Border Guard Service.

Zelensky also ordered a general military mobilization ""in order to ensure the defense of the state, maintaining combat and mobilization readiness of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other military formations, in a declaration signed late Thursday.

More than 100,000 people have already fled areas most at risk of attack within Ukraine, according to the United Nations refugee agency. The mass movement followed warnings from the US Ambassador to the UN, who said Russia's actions in Ukraine could create one of the largest refugee crises facing the world today, displacing as many as five million people.

Polish officials reported an increase in the number of people crossing into the country from Ukraine in the hours after the Russian invasion began.

Sanctioning Putin

The United States will impose sanctions on Putin and Lavrov, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Friday, hours after the European Union and United Kingdom said they would do the same.

The EU also announced a slew of other new sanctions on Russia, designed to have ""maximum impact on the Russian economy and political elite.""

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the sanctions would hit Russia's financial, energy and transport sectors, visa policy, and include export controls and export financing bans.

""We want to financially isolate Russia, we want to cut all the ties between Russia and the international financial system,"" said French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire.

Speaking in Brussels on Thursday, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg described Russia's attack on Ukraine as a ""brutal act of war.""

The alliance activated the NATO Response Force (NRF) for the first time ever in response to the invasion. The NRF is made up of land, air, sea and special operations forces from the allies that can deploy quickly in support of the NATO alliance.

""We have over 100 jets at high alert, operating in over 30 different locations, and over 120 ships from the high north, to the Mediterranean. We activated the defense plans yesterday, and now elements of this force are being deployed,"" Stoltenberg said during a press briefing on Friday, following an extraordinary meeting of NATO Heads of State and Government in Brussels. He also clarified that while the United States, Canada and European allies have ""deployed thousands more troops"" to the eastern part of the alliance, NATO is not deploying the entire Response Force.

A big concern for NATO is whether Putin's intentions lie beyond Ukraine, a prospect that risks drawing all 30 members -- including the US, the United Kingdom, Canada, France and Germany -- into a wider conflict on European soil.

""You don't need intelligence to tell you that that's exactly what President Putin wants. He has made clear he'd like to reconstitute the Soviet Empire, short of that he'd like to reassert a sphere of influence around the neighboring countries that were once part of the Soviet bloc,"" said Blinken on CBS Evening News.

Blinken said NATO would stand in the way if those were Putin's ultimate goals.

""Now, when it comes to a threat beyond Ukraine's borders. There's something very powerful standing in his way. That's article five of NATO, an attack on one is an attack on all,"" the top diplomat said.

On Thursday, the US Secretary of Defense ordered the deployment of 7,000 US service members to Europe. The deployment brings the number of US troops moved towards eastern Europe at more than 14,000.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/24/europe/ukraine-russia-invasion-friday-intl-hnk/index.html

Explosions were heard in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, early Friday morning, CNN reports.

The number of people injured and extent of the damage wasn't clear.

Russia declared a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine on Thursday.

Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, was awakened by explosions in the early hours of Friday morning local time, CNN reported.

""Strikes on Kyiv with cruise or ballistic missiles continued,"" Anton Gerashchenko, an advisor to the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Ukraine, told CNN.

The outlet said its reporters had heard two blasts in central Kyiv and another explosion in the distance.

It wasn't immediately clear how many people had been injured or how much damage the city had sustained.

Social-media users in Kyiv posted videos showing the sky lit up with explosions.

One user showed that what appeared to be an apartment building had been set ablaze.

The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, reported that the building fire injured three people — one of whom was said to be in critical condition.

The Biden administration told House lawmakers during a Thursday briefing that it believed Russian forces were intending to surround Kyiv — home to 3 million people — before capturing it, CNN reported.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday called himself Russia's ""No. 1 target"" but said, ""I stay in the capital, I stay with my people.""

""They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state,"" Zelensky added. ""We also have information that enemy sabotage groups have entered Kyiv. That's why I am asking Kyivites very much: Be careful, follow the rules of curfew.""

On Thursday, some Ukrainians took refuge in the subways for safety from attacks.

Russian forces invaded Ukraine on Thursday in what Russian President Vladimir Putin called a ""special military operation"" — essentially declaring war on the country early Thursday morning. Ukraine says more than 100 Ukrainians have been killed in the conflict so far.

The United Nations estimated Thursday evening that more than 100,000 people had been displaced within Ukraine.

Former and current Ukrainian diplomats condemned the Russian attacks, comparing them to World War II.

""Russia, the sin is on you. Shame is indelible,"" Olexander Scherba, Ukraine's former ambassador to Austria, tweeted. ""They say that you will bomb Kiev at 4 o'clock in Kiev. Well, you are true to tradition. Hitler was bombing at the same time.""

Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's minister of foreign affairs, urged the West to ""sever all ties"" with Russia.

""Horrific Russian rocket strikes on Kyiv,"" Kuleba said on Twitter. ""Last time our capital experienced anything like this was in 1941 when it was attacked by Nazi Germany. Ukraine defeated that evil and will defeat this one. Stop Putin. Isolate Russia.""

Mykhailo Podoliak, an advisor to Zelensky, argued, ""Just like in 1941, now the attacker can only get the hatred of the people and nothing more,"" according to The Kyiv Independent.

There are unconfirmed reports that as many as 40 cruise and ballistic missiles have pounded the Ukrainian capital. It's not entirely clear what kinds of missiles may have been employed, but you can read more about the types that we know have been used in the conflict so far here.

You can find out more about what has transpired already in the past day or so from our previous rolling coverage of the conflict here. For the latest info, including the fire at the Russian airbase near the border with Ukraine, scroll to the bottom of the article.

There are conflicting reports about a major explosion that was seen in the sky over the Ukrainian capital. An advisor to the country's Interior Minister, Anton Herashchenko (Gerashchenko), reportedly said that Ukrainian air defenses had shot either an aircraft or a missile down. CNN, citing Ukraine's Ministry of Defense, has reported that it was a Ukrainian Su-27 Flanker fighter jet that was shot down by a Russian surface-to-air missile. Right now we just can't say for certain and all of these reports could potentially be in error, either in part or in full.

There had been rumors that such an attack was coming and many of Kyiv's residents had already taken shelter in the city's subway stations, which are now serving as bomb shelters. Videos and pictures are already starting to emerge showing damage above ground to residential areas as a result of the strikes. It is only logical that Russia would have assessed the damage of its strikes from the night before and built up a new target list to re-attack certain targets as well as prosecute new ones.

Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had also defiantly refused to flee despite saying he is the Kremlin's number one target.

""They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state,"" Zelensky said in an earlier televised address from an undisclosed location in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, adding that he and his family were not leaving. ""We have information that enemy sabotage groups have entered Kyiv.""

Zelensky also criticized NATO and its members for refusing to publicly say whether or not Ukraine would ever be admitted to the alliance. ""Everyone is afraid, does not answer,"" he said. ""And we are not afraid, we are not afraid of anything.""

On the battlefield, so far, Ukrainian forces appear to have had some success in frustrating Russian advances on multiple fronts. The U.K. Ministry of Defense has said that there are indications that Russia's military did not meet its Day 1 objectives despite having made non-insignificant territorial gains – including the capture of the now-defunct Chernobyl nuclear power plant. The U.S. military has given its own assessment that the Ukrainians are very actively fighting back, as well.

After holding the line against ground assaults on multiple fronts, while also losing ground in other areas, earlier today, which followed barrages of air and missile strikes, as well as artillery fire, Ukrainian forces had already continued to fight into the night and are reported to have launched counter-attacks in some areas. In one particularly notable example, Ukrainian troops were reportedly able to retake Hostomel Airport near Kyiv, which currently hosts the only flying example of the An-225 Mriya, one of the world's largest aircraft, after a pitched back and forth battle with Russian paratroopers. Russia clearly saw this airfield as a critical staging location for operations near Kyiv. You can read more about this battle here.

Russian troops had still been able to make important gains, including in and around the site of the now-defunct Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Satellite imagery taken earlier today shows that Russian forces, possibly in cooperation with the Belarusian counterparts, erected a pontoon bridge over the Pripyat River in Belarus in order to affect that movement south into Ukraine. Satellite images from earlier this month had shown a similar bridge spanning a section of the river in the same general location, highlighting this area as a potential vector for an advance as part of a larger Russian invasion.

Ukraine's state nuclear regulator has denied that there has been any worrisome damage to the facility, despite earlier reports of ""destruction"" that could have caused a radiation leak.

U.S. officials said earlier that they could not confirm or deny that Russia's troops had done anything besides move through the area, despite Ukrainian officials saying that personnel there had been detained by occupying forces. A subsequent U.K. Ministry of Defense statement said that it was likely that Russian forces were in control of the plant. That same statement said that Ukrainian forces were putting up significant resistance and had likely prevented the Russians from meeting their intended objectives on the first day of the invasion.

Ukraine has also issued an appeal to the country's ""hacker underground"" to help defend the country by launching cyberattacks against Russia. A statement purportedly from the Anonymous hacker collective said that the group is now ""officially in cyber war against the Russian government."" Anonymous has already claimed responsibility for the inaccessibility of the pseudo-Russian state media outlet RT's website.

All told this still very young conflict continues to evolve rapidly and it remains highly uncertain what direction it will take in the coming hours, let alone days.

We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available.

UPDATE: 1:10 AM EST—

After a brief lull, things are moving fast once again in terms of news coming out of Ukraine.

Russian forces emanating from Belarus are now streaming down toward Kiyv where heavy fighting is approaching the capital. Six hours ago, it was estimated that Russian forces were just around two dozen miles from the northern reaches of the capital. By the accounts we are seeing, much of that distance has already been covered. Clearly, this is extremely worrisome as it has been clear part of the goal of this entire operation is to neuter the sitting Ukrainian government and basically take control over the country's political apparatus. The seizure of the capital, whether block-by-block or via siege, would be a key part of such a plan.

There are also reports of an airborne assault far to the east of Kyiv, which could provide another vector of attack, basically opening up a western front:

In the south and the east the fight seems to be only picking up steam:

As it sits, this is the tally from yesterday, according to Lithuania's defense minister:

As for the aircraft that was shot down over Kyiv. The Ukraine Ministry of Defense says it was one of their own Su-27 flying a combat air patrol that was shot down by a Russian surface-to-air missile. An Su-27 would make sense given the huge size of the fireball. Images from the crash scene appear to corroborate the MoD's statement:

The pilot was remarkably brave for flying in such heavily contested airspace with what was surely no real support and SAM activity nearby.

UPDATE: 2:13 AM EST—

Unconfirmed reports state that Ukraine launched a strike on Russia's Millerovo Air Base not far from the Ukrainian border.

Millerovo is home to the 31st Fighter Aviation Regiment. Formerly a MiG-29 operator, it has upgraded to the Su-30SM, with a total of 24 aircraft divided between two squadrons. Located less than 20 miles from the Ukrainian border, this base was involved in the fighting in Donbas in 2014.

There does look to be the tail of an Su-30 visible in the frame near the flames. There are claims that an OTR-21 Tochka (SS-21 Scarab) tactical ballistic missile was used in the strike or possibly a TB2 drone. Ukraine has a small inventory of the Soviet-era missiles. While they are not extremely accurate, they can deliver a relatively large payload over up to around 110 miles, depending on the variant. It's also possible that some other circumstances are at work here that do not include an aerial strike by Ukraine. Hopefully, some additional info will clear up exactly what happened.

“Strikes on Kyiv with cruise or ballistic missiles continued,” Anton Gerashchenko, adviser to the Head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, told reporters.

There are unconfirmed reports coming in that the city’s air defense stopped an air raid by intercepting a number of missiles and downing an enemy aircraft.

An official with the Ukrainian Interior Ministry said an aircraft had crashed in the Darnytskyi district of Kyiv. Meanwhile, local reports say a nine-story residential building is on fire in Kyiv.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky remains a “prime target for Russian aggression,” US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said Thursday evening.

In a video statement late Thursday, Zelensky said, “According to our information, the enemy marked me as target No. 1, my family as target No. 2. They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state. We have information that enemy sabotage groups have entered Kyiv.

“I am staying in the government quarter together with others,” he added.

Russian troops just 20 miles outside Kyiv

According to NBC News, a top Pentagon official said that Russian troops are just 20 miles from the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, described the current phase of the Russian military operation as the tip of the spear as the vast majority of Russian troops are still further back, NBC reports.

Without providing a timeline, Austin said he expects the next phase will involve more Russian forces and focus on consolidating gains in population centers. He also warned that civilians could be killed and injured, especially by missile and air strikes.

Biden, EU announce new sanctions against Russia

President Joe Biden on Thursday unveiled new sanctions on Russia meant to punish the country for its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, calling out Russian President Vladimir Putin for his aggression even as he acknowledged it would take time for the new measures to alter the strongman’s behavior.

“Putin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war. And now he and his country will bear the consequences,” Biden said, laying out a set of measures that will “impose severe cost on the Russian economy, both immediately and over time.”

The new sanctions include export blocks on technology, a centerpiece of Biden’s approach that he said would severely limit Russia’s ability to advance its military and aerospace sectors. He also applied sanctions on Russian banks and “corrupt billionaires” and their families, who are close to the Kremlin.

Biden insisted his threat to directly sanction Putin remains “on the table” and is “not a bluff,” but he didn’t answer when asked why he hasn’t directly sanctioned the Russian President yet.

The European Union has announced extensive new sanctions on Russia, with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen speaking of a watershed moment for Europe.

The sanctions will target areas including the financial sector, energy, transport, and visas for the Russian elite, she said after a meeting that ended in the early hours on Friday in Brussels.

Von der Leyen said the adopted measures would make it impossible for Russia to buy technology to upgrade its oil refineries, or spare parts for aircraft.

“The package of massive and targeted sanctions approved tonight shows how united the EU is,” she tweeted.",https://greekreporter.com/2022/02/25/ukraine-war-russia-kyiv/
8,a8a3c30e-6edd-4859-982c-461417accb98,[],2022-02-25 00:00:00,"(CNN)— Ukrainians in the capital Kyiv huddled in air raid shelters Friday morning, as a battle for the city raged overhead with claims of a Ukrainian fighter jet shot down and troops blowing up a bridge to stop an advance of Russian forces.

Before dawn, explosions lit up the sky as Russia targeted the city with missile strikes, according to a Ukrainian government adviser. A CNN team reported hearing two large blasts in central Kyiv and a third loud explosion in the distance, followed by at least three more explosions to the south-west of the city a few hours later.

""Strikes on Kyiv with cruise or ballistic missiles continued,"" Anton Gerashchenko, adviser to the Head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine told reporters via text message Friday.

Meanwhile, US officials warned lawmakers Russian forces that had entered Ukraine through Belarus were around 20 miles (32 kilometers) away from Kyiv, sources told CNN.

The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said airborne assault troops blew up a bridge over the Teteriv River at Ivankiv, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of Kyiv, in an effort to prevent a Russian column of forces from advancing towards the capital. The ministry said the Russian advance was stopped.

For now, Ukraine's democratically elected government remains intact but President Volodymr Zelensky warned in a video address late Thursday that ""enemy sabotage groups"" had entered this city and he is their No. 1 target.

""They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state,"" he said. In a separate address, he said the resistance continues.

""Russian forces continued to launch missile strikes on the territory of Ukraine. They say that they are only targeting military facilities, but these are lies. In fact, they do not distinguish in which areas they operate,"" he said. ""Such attacks on our capital haven't occurred since 1941.""

Ukrainian Deputy Interior Minister Evgeny Yenin told CNN a Ukrainian Sukhoi Su-27 fighter jet was shot down over Kyiv in the early hours. Photos tweeted by the emergency forces appear to show a fire at a two-story private house after fragments of a plane fell on it. It is unclear if those are the remnants of the jet.

The battle for Kyiv

Just a day earlier, Russian forces entered Ukraine by land, sea and air, prompting a barrage of international condemnation and sanctions amid questions about Russian President Vladimir Putin's wider ambitions for the country and the capital Kyiv.

Russian forces appeared to be encircling the city and looked poised to move in, Ukraine's deputy interior minister told CNN on Thursday. Officials in the country believe Russia's plan is to overthrow the Ukrainian leadership and install a pro-Russian government.

Those fears were shared with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, who said Thursday that he's ""convinced"" Moscow is going to try to overthrow the Ukrainian government.

If that happens, Blinken said he believes ""Moscow has developed plans to inflict widespread human rights abuses -- and potentially worse -- on the Ukrainian people.""

The fighting in Ukraine appears to be some of the worst conventional warfare Europe has seen since World War II and the conflicts in the Balkans in the 1990s. Preliminary figures showing 137 Ukrainian solders have been killed, including every soldier defending an island in the Black Sea that was taken over by Russian troops, according to President Zelensky.

The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said its armed forces had caused around 800 casualties among Russian forces since the attacks started early on Thursday. It was not immediately clear whether the ministry was referring solely to the number killed and CNN is not able to independently verify Ukraine's figures.

By the end of Thursday, Putin's forces had launched ""in total more than 160 missiles for airstrikes,"" a senior US defense official said, prompting a response reminiscent of the late 1930s, with vulnerable children evacuated by train from eastern Ukraine and packed subway stations turned into makeshift bunkers as air raid sirens wailed.

As missiles exploded over the capital, millions of residents remained inside under a government-ordered curfew from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. local time. Overnight, in an ominous sign a ground war could escalate, Zelensky barred male citizens between the ages of 18 and 60 from leaving the country, according to the State Border Guard Service.

Zelensky also ordered a general military mobilization ""in order to ensure the defense of the state, maintaining combat and mobilization readiness of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other military formations, in a declaration signed late Thursday.

More than 100,000 people have already fled areas most at risk of attack within Ukraine, according to the United Nations refugee agency. The mass movement followed warnings from the US Ambassador to the UN, who said Russia's actions in Ukraine could create one of the largest refugee crises facing the world today, displacing as many as five million people.

Putin's wider ambitions

Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron positioned himself as the mediator between Moscow and Kyiv for a potential ceasefire.

""I think it is my responsibility, first of all, to take such initiatives when they are requested by Ukraine, and then, while condemning, while sanctioning, while continuing to decide and act, to leave this path open so that the day when the conditions can be met, we can obtain a cessation of hostilities for the Ukrainian people,"" Macron said at a press conference in Brussels Friday.

Macron was the first major western leader to speak with Putin after Russian military actions began.

His comments came as the European Union announced new sanctions on Russia, designed to have ""maximum impact on the Russian economy and political elite.""

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the sanctions would hit Russia's financial, energy and transport sectors, visa policy, and include export controls and export financing bans.

Speaking in Brussels on Thursday, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg described Russia's attack on Ukraine as a ""brutal act of war.""

A big concern for NATO is whether Putin's intentions lie beyond Ukraine, a prospect that risks drawing in all 30 members -- including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, France and Germany -- into a wider conflict on European soil.

""You don't need intelligence to tell you that that's exactly what President Putin wants. He has made clear he'd like to reconstitute the Soviet Empire, short of that he'd like to reassert a sphere of influence around the neighboring countries that were once part of the Soviet bloc,"" said Blinken on CBS Evening News.

Blinken said NATO would stand in the way if those were Putin's ultimate goals.

""Now, when it comes to a threat beyond Ukraine's borders. There's something very powerful standing in his way. That's article five of NATO, an attack on one is an attack on all,"" the top diplomat said.

On Thursday, the US Secretary of Defense ordered the deployment of 7,000 US service members to Europe, comprising an armored brigade combat team, ""to deter Russian aggression,"" a senior defense official told reporters. The deployment brings the number of US troops moved towards eastern Europe at more than 14,000.

In his address announcing Russia's ""military operation"" in Ukraine Thursday, Putin threatened ""those who may be tempted to intervene"" on Ukraine's behalf, saying Russia's response would be ""immediate"" and lead to ""such consequences as you have never experienced in your history,"" he said.
