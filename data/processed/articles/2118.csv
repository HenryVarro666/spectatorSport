Good evening.

Allied leaders have just met to address the gravest threat to Euro-Atlantic security in decades.

I invited NATO’s close partners Finland, Sweden and the European Union to our summit.

Because this crisis affects us all.

Russia has shattered peace in Europe.

The people of Ukraine are fighting for their freedom in the face of Russia’s unprovoked invasion.

We deplore the tragic loss of life, enormous human suffering and destruction.

Our thoughts are with those killed, injured, and displaced.

We call on Russia to stop this senseless war.

Immediately cease its assault.

Withdraw all its forces from Ukraine.

And turn back to the path of dialogue.

And turn away from aggression.

The Kremlin’s objectives are not limited to Ukraine.

Russia has demanded legally binding agreements to renounce further NATO enlargement.

And to remove troops and infrastructure from Allies that joined after 1997.

We are facing a new normal in European security.

Where Russia openly contests the European security order.

And uses force to pursue its objectives.

The world will hold Russia and Belarus accountable for their actions.

Russia as the aggressor.

Belarus as the enabler.

President Putin’s decision to pursue his aggression against Ukraine is a terrible strategic mistake.

For which Russia will pay a severe price for years to come.

NATO Allies and the European Union have already introduced significant sanctions.

And many of our partners around the globe have joined us.

We must stand ready to do more.

Even if it means we have to pay a price,

Because we are in this for the long haul.

At the same time, the Russian people must know:

that the Kremlin’s war on Ukraine will not make Russia more secure.

It will not make Russia more respected in the world.

It will not lead to a better future for your children.

In response to Russia’s massive military build-up over the past months,

we have already strengthened our deterrence and defence.

Yesterday, NATO Allies activated our defence plans.

And as a result, we are deploying elements of the NATO Response Force.

On land, at sea, and in the air.

To further strengthen our posture.

And to respond quickly to any contingency.

The United States, Canada and European Allies have deployed thousands of more troops to the eastern part of the Alliance.

We have over 100 jets at high alert operating in over 30 different locations.

And over 120 ships from the High North to the Mediterranean.

Including three strike carrier groups.

There must be no space for miscalculation or misunderstanding.

We will do what it takes to protect and defend every Ally.

And every inch of NATO territory.

Leaders today also made clear that we must continue our support to Ukraine.

The Kremlin is trying to make NATO and the EU provide less support to our partners.

So our collective answer must be more support.

To countries like Georgia, Moldova, and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

To help them succeed with their democratic reforms,

and pursue the path that they have freely choosen.

More than ever, this crisis demonstrates the importance of North America and Europe standing together in NATO.

There is no security in Europe without a strong transatlantic bond.

With that, I’m ready to take your questions.

NATO Spokesperson: Al Jazeera.

James Bays (Al Jazeera): How fearful are you about the possible fall of Kyiv? How long in your estimate, in your estimation, can the government of Ukraine last? And if we move to a resistance, insurgency type situation, what support can NATO then give?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: So what we see now is a full-fledged invasion of Ukraine from multiple directions, with air, sea and land capabilities. And this is actually in line with what our intelligence services predicted over a long period of time because we saw the build-up around Ukraine with air, sea and land forces.

We see, of course, that they're moving towards Kyiv. We also see the rhetoric, the messages, which is strongly indicating that the aim is to change government, to change and remove the democratically elected government in Kyiv. We are in close contact with the government of Ukraine.

We are of course monitoring the situation very closely.

It is still a fluid situation. What we have seen is that the Ukrainian forces are fighting bravely and are actually able to inflict damage on the invading Russian forces.

But again, it is a very fluid and an evolving situation. NATO Allies expressed at the Summit today that they provide support to Ukraine. They are ready to continue to provide support to Ukraine. Military support, financial support, humanitarian support. And then, I think we will have to judge how things evolve. But the message from NATO Leaders, and also from Finland, Sweden, the EU, is that we are there to support Ukraine. We have supported Ukraine for many years and we continue to provide support.

NATO Spokesperson: We go to the National News Agency of Ukraine.

Dmytro Shkurko (National News Agency of Ukraine): Secretary General, in the current situation, which we observe now in Ukraine, does NATO preserve its desire to assist Ukraine with defensive equipment? In particular, can we expect that NATO will provide Ukraine with so badly needed anti-aircraft equipment? Thank you so much.

NATO Secretary General: So NATO Allies continue to provide support to Ukraine. And it was actually at the meeting today, at the NATO Summit with EU and Finland and Sweden, Allies announced and also informed all the Allies about the type of weapons, the type of support. And some of that also includes air defence systems. So NATO Allies have and continue to provide support militarily, but also different types of equipment to Ukraine.



Then, we all realize that, of course, in this very evolving and difficult situation, it's hard to predict what will be the… what are the possibilities in the future. But Allies are providing support and are very committed to continue to provide support.

NATO Spokesperson: Okay, we'll go to NBC, just behind the cameras.

Josh Lederman (NBC): Thank you Mr. Secretary General, there's concern that NATO could get pulled into this conflict if Russia were to shut down electricity or other services in Ukraine that could spill over into Poland or Romania. Can you say explicitly whether a Russian cyber attack of that nature would trigger an Article 5 collective defence?

NATO Secretary General: So we are sending a very clear message to Russia that we provide support to our partner, Ukraine. Allies provide many different types of support. NATO helps Ukraine also with their cyber defences.

But then, for NATO Allies, we provide the absolute security guarantees under the Washington Treaty Article 5. An attack on one will be regarded as an attack on all. And we are clear on this distinction because it is important to make sure that we don't have an even bigger crisis in Europe where Russia challenge, or is threatening, or attacking any NATO allied country. And that's reason why we so clearly send the message that we are there to protect all Allies and every inch of NATO territory.

When it comes to cyber attacks and the risk for incidents and accidents, for instance, in the Black Sea, we are pursuing mechanisms of de-confliction to prevent that from happening.

We have, NATO Allies, especially the United States have done that, for instance, in Syria over a long period of time.

And we, of course, are very focused. I spoke with SACEUR, the NATO Supreme Commander on that issue recently. And he is very focused on the need to de-conflict to make sure that we don't have incidents or accidents that can spiral and get out of control and create a very dangerous situation.

On cyber, well we have stated that cyber attacks can trigger Article 5. But we have never gone into the position where we give a potential adversary the privilege of defining exactly when we trigger Article 5.

We are focused on strengthening our cyber defences. We are very much aware of that that’s a risk. And therefore, we are stepping up. Both the protection of our cyber networks but also providing support to Ukraine. And we are very focused on the need for de-confliction.

NATO Spokesperson: Okay, we'll go to NPR/Deutsche Welle

Teri Schultz (NPR/Deutsche Welle):Thank you. I want to know more about the deployment of the NRF forces, please. How many will be sent? Where? From where? How long will it take to get there, thinking about military mobility, as always. And also what has changed in your calculation about the threat to NATO territory that has led Allies to make the decision to deploy this for the first time in history, for the purposes of collective defence? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General: Well, what has changed over the last days is of course that there is a full-fledged invasion of a partner, country that borders several NATO allied countries.

And this is the most serious security crisis we have faced in Europe for decades. And therefore, we have the high readiness force, we have the NATO Response Force. And that's the reason why we are deploying it to, again, prevent any miscalculation and a misunderstanding that we are not ready to protect and defend all Allies.

And of course, this is something all Allies have agreed to do. 30 Allies agreed. But of course, especially those in the eastern part of the Alliance, are extremely concerned. They are close to this, the fighting in Ukraine. And they also border Russia. And they have seen not only the military build-up and the ongoing war in Ukraine, but also seen the very threatening rhetoric. Because this goes far beyond Ukraine. This is about how Russia is actually challenging, contesting core values for security, and demanding that NATO should withdraw all forces and infrastructure from almost half of our members.

And they have stated that if you don't do that, if we don't meet their demands, there will be, what they call, military-technical consequences. So we have to take this seriously. And that's exactly why we are now deploying the NATO Response Force, for the first time in an collective defence context.

And we speak about thousands of troops. We speak about air and maritime capabilities. They are only actually part of the standing naval groups. We have many planes operating in the eastern part of the Alliance. And then, several Allies have partly already assigned troops and forces to the NATO Response Force.

We have the lead elements which are led by France. We have the United States which has assigned thousands of troops to the NATO Response Force. And these will be deployed to different places in eastern part of the Alliance.

[Follow-up question inaudible]

NATO Secretary General: Well, they are, partly, they are coming from the United States, but these are also very much European troops.

For instance, the lead element, the VJTF - the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force, is now led by France, there is a strong German component there and other Allies also part of that.

NATO Spokesperson: Associated Press.

Lorne Cook (Associated Press): Just to follow up on that, Secretary General. The VJTF can only go to one place and you have eight Allies that are extremely nervous. I mean, where might you send it? Have you identified a particular weakness on that eastern flank? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General: Well, I think we have to understand that we have many elements, components, of the NATO Response Force. We have increased the readiness of the NATO Response Force. And then, I don't speak only about that lead element, or the VJTF - the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force, but we speak about more elements than just that one.

Second, we have Allies, the United States, but also United Kingdom and other Allies that have increased readiness or forces that are assigned to NATO and the NATO Response Force.

So of course these are additional forces that we can deploy as part of the broader deployment of the NATO Response Force. I'm not saying that we are deploying the whole force. The size of the NATO Response Force has been tripled since 2014, to roughly 40,000 troops.

I'm not saying we're deploying the whole thing. I'm saying that we are deploying elements, elements of the lead…, the VJTF, and elements of the rest of the NATO Response Force.



And then, it is for SACEUR to make final decisions exactly where the different elements are deployed. But we activated the defence plans yesterday. And now the elements of this force will be deployed, or is being deployed.

NATO Spokesperson: Okay. We'll go to TV2. Lady in white, over there.

Elin Sørsdahl (TV2 Norway): Thanks. I'll just follow up on AP and what Teri from NPR said, how quick can these troops and this force be deployed?

NATO Secretary General: Well, some of these forces are already operating, because we have sea and air forces, which are also already part of the NATO maritime forces operating from the Barents Sea down to the Mediterranean. Some are air forces, the air component of the NATO Response Force. And then some of the land forces are… also can move within a few days. Because they're part of either the lead element, which has already high readiness, or the other elements that has been put on high readiness. So we speak about days and some are already operating, because we have increased our presence already.

NATO Spokesperson: Okay, we'll try to take a couple of questions online. We'll go first to Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Thomas Gutschker.

Thomas Gutschker (FAZ): Thanks a lot. Good afternoon. Secretary General, in the statement that has just been released, it is said that Russia's actions are a flagrant rejection of the principles enshrined in the NATO-Russia Founding Act. And then, it continues it is Russia that has walked away from its commitments under the Act. Does that mean that NATO now considers the NATO-Russia Founding Act as obsolete? Or do NATO member states still, are they still bound, do they still feel bound by this document? Thanks a lot.

NATO Secretary General: NATO leaders decided today a statement where it clearly states the fact that Russia has walked away. The NATO-Russia Founding Act is based on some core principles enshrined in the Founding Act. And that is the respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty of all countries, including, of course, Ukraine. And this has been violated not once, but twice. And actually it has been constantly violated since 2014, with the illegal annexation of Crimea, and the continued presence of Russian forces and Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, in Donbass. And this is further violated with the full-fledged invasion of Ukraine that we have seen over the last couple of days.

So what we have, what we see is that Russia shows no respect for the NATO-Russia Founding Act. And, of course, if you have a Founding Act between two partners, NATO and Russia, and one part doesn't respect that agreement, the agreement doesn't work. It doesn't function. It doesn't help us to improve our relationship with Russia. Because even if the Founding Act has good provisions and good intentions, if these intentions and the provisions under the Founding Act is not respected, it doesn't work. So that's the reality. The NATO-Russia Founding Act doesn't work, because one side, Russia, has violated over many years. But now we see an extremely blatant and flagrant violation of the Founding Act with the invasion of Ukraine.

NATO Spokesperson: We'll take the next question online also from Greg Palkot from FOX.

Greg Palkot (FOX News): Thank you, Oana. Thank you, Mr Secretary General. Two quick questions. One about war. One about peace. Do you agree with some reports of intelligence officials, that Kyiv could fall within the next say, day or two? And despite the bravery of the fighting that you have cited among Ukrainian soldiers, do you see a defeat inevitable if war goes on? And the quick question about peace, there is discussion, President Zelenskyy offering to discuss with Russia an approach to peace that might include neutrality for Ukraine. Would you agree to something like that? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General: So first, on the situation on the ground, it is a full invasion of Ukraine. They are moving towards Kyiv. And the stated goal is to change the government of Ukraine. It is a very unpredictable situation. Therefore, I will not speculate, but I will pay my respect to the Ukrainian armed forces, which are really proving their bravery and their courage by fighting and standing up against the much larger invading Russian force. On potential talks between the government of Ukraine, President Zelenskyy and Russia, my main message is that this is for President Zelenskyy and the government of Ukraine to decide. What we need to see now is that Russia stop the attack against Ukraine. That they withdraw their forces and cease all the attacks on Ukraine. That's the easiest, the fastest, and the best way to peace. So if they want peace, then, it is just stop to attack Ukraine. And, therefore, we call on Russia to do exactly that.

NATO Spokesperson: Okay we’ll go to NTV.

Gul Sonomut (NTV): Secretary General two short questions. First, you are a statistician and so far with regard the risk, you have already evaluate the risk and the threat against NATO coming from Russia. Particularly you foresee the playbook of Russia. And so, my first question is, what is the risk that this conflict spread? Where and what might be the end goal of Russia?

And my second question is, you have at the top of your… the tip of your fingers, the security of one billion citizen in the transatlantic area. So you met with, on VTC with all the leaders, can you reassure the public opinion that if there is a genuine threat coming from… because the rhetoric… the aggressive rhetoric of Russia, its behaviour isn’t acceptable that all member states are committed to defend and protect every single centimetre of NATO. Thank you.

NATO Secretary General: In the meeting today with NATO leaders, it was a very strong message of unity. A very strong message of resolve, that we need to stand together not only in words, but also in deeds. So we agreed a strong statement, calling on Russia to stop the attacks on Ukraine, to withdraw its forces. But, also, we agreed to continue to provide support to Ukraine, and also continue to strengthen our presence in eastern part Alliance, to prevent any attack on any NATO allied country. We have a defensive presence in the East. We are increasing our presence. Not to provoke a conflict, but to prevent a conflict. And as long as there is no doubt about NATO's readiness to protect and defend all Allies. And our commitment to the core message, the core task of NATO, one for all, all for one. An attack on one Ally will be regarded as an attack on all, then no Ally will be attacked. And that will prevent a conflict, and that will preserve peace for NATO Allies, and for one billion people.

And that's the reason why we communicate so clearly. And that's reason why we are deploying more troops in the eastern part Alliance, to make sure that there is no possibility to misunderstand our readiness to protect and defend all Allies. And, again, this is to preserve peace, to prevent an attack. And to prevent that the war which is going on in Ukraine spill over to any NATO allied country. And that was the message from NATO leaders today. And that was also the message when I met with many of them in the G7 yesterday. And that is also of course the message when we speak to close partners, Finland, Sweden, and the European Union. Because we all are concerned and Russia's attack on Ukraine is more than an attack on Ukraine. It's a devastating horrendous attack on innocent people in Ukraine. But it's also an attack on the whole European security order. And that's the reason why we take it so extremely seriously.

NATO Spokesperson: Deutsche Welle.

Alexandra von Nahmen (Deutsche Welle): Thank you. Secretary General, one question on Ukraine's request for Turkey to close the Bosphorus for Russian warships. Is that… was that discussed today? And one follow-up on the question just asked, we heard today from the Lithuanian Foreign Minister saying that when we lose Ukraine today we will be fighting for NATO later. Would you say that statement is exaggerated? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General: On the Bosphorus, that was not an issue. On the potential attack, or any potential attack on a NATO allied country, well that has been my message throughout the whole day. That was the message from the NATO leaders in the Summit today, is that we are there to protect and defend all Allies. NATO is the strongest military Alliance in the world. And make no mistake, we are there to protect and defend all Allies, and every inch of NATO territory. And we convey that message again and again. Both in words, but also in deeds. And that's the way to prevent war. That's the way to prevent an attack, to preserve peace. And we have done so for more than 70 years. And we will continue to do it also in the light of the attack on Ukraine.

NATO Spokesperson: Thank you very much. This concludes this press conference.

NATO Secretary General: Thank you so much.",https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_192455.htm

3,01b1d7aa-189b-43af-bffd-56bf4e8c29f8,['Ellen Mitchell'],2022-02-25 19:52:11+00:00,"NATO, for the first time in its history, is activating its NATO Response Force (NRF) in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

“We have activated NATO’s defense plans to prepare ourselves to respond to a range of contingencies and secure Alliance territory, including by drawing on our response forces,” NATO heads of state and government said in a joint statement released Friday after the alliance held a virtual summit.

“We are now making significant additional defensive deployments of forces to the eastern part of the Alliance. We will make all deployments necessary to ensure strong and credible deterrence and defense across the Alliance, now and in the future.”

The leaders stressed the moves “are and remain preventive, proportionate and non-escalatory.”

The extraordinary move marks the first time NATO has activated the NRF, a multinational force comprised of around 40,000 land, air, maritime and special operations personnel the alliance can deploy on short notice as needed. All 30 members of NATO must agree to activate the force, which they did on Thursday.

The Pentagon in January put 8,500 U.S. troops on heightened alert for such a mission, and with the NRF now activated, those troops could soon be ordered to Europe to help bolster NATO countries near Ukraine. President Biden has stressed, however, that they will not go to Ukraine as it is not a member of the alliance.

Supreme Allied Commander of NATO Gen. Tod Wolters, the head of the NRF, called the force’s activation a “historic moment” according to a statement.

“They represent a flexible, combat credible force that can be employed in multiple ways and we are utilizing fully their inherent agility,” Wolters said. “These deterrence measures are prudent and enhance our speed, responsiveness and capability to shield and protect the one billion citizens we swore to protect.”

The force is still on standby and has not yet been deployed.

In addition, NATO has “deployed defensive land and air forces in the eastern part of the Alliance, and maritime assets across the NATO area,” according to its statement.

The alliance also reaffirmed its “unwavering support for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity” of Ukraine, and pledged continued “political and practice support” to its government.

Speaking to reporters after the summit, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the U.S., Canada and European allies have deployed “thousands of more troops to the eastern part of the alliance,” with more than 100 jets and 120 ships operating on high alert in more than 30 locations.

Stoltenberg also again called on Russia to stop its attack on Ukraine.

“We call on Russia to stop this senseless war, immediately cease its assaults, withdraw all of its forces from Ukraine and turn back to the path of dialogue and turn away from aggression,” he said.

He warned that the alliance is facing a new normal in European security, and that “the world will hold Russia and Belarus accountable for their actions — Russia as the aggressor, Belarus as the enabler.”

The United States has already deployed or repositioned roughly 15,000 American troops to locations in Germany, Romania and Poland. Russia Russian President Vladimir Putin early on Thursday launched a military operation into Ukraine. Hundreds of Ukrainian citizens have since been killed or wounded.",https://thehill.com/policy/defense/595876-nato-activates-response-force-for-first-time-in-history/
4,01b1d7aa-189b-43af-bffd-56bf4e8c29f8,[],,"NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg says the alliance will deploy parts of its combat-ready response force to reassure Eastern member countries after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.



""We are now deploying the NATO response force for the first time in the context of collective defense,"" Stoltenberg told a news conference on February 25 following a virtual NATO summit.

“Russia has shattered peace on the European continent. What we have warned against for months has come to pass, despite all of our efforts to find a diplomatic solution,” Stoltenberg said as he opened the summit.



“Moscow bears sole responsibility for the deliberate, cold-blooded, and long-planned invasion,” he added.



He did not say how many troops from the NATO response force would be deployed but referred to “thousands” and confirmed that the move would involve land, sea, and air power.



In addition, parts of a force known as the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF), which is currently led by France, will also be sent.



NATO previously had around 5,000 troops stationed in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland but has significantly increased its defenses in the countries over the past three months.



U.S. President Joe Biden welcomed the decision to activate the NATO response force and said Russian President Vladimir Putin had “failed in his goal of dividing the West.”



NATO is “as united and resolute as it’s ever been, and NATO will maintain its Open Door to those European states who share our values and who one day may seek to join our Alliance,” Biden said in a statement issued by the White House.



After participating in the summit, Biden said he spoke by phone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.



“I commended the brave actions of the Ukrainian people who were fighting to defend their country,” Biden said in the statement. “I also conveyed ongoing economic, humanitarian, and security support being provided by the United States as well as our continued efforts to rally other countries to provide similar assistance.”

The United States and some of NATO’s other 29 members are supplying a variety of weapons to Ukraine, and Stoltenberg said that would continue. He said weapons they would supply include air defenses.



But NATO has said it won’t launch any military action in support of Ukraine, which is a close partner of the alliance but not a member.



The U.S. military said on February 24 that it is sending 7,000 troops to Europe in addition to 5,000 recently deployed.

Prior To Joining Aviation Week In November', 'Tony Was At Shephard Media Group Where He Was Deputy Editor For Rotorhub', 'Defence Helicopter Magazines.']",,"LONDON—NATO has activated its defense plans and given more authority to military commanders in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The alliance is planning to deploy more military equipment to reinforce Eastern European countries, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told journalists following a meeting of the North Atlantic Council.

He said the invasion was “a grave moment for the security of Europe,” and a “brutal act of war.”

“Peace in our continent has been shattered,” Stoltenberg said. “We now have war in Europe, on a scale and of a type we thought belonged to history.”

The attacks have prompted a joint request from Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia to hold urgent consultations under Article 4 of the Washington Treaty over concerns about the potential security impact of the invasion on their own borders.

Stoltenberg said the activation of the defense plans would allow much quicker deployment of troops and equipment. NATO forces now have 100 aircraft on standby and 120 allied ships are now at sea, arrayed from the High North to the Mediterranean, Stoltenberg said.

Recent days have seen the forward deployment of U.S. F-35s from Germany, while the Netherlands has brought forward a planned F-35 deployment to Bulgaria which was planned for April and May. The Netherlands defense ministry confirmed that the aircraft had already arrived in-country.

Elsewhere across the alliance, thousands of troops were being put on standby for possible deployment to Eastern Europe.

Stoltenberg would not say whether NATO’s defense plans had been previously activated, stating he was not clear if previous activations had been made public.

Russian forces launched a multi-pronged attack into Ukraine in the early hours of Feb. 24 with an initial bombardment of ballistic and cruise missiles, followed by an armoured push with forces crossing in from the Donbas region, Crimea and neighboring Belarus.

Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the operation with a lengthy address, saying the goal was to “demilitarize” Ukraine and roll-back the encroachment of NATO forces and allies on Russia’s borders.

Stoltenberg said Russia was “using force to try to rewrite history,” and “deny Ukraine its free and independent path.”",https://aviationweek.com/defense-space/budget-policy-operations/nato-activates-defense-plans-response-russian-invasion

The tenet allows any member to call for a consultation of the alliance when they feel threatened.

On Friday, NATO said it would activate its response force as a defensive measure for the first time.

Russia's ongoing assault on Ukraine has forced the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and its 30 member countries to rapidly grapple with the role they should play in the escalating conflict.

US President Joe Biden on Thursday said no US troops would be sent to Ukraine, which is not a member of NATO, But he warned that the US and its allies would ""defend every inch of NATO territory.""

""Our forces are not and will not be engaged in the conflict with Russia in Ukraine,"" Biden said in a Thursday speech from the White House. ""Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our NATO allies.""

But as reports of increasing shelling, bombings, and casualties across Ukraine poured in on Thursday morning, several Eastern European countries in the body called for consultations under NATO Article 4, triggering an emergency meeting Friday morning and further testing how far the alliance will allow itself to be drawn into the war.

What is NATO?

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is a military alliance created in 1949 to provide collective security against Soviet expansionism and to encourage European political integration in the aftermath of World War II.

NATO serves as a collective security system, wherein its member states agree to mutually defend any attack on a member party — a pledge enshrined in the treaty's most famous tenet, Article 5.

The alliance contained just 12 countries when it was founded but has more than doubled in size in the years since. The body now consists of two countries in North America and 28 European countries, including several former Soviet nations.

Ukraine, though not a member of NATO, has been designated one of the alliance's ""enhanced opportunity partners,"" a title granted to nonmember countries that have contributed to NATO-led operations and missions.

As such, NATO and its members have no binding obligation to defend Ukraine against Russia's attacks.

But as the conflict quickly intensifies, pleas for NATO assistance — from Ukraine and others — are growing louder.

What is Article 4 of NATO's treaty?

On Thursday, a group of Eastern European countries, including Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia requested discussions under NATO Article 4.

Article 4 of the treaty allows any member nation to call for a consultation of the organization's governing body when ""the territorial integrity, political independence, or security of any of the parties is threatened,"" according to the treaty.

Triggering the article does not guarantee that the alliance will take action, but it is a significant step in intensifying discussions between members. Article 4 starts formal communications on behalf of the threatened member.

Discussions within the alliance then focus on whether the threat exists and how to counter it. NATO employs consensus decision-making, meaning there is no voting within the alliance. Consultations continue until a unanimous decision is reached, NATO's website says.

In an immediate response to the invocation of Article 4 on Thursday, NATO announced the alliance would proceed with ""defensive planning"" as it made preparations for further Russian violence against Ukraine.

When has Article 4 been invoked before?

In NATO's 73-year existence, Article 4 had only been triggered six times prior to Thursday, according to the alliance's website.

Its most recent use was in February 2020, when Turkey, which has triggered consultations more than any other country, invoked the article after Syrian government forces killed dozens of Turkish soldiers in an attack in opposition-held regions in northern Syria.

The other five times it was used were:

July 2015: Turkey invoked Article 4 to alert the alliance to its impending response to terrorist attacks

March 2014: Poland invoked Article 4 to discuss increasing tensions in Ukraine amid Russian aggression

October 2012: Turkey triggered talks after five Turkish civilians were killed by Syrian shells

June 2012: Turkey requested a meeting after one of its fighter jets was shot down by Syrian air defense forces

February 2003: Turkey invoked Article 4 asking NATO to help protect its people from any spillover consequences of the war in Iraq

On two of those occasions, NATO responded with military assistance, aiding Turkey with Patriot missile batteries to combat Syrian attacks in 2012 and providing aircraft and missile batteries along Turkey's border with Iraq in 2003.

Poland's use of the tenet in 2014 led to a member meeting that resulted in stronger NATO efforts to defend the alliance.

What was the outcome of Friday's discussion?

World leaders attended an emergency virtual NATO summit Friday morning following the invocation of Article 4. The meeting followed a separate emergency NATO summit on Thursday, where members also discussed the Ukraine situation.

Following Friday's meeting, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told journalists the alliance would deploy parts of its response force and continue sending weapons to Ukraine, including air defenses.

The decision marks the first time in NATO's seven-decade history that the body's combat-ready response force has been activated as a defensive measure, CNN reported.

""This is an historic moment and the very first time the Alliance has employed these high readiness forces in a deterrence and defense role,"" NATO Supreme Allied Commander Gen. Tod Wolters said in a statement to the outlet.

The force includes land, air, sea, and special operations forces from the alliance's member nations ready for rapid deployment. Wolters activated the force Friday, though troops have not yet been deployed and remain on standby.

It was not immediately clear how many of the force's 40,000 troops would be activated. The forces will not go directly to Ukraine.

Biden has made clear that US troops thus far deployed to Eastern Europe are there to bolster NATO member countries wary of nearby Russian aggression.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday thanked NATO for its help but called on the alliance to do more.

""We are alone in defending our country. Who is ready to defend us together with us? Honestly, I don't see any,"" Zelensky said, according to CNN. ""Who is ready to give Ukraine a guarantee of joining NATO? Honestly, everyone is afraid.""",https://www.businessinsider.com/multiple-countries-triggered-nato-article-4-what-does-that-mean-2022-2

NATO will therefore continue to develop and acquire a range of networked information systems (Automated Information Systems) that support NATO’s Strategic Commands. These systems cover a number of domains – including land, air, maritime, intelligence and logistics – with a view to enabling more informed and effective holistic oversight, decision-making and command and control.

Joint Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance

The Alliance has long recognised the fundamental importance of Joint Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (JISR) to its strategic preparedness and to the success of its operations and missions. The aim of this capability is to support the coordinated collection, processing and sharing within NATO of ISR material gathered by the Alliance Ground Surveillance (AGS) system, the NATO Airborne Early Warning and Control Force (NAEW&C Force) and Allies’ own ISR assets.

In view of today’s rapidly changing security environment, JISR continues to adapt to ensure that the Alliance has the information and intelligence needed to make the right decisions at the right time. This is why NATO Allies endorsed a new capability development strategy in October 2020 and concrete implementation measures in October 2021. The strategy will help develop and field interoperable intelligence capabilities in a more agile manner, harvesting the power of cutting-edge technologies, such as big data, artificial intelligence and autonomous systems.

The space domain plays a crucial role for JISR. At the 2021 NATO Summit in Brussels, Allies announced plans to develop a Strategic Space Situational Awareness System (3SAS) at NATO Headquarters. This capability will allow the Alliance to better understand the space environment and space events, and their effects across all domains.

Alliance Ground Surveillance

The Alliance Ground Surveillance (AGS) programme represents an excellent example of transatlantic cooperation, thanks to the multinational industrial cooperation on which the programme has been founded. The AGS system is an essential enabling capability for forces across the full spectrum of NATO’s current and future operations and missions. Using advanced radar sensors, it is able to continuously detect and track objects that are moving on or near the ground (such as tanks, trucks or helicopters) in all weather conditions and provide radar imagery of areas of interest on the ground and at sea.

As such, AGS complements the NATO Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS), which already monitors Alliance airspace. The AGS Core is an integrated system consisting of air, ground and support segments. The air segment includes five remotely piloted surveillance aircraft.

NATO Airborne Warning and Control System

As one of the most visible and tangible examples of what cooperation between Allies can achieve, the NATO Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) provides NATO-owned and operated airborne command and control, air and maritime surveillance, and battlespace management capability. AWACS has continuously proven itself to be a critical asset to NATO and Allies, for example by safeguarding the Alliance’s eastern perimeter and providing support to the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.

NATO AWACS aircraft will continue to be modernised and extended in service until 2035. The modernisation of NATO’s AWACS fleet is vital to ensuring the security of all Allies and will strengthen the Alliance’s awareness and capacity for strategic anticipation.

Alliance Future Surveillance and Control capability

At the 2016 NATO Summit in Warsaw, NATO Leaders launched the Alliance Future Surveillance and Control (AFSC) initiative in order to determine how NATO will maintain its situational awareness and command Allied forces after the retirement of AWACS in 2035. NATO is now moving forward to redefine its means for surveillance and control in the future.

In cooperation with Allied experts from a range of communities and backgrounds – including military, industry, and science and technology – NATO is evaluating new technologies and solutions through studies that will inform decisions by NATO, individual Allies or multinational groups to develop and acquire new systems in the future. These solutions could include combinations of interconnected air, ground, space, manned or unmanned systems to collect and share information.

Ballistic missile defence

Proliferation of ballistic missiles poses an increasing threat to NATO populations, territory and forces. Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) is one of NATO’s permanent missions and is part of the Alliance’s response to this threat, as a component of NATO Integrated Air and Missile Defence (IAMD). NATO BMD is strictly defensive and contributes to NATO’s core task of collective defence. BMD capabilities are an essential part of NATO’s strategic mix, along with conventional forces and nuclear deterrence. During the 2016 NATO Summit in Warsaw, Allies declared initial operational capability of NATO BMD, offering a capability to defend Alliance populations, territory and forces across southern NATO Europe against a ballistic missile attack. The ultimate aim of NATO BMD is to achieve full operational capability, providing coverage and protection to all NATO Europe.

Air command and control

NATO air command and control (Air C2) systems provide the Alliance with a capability to manage NATO air operations (including air policing) in and out of the Euro-Atlantic area. NATO Air C2 systems integrate air mission control, air traffic control, airspace surveillance, airspace management, command and control (C2) resource management and force management functions, among other functionalities. The systems cover a theatre of operations of 81 million square kilometres (not including deployable capability) from the northernmost point of Norway to the Mediterranean Sea, and from the easternmost point of Turkey to the North Atlantic. They constitute one of the major pillars in NATO aimed at safeguarding and protecting Alliance territory, populations and forces against any air and missile threat and attack.

Electromagnetic spectrum superiority

The electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) is a pervasive global commons and yet a finite resource. NATO forces exploit the EMS to build situational awareness within the operational environment; access it to communicate, share information, synchronise operations, navigate, and operate sensors and weapons systems; and control it by protecting friendly freedom of action within it, while denying use to a potential adversary.

Synchronised activities associated with spectrum management, signals intelligence, electronic warfare, communications, and navigation warfare, among others, constitute electromagnetic operations (EMO). EMO enables greater effectiveness of military operations and activities.

NATO’s EMS strategy aims to ensure military freedom of action of its forces through gaining access to and superiority over the EMS. This is supported by an increased cooperation between the various stakeholders within all operational domains, including cyber and space.

Federated Mission Networking

Federated Mission Networking (FMN) is a key contribution in helping Allied and partner forces better communicate, train and operate together. The programme aims to support command and control, as well as decision-making in operations, by enabling improved information-sharing through common standards, protocols and procedures.

FMN is based on the lessons learned from operations in Afghanistan, particularly the need for harmonised operational processes and scalable supporting systems for all future missions. The objectives of FMN are to ensure consultation, command and control (C3), interoperability and readiness. FMN will underpin the Alliance’s ability to connect its information systems and operate effectively, including together with partners, on training, exercises and operations.

Cyber defence

Cyber threats to the security of the Alliance are complex, destructive, coercive and becoming ever more frequent. This has been illustrated by ransomware incidents and other malicious cyber activity targeting critical infrastructure and democratic institutions in Allied countries, which might have systemic effects and cause significant harm. NATO and its Allies rely on strong and resilient cyber defences to fulfil the Alliance’s core tasks of collective defence, crisis management and cooperative security.



Logistics

Logistics planning is an integral part of the NATO Defence Planning Process (NDPP). In concrete terms, logistics capabilities are built upon requirements identified by the NDPP and generated by Allies individually, multinationally or collectively.

Logistics capabilities can be called upon by NATO commanders, as part of the operational planning process, to be used in a NATO-led operation and any other activity in support of the Alliance’s posture. Cooperation and coordination in logistics ensures that national and NATO logistics plans are sufficiently resourced in quantity and quality, focusing on four main aspects: provision of capabilities, command and control, deployability and sustainability.

Next-generation networks

Many of the critical enabling capabilities described above are dependent on communications networks that are able to cope with exponentially increased requirements for bandwidth and data throughput. New technologies, such as 5G, are in a position to support these requirements, but they also raise concerns about security and resilience. NATO initiatives are addressing these concerns by ensuring that telecommunications equipment in use in the Alliance’s networks is meeting the highest possible level of security, and that fall-back capabilities are in place to account for interruptions in the networks.

Consequently, much attention is on communication and information systems (CIS) supply chain security.",https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_49137.htm
8,01b1d7aa-189b-43af-bffd-56bf4e8c29f8,[],,"The NRF has the overarching purpose of being able to provide a rapid military response to an emerging crisis, whether for collective defence purposes or for other crisis-response operations.

The NRF gives the Alliance the means to respond swiftly to various types of crises anywhere in the world. It is also a driving engine for NATO’s military transformation.

A rotational force

The NRF is based on a rotational system where Allied countries commit land, air, maritime or Special Operations Forces (SOF) units for a period of 12 months.

The NRF is also open to partner countries, once approved by the North Atlantic Council.

Participation in the NRF is preceded by national preparation, followed by training with other participants in the multinational force. As units rotate through the NRF, the associated high standards, concepts and technologies are gradually spread throughout the Alliance, thereby fulfilling one of the key purposes of the NATO Response Force – the further transformation of Allied forces.

Operational command of the NRF alternates annually between Allied Joint Force Commands in Brunssum, the Netherlands and Naples, Italy.

A powerful package

NATO Allies decided at the 2014 Wales Summit to enhance the NRF by creating a “spearhead force” within it, known as the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force or VJTF. This enhanced NRF is one of the measures of the Readiness Action Plan (RAP) agreed by Allies to respond to the changes in the security environment.

The enhanced NATO Response Force includes:

a command and control element: Operational command of the NRF alternates between Allied Joint Force Commands in Brunssum and Naples;

Operational command of the NRF alternates between Allied Joint Force Commands in Brunssum and Naples; the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF) : This NRF element – about 20,000 strong – includes a multinational land brigade of around 5,000 troops and air, maritime and SOF components. Leading elements are ready to move within two to three days. Allies assume the lead role for the VJTF on a rotational basis;

: This NRF element – about 20,000 strong – includes a multinational land brigade of around 5,000 troops and air, maritime and SOF components. Leading elements are ready to move within two to three days. Allies assume the lead role for the VJTF on a rotational basis; the Initial Follow-On Forces Group (IFFG) : These are high-readiness forces that can deploy quickly following the VJTF, in response to a crisis. They are made up of two multinational brigades;

: These are high-readiness forces that can deploy quickly following the VJTF, in response to a crisis. They are made up of two multinational brigades; a maritime component : it is based on the Standing NATO Maritime Groups (SNMGs) and the Standing NATO Mine Countermeasures Groups (SNMCMGs);

: it is based on the Standing NATO Maritime Groups (SNMGs) and the Standing NATO Mine Countermeasures Groups (SNMCMGs); a combat air and air-support component ;

; Special Operations Forces ; and

; and a chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) defence task force.

Before use, the NRF will be tailored (adjusted in size and capability) to match the demands of any specific operation to which it is committed.

The VJTF and Initial Follow-on Forces are based in their home countries, but are able to deploy to wherever they are needed for exercises or crisis response. The VJTF participated in its first deployment exercise in Poland in June 2015 and is regularly tested during exercises on its ability to deploy and respond to any arising crisis.

Leadership of the VJTF rotates on an annual basis, with one Ally designated as the lead country and other Allies participating.

Altogether, the enhanced NRF comprises around 40,000 troops.

Any mission, anywhere

The NRF provides a tangible demonstration of NATO’s cohesion and commitment to deterrence and collective defence. Each NRF rotation has to prepare itself for a wide range of tasks. These include contributing to the preservation of territorial integrity, making a demonstration of force, peace support operations, disaster relief, protecting critical infrastructure and security operations. Initial-entry operations are conducted jointly as part of a larger force to facilitate the arrival of follow-on troops.

Elements of the NRF helped protect the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, and were deployed to support the Afghan presidential elections in September of the same year.

The NRF has also been used in disaster relief.

In September and October 2005, aircraft from the NRF delivered relief supplies donated by NATO member and partner countries to the United States to assist in dealing with the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.

From October 2005 to February 2006, elements of the NRF were used in the disaster relief effort in Pakistan, following the devastating 8 October earthquake. Aircraft from the NRF were used in an air bridge that delivered almost 3,500 tons of urgently needed supplies to Pakistan, while engineers and medical personnel from the NRF were deployed to the country to assist in the relief effort.

Elements of he NRF were activated in August 2021 to support the evacuation and relocation of Afghans who worked alongside NATO, together with their families. This response included the establishment of Task Force Noble, a task force coordinating hundreds of NRF troops from 20 Allied countries. These troops are supporting the evacuation in locations across Europe, including with transportation aircraft, construction equipment, ambulances, medical teams, civil affairs teams and security personnel.",https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_49755.htm
9,01b1d7aa-189b-43af-bffd-56bf4e8c29f8,['Sarah Pruitt'],2022-02-11 16:51:16+00:00,"Article 5 is the cornerstone of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and states that an attack on one member of NATO is an attack on all of its members. Despite its importance, NATO has only invoked Article 5 once in its history—in response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.

NATO Established After World War II

NATO and Article 5 were established in 1949 in the aftermath of World War II when Communist movements supported by the Soviet Union posed a serious threat to democratically elected governments all over a devastated Europe. In 1948, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia overthrew that nation’s democratic government, while in Germany, Soviet authorities blockaded the Allied-controlled section of Berlin in an attempt to strengthen their position there.

The Berlin Airlift, when U.S. and British planes carried food, fuel and other vital supplies to the isolated citizens of West Berlin, marked an early victory for the West in the Cold War. And with the launch of the Marshall Plan, which provided economic aid to the war-ravaged countries of Europe, the United States had decisively abandoned its earlier policy of isolationism.

But at such a vulnerable time, it seemed clear that Europe required not just economic aid, but also military support, in order to counterbalance the power of the Soviet Union, prevent the revival of nationalist military movements (such as Nazism) and allow for political development along democratic lines.

VIDEO: The Formation of NATO

Tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union resulted in the formation of key alliances that would endure throughout the Cold War.

In April 1949, representatives from 12 nations—the United States, Canada, Great Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark, Luxembourg, Iceland, Italy and Portugal—gathered in Washington, D.C. to sign the North Atlantic Treaty.

“Men with courage and vision can still determine their own destiny,” President Harry S. Truman declared at the signing ceremony. “They can choose slavery or freedom—war or peace…If there is anything certain today, if there is anything inevitable in the future, it is the will of the people of the world for freedom and for peace.”

Article 5 Text: 'An Attack Against One...'

The treaty’s key provision was Article 5, which began: “The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all…” While this commitment to collective defense lay at the heart of NATO, it was left to the judgment of each member state to decide how exactly it would contribute.

Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, NATO opened its door to include former Warsaw Pact states (the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland) and ex-Soviet republics (Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia). The alliance also broadened its role. Member states sent peacekeepers to Bosnia in the 1990s and carried out bombings in Serbia in 1999 in defense of Kosovo. Several former Soviet republics, including those in the Baltic region, began joining the NATO alliance.

Article 5 Invoked After 9/11 Attacks

On September 12, 2001, the day after the terrorist attacks at the World Trade Center and Pentagon, NATO invoked Article 5 for the first time in its history, committing its members to stand by the United States in its response to the attacks. In a four-paragraph resolution that passed unanimously, the organization reflected its understanding that the threats to global security had changed radically in the 52 years since the alliance was founded.

AUDIO: NATO Offers Aid to United States Following 9/11 Attacks

On October 2, 2001, NATO Secretary-General Lord Robertson held a press conference to discuss the events of September 11, and pledged support of the 18 NATO allies in the campaign against international terrorism.

”The commitment to collective self-defense embodied in the Washington Treaty was entered into in circumstances very different from those that exist now,” the statement read. “But it remains no less valid and no less essential today, in a world subject to the scourge of international terrorism.”

In addition to participation in the war in Afghanistan, NATO’s response to the 9/11 attacks under Article 5 included Operation Eagle Assist, in which NATO aircraft helped patrol the skies over the United States for seven months between 2001 and 2002, and Operation Active Endeavour, in which NATO naval forces were sent to perform counterterrorism activities in the Eastern Mediterranean. Operation Active Endeavour, which began in October 2001 and later expanded to the entire Mediterranean region, didn’t conclude until 2016.

NATO has taken collective defensive measures in other situations, including deploying missiles on the border of Turkey and Syria in 2012. Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the rise of ISIS in recent years led the organization to implement a huge increase in its collective defenses, including tripling the size of the NATO Response Force.

In 2014, NATO member states agreed to try and spend 2 percent of their GDPs on defense, although most member states fail to meet this non-binding goal.

U.S.-NATO Relations Under Trump, Biden

President Trump was critical of NATO, calling it “obsolete” in a 2017 interview and criticizing other NATO members for not spending enough on defense. But he also affirmed U.S. commitment to Article 5 in June 2017, during a news conference with the president of Romania: “I’m committing the United States to Article 5, and certainly we are there to protect, and certainly that’s one of the reasons that I want people to make sure we have a very, very strong force by paying the kind of money necessary to have that force.”

In February 2022, President Joe Biden ordered U.S. troops to eastern Europe to reinforce NATO's Response Force as Russian military forces encircled Ukraine. With troops surrounding Ukraine's border, Russian President Vladimir Putin insisted that the former Soviet republic never be permitted to join NATO.

As Pentagon Press Secretary John F. Kirby said in a February 2, 2022 press briefing, ""Our commitment to NATO Article 5 and collective defense remains ironclad.""",https://www.history.com/news/nato-article-5-meaning-history-world-war-2

1:43 P.M. EST

THE PRESIDENT: Sorry to keep you waiting. Good afternoon. The Russian military has begun a brutal assault on the people of Ukraine without provocation, without justification, without necessity.

This is a premeditated attack. Vladimir Putin has been planning this for months, as I’ve been — as we’ve been saying all along. He moved more than 175,000 troops, military equipment into positions along the Ukrainian border.

He moved blood supplies into position and built a field hospital, which tells you all you need to know about his intentions all along.

He rejected every good-faith effort the United States and our Allies and partners made to address our mutual security concerns through dialogue to avoid needless conflict and avert human suffering.

For weeks — for weeks, we have been warning that this would happen. And now it’s unfolding largely as we predicted.

In the past week, we’ve seen shelling increase in the Donbas, the region in eastern Ukraine controlled by Russian-backed separatists.

Rus- — the Russian government has perpetrated cyberattacks against Ukraine.

We saw a staged political theater in Moscow — outlandish and baseless claims that Ukraine was — Ukraine was about to invade and launch a war against Russia, that Ukraine was prepared to use chemical weapons, that Ukraine committed a genocide — without any evidence.

We saw a flagrant violation of international law in attempting to unilaterally create two new so-called republics on sovereign Ukrainian territory.

And at the very moment that the United Nations Security Council was meeting to stand up for Ukraine’s sovereignty to stave off invasion, Putin declared his war.

Within moments — moments, missile strikes began to fall on historic cities across Ukraine.

Then came in the air raids, followed by tanks and troops rolling in.

We’ve been transparent with the world. We’ve shared declassified evidence about Russia’s plans and cyberattacks and false pretexts so that there can be no confusion or cover-up about what Putin was doing.

Putin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war. And now he and his country will bear the consequences.

Today, I’m authorizing additional strong sanctions and new limitations on what can be exported to Russia.

This is going to impose severe costs on the Russian economy, both immediately and over time.

We have purposefully designed these sanctions to maximize the long-term impact on Russia and to minimize the impact on the United States and our Allies.

And I want to be clear: The United States is not doing this alone. For months, we’ve been building a coalition of partners representing well more than half of the global economy.

Twenty-seven members of the European Union, including France, Germany, Italy — as well as the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and many others — to amplify the joint impact of our response.

I just spoke with the G7 leaders this morning, and we are in full and total agreement. We will limit Russia’s ability to do business in Dollars, Euros, Pounds, and Yen to be part of the global economy. We will limit their ability to do that. We are going to stunt the ability to finance and grow Rus- — the Russian military.

We’re going to impose major — and we’re going to impair their ability to compete in a high-tech 21st century economy.

We’ve already seen the impact of our actions on Russia’s currency, the Ruble, which early today hit its weakest level ever — ever in history. And the Russian stock market plunged today. The Russian government’s borrowing rate spiked by over 15 percent.

In today’s actions, we have now sanctioned Russian banks that together hold around $1 trillion in assets.

We’ve cut off Russia’s largest bank — a bank that holds more than one third of Russia’s banking assets by itself — cut it off from the U.S. financial system.

And today, we’re also blocking four more major banks. That means every asset they have in America will be frozen. This includes V.T.B., the second-largest bank in Russia, which has $250 billion in assets.

As promised, we’re also adding names to the list of Russian elites and their family members that are sanctioning — that we’re sanctioning as well.

As I said on Tuesday, these are people who personally gain from the Kremlin’s policies and they should share in the pain. We will keep up this drumbeat of those designations against corrupt billionaires in the days ahead.

On Tuesday, we stopped the Russian government from raising money from U.S. or European investors.

Now, we’re going to apply the same restrictions to Russia’s largest state-owned enterprises — companies with assets that exceed $1.4 trillion.

Some of the most powerful impacts of our actions will come over time as we squeeze Russia’s access to finance and technology for strategic sectors of its economy and degrade its industrial capacity for years to come.

Between our actions and those of our Allies and partners, we estimate that we’ll cut off more than half of Russia’s high-tech imports.

It will strike a blow to their ability to continue to modernize their military. It’ll degrade their aerospace industry, including their space program. It will hurt their ability to build ships, reducing their ability to compete economically. And it will be a major hit to Putin’s long-term strategic ambitions.

And we’re preparing to do more. In addition to the economic penalties we’re imposing, we’re also taking steps to defend our NATO Allies, particularly in the east.

Tomorrow, NATO will convene a summit — we’ll be there — to bring together the leaders of 30 Allied nations and close partners to affirm our solidarity and to map out the next steps we will take to further strengthen all aspects of our NATO Alliance.

Although we provided over $650 million in defensive assistance to Ukraine just this year — this last year, let me say it again: Our forces are not and will not be engaged in the conflict with Russia in Ukraine. Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine but to defend our NATO Allies and reassure those Allies in the east.

As I made crystal clear, the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of American power. And the good news is: NATO is more united and more determined than ever.

There is no doubt — no doubt that the United States and every NATO Ally will meet our Article 5 commitments, which says that an attack on one is an attack on all.

Over the past few weeks, I ordered thousands of additional forces to Germany and Poland as part of our commitment to NATO.

On Tuesday, in response to Russia’s aggressive action, including its troop presence in Belarus and the Black Sea, I’ve authorized the deployment of ground and air forces already stationed in Europe to NATO’s eastern flank Allies: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Romania.

Our Allies have also been stepping up, adding — the other Allies, the rest of NATO — adding their own forces and capabilities to ensure our collective defense.

And today, within hours of Russia’s unleashing its assault, NATO came together and authorized and activated — an activation of response plans.

This will enable NATO’s high-readiness forces to deploy and — when and where they’re needed to protect our NATO Allies on the eastern boundaries of Europe.

And now I’m authorizing additional U.S. forces and capabilities to deploy to Germany as part of NATO’s response, including some of U.S.-based forces that the Department of Defense placed on standby weeks ago.

I’ve also spoken with Defense Secretary Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Milley, about preparations for additional moves should they become necessary to protect our NATO Allies and support the greatest military Alliance in the history of the world — NATO.

As we respond, my administration is using the tools — every tool at our disposal to protect American families and businesses from rising prices at the gas pump.

You know, we’re taking active steps to bring down the costs. And American oil and gas companies should not — should not exploit this moment to hike their prices to raise profits.

You know, in our sanctions package, we specifically designed to allow energy payments to continue.

We are closely monitoring energy supplies for any disruption. We have been coordinating with major oil producing and consuming countries toward our common interest to secure global energy supplies.

We are actively working with countries around the world to elevate [evaluate] a collective release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserves of major energy-consuming countries. And the United States will release additional barrels of oil as conditions warrant.

I know this is hard and that Americans are already hurting. I will do everything in my power to limit the pain the American people are feeling at the gas pump. This is critical to me.

But this aggression cannot go unanswered. If it did, the consequences for America would be much worse. America stands up to bullies. We stand up for freedom. This is who we are.

Let me also repeat the warning I made last week: If Russia pursues cyberattacks against our companies, our critical infrastructure, we are prepared to respond.

For months, we have been working closely with our private — with the private sector to harden their cyber defenses, sharpen our ability to respond to Russian cyberattacks as well.

I spoke late last night to President Zelenskyy of Ukraine and I assured him that the United States, together with our Allies and partners in Europe, will support the Ukrainian people as they defend their country. We’ll provide humanitarian relief to ease their suffering.

And in the early days of this conflict, Russian propaganda outlets will keep trying to hide the truth and claim success for its military operation against a made-up threat.

But history has shown time and again how swift gains in territory eventually give way to grinding occupations, acts of mass civil — mass civil disobedience, and strategic dead-ends.

The next few weeks and months will be hard on the people of Ukraine. Putin has unleashed a great pain on them. But the Ukrainian people have known 30 years of independence, and they have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.

This is a dangerous moment for all of Europe, for the freedom around the world. Putin has a — has committed an assault on the very principles that uphold global peace.

But now the entire world sees clearly what Putin and his Kremlin — and his Kremlin allies are really all about. This was never about genuine security concerns on their part. It was always about naked aggression, about Putin’s desire for empire by any means necessary — by bullying Russia’s neighbors through coercion and corruption, by changing borders by force, and, ultimately, by choosing a war without a cause.

Putin’s actions betray his sinister vision for the future of our world — one where nations take what they want by force.

But it is a vision that the United States and freedom-loving nations everywhere will oppose with every tool of our considerable power.

The United States and our Allies and partners will emerge from this stronger, more united, more determined, and more purposeful.

And Putin’s aggression against Ukraine will end up costing Russia dearly — economically and strategically. We will make sure of that. Putin will be a pariah on the international stage. Any nation that countenances Russia’s naked aggression against Ukraine will be stained by association.

When the history of this era is written, Putin’s choice to make a totally unjustifiable war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger.

Liberty, democracy, human dignity — these are the forces far more powerful than fear and oppression. They cannot be extinguished by tyrants like Putin and his armies. They cannot be erased by people — from people’s hearts and hopes by any amount of violence and intimidation. They endure.

And in the contest between democracy and autocracy, between sovereignty and subjugation, make no mistake: Freedom will prevail.

God bless the people of a free and democratic Ukraine. And may God protect our troops.

Q President Biden —

Q Chris Megerian. So, do you have any plans to speak with President Putin at this point? And what interactions have you had with the Russian government?

THE PRESIDENT: I heard the first part: Do I have any plans to speak with Putin at this point. And what?

Q What communications have you had with the Kremlin as far as military (inaudible) in Ukraine and making sure this does not spiral into a larger conflict?

THE PRESIDENT: Well, it’s a large conflict already. The way we’re going to assure it’s not going to spiral to a larger conflict is by providing all the forces needed in the Eastern European nations that are members of NATO. NATO is more united than it’s ever been.

And I have no plans to talk with Putin.

Wall Street Journal, Tarina [Tarini].

Q Mr. President, you didn’t mention SWIFT in your sanctions that you announced. Is there a reason why the U.S. isn’t doing that? Is there disagreement among Allies regarding SWIFT and whether Russia should be allowed to be a part of it?

THE PRESIDENT: The sanctions that we have proposed on all their banks is of equal consequence — maybe more consequence than SWIFT — number one.

Number two, it is always an option. But right now, that’s not the position that the rest of Europe wishes to take.

Cecilia Ve- — Vega, ABC.

Q Thank you, sir. Sir, sanctions clearly have not been enough to deter Vladimir Putin to this point. What is going to stop him? How and when does this end? And do you see him trying to go beyond Ukraine?

And a second question I’ll just give to you now: This statement that he gave last night will — that the We- — the threat that he gave — the West “will face consequences greater than any you have faced in history.” Is he threatening a nuclear strike?

THE PRESIDENT: I have no idea what he’s threatening. I know what he has done, number one.

And number two, no one expected the sanctions to prevent anything from happening. That has to sh- — this is going to take time. And we have to show resolve so he knows what’s coming and so the people of Russia know what he’s brought on them. That’s what this is all about.

This is going to take time. It’s not going to occur — he’s going to say, “Oh my God, these sanctions are coming. I’m going to stand down.”

He’s going to test the resolve of the West to see if we stay together. And we will. We will and it will impose significant costs on him.

Q Will he go beyond Ukraine, sir? Do you see him going beyond Ukraine?

Q Mr. President — Mr. President —

THE PRESIDENT: (Points to reporter.) Yes.

Q Thank you. Two topics, just really quick. First, markets are down and gas prices are up. I know you always stress the difference between Wall Street and Main Street, but everybody seems to be in for some economic pain. How economically painful is it going to get for people in this country?

And I do have one more question.

THE PRESIDENT: First of all, there’s no doubt that when a major nuclear power attacks and invades another country that the world is going to respond and markets are going to respond all over the world. So, there’s no doubt about that, number one.

Number two, the notion that this is going to last for a long time is highly unlikely, as long as we continue to stay resolved in imposing the sanctions we’re going to impose on Russia, period.

What’s your next question? I’m sorry.

Q The next question is: Did you underestimate Putin? And would you still describe him the way that you did in the summer, as a “worthy adversary”?

THE PRESIDENT: At the time, he was — I made it clear he was an adversary, and I said he was “worthy.” I didn’t underestimate him.

And I’ve read most of everything he’s written. Did you read the — I shouldn’t sa- — I’m not being a wise guy. The — you heard the speech he made — almost an hour’s worth of speeches — why he was going into Ukraine.

He has much larger ambitions in Ukraine. He wants to, in fact, reestablish the former Soviet Union. That’s what this is about.

And I think that his — his ambitions are — are completely contrary to the place where the rest of the world has arrived.

Q President Biden — President Biden —

Q And — and with that — with his ambitions, you’re confident that these devastating sanctions are going to be as devastating as Russian missiles and bullets and tanks?

THE PRESIDENT: Yes. Russian bullets, missiles, and tanks in Ukraine. Yes, I am.

Q Thank you, President Biden. If sanctions cannot stop President Putin, what penalty can?

THE PRESIDENT: I didn’t say sanctions couldn’t stop him.

Q But you’ve been talking about the threat of these sanctions for several weeks now —

THE PRESIDENT: Yes, but the threat of the sanctions and imposing the sanctions and seeing the effect of the sanctions are two different things.

Q Okay, but —

THE PRESIDENT: They’re two different things. And we’re now going to — he’s going to begin to see the effect of the sanctions.

Q And what will that do — how will that change his mindset here, given he’s attacking Ukraine as we speak?

THE PRESIDENT: Because it will so weaken his country that he’ll have to make a very, very difficult choices of whether to continue to move toward being a second-rate power or, in fact, respond.

Q You said, in recent weeks, that big nations cannot bluff when it comes to something like this. You recently said that the idea of personally sanctioning President Putin was on the table. Is that a step that you’re prepared to take? And if not —

THE PRESIDENT: It’s not a bluff; it’s on the table.

Q Sanctioning President Putin?

THE PRESIDENT: Yes.

Q Why not sanction him today, sir? Why not sanction him today, sir?

Q Mr. President —

Q Mr. President, if I can, you detailed some severe and swift new sanctions today and said the impact it will have over time, but given the full-scale invasion, given that you’re not pursuing disconnecting Russia from what’s called “SWIFT” — the international banking system — or other sanctions at your disposal, respectfully, sir, what more are you waiting for?

THE PRESIDENT: Specifically, the sanctions we’ve imposed exceed SWIFT. The sanctions we imposed exceed anything that’s ever been done. The sanctions we imposed have generated two thirds of the world joining us. They are profound sanctions. Let’s have a conversation in another month or so to see if they’re working.

Yes.

Q Let me ask you about — can I ask you about Zelenskyy? Sir, you spoke to Volodymyr Zelenskyy yesterday, sir, if I could follow up —

Q What’s the risk that we are watching the beginning of another Cold War? And is there now a complete rupture in U.S. and Russian relations?

THE PRESIDENT: There is a complete rupture right now in U.S.-Russian relations if they continue on this path that they’re on.

And in terms of a Cold War, that depends. You have the vast majority of the rest of the world in total opposition to what he’s doing — from Asia to South America to Europe to acr- — around the world.

And so, it’s going to be a cold day for Russia. The idea — you don’t see a whole lot of people coming to his defense.

Q And are you — are you — if I could follow-up, sir. Are you urging China to help isolate Russia? Are you urging China to help isolate Russia?

THE PRESIDENT: I’m not prepared to comment on that at the moment.

(Cross-talk by reporters.)

Q Mr. President —

THE PRESIDENT: Wait. No, no. (Points to reporter.) Yeah.

No, no, no. He’s had his hand up a long time.

Q Thank you, Mr. President. How concerned are you that Putin wants to go beyond Ukraine into other countries and the U.S. will have to get involved if he moves into NATO countries?

THE PRESIDENT: Well, if he did move into NATO countries, he will be involved — we will be involved. The only thing that I’m convinced of is: If we don’t stop now, he’ll be emboldened. If we don’t move against him now with these significant sanctions, he will be emboldened.

Look, you know, every — well, anyway.

Q And can you talk anything more about your conversation —

(Cross-talk by reporters.)

THE PRESIDENT: I’m sorry, I can’t hear you.

Q Sir, India, which is a major defense partner of the United States — is India with — fully with you on the issue of Ukraine and Russia?

THE PRESIDENT: Does the Defense Department of the United States —

Q Sir, India is one of your major defense partners. Is India fully in sync with United States on Russia?

THE PRESIDENT: We’re going to be — we’re in consultation with — with India today. We haven’t resolved that completely.

Q One more question —

(Cross-talk by reporters.)

THE PRESIDENT: Okay, thank you all very much. Thank you.
