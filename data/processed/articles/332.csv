A huge Russian military convoy that had been stationed outside the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, since last week appears to have dispersed, according to a United States-based company, as the city braces for a possible ground assault.

Maxar Technologies said satellite images taken on Thursday showed that the 64km (40 miles) long line of vehicles, tanks and artillery has broken up and been redeployed.

The company said the images showed armoured units manoeuvring in and through the surrounding towns close to the Antonov airport, northwest of Kyiv.

Some of the vehicles have moved into forests, Maxar reported.

It added that images also show convoy elements further north have repositioned near the town of Lubyanka with towed artillery howitzers in firing positions nearby.

The convoy had massed outside the city early last week, but its advance appeared to have stalled amid reports of food and fuel shortages.

Al Jazeera’s Imran Khan, reporting from Kyiv, said the vehicles in the convoy were changing positions but it was not clear whether they were being redeployed or securing supply lines.

“We don’t know [if] they are moving to other parts and are strengthening other offensives that might be going on or whether they are trying to secure supply lines for an entry into Kyiv in the coming days,” he said. “It is a significant change of tactic if they are redeploying them elsewhere but if they are resupplying them, that could suggest they are getting for an offensive into Kyiv.”

Some analysts have said this week Russia was gradually overcoming logistical issues and was preparing for a ground assault on the capital.

On Wednesday, the Institute for the Study of War said Russian forces “continued concentrating in the eastern, northwestern and western outskirts of Kyiv for an assault on the Ukrainian capital in the coming 24-96 hours”.

The convoy’s redeployment comes amid reports that Russian forces have reached the northeastern edge of Kyiv, where suburbs including Irpin and Bucha have endured days of heavy bombardment.

Ukrainian soldiers there described fierce fighting for control of the main highway leading into the capital, and the AFP news agency reported seeing missile attacks in Velyka Dymerka just outside Kyiv’s city limits.

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said the capital had now been “transformed into a fortress”.

“Every street, every house … is being fortified,” he told Ukrainian television. “Even people who in their lives never intended to change their clothes, now they are in uniform with machine guns in their hands.”

He added that about two million people – half the population of the metropolitan area – have left the capital. “From our information, one in two Kyiv residents has left the city,” he said.

Western officials said Russian forces have made little progress on the ground in recent days and are seeing heavier losses and stiffer Ukrainian resistance than Moscow apparently anticipated.

But Russian President Vladimir Putin’s forces have used airpower and artillery to pummel Ukraine’s cities.

The 15-day conflict has killed and wounded thousands of people and displaced millions.

The satellite intel comes as a US defense official tells the media that Russia forces have begun making progress toward the capital, after having appeared to stall for the last week.

The official says that the US expects the Russians to eventually overcome initial logistical challenges to mount a full-scale attack on the city, CNN reports.

“You’re starting to see a little bit of that happening in just the last 24 as they begin to creep a little closer towards Kyiv from the northwest,” the official says.

Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko says half the city’s population has fled, adding that the city “has been transformed into a fortress. Every street, every building, every checkpoint has been fortified.”

On Kyiv’s northeastern edge, Ukrainian soldiers describe a night of fierce fighting for control of the main highway leading into the capital.

Satellite images taken on March 10 show that a Russian military convoy on the way to Kyiv, which was more than 64 km long, has largely dispersed and redeployed, the Reuters news agency said, citing U.S. satellite imagery company Maxar.

Earlier, the Russian convoy was spotted to the north-west of Kyiv near Antonov airport in Hostomel. According to Maxar, the satellite images show that some elements of the convoy have “moved” into forests and forested areas near the village of Lubyanka, north of Hostomel. Specifically, the equipment moved there seems to be mostly towed artillery and other vehicles.

Maxar images also captured several fuel trucks and equipment, resembling multiple launch rocket systems, in a field near the village of Berestyanka - 16 km from Antonov Airport.

On March 4, CNN, citing a Pentagon source, reported that the multi-kilometer convoy had stalled about 15 miles (about 25 km) north of Kyiv, due to direct attacks by the Ukrainian armed forces and because a bridge had been destroyed.

The U.S. defense official told CNN that Russian troops from the column are redeploying so as to better strike the Ukrainian capital.

New satellite views from space show the Russian military moving towards Kyiv, Ukraine on Friday (March 11), including images of a battalion firing upon the besieged capital.

Muzzle flashes and smoke are visible in some of the satellite images obtained by Maxar's WorldView-2 satellite, which has been watching the invasion of Ukraine by Russia since Feb. 24 and producing high-above views of the conflict.

Russia has faced international condemnation and sanctions for its actions, especially in the space sector, where many partnerships have dissolved or frayed.

The heavy bombardment from Russia is ""a war of annihilation"" upon Ukraine, the besieged country's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said in a New York Times report Saturday (March 12).

Firing is particularly heavy in the suburbs of the capital, Kyiv, which has been fighting off troops for three weeks; shelling was particularly intense in Irpin and Bucha on the northwest rim of the capital, the Times said.

However, Ukraine's military reported that is has been able to stop the Russian advance, inducing ""heavy losses in manpower and equipment."" While the Times could not directly verify Ukraine's claim, military experts and the Washington, D.C.-based Institute for the Study of War think tank have produced similar analyses, the Times said.

WorldView-2, in line with local reports from the Times, shows evidence of homes and other buildings set on fire by the military activity. Impact craters and other damage are visible in satellite images from Moschun and Chernihiv, which are northwest and northeast of Kyiv respectively.

A notorious 40-mile (64-km) convoy seen northwest of Kyiv in recent days appears to be dispersing and moving to other areas, the fresh photos show, as the Times reported ground forces in Ukraine sending anti-tank missiles towards the group. The photos also show the effects of recent attacks on the Chernobyl nuclear power facility and Antonov Airport, and cars filled with people fleeing Kyiv.

The United Nations estimates more than 2.5 million refugees are in neighboring countries, with 1.85 million ""internally displaced"" within Ukraine and 12.65 million ""directly affected by the conflict."" Ukraine's estimated 2021 population is 43.7 million, according to the CIA Factbook.
