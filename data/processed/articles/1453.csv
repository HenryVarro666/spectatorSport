The United Nations is still not aware of any biological weapons programme being conducted in Ukraine, the senior disarmament official told the Security Council today, responding to fresh allegations by the Russian Federation of the existence of such research.

Izumi Nakamitsu, United Nations Under-Secretary-General and High Representative for Disarmament Affairs, addressed the Council at the outset of the emergency session, as several of its 15 members denounced the meeting as a “charade” and “not worthy of a permanent member of the Security Council”.

Referring to the Russian Federation’s circulation of fresh documents alleging the existence of biological weapons programmes in Ukraine, she said the United Nations has neither the mandate nor the capacity to investigate such allegations. Reiterating her statement before the Council at a similar meeting on 11 March, she stressed that the United Nations is not aware of any such biological weapons programme in Ukraine (see Press Release SC/14827). She added that both the Russian Federation and Ukraine are States parties to the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, which effectively prohibits the development, production, acquisition, transfer, stockpiling and use of biological and toxin weapons.

The representative of the Russian Federation, outlining his delegation’s newly circulated documents, said evidence of dangerous biological weapons projects — carried out in Ukraine, and supported by the United States — was recently discovered in the course of his country’s special military operation. On 11 March, when confronted by similar evidence, the delegate of the United States was not able to explain documented proof of a 2005 agreement signed between United States and Ukrainian ministers, which laid out support for joint biological research on Ukrainian territory.

Over the last week, he said, new details have come to light, namely that the components for biological weapons were being created on Ukrainian territory. Citing proof of direct United States funding to Ukraine amounting to $32 million, he said the new documents refute United State assertions that it does not operate any biological laboratories in Ukraine. “The facts show otherwise,” he said, noting that Ukrainian authorities gave the United States carte blanche to carry out dangerous experiments on its territory in return for free travel to international conferences. Those included studies into Crimean-Congo Fever, leptospirosis and other dangerous pathogens, whose use could be easily dressed up as “naturally occurring”. “We are talking about more and more proof that, at the heart of Central Europe, a dangerous biological operation was being carried out,” he stressed, warning that the new evidence is “only the tip of the iceberg” and pledging to keep the global community informed as more facts emerge.

Responding to those allegations, the representative of the United States recalled that the Council already heard a similar “tirade of bizarre conspiracy theories” at its 11 March meeting. Today, the Russian Federation’s claims sound as if they were forwarded through a chain email from “some dark corner of the Internet”. As she said on 11 March, Ukraine does not have a biological weapons programme, but only hosts public health facilities that are proudly supported by the United States, the World Health Organization (WHO) and other Governments and international institutions. Moreover, she expressed grave concern that today’s fresh allegations could be part of a Russian “false flag effort in action”, warning that Moscow could then use biological or chemical weapons against Ukrainians.

The United Kingdom’s delegate, recalling that just yesterday the Council discussed the devastating humanitarian situation in Ukraine, said today it is hearing yet another “rehash of amateurish information that we discussed and debunked last Friday”. “It was nonsense then, and it is nonsense now,” she said, adding that the real threat to international peace and security is the ongoing Russian aggression. Describing today’s charade as “not worthy of a permanent member of the Security Council”, she urged Moscow to urgently end its invasion of Ukraine.

The representative of Gabon was among other Council members who expressed concern about the worsening crisis in Ukraine, as well as the grave tenor of today’s meeting, while noting that no new facts have been raised since the 11 March meeting on the same topic. All States parties must abide by the terms of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, of which Gabon is also a member, he said, reiterating his country’s repeated calls for the parties to engage in negotiations in good faith in order to bring an end to the war, whose consequences are already being felt far beyond Ukraine.

China’s representative struck a different tone, emphasizing that any information on biological military activities should trigger “high concern” by the international community. Urging the relevant parties to take a responsible approach, he encouraged those mentioned in the Russian Federation’s new evidence to respond to questions raised and offer timely, comprehensive clarifications to assuage the international community’s doubts. “We do not consider it too much to ask,” he said, while cautioning against the use of any double standards.

Also speaking today were representatives of Albania, Ireland, France, Ghana, Brazil, Kenya, Norway, India, Mexico and the United Arab Emirates.

The Council last discussed the issue of alleged biological materials in Ukraine in a meeting on 11 March.

United States-Ukraine agreement

Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia, told the Council that his delegation is in possession of new evidence of a United States-Ukrainian agreement to conduct biological weapons research on Ukrainian territory, dating back as far as 2005.

He has circulated proof of that agreement to the Council, he said, including signed evidence of direct US funding to Ukraine, amounting to $32 million.

While the US continues to assert that the country does not operate in any biological laboratories in Ukraine, “the facts show otherwise”, he said, claiming that Ukrainian authorities in fact gave the US permission to carry out dangerous experiments in return for free travel to international conferences.

Today’s evidence points to studies conducted on Crimean-Congo Fever, leptospirosis and other dangerous pathogens, he said.

He also cited proof of studies into how such illnesses could pass from bats into humans, adding that use of biological weapons could be “easily dressed up as naturally occurring.”

‘Bizarre conspiracy theories’

Responding to those allegations, US Ambassador, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, recalled that the Council already heard a “tirade of bizarre conspiracy theories” on biological weapons at its meeting a week ago.

“There are no such labs, not near Russia’s border, not anywhere,” she said.

Instead, Ukraine hosts several public health facilities, proudly supported by the United States, the World Health Organization (WHO) and other Governments and international institutions.

She voiced deep concern that Friday’s meeting could represent a “potential false flag effort in action,” warning of the possibility that Moscow is planning to use chemical or biological agents against Ukrainians.

Describing the new allegations as a sign of desperation, she declared: “This meeting is a result of [Russia’s] isolation on this Council, and on the world stage.”

Biological Weapons Convention

Reiterating her response to similar allegations raised on 11 March, High Representative Nakamitsu, emphasized that the UN has neither the mandate not the capacity to investigate such claims, which fall under the auspices of 1972 Biological Weapons Convention.

The treaty - to which both Ukraine and the Russian Federation are party - effectively prohibits the development, production, acquisition, transfer, stockpiling and use of biological and toxin weapons.

Against the backdrop of the latest allegations, she outlined several possible courses of action for resolving inter-State conflicts under that Convention, which include the possible convening of a consultative meeting.

“The UN Office for Disarmament Affairs stands ready to support any procedures under the Biological Weapons Convention that States Parties may decide to use,” she said.

Update on nuclear plants

Turning to the issue of the safety and security of Ukraine’s nuclear power facilities, the disarmament chief said the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported that according to the Ukrainian authorities, all safety systems at the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant remained fully functional as of 17 March.

While officials from the Russian Federation’s State nuclear power company were present at the facilities in southern Ukraine, Ukrainian staff continue to operate the plant.

Meanwhile, the Chornobyl plant remains connected to the national electricity grid, following reconnection on 14 March.

However, Ms. Nakamitsu raised concerns that Ukrainian operators and guards have not been able to rotate for three weeks, and IAEA is still not receiving remote data transmission from its monitoring systems installed at the Chornobyl.",https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/03/1114272

Mister President,

Distinguished Members of the Security Council,

I am aware that the Russian Federation has submitted documents regarding allegations of biological weapons programmes in Ukraine.

As I informed the Council last Friday, the United Nations is not aware of any such biological weapons programmes.

I would also like to note that the United Nations currently has neither the mandate nor the technical or operational capacity to investigate this information.

As I previously informed the Council, the relevant instrument of international law is the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention, which effectively prohibits the development, production, acquisition, transfer, stockpiling and use of biological and toxin weapons.

The Russian Federation and Ukraine are both States Parties to the Biological Weapons Convention.

Mister President,

The Biological Weapons Convention contains several measures to which concerned States Parties can have recourse in order to address situations in which they have concerns or suspicions about the activities of their peers.

Pursuant to Article V of the Convention, its States Parties undertake to consult one another and to co-operate in solving any problems.

Such consultation and cooperation can take place on a bilateral basis between the concerned States Parties, or it can be undertaken through appropriate international procedures.

One such international procedure that has been elaborated within the framework of the Biological Weapons Convention is the convening of a consultative meeting.

Other possibilities for addressing concerns between States Parties also exist under Article V of the Convention, as well as under Article VI.

As I mentioned last week, the BWC needs to be operationalized and institutionalized to ensure it is properly equipped and resourced to face future challenges. The Convention’s upcoming Ninth Review Conference presents the ideal opportunity for its States Parties to comprehensively strengthen the Convention.

The UN Office for Disarmament Affairs stands ready to support any procedures under the Biological Weapons Convention that States Parties may decide to use.

Mister President,

Turning to the issue of the safety and security of Ukraine’s nuclear power facilities, the Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency has reported that according to the Ukrainian authorities, all safety systems at the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant remained fully functional as of yesterday, following the site’s loss of connection to a third external power line linking it to the national electricity grid.

Although officials from Russia’s state nuclear power company were present at the facilities in southern Ukraine, Ukrainian staff continue to operate the plant.

The Chornobyl power plant remains connected to the national electricity grid, following reconnection on 14 March. However, Ukrainian operators and guards have not been able to rotate for three weeks.

The IAEA has reported that, according to the Ukrainian authorities, eight of the country’s 15 reactors remained operating.

I understand that, regarding nuclear safeguards, the IAEA is still not receiving remote data transmission from its monitoring systems installed at the Chornobyl, but such data was being transferred to IAEA headquarters from the other nuclear power plants in Ukraine.

I take this opportunity to reiterate the Secretary-General’s support for efforts by the IAEA to establish a framework on the safety and security of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities and urge all parties to work towards this end.

Mister President,

I wish also to highlight the terrible toll this conflict is having on civilians. The civilian casualties continue to rise: as of 16 March, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights had recorded 2,032 civilian casualties, including 780 killed of whom 58 were children.

The actual number of casualties is believed to be much higher.

Most of these casualties are caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area.

These include attacks using heavy artillery, multiple-launch rocket systems, ballistic and cruise missiles, and air strikes.

I also want to reiterate that attacks directed at civilians are prohibited by international humanitarian law.

We must find a diplomatic solution to this war to put an end to the violence.

As Secretary-General Guterres said, and I quote: “We need an immediate cessation of hostilities and serious negotiations based on the principles of the UN Charter and international law.

We need peace. Peace for the people of Ukraine. Peace for the world. We need peace now.” I thank you very much for your attention.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/high-representative-s-briefing-security-council-threats-international-peace-and

Instead, tomorrow morning, we will ask for an emergency meeting to discuss again the issue of US bio laboratories in Ukraine, using the new documents we obtained in the course of the special military operation,"" Russian Permanent Representative to the United Nations Vassily Nebenzia said during a Security Council meeting on Thursday.

I also thank Ms Nakamitsu for her briefing today.

Mr President,

Only yesterday, this Council discussed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. We heard from UN briefers about the devastating impacts on Ukraine, its people and its cities. On the region, to which 3 million refugees have fled. And on the wider international community, facing higher economic prices, and the consequences for countries in need of this Council’s attention.

Today however, we’ve had a rehash of amateurish disinformation, which we discussed and debunked last Friday.

It was nonsense then, and it is nonsense now.

As I said then – laboratories in Ukraine carrying out research on public health hazards are not a threat to international peace and security.

By contrast, President Putin’s illegal and inhumane invasion of Ukraine is the most significant threat to international peace and security we face today.

So today’s charade is really not worthy of a Permanent Member of the UN Security Council.

The only thing this Council needs to hear from the Russian Federation - we didn’t hear it yesterday, we haven’t heard it today – the only thing this Council needs to hear is that Russia’s troops are leaving Ukraine.

Ukraine does not want war. Russians and Ukrainians – soldiers, civilians, mothers, children - are dying.

Russia is isolated diplomatically, isolated economically and bogged down in Ukraine.

So we urge Russia to stop this invasion now, before any more damage is done in Ukraine – and also to Russia.

I thank you, Mr President.",https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/nonsense-then-and-nonsense-now-uk-statement-at-the-security-council
5,07eb03e5-195a-402f-84ba-4714ffd2e15a,[],,"Mr. President,

China has stated its position on the Ukraine issue many times. Under the current situation, it is the shared desire of the international community to achieve a ceasefire as soon as possible to avoid more civilian casualties and to prevent a massive humanitarian crisis, which is also what China is hoping for. Direct negotiations between the parties concerned are the fundamental way to solve the problem. Russia and Ukraine have held four rounds of negotiations. With the negotiations continuing, there is hope for a ceasefire and a peaceful future. China will continue to facilitate dialogues for peace. We support the UN and all parties in ramping up mediation efforts, and hope that all parties can do more that are conducive to promoting peace talks, rather than adding fuel to the fire. Behind the Ukraine crisis is the issue of European security. It is our hope that the United States, the European Union and NATO can sit down with Russia for in-depth and comprehensive dialogues and explore ways to put in place a balanced, effective and sustainable European security mechanism based on the principle of indivisible security, so as to achieve lasting peace and stability in Europe.

China's position on weapons of mass destruction and biological security is consistent and clear. China stands for the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of all weapons of mass destruction, including biological and chemical weapons. China resolutely opposes the development, possession or use of biological and chemical weapons by any country under any circumstance, and urges countries that have not done so to destroy their chemical weapons stockpiles as soon as possible. Complying with the Biological Weapons Convention is the obligation of all state parties. We call for early negotiations on the establishment of a BWC verification regime, which will help improve the global biosecurity.

China was once a victim of chemical and biological weapons. China believes that any information and lead on biological military activities should trigger heightened concern and attention of the international community to avoid irreparable harm. In this regard, relevant parties should take a responsible approach. Russia has further revealed the newly discovered relevant documents. The party concerned should respond to questions, and offer timely and comprehensive clarifications to remove the doubts of the international community. We do not consider it too much to ask. And on this issue, no double standards should be applied.

Thank you, Mr. President.",https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjb_663304/zwjg_665342/zwbd_665378/202203/t20220319_10653201.html
