The Russian Defense Ministry reported that Russian military allegedly used hypersonic missiles Kinzhal and a coastal missile system Bastion on targets in Ukraine.

The Ministry’s spokesperson, Major General Igor Konashenkov, said at the morning briefing that the Russian armed forces destroyed an underground ammunition depot in the Ivano-Frankivsk region using a hypersonic missile Kinzhal. According to him, the Bastion coastal missile system also destroyed electronic intelligence centers of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Odesa region.

Earlier, Konashenkov reported that Russian forces struck an aircraft repair plant in Lviv and ammunition and military equipment depots on outskirts of Mykolaiv and Voznesensk.

Ukraine has confirmed that Russian troops struck an underground missiles and aviation ammunition depot in Delyatyn, Ivano-Frankivsk region.

Yuriy Ignat, a spokesman for the Ukrainian Air Force Command, noted: ""Indeed, the enemy struck our storage depot. The type of missile is still be confirmed. We have damage, we have destruction. Some ammunition has detonated. The number of victims is being determined.""

""Ukraine, unfortunately, has become a testing ground for the entire arsenal of Russia's missiles. They use missiles with ranges of two thousand kilometers, five and a half thousand kilometers. These are operational-tactical missiles Iskander, cruise missiles Kalibr and others such as Kh-101, Kh-55, Kh-555. There was a statement about the Kinzhal being used, which the Russians are bragging about. We don't know what the missile was. We cannot confirm it yet,"" Yuriy Ignat said.

According to British intelligence, Russia, having failed to achieve its original goals, has changed its tactics in Ukraine. Now Russian troops are moving to trench warfare of attrition, which will entail an increase in the number of victims and an intensification of the humanitarian crisis.

The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making “the most important decision of their life -- to fight.”

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.”

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the major developments on Russia's invasion, how Kyiv is fighting back, the plight of civilians, and Western reaction. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.

Zelenskiy noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.”

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

The first final is an unconditional total defeat of one of the parties. This is what the Russians wanted to impose on us from the very beginning, The second final is an agreement. The agreement is a search and fixation of mutually acceptable solutions,"" said the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine.

The United States is also not very optimistic: Blinken admitted that the states do not see any signs that Putin is ready to stop. At the moment, Russia and its leader, Vladimir Putin, show no signs of participating in responsible talks and ending Russia's bloody aggression against Ukraine.

Who's coming to Ukraine?

About financial aid, weapons, and volunteer fighters

The supply of US weapons to Ukraine lasts once a day or once every two days, and additional military aid will be transferred just as quickly, Psaki said.

The G7 foreign ministers agreed to increase humanitarian aid to Ukraine and called on other states to do so.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg also promised to continue supplying NATO weapons to Ukraine.

Infrastructure

The President of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine Zahorodnii addressed the leadership of the International Association of Academies of Sciences: ""The fire of Russian aircraft and artillery erases peaceful cities from the face of the earth, destroys civilian infrastructure: kindergartens, schools, hospitals, residential buildings. The bombing killed civilians and innocent children. Objects of scientific infrastructure, in particular the institutes of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Sumy, and other cities of Ukraine, were also affected by the Russian shelling,"" the document reads.

It should be noted that the International Association of Academies of Sciences has not reacted in any way to the tragic events in Ukraine since the beginning of the Russian military invasion.

Gazprom is using Ukrainian gas pipelines at full capacity, according to the Ukrainian gas transportation system. Through Ukraine, the company sends more than 105 million cubic meters of gas per day.

For comparison, in January Gazprom reduced the daily volume of gas transit through Ukraine to Europe to about 50 million cubic meters. This is the lowest figure since January 2020. This has led to a jump in energy prices.

Peaceful atom

Ukraine expects more decisive action from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on Russians seizing nuclear facilities in Ukraine. This was stated by Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko on the air of the Priamyi TV channel.

""We would like clearer signals, clearer actions. In the context of what we expect: first, all troops must leave nuclear facilities.

Russian lies don't get tired

Employees of the Center for Combating Disinformation at the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine collected a selection of fresh fakes, manipulations, and disinformation ""throws"" that the enemy produced during March 17, 2022:

The head of the radiation, chemical, and biological protection forces of the Russian Armed Forces held a briefing on US bio laboratories in Ukraine that infected birds with viruses and studied the ways of their migration to the territory of the Russian Armed Forces. Fake!

The network of photos and videos of rescued orphans is accompanied by a call to ""adopt them quickly"" and the readiness of the Ukrainian authorities to hand them over to ""good hands"". Fake! Ukraine doesn't ""distribute"" orphans . If any assistance is required, this will be officially announced. At present, Ukraine has a simplified procedure, but not adoption, but guardianship or patronage.

Information is spreading on the Internet that the Ukrainian authorities have left Mariupol. Fake! ""Mariupol is a topic №1 for the President and diplomacy.""

The occupiers shot a video allegedly distributing humanitarian aid in Lyptsi, Kharkiv region. ""Pure montage and editing,"" the head of the Kharkiv regional state administration, Sinehubov, reacted to a fake. ""We see provocations when Russian TV channels filmed in Lyptsi, the fact of humanitarian aid distribution, the gym was filmed. There is no such gym in this settlement. This is pure editing with actors who are brought there specifically for comments and a certain picture.""

More great and various sanctions!

In the Netherlands, sanctions have frozen Russian assets by more than 200 million euros, according to Reuters.

Australia has imposed sanctions on 11 Russian banks and government agencies. New Zealand is also imposing sanctions on Russia. The state will freeze the assets of Putin and 12 members of the Security Council.

Japan is also imposing new sanctions on individuals and companies from Russia.

Apple will not sell the new iPhone SE and other devices from the spring presentation in Russia.

Bank of New York Mellon, one of the oldest US banks, has suspended investments in Russian securities and donated $1 million in humanitarian aid to Ukraine

According to Kuleba, the European Union is discussing the preparation of the fifth package of sanctions against Russia for its war against Ukraine.

14:00 – Russian and Belarusian diplomats were banned from entering the buildings of the European Parliament, said Parliament Speaker Roberta Metsola. The occupier and his henchmen are now worse than lepers.

Paramount has ceased operations in Russia. The film company will also donate one million dollars to humanitarian aid to Ukraine.

Lithuania has restricted the export of cash euros to Belarus and Russia. Now, individuals traveling to Belarus or Russia from Lithuania can carry no more than €60 per person.

Korean LG has announced the cessation of all supplies to Russia

Norway has joined several new EU sanctions against Russia. These include personal sanctions, as well as restrictions on the export of technology, goods, and services. Norwegian Foreign Minister Anniken Hewitfeld called the sanctions package the broadest the country has ever adopted.

What's in Russia?

The rating agency S&P downgraded Russia's rating to CC from CCC, as the owners of Russian bonds never received a payment. Russia is separated from the default rating by one step. According to the agency's scale, the CC rating means high vulnerability: the default has not yet occurred but is virtually certain.

The media write that in Russia they cannot print ""rubles"" because the paint and paper were supplied by Canada and Switzerland.

Manufacturers of hygiene products were more cautious. The Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation assures the Russians that pads and diapers will be enough for Russia for as long as 3 months: ""Manufacturers have bought enough raw materials to avoid shortages,"" the ministry said. As you know, now due to the upheaval, these products have disappeared from store shelves in Russia, and hygiene products have risen in price by 40%.

The Russians hope in vain that in three months all sanctions will be lifted.

Mordor threatens Georgia: ""If Georgia refuses to give Russian inspectors access to US Biolabs on its territory, Russia has every right to launch a missile strike on them,"" said Mikhail Aleksandrov, a leading expert at the MGIMO's Center for Military and Political Studies.

In Russia, the demand for antidepressants has quadrupled. From February 28 to March 6, their sales in pharmacies exceeded 525 million rubles, which is more than four times more than a year ago.

This is not surprising, because Russia has already suffered huge losses on all fronts. Ukrainian defenders destroy Russian soldiers. And the sanctions of European countries destroy the remnants of Russia's hopes for a good or at least normal life. The default has technically already taken place. We explain what this means.

""Any cargo that enters the territory of Ukraine, which we consider to be carrying weapons, will become a legitimate target,"" said Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. This is definitely a direct threat to Ukraine's western partners.

Kuleba's immediate reaction was not long in coming: Ukraine's foreign minister said Moscow would not decide what military assistance Ukraine could receive to resist the Russian invasion.

""Russia has never had any claims against the people of Ukraine,"" Lavrov said. Translated into human language: we kill you just because we like it.

Life considering hostilities

The Russian attack on Ukraine: day 21

The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has ceased giving information about the situation in individual lines of defence. The Ukrainian army reports that it has inflicted losses on the aggressor’s troops, and is proceeding with local counterattacks. The Russian forces are mainly focused on strengthening and defending the positions it has already occupied, and are continuing missile & air strikes and shelling. During the last 24 hours, the Russians have intensified the destruction of radio and television signal transmission stations, including some in western Ukraine. They are also continuing to transfer reserves from the Eastern Military District (MD).

In the Polessie direction, there have been sporadic clashes (mainly around Irpin near Kyiv). During the artillery exchanges, the command post and the logistics centre of the Russian 35th Military Army of the Eastern Military District were destroyed. The aggressor introduced its previously accumulated reserves in order to resume the offensive in the Vyshhorod region north of Kyiv. In the Severny direction, Russia has continued centring its units on the eastern outskirts of Kyiv, and new forces have been observed entering the area of ​​Bohdanivka and Velyka Dymerka, which border on the Brovary region. During a firefight in the vicinity of Chernihiv, the defenders destroyed a logistics centre containing ammunition and fuel. Ukrainian units in Sumy oblast attacked the bases of Russian troops in Boromla, Okhtyrka and Velyka Pysarivka.

In the Slobodka direction, fighting is taking place south of Izyum (street battles are taking place in the besieged town), in which the Ukrainian forces are trying to halt the aggressor’s move towards Slavyansk. Kharkiv has been under fire for another day. In the Donetsk direction, the defenders halted a Russian offensive on the western borders of Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts. As a result of the clashes and shelling in Lisichansk, Severodonetsk and Rubizhne, the infrastructure was seriously damaged and there was civilian loss of life. Mariupol has also been bombarded for another day.

In the South Buzhany direction, the aggressor’s forces entered Dnipropetrovsk oblast: fighting took place 35 km south of Kryvyi Rih. The intensity of fighting and shooting in the area of ​​Mykolayiv has decreased. A group of Russian air-supported ships fired at coastal towns southwest of Odesa (Sanzhiyka, Zatoka, Bilenke and Lebedivka), but there were no attempts at landing.

When assessing the Russian losses, the Ukrainian General Staff emphasises that their figures are estimates. As of 24 February, the Russians have allegedly lost c. 14,000 troops, 444 tanks, 1435 armoured vehicles, 201 artillery systems, 72 multiple rocket launchers, 43 air defence systems, 86 aircraft, 108 helicopters, 864 wheeled vehicles, 11 unmanned aerial vehicles and 60 fuel tanks. According to the Russian defence ministry, Ukrainian losses amounted to 181 aircraft and helicopters, 172 unmanned aerial vehicles, 170 anti-aircraft missile launchers, 1379 tanks and other armoured vehicles, 133 multiple missile systems, 514 guns and mortars, as well as 1168 wheeled vehicles.

The Ukrainian authorities have reported that the activity of saboteurs and subversive groups is increasing. The Centre for Counteracting Disinformation warns that people belonging to Russian sabotage groups may have entered from EU countries, and very often use press cards bearing false names. According to the interior ministry, sabotage groups are present in most of Ukraine’s territory, especially in Kyiv and the Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk and Rivne oblasts.

Russian troops are committing more war crimes. 53 civilians were killed in Chernihiv, including 10 people who were queuing for bread. Private houses in Sumy are being demolished and looted. A column of refugees from Mariupol came under artillery fire and seriously injured five people. During an extraordinary session of the North Atlantic Council, Ukrainian defence minister Oleksiy Reznikov confirmed that over the last three weeks the Russian aggressors had killed 103 Ukrainian children, crippled over 100 more, and killed around 3000 civilians. Mariupol’s authorities estimate the loss of the civilian population in their city at around 20,000 people.

The Ukrainian government announced that on 17 March it plans to open nine humanitarian corridors towards Zaporizhzhia, Zhytomyr and Brovary near Kyiv. Field fuel stations for private vehicles are to be set up along these routes. There are plans to deliver humanitarian aid to the towns of Hostomel and Bucha. On 16 March, 6426 people came from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia, including 2039 children. More evacuation trains have been introduced along routes from Kharkiv to Lviv, Kharkiv to Uzhhorod, Dnipro to Lviv and Kramatorsk to Lviv. It should be expected that the Russians will continue to hinder the evacuation of the civilian population and shell these routes. The mayor of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov, who had been kidnapped by Russian forces, was released in exchange for nine Russian prisoners of war who, according to the Ukrainian side, were inexperienced soldiers from the autumn draft.

According to the energy ministry, the war has led to 933,000 people being cut off from electricity, and damage to 38 compressor stations, which has cut off gas supplies to 254,000 recipients. At the same time, on 16 March, the grid operators of continental European countries associated in ENTSO-E agreed to start a trial synchronisation of the European power grid with those of Ukraine and Moldova.

The Border Guard of the Republic of Poland reported that 1.95 million people had entered Poland from Ukraine as of 24 February. On 16 March, 60,000 refugees crossed into the country (down by 11% compared to the previous day). The Ukrainian border service reported that as of 24 February, over 310,000 people, mostly men, have returned to Ukraine to defend the country.

The Russian-Ukrainian talks have still not brought any breakthroughs, and the parties are issuing contradictory messages. The representative of the Ukrainian president’s office, Mykhailo Podolyak, expressed his concern that the Russian side “wants to gain time to prepare the next phase of the offensive” by prolonging the talks. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine is seeking “guarantees of absolute security”, and that the negotiations “should lead to a ceasefire and restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity.” The Russian side suggests that the option of granting Ukraine neutral status similar to Austria and Sweden’s has been discussed during the talks. The negotiation process and Moscow’s position is affected by Putin’s emotional attitude; he announced that the “special operation” would continue as it was “a fight for Russia’s sovereignty and future”. A spokeswoman for the Russian foreign ministry expressed her hope that Kyiv would acknowledge the inevitability of a “peaceful solution to the problem of demilitarisation and de-Nazification” and transforming Ukraine into a neutral state. Russia has made a ceasefire conditional on Kyiv accepting these conditions.

President Zelensky delivered a message to the US Congress in which he compared the attack on Ukraine with the attacks on Pearl Harbour and September 11, and described the Russian actions as a kind of terror that had not been seen in Europe for 80 years. He called for an increase in sanctions, and – in the absence of consent to close the airspace over Ukraine – for the transfer of as many anti-aircraft weapons and Soviet-made aircraft as possible. On 17 March, he also appeared by video link at a session of the Bundestag, where he accused Berlin of being indirectly responsible for the Russian aggression by blocking Ukraine’s integration with the EU and NATO.

The US has granted Ukraine a new US$800 million military aid package. The deliveries will include 800 Stinger air defence systems, 2000 Javelin anti-tank missile systems, 1000 light anti-tank guns, 6000 AT-4 anti-tank grenade launchers, 100 tactical unmanned aerial vehicles, 5 Mi-17 helicopters, 5000 automatic rifles, 1000 pistols, 400 machine guns and 400 smoothbore rifles, over 20 million grenades, mortars and rounds for small arms, 25,000 sets of bulletproof vests and 25,000 helmets. The United States will also continue to provide satellite reconnaissance intelligence.

The International Court of Justice in the Hague issued a ruling ordering Russia to halt the invasion because there were no signs of the ‘genocide’ Ukraine was allegedly carrying out on the Russian-speaking inhabitants of the eastern part of the country, which was the Kremlin’s pretext for starting the war. Only two of the fifteen judges (from Russia and China) voted against. Under the Charter of the United Nations, enforcement of the Court’s judgments is mandatory, however, there are no means to enforce them.
