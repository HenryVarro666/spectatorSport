Russia has expanded its offensive in Ukraine, striking cities in the west and centre of the country.

Authorities reported dire humanitarian situations in the besieged southern port city of Mariupol and eastern city of Kharkiv amid intense Russian bombardment. A Russian convoy spread out close to the capital Kyiv in a possible sign of an imminent assault.

Meanwhile, Ukraine warned Belarus might be poised to invade its country, and the United Nations said there was no evidence to support Russia’s claims that Ukraine had a biological weapons programme.

Here were the main military developments on Friday – the 16th day of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Widening offensive

Several blasts were reported in the western regions of Ukraine which Russian forces had yet to attack since the beginning of the invasion on February 24.

Russian strikes hit Lviv, and airfields in Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk.

One person was killed after three missiles hit the central city of Dnipro, which had been a relatively safe haven for evacuees and a hub for humanitarian coordination since the beginning of the Russian invasion.

Kyiv and Chernihiv

A Russian military convoy approaching Kyiv appears to have “dispersed and redeployed”, according to a satellite imaging company Maxar, raising fears of a new assault on Ukraine’s capital.

A US defence official said Russian troops had moved 5km (3.1 miles) closer to Kyiv, taking them to just 14km (9 miles) from the centre of the city.

Chernihiv, north of Kyiv, appears to be encircled by Russian troops. NetBlocks reported major internet disruption in Chernihiv amid reports of new air attacks that could hinder communications.

Kharkiv encircled

Kharkiv now appears to be encircled. The mayor said about 50 schools had been destroyed in the city.

Ukraine accused Russian forces of hitting a psychiatric hospital near Izyum, in Kharkiv region, but the authorities said no one was hurt.

“All 30 staff and 330 patients were in a bomb shelter at the time of the strike,” Ukraine’s State Emergencies Service said in a statement.

Mariupol in ‘critical’ situation

Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had completely surrounded the Black Sea port of Mariupol.

Renewed efforts to evacuate citizens failed as Russian shelling prevented evacuations, Ukraine said.

“The situation is critical,” Ukraine’s interior ministry adviser Vadym Denysenko said.

Russian-backed separatists captured Volnovakha north of Mariupol, the RIA news agency quoted Russia’s defence ministry as saying.

Russian forces could soon surround Odesa on three sides, the southern port city’s mayor said. Gennadiy Trukhanov said Russian forces would seek to advance from territories they have occupied in Mykolaiv region.

Russia approves foreign fighters

Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu said there were 16,000 volunteers in the Middle East ready to fight alongside Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.

The news comes amid footage posted online by the Russian defence ministry of Syrian fighters from government-controlled areas in Syria who are reportedly ready to leave for Ukraine.

Warnings of Belarusian invasion

Kyiv said Belarus could be planning to invade to support Russian forces, as Ukraine’s military accused Russian aircraft of firing at Belarusian border villages from Ukrainian air space to provide a pretext for an offensive.

“This is a PROVOCATION! The goal is to involve the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus in the war with Ukraine!” Ukraine’s Air Force Command said in an online statement. Russia did not comment on the claims.

UN dismisses biological weapons claims

The United Nations Security Council granted Russia’s request for an emergency meeting to discuss the Kremlin’s claim that the US is “funding the development of biological weapons in Ukraine”.

The UN said it had no evidence Ukraine had a biological weapons programme, while member countries called the claim “a lie” and “utter nonsense”.

The US and the UK have both warned that Russia might be planning to use “chemical or biological weapons” itself.

Casualties and refugees

The UN’s human rights office (OHCHR) has confirmed the deaths of 564 civilians in Ukraine since the Russian invasion began, including 41 children – although the toll could be much higher.

More than 2.5 million people have fled Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion, according to the UN’s migration agency.

Ukraine says more than 12,000 Russian soldiers have been killed, though the US estimates that 2,000 to 4,000 Russians have been killed.

Russia said last week that 498 Russian soldiers had been killed in Ukraine.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/11/russia-ukraine-war-military-dispatch-march-11-2022

Ukraine Accuses Russia of Damaging Cancer Hospital With Shelling

Ukrainian officials accused Russia of damaging a cancer hospital and several residential buildings in the southern city of Mykolaiv with shelling from heavy artillery.

The hospital’s head doctor, Maksim Beznosenko, said several hundred patients were in the hospital during the attack but that no one was killed. The assault damaged the building and blew out windows.

Russian forces have stepped up their attacks on Mykolaiv, located 470 kilometers (292 miles) south of Kyiv, in an attempt to encircle the city.

Ukrainian and Western officials earlier accused Russia of shelling a maternity hospital in the southern city of Mariupol on Wednesday. Three people died in that attack.

US Imposes New Sanctions on Russian Billionaire, Putin Spokesman’s Family

The United States on Friday imposed sanctions on Russian billionaire Viktor Vekselberg, three family members of President Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson, and lawmakers in the latest punishment for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Russia has faced a slew of measures since launching its Feb. 24 invasion, the biggest attack on a European state since World War II. Those hit by Friday’s sanctions include 10 people on the board of VTB Bank, the second-largest lender in Russia, and 12 members of the Duma, Russia’s lower house of parliament, the U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement.

“Treasury continues to hold Russian officials to account for enabling Putin’s unjustified and unprovoked war,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said.

Putin’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was targeted on March 3. Friday’s measures extend to his wife and two adult children. They lead “luxurious lifestyles that are incongruous with Peskov’s civil servant salary,” the Treasury said in a news release.

UN: Ukraine War Could Trigger 20 Percent Food Price Rise

International food and feed prices could rise by up to 20 percent as a result of the conflict in Ukraine, triggering a jump in global malnourishment, the United Nations food agency said on Friday.

The Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said it was not clear whether Ukraine would be able to harvest crops if the war dragged on, while uncertainty also surrounded the prospects for Russian exports in the coming year.

FAO said Russia was the world’s largest exporter of wheat and Ukraine was the fifth largest. Together, they provide 19 percent of the world’s barley supply, 14 percent of wheat, and 4 percent of maize, making up more than one-third of global cereal exports.

Russia is also a world leader in fertilizer exports.

“The likely disruptions to agricultural activities of these two major exporters of staple commodities could seriously escalate food insecurity globally,” FAO Director General Qu Dongyu said in a statement.

State Department Warns Americans Not to Travel to Ukraine

The U.S. State Department on Friday said that U.S. citizens who travel to Ukraine, including those who go to participate in the conflict, face a very real risk of capture or death as it warned that Washington would not be able to facilitate evacuation.

“They may be subject to potential attempts at criminal prosecution and may be at heightened risk for mistreatment,” State Department spokesperson Ned Price told reporters.

Facebook Parent Company Defends Policy on Calls for Violence

Facebook owner Meta Platforms said Friday that a temporary change in its content policy, only for Ukraine, was needed to let users voice opposition to Russia’s attack, as Russia opened a criminal case after the company said it would allow posts such as “death to the Russian invaders.”

Russian prosecutors asked a court to designate the U.S. tech giant as an “extremist organization,” and the communications regulator said it would restrict access to Meta’s Instagram starting March 14. The company said the decision would affect 80 million users in Russia.

“A criminal case has been initiated … in connection with illegal calls for murder and violence against citizens of the Russian Federation by employees of the American company Meta, which owns the social networks Facebook and Instagram,” Russia’s Investigative Committee said.

Meta Global Affairs President Nick Clegg responded with a statement saying that the company aimed to protect rights to speech as an expression of self-defense reacting to the invasion of Ukraine and that the policy only applied to Ukraine.

Just Over 7,000 People Evacuated From Ukrainian Cities Friday, Mariupol Blocked: Zelensky

A total of 7,144 people were evacuated from four Ukrainian cities on Friday, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a televised address, a sharply lower number than managed to leave in each of the two previous days.

Zelensky accused Russia of refusing to allow people out of the besieged city of Mariupol and said Ukraine would try again to deliver food and medicines there on Saturday.

Almost 40,000 people left a number of cities through humanitarian corridors on Thursday, on top of the 35,000 who fled on Wednesday, Ukrainian authorities said.

Ukraine Says Russia Wants to Drag Belarus Into War, Warns of Invasion Plan

Ukraine said Belarus could be planning to invade its territory on Friday and accused Russia of trying to drag its ally into the war by staging air attacks on Belarus from Ukrainian air space.

Belarus has served as a staging post for Russian troops, missiles and aircraft, both before and after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, but it has not deployed its own forces in active battle.

The alleged attacks took place as Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko was meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, according to Ukraine’s State Centre for Strategic Communications.

Last week, Lukashenko, a close Kremlin ally, said Belarusian armed forces were not taking part and would not take part in what Russia calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine.

IAEA: Power Line Repairs Begin at Chernobyl

Ukraine told the International Atomic Energy Agency on Friday that technicians have started repairing damaged power lines at the decommissioned Chernobyl power plant in an effort to restore power supplies, the U.N. nuclear agency said.

On Wednesday, Ukrainian authorities said that Chernobyl, the site of the 1986 nuclear disaster, was knocked off the power grid, with emergency generators supplying backup power.

The Ukrainian nuclear regulator said Friday that workers repaired one section of the lines, but there still appears to be damage in other places, the IAEA said. Repair efforts would continue despite “the difficult situation” outside the plant, which was taken by Russian forces early in the invasion, it said.

The Ukrainian regulator said additional fuel was delivered for generators, but it remains important to fix the power lines as soon as possible. The IAEA reiterated that the disconnection “will not have a critical impact on essential safety functions at the site.”

Deutsche Bank to Wind Down in Russia, Reversing Course After Backlash

Deutsche Bank, which faced stinging criticism from some investors and politicians for its ongoing ties to Russia, said on Friday in a surprise move that it would wind down its business in the country.

Deutsche joins the ranks of Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, which were the first major U.S. banks to exit after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Those moves put pressure on rivals to follow.

Deutsche had resisted pressure to sever ties, arguing that it needed to support multinational firms doing business in Russia.

But on Friday evening in Frankfurt, the bank suddenly reversed course.

“We are in the process of winding down our remaining business in Russia while we help our non-Russian multinational clients in reducing their operations,” the bank said.

“There won’t be any new business in Russia,” Deutsche said.

A day earlier, Deutsche Bank’s Chief Executive Christian Sewing explained to staff why the bank was not withdrawing.

“The answer is that this would go against our values,” he wrote. “We have clients who cannot exit Russia overnight.”

Kharkiv Nuclear Facility Safe but War Poses Big Risks, Says Institute Director

The head of a nuclear research facility in the northeastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv said on Friday that the grounds of the institute had been struck by Russian shells during recent fighting, but the core housing nuclear fuel remains intact.

He warned, however, that any future damage to equipment in the core could pose a danger.

“The facility, in working condition, doesn’t present any danger whatsoever,” said Mykola Shulga, director general of the National Science Centre Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology.

“However, if there is physical damage, a nuclear fuel leak is possible, radioactive elements (could escape) outside,” he told Reuters, speaking inside the facility.

“This obviously would be a huge, huge problem for the environment. In other words, what would happen would be comparable to a similar situation at any nuclear power station.”

While the inner areas of the institute were unscathed, some of the outer walls of the building were damaged by shrapnel and windows were blown in.

Ukraine and its allies are concerned about the risk Russia’s invasion poses to nuclear facilities across the country, including power plants and research centres.

Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, is now in Russian hands. During fighting with Ukrainian forces in the area, a blaze broke out in a building at the site.

Ukraine Says Situation in Encircled City of Mariupol Is ‘Critical’

Ukraine said on Friday the situation in Mariupol was now critical as Russian forces tightened their noose around the Black Sea port city and the death toll from Russian shelling and a 12-day blockade reached almost 1,600.

Russia’s defence ministry was quoted by the Tass news agency as saying Mariupol was now completely surrounded, and Ukrainian officials accused Russia of deliberately preventing civilians getting out and stopping humanitarian convoys getting in.

Russian shelling prevented evacuees from leaving the city again on Friday. Elsewhere, Russian forces also stopped some buses of people trying to flee the Kyiv region, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said in a video address.

Interior ministry adviser Vadym Denysenko expressed doubt that the latest attempt to deliver humanitarian aid to Mariupol would succeed, and a new effort to evacuate civilians appeared to have failed.

“The situation is critical,” Denysenko said.

Ukraine Claims Russian Jets Fired at Belarus in False Flag Attempt

Ukrainian officials on Friday said that Belarus could be planning to invade its territory, accusing Russia of attempting to drag its ally into the conflict.

Ukraine’s Air Force Command, on March 11, alleged that border officials obtained information detailing how Russian aircraft took off from a Belarus airfield, crossed into Ukraine, and fired at the Belarussian village of Kopani.

The Ukrainian “State Border Service received information that Russian aircraft took off from Dubrovytsia airfield (Belarus), entered the territory of Ukraine, turned over our populated areas of Horodychi and Tumen, and then launched an airstrike on the populated area of Kopani (Belarus),” said the Air Force Command on social media. It included a video that purported to show part of the incident.

The claim could not be immediately verified by The Epoch Times. Russia’s Ministry of Defense has not publicly responded to the allegations.

Russia Says It Has Enough Fossil Fuel Buyers Even With Sanctions

The Russian Federation has signaled once again that it does not expect serious harm to befall its fossil fuel industry amidst economic sanctions and international isolation, arguing that it will continue to find buyers, even if Europe and the United States cease doing business with Russian oil exporters.

“We will not persuade anyone to buy our oil and gas,” said Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on March 10. “If they want to replace it with something, they are welcome, we will have supply markets, we already have them.”

While the international community has responded to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine with resounding disapproval, the economic isolation is not universal. Russia remains closely aligned with China, Cuba, Venezuela, Belarus, and Syria, and the country will likely continue trading with Turkey, which has become increasingly dependent on Russian exports in recent years.

Niinistö’s office said in a statement that he informed Putin that he, earlier in the day, had a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and that Zelenskyy was prepared to talk directly with Putin.

The statement said Niinistö called for an immediate ceasefire and the safe evacuation of civilians, but also spoke to Putin about the security of nuclear energy facilities in Ukraine.

Niinisto is one of the few Western leaders who has kept a regular dialogue with Putin ever since the Finnish leader took office in 2012.

UN: ‘Credible Reports’ of Cluster Munitions

The United Nations human rights office has received “credible reports” that Russian forces are using cluster munitions in Ukraine, including in populated areas which is prohibited under international humanitarian law, the U.N. political chief said Friday.

Undersecretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo told a U.N. Security Council meeting that residential areas and civilian infrastructure are being shelled in Mariupol, Kharkiv, Sumy, and Chernihiv, and “the utter devastation being visited on these cities is horrific.”

Most of the civilian casualties recorded by the U.N. human rights office—564 killed and 982 injured as of Thursday—“have been caused by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and missile and airstrikes,” she said.

“Indiscriminate attacks, including those using cluster munitions, which are of a nature to strike military objectives and civilians or civilian objects without distinction, are prohibited under international humanitarian law,” DiCarlo said. “Directing attacks against civilian and civilian objects, as well as so-called area bombardment in towns and villages, are also prohibited under international law and may amount to war crimes.”

Ukraine Loses Communication With Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant: IAEA

Ukraine lost all communications with the Chernobyl nuclear power plant on March 10, the country’s regulatory authority informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

Just a day earlier, the site had lost all external power supply, following which, the plant made use of emergency generators. The loss in communication means that the Ukraine operator cannot provide IAEA with updated information about the site.

Prior to the loss of communication, power lines on the site were damaged, disconnecting it from the electric grid. To ensure the site receives continuous power, either the power lines have to be repaired or diesel deliveries must be made. The generators have a capacity of two days’ worth of fuel.

Biden Calls for End to Normal Trade Relations With Russia

President Joe Biden has announced the latest round of sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies against Russia in response to the now weeks-long Russian military campaign in Ukraine.

In an address Friday, Biden said he will sign bipartisan legislation that will revoke Russia’s permanent normal trade relations status with the United States, making it more difficult for Russia to do business with the West.

Biden says the move to end normal trade relations with Russia was done in coordination with Canada, France, Germany, Italy Japan, the United Kingdom, and the European Union.

“[Russia President Vladimir] Putin must pay the price,” Biden said. “He cannot pursue a war that threatens the very foundations of international peace and stability, and then ask for financial help from the international community.”

He then said Ukrainian negotiations were taking place practically every day.

“There are certain positive shifts, negotiators on our side tell me,” Putin said. “I will talk about all of this later.”

Lukashenko told Putin that both of them were from Soviet generations which had endured sanctions and that the Soviet Union had developed well.

WHO Says It Advised Ukraine to Destroy Pathogens in Health Labs to Prevent Disease Spread

The World Health Organization advised Ukraine to destroy high-threat pathogens housed in the country’s public health laboratories to prevent “any potential spills” that would spread disease among the population, the agency told Reuters on Thursday.

Biosecurity experts say Russia’s movement of troops into Ukraine and bombardment of its cities have raised the risk of an escape of disease-causing pathogens, should any of those facilities be damaged.

Ukraine has public health laboratories researching how to mitigate the threats of dangerous diseases affecting both animals and humans including, most recently, COVID-19. Its labs have received support from the United States, the European Union, and the WHO.

In response to questions from Reuters about its work with Ukraine ahead of and during Russia’s invasion, the WHO said in an email that it has collaborated with Ukrainian public health labs for several years to promote security practices that help prevent “accidental or deliberate release of pathogens.”

“As part of this work, WHO has strongly recommended to the Ministry of Health in Ukraine and other responsible bodies to destroy high-threat pathogens to prevent any potential spills,” the WHO, a United Nations agency, said.

The WHO would not say when it had made the recommendation nor did it provide specifics about the kinds of pathogens or toxins housed in Ukraine’s laboratories. The agency also did not answer questions about whether its recommendations were followed.

Ukrainian officials in Kyiv and at their embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment.

Zelensky Says 100,000 Evacuated Amid Blockade

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said 100,000 people have been evacuated during the past two days from seven cities under Russian blockade in the north and center of the country, including the Kyiv suburbs.

But he said the Russian refusal to allow evacuations from Mariupol, a port city in the south, was “outright terror.”

“They have a clear order to hold Mariupol hostage, to mock it, to constantly bomb and shell it,” Zelensky said in his nightly video address to the nation. He said the Russians began a tank attack right where there was supposed to be a humanitarian corridor.

The city of 430,000 has been without food supplies, running water, and electricity for 10 days. Ukrainian officials say about 1,300 people have died, including three in the bombing of a maternity and children’s hospital on Wednesday.

Russia-Ukraine war: Moscow never wanted war, seeks to end current conflict, says Lavrov

On the 15th day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Russian forces were encircling at least four major cities and inched closer towards the city limits of Kyiv. The last batch of 600 Indian students were evacuated from embattled Sumy in war-hit Ukraine to Poland on Thursday. Meanwhile, a special flight from Bucharest carrying 119 Indians and 27 foreign nationals landed in Delhi on Thursday morning.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is ready to talk to Russian President Vladimir Putin directly — but “will not make any compromise to the Russian position during these negotiations,” his deputy told CNN.

Though talks between the Ukrainian and Russian foreign ministers, held Thursday in the Turkish city of Antalya, did not yield any major breakthrough, Ukraine hadn’t been too optimistic from the start, said Igor Zhovkva, Deputy Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine.

“This is a really good thing that they met, but unfortunately we can say that the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Russia is not the one making the final decision. The final decision to stop war, to make a ceasefire, to withdraw troops is made by one person only,” he added, apparently referring to Putin.

Zhovkva stated that though Zelensky was ready for a diplomatic solution, he has not heard from the Russian President personally or his aides.

“The last thing I heard from them was we have to still work under the format of two delegations … But, look, even the agreements reached during these negotiations are not held,” Zhovkva noted, pointing to humanitarian corridors in Ukraine that are “being kept in custody by Russian forces.”

Zhovkva said Ukraine was open to neutrality “if the NATO bloc is not ready for the time being to accept Ukraine.”

“But at the same time, we do need hard security guarantees for Ukraine so these awful wars, this awful aggression does not repeat in the future,” he added.

Zhovkva said Ukraine wanted to work with Putin and its neighbors to establish a system he called “the renewed security system of Europe.”

“My country, the Ukrainian people deserve to become a part of the European family…Ukraine is fighting for the security of all of Europe. So when (French) President (Emmanuel) Macron talks about possible European security, how can he talk without having President Zelensky at the table? Without having President Zelensky and Ukraine in the European Union?” Zhovkva added.

Several major cities in Ukraine are “under attack”

Major Ukrainian cities including Dnipro and Lutsk are being “subjected to devastating blows,” said Mykhailo Podoliak, an adviser to the head of the Ukrainian President’s office on Friday.

Explosions shut down two boiler houses in Lutsk, located in the far west near the Polish border, while three major explosions were reported in the western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, he wrote on Twitter.

“Dnipro is also under attack,” he continued, adding, “Russia’s destructive war against civilians and major cities continues.”

WHO says it advised Ukraine to destroy pathogens in health labs to prevent disease spread

The World Health Organization advised Ukraine to destroy high-threat pathogens housed in the country’s public health laboratories to prevent “any potential spills” that would spread disease among the population, the agency told Reuters news agency.

In response to questions from Reuters about its work with Ukraine ahead of and during Russia’s invasion, the WHO said in an email that it has collaborated with Ukrainian public health labs for several years to promote security practices that help prevent “accidental or deliberate release of pathogens”.

“As part of this work, WHO has strongly recommended to the Ministry of Health in Ukraine and other responsible bodies to destroy high-threat pathogens to prevent any potential spills,” the WHO, a UN agency, added.

Russia to lose ‘most favoured nation status’ over Ukraine

The US, together with the Group of Seven nations and the EU, will move to revoke Russia’s “most favoured nation” status, multiple people familiar with the situation told Reuters.

Stripping Russia of its favoured nation status paves the way for the US and its allies to impose tariffs on a wide range of Russian goods, which would ratchet up pressure on an economy already heading into a recession.

Russian troops have launched a high-precision, long-range attack on two military airfields in the Ukrainian cities of Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk and have taken them out of action, Russian news agencies have quoted Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov as saying.

The mayor of Ivano-Frankiivsk, Ruslan Martsinkiv, ordered residents in the neighbouring areas to head to shelters after an air raid alert. The mayor of Lutsk also announced an airstrike near the airport.

The strikes were far to the west from the main Russian offensive and could indicate a new direction of the war.

IMF chief says Ukraine war to lower global growth forecast

The war in Ukraine and sanctions against Russia will force the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to lower its global growth forecast next month, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said.

Georgieva stated the unprecedented sanctions imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine had caused an abrupt contraction of the Russian economy and it faced a “deep recession” this year.

She added the IMF had no programme or policy relations with Russia at this point and its Moscow office was not operating. Fund member countries have condemned the war, but there is no discussion currently about ending Russia’s membership in the global lender.

Ukraine FM: Russia could be preparing ‘horrific false flag operation’

Nationalists trapped in Mariupol commit all war crimes in the city, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov told reporters.

“I underscore that all these and other war crimes in Mariupol are being committed by the punishers trapped in the city. We have warned repeatedly that, as the ring contracts, the number of provocations from the Nazis will keep growing. They have nowhere to run from there,” Konashenkov noted.

According to the spokesman, “it was these Azov battalion Nazis who had been exterminating civilian population in Donetsk and Lugansk republics, deliberately and with exceptional cruelty, for eight years”.

Zelensky hits back at Russian chemical weapons propaganda

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has hit back at widely discredited Russian disinformation suggesting Ukraine is preparing a chemical attack.

Zelensky stated no chemical weapon or weapons of mass destruction were developed in Ukraine, and Moscow’s accusations that Kyiv was developing biological weapons and preparing a chemical attack made him “really worried.”

“We’ve been repeatedly convinced: If you want to know Russia’s plans, look at what Russia accuses others of,” he said. “We are accused of attacks on allegedly peaceful Russia. And now what? … What else have you prepared for us? Where will you strike with chemical weapons?” Zelensky asked, addressing Russia.

US warns Russia is “gaslighting world” as UN Security Council discusses chemical weapons claims

The United Nations Security Council will hold a meeting Friday at the request of Russia about an allegation the United States is developing chemical weapons in Ukraine.

The US’ UN Mission spokeswoman Olivia Dalton said the move was “exactly the kind of false flag effort we have warned Russia might initiate to justify a biological or chemical weapons attack.”

“Russia has a well-documented history of using chemical weapons and has long maintained a biological weapons program in violation of international law. Russia also has a track record of falsely accusing the West of the very violations that Russia itself is perpetrating,” Dalton continued, adding, “We’re not going to let Russia get away with gaslighting the world or using the UN Security Council as a venue for promoting their disinformation.”

Satellite images show stalled 40-mile-long Russian convoy near Kyiv now largely dispersed

With the clouds temporarily clearing around the Ukrainian capital, new satellite images taken earlier on Thursday show that the Russian military convoy northwest of Kyiv that stretched more than 40 miles (more than 64 kilometers) has “largely dispersed and redeployed,” Maxar Technologies says.

The satellite images show that some elements of the convoy have “repositioned” into forests and treelined areas near Lubyanka, Ukraine, according to Maxar.

The satellite images were taken at 11:37 a.m. Kyiv time (4.37 a.m. ET) on Thursday.

Just north of the Antonov Airbase in Hostomel, Ukraine, Russian military vehicles are seen sitting on roadways in residential areas in the town of Ozera — 17 miles northwest of Kyiv.

Towed artillery and other vehicles are seen taking cover in a sparse patches of trees near Lubyanka — about three miles northwest of the Antonov Airbase.

In Berestyanka — 10 miles west of the airbase — a number of fuel trucks and, what Maxar says, appears to be multiple rocket launchers are seen positioned in a field near trees.

Southeast of Ivankiv — the end of what was the 40+ mile convoy — a number of trucks and equipment are still seen on the roadway.

UK defense ministry: More Russian forces are being sent to encircle key cities, slowing Russian advance

Due to “strong Ukrainian resistance,” Russian forces are increasing their number of deployed forces to encircle key cities which will reduce the number of forces available to continue advancing, according to an intelligence update from the UK’s Ministry of Defence on Thursday.

The UK MoD tweeted the update saying, “Due to strong Ukrainian resistance, Russian forces are committing an increased number of their deployed forces to encircle key cities. This will reduce the number of forces available to continue their advance and will further slow Russian progress.”

The UK MoD also added that protests against Russian occupation have been reported throughout the week in the occupied cities of Kherson, Melitopol and Berdyansk, with 400 “reportedly detained by Russian forces in the Kherson Oblast yesterday.”

US officials believe Ukraine can keep control of Kyiv for another four-to-six weeks

US intelligence believes Ukraine will be able to maintain control of Kyiv for several more weeks, according to NBC News, even as Russian troops continue to encircle the capital city.

US official told the outlet that while Russia’s troops are in a position to completely circle Kyiv in the coming week or two, the fight to take total control of the capital will likely take much longer.

The same official stated US intelligence believes the battle to take Kyiv could take another four-to-six weeks, though the official acknowledged that the US’ assessment is fluid and frequently changing.

Ukraine: Over 400,000 people evacuated from conflict areas:

US: Russian forces have moved about 3 miles closer to Kyiv and Chernihiv is now “isolated”

Russian forces have moved forward, in the vicinity of Hostomel Airport, by about 5 kilometers (or about 3 miles) in the last day, a senior US defense official told reporters Thursday.

Russian forces continue to “advance their troops” along two parallel lines outside of Kyiv, and in those lines, the closest line has “reached about 40 kilometers east of Kyiv,” the official said.

“We see Russian forces continue to advance their troops, they’re really along two sort of parallel lines there, and we assess that the northern most of those two lines, the closest line has reached about 40 kilometers east of Kyiv,” the official added.

Out of those two lines, “the one that’s to the south of the two which kind of emanated out of Sumy, we also assess that some of [the Russian forces] might have reached approximately 40 kilometers from Kyiv,” the official said.

On the southern line, the official believes Russian forces “might be repositioning themselves back towards Sumy,” but it is not clear how many forces, how fast they are moving back, or why they are doing that, the official added.

The town of Chernihiv is “now isolated,” the official stated.

The official also noted that Russian forces have conducted “775 missile launches” of “all stripes, all different varieties” since the beginning of their invasion in Ukraine. The US has seen “reports of internet outages particularly around Mariupol and Kherson,” over the last 24 hours, the official continued.

Mariupol “on the verge of a humanitarian catastrophe” as food supply decreases daily

Food supply in the city of Mariupol is “decreasing day by day,” according to a statement from the Mariupol city council on Thursday.

The statement called the situation in the city “critical” and said with blocked entrances to the city, there is no way to deliver food and water.

“The city of Mariupol is on the verge of a humanitarian catastrophe,” the city council added.

Mariupol mayor Vadym Boychenko has stated 400,000 people were trapped in the port city which had gone through “two days of hell”.

“Every 30 minutes planes arrived over the city of Mariupol and worked on residential areas, killing civilians – the elderly, women, children,” he said in an online post.

Petro Andrushenko, an adviser to the mayor, noted the Russians wanted to “delete our people”.

“They want to stop any evacuation,” he added.

White House continues to blame Putin for skyrocketing gas prices

There is “no question” that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has impacted gas prices in the US, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday after a new consumer price index report showed consumer prices spiked more than 7.9% over the last 12 months.

“There’s also no question that when a foreign dictator invades a foreign country, and when that foreign dictator is the head of a country that is the third largest supplier of oil in the world, that that is going to have an impact, and it is,” Psaki told reporters at a White House briefing.

Psaki added, “We’ve seen the price of gas go up at least 75 cents since President Putin lined up troops on the border of Ukraine.”

State Department stops short of calling Russia’s actions “war crimes” after US ambassador to UN says they are

US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said actions committed by Russia against the Ukrainian people are “war crimes.”

“They constitute war crimes; they are attacks on civilians that cannot be justified by any – in any way whatsoever,” Linda Thomas-Greenfiel said in an interview with BBC Newshour.

State Department spokesperson Ned Price stopped short of declaring Russia’s actions against Ukrainian civilians “war crimes” during a briefing Thursday, instead reiterating that the United States is “supportive of efforts to document and to investigate reports of potential war crimes in Ukraine.”

“The fact is that we’ve seen very credible reports of deliberate attacks on civilians, which would, under the Geneva Conventions, constitute a war crime,” he said at a State Department briefing Thursday, citing attacks on the hospital in Mariupol and strikes on schools, hospitals, buses, cars, and ambulances.

“We are appalled by the brutal tactics that the Russian Federation, the Kremlin, has employed in prosecuting this war of choice,” Price added.

Thomas-Greenfield stated the question of whether Russia is guilty of war crimes is the one “we’re being asked every day, and we’re working with others in the international community to document the crimes that Russia is committing against the Ukrainian people.”

Germany: There will be no fast-track procedure for Ukraine EU membership

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that he rejects a fast-track procedure for Ukraine’s membership in the European Union.

“It is very important that we continue to pursue the things that we have indeed decided in the past,” Scholz told reporters ahead of an EU summit in Versailles, France.

Scholz referred to the association agreement that the EU and Ukraine concluded in 2017 that aims to deepen political and economic ties.

“This is the course we have to follow,” Scholz added.

Moscow to open daily humanitarian corridors from Ukraine to Russia

Moscow has said it will open daily humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians fleeing fighting in Ukraine to Russian territory, despite Kyiv insisting that no evacuation routes should lead to Russia.

“Humanitarian corridors towards the Russian Federation will now be opened, without any agreements, every day from 10:00am,” defence ministry official Mikhail Mizintsev was quoted as saying by Russian agencies.

He added evacuation routes in other directions would proceed “in agreement with the Ukrainian side”.

UN says 2.3m people fled Ukraine amid war with Russia

More than 2.3 million people have fled Ukraine since Russia launched a war on its neighbor late February, the UN refugee agency announced.

The night and morning have been marked by attacks on previously spared cities and reports that the huge Russian military column northwest of Kyiv is gathering, which may be a sign of a close attack on the capital.

On Friday morning, there will be reports that several cities that were not previously affected have now been attacked by Russia.

It is about Lutsk in northwestern Ukraine and Dnipro in the southeast, Ivano-Frankivsk in the southwest has also been shelled.

Oleg Synegubov, governor of the Kharkiv region, told Telegram that a ward for the mentally ill near the city of Izyum had been hit by Russian shelling.

According to him, 73 people were evacuated after the attack.

More than 300 people must have been in the building at the time of the incident.

The large military convoy that was previously reported northwest of Kyiv has now dispersed and spread, new satellite images show.

An attack on the city in the near future is therefore likely, says Ilmari Käihkö, associate professor of war science.

- Maybe not the coming hours, but the coming days, he says in Morgonstudion.

Russian President Vladimir Putin is now calling on Russian authorities to help foreign volunteers who want to fight on Russia's side in the war.

Humanitarian corridors

New attempts at humanitarian corridors will be carried out during the day, says Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister.

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has accused Russia of being a “terrorist state”after its tanks prevented a delivery of food, water and medicine to the besieged city of Mariupol, and he said Moscow was capable of chemical weapons attacks.

As Russian forces appeared to be regrouping in order to encircle Kyiv, and the US planned to ratchet up the economic pressure on Vladimir Putin, Zelenskiy tried to rally Ukrainians with another video address late on Thursday condemning the relentless assault on cities.

Meanwhile, Ukraine’s defence minister said Russian forces had killed more Ukrainian civilians than soldiers, and Russian forces have been accused of hitting a psychiatric hospital near the eastern Ukrainian town of Izyum.

“This is a war crime against civilians, genocide against the Ukrainian nation,” the regional governor of Kharkiv said. Russia denies targeting civilians.

What else is happening? Here’s everything we know on day 16 of the Russian invasion.

What happens if Russia cannot pay its debts after western sanctions? While Russia would have had enough foreign currency to cover debt payments, having amassed $630bn in reserves, the US, UK and EU freezing the assets of its central bank have made much of this sum inaccessible. This means it could default.

Meanwhile, Russia’s past has raised fears of a large-scale cyberwar targeting Ukraine and its allies, including the US.

Likelihood of criminal charges against Trump rising, experts say

Some former prosecutors have called on the DoJ to accelerate the investigation after a House panel’s allegations that Trump broke laws to overturn the election.

The likelihood of a criminal investigation and charges against Donald Trump are rising. This is due to allegations by a House panel of a “criminal conspiracy” involving his aggressive drive to overturn the 2020 election results, coupled with a Department of Justice inquiry into a “false electors” scheme that Trump loyalists devised to block Joe Biden from taking office.

Former federal prosecutors say evidence is mounting of criminal conduct by Trump that may yield charges of obstructing an official proceeding of Congress on 6 January or defrauding the US government, stemming from his weeks-long drive with senior allies to thwart Biden’s inauguration by pushing false claims of fraud.

A 2 March court filing by the House January 6 panel implicated Trump in a conspiracy to block Congress from certifying Biden’s win, and Trump faces legal threats from investigations under way into the “false electors” ploy, and seditious conspiracy charges filed against Oath Keepers who attacked the Capitol, say department veterans.

What has the House panel said? The filing by the House panel stated that it had “a good-faith basis for concluding that the president and members of his campaign engaged in a criminal conspiracy to defraud the United States”.

Actor Jussie Smollett sentenced to 150 days in jail for lying to police about fake hate crime

The actor Jussie Smollett has been sentenced to 30 months of probation, including 150 days of jail time, and ordered to pay restitution after his conviction for lying to police about a racist and homophobic attack that he orchestrated himself.

Smollett, who is Black and gay, reported to police that two men wearing ski masks beat him and hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him on a dark Chicago street. The 39-year-old was also ordered to pay $120,000 in restitution to the city of Chicago and fined $25,000 by Judge James Linn of Cook county circuit court.

Linn denied a request to suspend Smollett’s sentence and ordered he be placed in custody immediately. After the sentencing, Smollett removed the face mask he wore throughout the hearing to loudly proclaim his innocence.

What did he say? “If I did this, then it means that I stuck my fist in the fears of Black Americans in this country for over 400 years and the fears of the LGBT community,” Smollett said, standing up at the defense table as his lawyers and sheriff’s deputies surrounded him. “Your honor, I respect you and I respect the jury but I did not do this.”

US inflation surged again last month to a new 40-year high of 7.9%, propelled by surging costs for gas, food and housing. The February figures, the sharpest increase since 1982, are only a foretaste of higher prices to come as they do not factor in the impacts of the Ukraine war, Biden’s ban on Russian energy imports and tightened oil supplies have sent prices at US gas stations and other energy commodities to record levels.

As Biden ratchets up the pressure on Russia by banning imports of its oil, and American drivers grumble about rising gasoline prices, a more fundamental demand has emerged – for the US to decisively cut its umbilical reliance on fossil fuels. Environmental groups and progressive Democrats are aiming to build on the backlash to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine by ending the era of fossil fuel dependency and help address the unfolding climate crisis.

In the south of the city, Konstantin Bondarev, 61, has been running long distances since 1983. “Now that there has been war, I’ve been running non-stop; it makes things feel a lot easier during such turbulent times,” he said. “It’s important for people to show that we are alive and strong. This is our expression of the fight.”
