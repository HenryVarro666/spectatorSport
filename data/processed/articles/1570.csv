An official in the Israeli Prime Minster's Office denies the claim.

Why it matters: Bennett has emerged as a key mediator between Putin and Zelensky in the last two weeks. Israel has said it needs to remain neutral in the mediation, but the Ukrainian official told Axios that Bennett must present proposals and do more than act as a ""mailbox"" between the two sides.

Driving the news: The senior Ukrainian official claimed Bennett initiated the call on Tuesday and recommended Zelensky take the offer.

Zelensky and his advisers didn’t like Bennett’s recommendation, according to the Ukrainian official.

""Bennett is basically telling us to surrender and we have no intention of doing that,"" the senior Ukrainian official said.

A senior official in the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said that the details of the call as described the Ukrainian official were not true.

“We doubt that the official is a senior person that is in Ukraine now and who was on the call, because it was conducted on a private line. Our contacts are directly with President Zelensky and his close advisers,"" the official in the Prime Minister’s Office said.

The Israeli official said Bennett didn’t recommend that Zelensky take Putin’s offer because Israel hasn’t received such an offer. “The prime minister doesn’t intend to give Zelensky any recommendations or advice at any stage,"" the official said.

The Israeli official stressed the call between Zelensky and Bennett was good and long and included a discussion about the possibility of holding a mediation meeting in Jerusalem.

The Israeli official declined to comment on whether Israel is going to propose a more detailed plan for ending the war. “The prime minister’s efforts are focused on one thing — stopping the bloodshed in Ukraine,"" the official said.

Behind the scenes: In the last two weeks — and especially after Bennett’s trip to Moscow last Saturday — the Israeli government has claimed that it needs to maintain a careful and balanced approach to the war in Ukraine.

The Israelis asked Ukraine in private to stop requesting military assistance or political backing from Israel because it will harm the mediation efforts that demand neutrality, the senior Ukrainian official said.

Details: The senior Ukrainian official said Zelensky and his aides didn’t get the impression over the last week that Bennett’s mediation efforts are bearing any fruit.

The government in Kyiv thinks Bennett has not been acting as a mediator, the senior Ukrainian official said. He added that a mediator needs to push for compromises, put proposals on the table and not simply pass messages.

“We don’t need another mailbox, we have enough of those,"" the Ukrainian official said.

The official added that Zelensky and his advisers believe that if Bennett wants to stay neutral and mediate, he needs to appoint an envoy that will work on this full time.

Between the lines: The Ukrainian president and his aides think that Bennett’s diplomatic involvement is largely motivated by his goal of not taking a clear position on the Russian invasion in order to maintain good relations with Russia, according to the Ukrainian official.",https://www.axios.com/russia-war-israel-bennett-zelensky-told-to-surrender-d5c53a0b-5940-4b09-85e4-ede244a2f5a1.html
1,288abfc3-53d6-4e43-b1ac-1d2f26a57da9,[],,"Prime Minister Naftali Bennett on Tuesday pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to accept an offer from Russian President Vladimir Putin, which would require Kyiv to make significant concessions in order to end Moscow’s invasion, the Walla and Haaretz news sites report.

The Prime Minister’s Office denied the claim.

Walla does not specify the details of Putin’s offer as reportedly conveyed by Bennett, but previous reports from the news site said that Putin is demanding an independent Donbas region, while stopping short of seeking regime change in Ukraine. Other reports have suggested that the plan Bennett brought to Zelensky includes recognizing Russia’s annexation of Crimea, recognizing Donetsk and Luhansk as separate entities, and changing the Ukrainian constitution to excise a commitment to joining NATO.

“If I were you, I would think about the lives of my people and take the offer,” Bennett told Zelensky during a phone call on Tuesday, according to a senior Ukrainian official who spoke to Walla and Haaretz on condition of anonymity.

Zelensky did not take well to the proposal, responding with a brief “I hear you.”

“Bennett has proposed that we surrender,” the senior Ukrainian official tells the Hebrew news sites. “We have no intention of doing so. We know that Putin’s proposal is just the beginning.”

The report says that Israel has also asked that Ukraine cease its requests for Israeli military or defense assistance, as this could hinder Jerusalem’s efforts to mediate and maintain neutrality.

Thus far, Zelensky has been unimpressed with Bennett’s mediation efforts, saying the Israeli premier has sufficed with being a “mailbox” that passes along messages between Russia to Ukraine without coming up with any proposals of his own, the senior official says.

“We do not need a mailbox. We have enough of these,” the senior Ukrainian official says. “President Zelensky’s office does not believe this is the way to mediate. If Bennett wants to be neutral and mediate, we would like to see him appoint someone who will deal with the matter day and night to try and reach a compromise.”

Zelensky is under the impression that Bennett has taken up the role of mediator as part of his effort to avoid picking sides in a war because of the risk of damaging Israel’s ties with Russia, the official claims. (Bennett was asked by Zelensky on February 25 to try to mediate a solution to the crisis, and flew to Moscow on Saturday night for a Kremlin meeting with Putin. Zelensky has also criticized Bennett, however, saying on March 3 that he did not feel the prime minister is “wrapped in our flag.”)

The official reportedly pointed out that other countries such as Germany and France have also played roles in passing along messages between Russia and Ukraine while still maintaining a clear public stance against Moscow’s invasion, unlike the Israeli prime minister, who has not condemned Russia.

Zelensky’s office has identified a wide gulf between Bennett’s position and that of the Israeli public, which has been far more supportive of Ukraine, the official reportedly says. This has led to significant frustration and even personal offense on the part of Zelensky with the Israeli government, according to the senior official.

The official reportedly said Zelensky feels he has all but exhausted his efforts to influence the Israeli government.

He is hoping to deliver a speech to the Knesset plenum, as he has done in other parliaments around the world. But Israel has instead proposed that he hold a less formal Zoom session with all MKs invited, Walla reports.

Zelensky has rejected the idea and is weighing the possibility of a speech at Yad Vashem, though it is not clear whether the Holocaust museum would be interested in the idea.

Israeli officials have given a number of reasons to Zelensky’s office for why he cannot give a speech at the Knesset plenum — including that parliament is in recess and that the building is undergoing renovation.

But Walla reports that those are mere excuses, as Bennett and Foreign Minister Lapid do not want to anger Russia by granting Zelensky such a high-profile appearance.

Responding to the report, a source in the Prime Minister’s Office says, “It is doubtful whether this is a senior official who is in Ukraine and on [Bennett’s] call [with Zelensky], since it took place on a private line.

The PMO source denies that Bennett told Zelensky to take Putin’s offer, “as Israel does not have such an offer.”

“In any case, the prime minister does not intend to give Zelensky recommendations or advice on how to act at any stage,” the source tells Walla. “The conversation between the two was long and positive and included the possibility of a meeting [between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators] in Jerusalem.”

The source declined to say whether Bennett will be prepared to make proposals of his own. “The prime minister’s efforts are aimed at one thing: to stop the bloodshed in Ukraine and the unnecessary suffering.”

Israel has long had good relations with both Ukraine and Russia, and has been seeking to use its position to broker an agreement, as it also tries to walk a tightrope maintaining its ties to both countries. But its relationship with Kyiv has strained as Bennett has avoided directly blaming Russia for the war, although Foreign Minister Yair Lapid has done so.

The unnamed Ukrainian official was quoted in the Hebrew reports soon after Ukraine’s ambassador to Israel, Yevgen Korniychuk, gave a press conference at which he urged Israel to drop its neutrality and side openly with Ukraine, noted that Bennett is not the only mediator, and claimed Israel is “afraid” of offending Moscow.

The unnamed official also reportedly said Israel has asked that Ukraine cease its requests for military or defense assistance, as this could hinder Jerusalem’s efforts to mediate and maintain neutrality. Ukraine has repeatedly pushed Israel for more support since Russia launched its invasion. Israel has been seeking to avoid antagonizing Russia, which has a strong presence in Syria, where Israel carries out military action against Iran-linked groups.

Thus far, Zelensky has been unimpressed with Bennett’s mediation efforts, saying the Israeli premier has sufficed with being a “mailbox” that passes along messages between Russia to Ukraine without coming up with any proposals of his own, the Ukrainian official reportedly said.

Zelensky, who is Jewish and a declared admirer of Israel, is hoping to broadcast a speech to the Knesset plenum as he has done in other parliaments around the world, but the plans for the speech remain unclear. Israel has instead proposed that he hold a less formal Zoom session with all MKs invited, Walla reported. Knesset Speaker Mickey Levy said Thursday that Zelensky will speak to lawmakers via Zoom in the coming days.

Zelensky initially rejected the idea of a Zoom call and is weighing the possibility of a speech at Yad Vashem, though it is not clear whether the Holocaust museum would be interested in the idea.

But Walla reported that those are mere excuses, as Bennett and Lapid do not want to anger Russia with such a high-profile appearance.

Israeli officials are reportedly also concerned that many lawmakers might not show up for a Zelensky speech, leading to embarrassment.

Bennett traveled to Moscow to meet with Putin on Saturday, becoming the first foreign leader to sit down with the Russian president since he invaded his neighbor. He spoke to Zelensky before and after the meeting.

Bennett decided to travel to Moscow without consulting with his advisers, or with his political partners Lapid and Defense Minister Benny Gantz, who were both only updated after the decision, Walla reported Friday.

He has not held any in-depth discussions with the defense establishment or Foreign Ministry about the trip’s successes or failures, or about its implications for the Iran nuclear negotiations, the report said.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/ukraine-official-said-to-claim-bennett-pushed-zelensky-to-surrender-to-putin-deal/

Israel has been engaged in diplomatic efforts to try to end the war in Ukraine. Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has held talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin and spoke by phone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

A report carried by Israel's Walla news, the Jerusalem Post and U.S. news site Axios had suggested, citing an unidentified Ukrainian official, that Bennett had urged Ukraine to give in to Russia.

Israel, ""just as other conditional intermediary countries, does NOT offer Ukraine to agree to any demands of the Russian Federation,"" Ukrainian adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said on Twitter. ""This is impossible for military & political reasons. On the contrary, Israel urges Russia to assess the events more adequately.""

A senior Israeli official, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter, called the report ""patently false"".

""At no point did Prime Minister Bennett advise President Zelenskiy to take a deal from Putin - because no such deal was offered to Israel for us to be able to do so,"" the official said.

""Bennett has at no point told Zelenskiy how to act, nor does he have any intention to.""

The official said Friday that Bennett is ""using the mediation as an excuse to justify the fact that Israel is avoiding transferring military aid to Ukraine or joining the sanctions slapped on Russia.""

The official added that Bennett is serving as a mailbox between Ukraine and Russia and that the Israeli prime minister pressured Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to accept Russian President Vladimir Putin's conditions for ending the war.

Last week, Bennett met with Putin in Moscow to discuss the Ukraine crisis, followed by a phone call with Zelenskyy.

The two leaders met for three hours. Less than 24 hours after their meeting in Moscow, Bennett and Putin spoke again by phone. According to a statement from the Prime Minister's Office, Bennett also spoke with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron following the phone call with Putin.

The official went on to say that mediation does not mean passing messages between the sides, adding that a mediator needs to present a viable compromise, ""to reach a result. Should this happen we'll be grateful. Other counties can provide mail services and Israel's natural stance"" has no advantage under these circumstances.

In his last phone call with Zelenskyy, Bennett tried to convince the Ukrainian president to accept Putin's offer, the official said.

""When Bennett told him he should accept the Russian stance, Zelenskyy replied: 'I heard you, thanks,'"" the official said, adding that Bennett wants Ukraine to surrender.

A source from Bennett's office later said that the Ukrainian official's description of the prime minister's conversion with Zelenskyy is untrue.

""The prime minister did not recommend that Zelenskyy accept Putin's offer, as Israel does not know what that offer is. In any case Bennett does not intend to give Zelenskyy recommendations or advice on how to act at any stage,"" the source said.

According to the source, the talk between Bennett and Zelenskyy was successful. ""The prime minister's efforts are directed at one thing – to stop the bloodshed in Ukraine and the unnecessary suffering,"" the Prime Minister's Office added.

Zelenskyy is interested in speaking before the Israeli parliament next week. If Knesset Speaker Mickey Levy does not allow him to speak before the plenum, or guarantee that a significant number of lawmakers attend, he plans to speak before Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial or broadcast his speech to the Israeli public at Tel Aviv's Rabin Square.



""Zelenskyy is exhausted from conversations with leaders, he wants to talk to the public,"" the officials explained.

Meanwhile, the Israeli Embassy has begun mapping out the 20 major Israeli companies operating in Russia, in an attempt to persuade them to voluntarily join the sanctions next week, as other international companies have done.

This comes after the Israeli government clarified there is no legislation allowing it to force private companies to sever or limit ties with Russia.",https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-bennett-wants-ukraine-to-surrender-official-says-israel-s-mediation-useless-1.10668879
