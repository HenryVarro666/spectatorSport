(ANSA) - PARIS, MARCH 17 - France must strengthen its army to be ready to respond to ""a high-intensity war that can return to our continent"": candidate president Emmanuel Macron said, presenting at the Aubervilliers Docks, just outside Paris, its electoral program ahead of the presidential elections of 10 and 24 April.

Addressing the more than 300 reporters gathered on the spot, Macron insisted on the need to strengthen the autonomy of France and Europe in the face of future challenges, starting with the defense sector which has returned to disruptive topicality after the invasion of Ukraine by Vladimir Putin's Russia. .

The candidate president, favored in the polls in view of the vote, has evoked a defense budget equivalent to 50 billion euros in 2025. But to ""gain flexibility in the face of new types of conflict, space, cyber"", the founder of En Marche also intends to ""invest cutting-edge technologies and strengthen investments to be able to guarantee a high-intensity war that can return to our continent "".

He also hoped that France would be ""the first nation to escape from its dependence on oil, gas and coal"".

24 days before the presidential election, Emmanuel Macron reveals the main lines of his program. The president-candidate, still caught up in the war in Ukraine, took the time during a press conference at the Docks de Paris to discuss the central themes of his campaign. Emmanuel Macron has put forward his proposals on social aid, employment, pensions, school or even health. Europe 1 takes stock.

A reform of the RSA with “15 to 20 hours of weekly activity”

First, the outgoing president mentioned a reform of the RSA with “a better balance of rights and duties” and “the obligation to devote 15 to 20 hours a week” to an activity facilitating professional integration. “The beneficiaries of the RSA have in a way been the victims of our poor collective organization and our nation organized itself first by dividing skills”, lamented the outgoing president, considering that “no one considers that this dignity is recognised, respected, with a service”. Emmanuel Macron also proposed a transformation of Pôle Emploi renamed “France Travail”.

Automatic payment of social assistance

Emmanuel Macron has undertaken, if he is re-elected, to have social aid paid “at source”, automatically, which according to him would benefit the “20 million French people” who receive the RSA, the bonus. activity, housing aid or family allowances. Taking up this promise of 2017, he said he wanted to “simplify” this aid so that all French people who are entitled to it can receive it, but also to fight against fraud.

School and health, two “major projects”

The president-candidate declared Thursday that school and health would be “two major projects” of his second five-year term, if he were re-elected, promising a “new method” based on “broad consultation”. “On school and health, it is clear” that the policy implemented since 2017 “has been enough”, he acknowledged while presenting his program for the presidential election.

It is therefore necessary “that we manage to mobilize energies differently” to “give back to those who do it on a daily basis the possibility of adapting the solutions to the realities on the ground and in some way getting out of the war of position in which we are “, he added. It is therefore a question of “changing the method collectively” and, for the school, “beginning with a broad consultation to discuss the best way to achieve the objectives (…) by bringing all the stakeholders around the table”.

As part of “a new pact for teachers”, “it will be necessary to continue to increase salaries significantly”, which will be linked to “the definition of new missions”, according to Emmanuel Macron. Measures will be taken to guarantee the “replacement of absent teachers because we owe our students and their parents the full teaching hours”.

The candidate also intends to give “more freedom for establishments” in order to “value expertise in the field”, as he announced as part of the Marseille recovery plan. In the field of health, “we must succeed in going much further, faster and stronger”, in particular by strengthening “the prevention policy”, “the simplification of the hospital and its governance” and the improvement of “access to emergency care”. The Minister of Health Olivier Véran announced Thursday the organization of “a major conference” on the health system if Emmanuel Macron was re-elected in April.

A program valued at 50 billion euros

Emmanuel Macron has estimated the cost of his presidential program at 50 billion euros per year, to which will be added 15 billion per year in tax cuts, half benefiting households, half businesses. These expenditures, in particular for education, health and autonomy, will be financed in particular by savings through the pension reform, with the postponement of the retirement age to 65, and on unemployment benefits, a he estimated.

Regarding retirees, he also wants the elderly to be able to adapt their housing thanks to a “prime adapt'” on the model of the premium renov. He promises to hire 50,000 nurses and caregivers in nursing homes.

A “citizen’s agreement” on the end of life

Emmanuel Macron estimated that a “citizen convention” would be suitable to settle the debate on the end of life in the context of a possible second term. “On this subject, I hope that we can move forward in a peaceful way, which is why I think it is a good subject for a citizens’ convention”, argued the outgoing president, adding that “on the basis of the conclusions ” of such a Convention, he would submit ” to the national representation or to the people the choice to go to the end of the path which will be recommended “, that is to say by referendum.

The outgoing president also closed the door to the establishment of GPA.

An overhaul of the pact between “the army and the nation”

Drawing lessons from the war in Ukraine, the president-candidate pleaded for a “refoundation of the pact” between “the army and the nation”. He also wanted to “intensify” investments “to be able to face a high-intensity war, which can “return to our continent”. We must “think about how we manage to strengthen, restore vitality to this pact” which is ” so essential”, he continued, referring to “the generalization of universal national service” as well as “the increase in reservists who will be doubled”.

For immigration, faster removal procedures

The candidate Emmanuel Macron wants the establishment of faster and more effective removal procedures, and in particular with a system which will make the refusal of asylum worth the obligation to leave French territory. He wants to further tighten the visa policy if the states do not cooperate “with a return policy”. In return, he wants to fight against discrimination by resorting to “systematic testing” in companies.

Increase in the direct line allowance for inheritance tax

Emmanuel Macron announces that he wants to increase the direct line allowance from a parent to his child from 100,000 to 150,000 euros. He also proposes to review the indirect online allowance.

Advance on the autonomy of Corsica

Emmanuel Macron estimated Thursday that “a working process must now begin” on the autonomy of Corsica, but with a “return to calm” on the island beforehand. “The debate on the inclusion of Corsica in the Constitution, the question of competences and possibly autonomy is not a taboo debate. You heard me say it as a candidate five years ago and as president he more than four years ago,” said the president-candidate.

But “it is a debate that cannot be held until there is absolute calm, and it is a debate that supposes clarifying what is behind it” this notion of autonomy, has added Emmanuel Macron.

Energy, agriculture, institution: Macron’s latest proposals

The president-candidate wants to “change the price formation” of the European energy price mechanism. He also announces that he wants to “take back the capitalistic control of several industrial players”. Also, he wants to “invest massively for agricultural independence” and promises an orientation law on the installation, land, training and support for farmers. He also wants the objectives of the European farm to fork program to be reviewed.

The candidate wants to strengthen the autonomy of universities. He also plans to develop “more short and professionalizing courses”. He wants to “position research organizations in strategic sectors for French independence”. He also said he was in favor of a “European metaverse”, in reference to the creation of Facebook. In addition, he reiterated his desire to abolish the fee.

Finally, Emmanuel Macron wants to launch a cross-party commission to renovate the institutions. He wants to keep a “strong executive”, but a parliament with reinforced control missions. He reiterated his taste for proportional representation. It takes up a measure decided by Nicolas Sarkozy but buried under François Hollande, the creation of the territorial adviser.",https://globalhappenings.com/politics/127813.html

As expected, today has followed the trend of the previous ones, with an almost total protagonism of the artillery. General Graziano, President of the EU Military Committee has defined the current situation as «operational pause«. Whether or not the Russians are reorganizing and preparing for a long war, or trusting in a possible negotiated solution in the coming weeks, the death toll on both sides continues to grow and the destruction caused has swept away entire populations. The biggest danger right now is that, at this point, both the Russian and Ukrainian stakes have been so high that it is impossible for them to concede enough to reach a ceasefire and a possible peace agreement.

Today has been a day of speculation. From a possible airborne operationabout Odessa, until the preparations Russians for an imminent nuclear war, given the intense movement of VIP transport aircraft from Moscow to the central areas of the country. The latter can be interpreted as one more ""signalling"", in line with those of previous days. As it is not accompanied by other indicators, nor by any new declaration, it does not have greater meaning either. In fact, it could be a simple exercise, without much importance, so it is not necessary to give it more thought than necessary.

Speaking of speculation, one more day they have continued to cross publications about casualties. It is true that Russian casualties are easier to quantify, as the Ukrainians strive to bring them to light as soon as they manage to destroy a vehicle, shoot down a plane or whatever. By mere extrapolation, at least it follows that they are important. However, today we have also been able to see the shooting down of a Ukrainian Su-25 or the successful attack on a battery of 2A65 Msta-B towed howitzers. in other words, despite the disparity in the casualty figures and the disinformation on the part of one and the other, the Ukrainians will hardly be suffering less than the Russians.

Russian attack on the Ukrainian artillery.

At the institutional level, it should be emphasized that we know little or nothing about the course of negotiations between Ukraine and Russia today. If yesterday The Financial Times published a possible agreement based on 15 points that, according to the advisor to the Ukrainian presidency, only reflected the Russian position, today we have not had any news. Nor have they pronounced on one side or the other.

Of the meeting held as announced between the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Turkey Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu and his counterpart, Dmitro Kuleba, in Lviv there is no news either. Even so, the Turkish representative would have been somewhat more positive about his hopes for a ceasefire.

Furthermore, President Zelensky has spoken today before the Bundestag and reproaches Germany for its continued commitment to the economy and for prioritizing the supply of Russian gas in relation to Nord Stream 2. Regarding the decisions related to the gas pipeline and The sanctions state that “they are insufficient and are late”. The Ukrainian leader has raised the tone in his intervention before the German representatives, making allusions to the historical responsibility and warning of the ""construction of a new wall"".

On the other hand, his Minister of Defence Oleksii Reznikov has intervened before the Subcommittee on Security and Defence of the European Parliament. In his appearance and in line with everything expressed by the Ukrainian government in previous days, he has urged the EU to hit Russia with destructive sanctions and ""bite"" so that they cause a paralysis of its economy and force it to stop the aggression.

In this regard, he also urged EU Member States to supply more lethal weapons to Ukraine and calls again for the imposition of a no-fly zone over its territory. In line with President Zelensky's interventions before different national and international chambers, he asks MEPs: “What level of escalation is necessary to see more action?

For their part, the MEPs stated that they would support more sanctions packages to seat Russia at the negotiating table and posed questions about the participation of countries that are politically close to Russia. For example, they have referred to Kazakhstan or Armenia, and also if they considered that Belarus could join the war. They also raised the question of how to launch the investigation into possible war crimes committed on the territory of Ukraine.

Russian positions at Mariupol.

On the other hand, today the German Foreign Minister, Annalena Baerbock, has chaired a videoconference of the G7 Foreign Ministers in which the High Representative of the EU, Josep Borrell, also participated.

In this meeting, among other issues, they demanded that the Russian leaders comply with the provisional measures issued by the International Court of Justice in order to stop the attacks and withdraw its troops. In addition, they describe as inadmissible the siege of cities such as Mariupol and the denial of aid in these.

They have also emphasized the measures adopted within the G7 jointly with the European Union, and commit to substantially increase and disburse humanitarian aid. Also to help neighboring countries in the face of the pressure they are suffering, referring in particular to the case of Moldova, since the number of displaced persons has already exceeded 3,2 million. They especially highlight the consequences of the war on food security especially for countries dependent on the Ukrainian agricultural sector.

Kharkiv.

Another of the meetings of the day and related to the above, has been the one between NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and Chancellor Scholz, Defence Minister Lambrecht and Foreign Minister Baerbock in Berlin. In addition to congratulating Germany for the support offered both at a military, financial and humanitarian level, as well as for the reception of refugees, it has done so for the contribution to NATO's response. In particular, due to the deployment of additional troops in Lithuania and fighter aircraft in Romania.

Of course, one issue that was clearly going to come to the fore at this meeting is the aforementioned shift in German policy, having decided to increase defense spending to 2% of GDP. Moreover, the Secretary General has stated that due to this decision, also accompanied by the decision to acquire fifth-generation combat aircraft ""Germany is leading the way.""

Related to the above, are also noteworthing the statements like those of President Macron in which he states that ""We have to intensify our investments to be able to face a high-intensity war that can return to our continent.""

Situation map, according to the British Ministry of Defence.

To finish, one more day, the review of the main novelties of each theatre of operations:

North: Bombing continues on the capital, as well as on Chernigov, where it has been destroyed, among many other buildings, a football stadium. Russia has set up a new military hospital in Belarus, in this case in the town of Naroulia, indicative of the high number of victims they are receiving. There have also been images of a Turkish drone Bayraktar TB-2 used by the Ukrainians and would have been shot down.

Roman Catholic Pope Francis has denounced the “perverse abuse of power” on display in Russia’s war in Ukraine and called for aid to Ukrainians who he said had been attacked in their “identity, history and tradition” and were “defending their land.”

Ukraine war ups pressure for US oil; industry faces hurdles

In the oil fields of northern Montana, industry veteran Mac McDermott has watched crude prices whipsaw from $75 a barrel in January to more than $120 as Russia pressed its war in Ukraine, then down again when coronavirus worries in China raised the spectre of a global slowdown.

McDermott said his family-owned company will modestly increase drilling if oil prices stabilise. But for the next few months, he’s waiting on the sidelines and struggling to get enough workers to watch over roughly 100 oil wells the company operates. That includes some wells idled during the pandemic that he’s been trying to bring online since last year.

President Joe Biden’s move to ban Russian oil imports over its invasion of Ukraine was met with Republican demands to boost US production to address high petrol prices.

Latest Western arms supplies for Ukraine ‘not escalatory’: Analyst

Richard Weitz, a defence and military analyst with Wikistrat in Washington, DC, says the latest weapons supplies pledged for Ukraine by the US and other Western countries do not amount to an escalation.

“The weapons under discussion are the same that Western powers have been providing the Ukrainian armed forces for months, anti-air missiles, anti-tank and armour missiles, other types of light weapons. The S-300 systems that the Slovaks may provide are already in the Ukrainian inventory, and Russia has more advanced S-400 and S-500 systems,” he told Al Jazeera.

“So it seems to me, this is in line with what the alliance has been doing, providing the Ukrainians with the weapons and the munitions they need to replenish the stocks they have lost and take advantage of Russian tactical errors. But it’s not an escalatory move.”

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says his country is different from the one Russia found in 2014 when it seized Crimea without a fight and backed separatists as they took control of the eastern Donbas region.

“The occupants thought they were going to Ukraine which they had seen before, in 2014-2015, which they corrupted and were not afraid of. But we are different now,” he said. “And it allows us to defend ourselves against a full-scale attack for 22 days.”

Russia’s invasion ‘faltering’ amid logistical problems: UK

The British Ministry of Defence says logistical problems are continuing to beset Russia’s “faltering invasion of Ukraine”.

“Reluctance to manoeuvre cross-country, lack of control of the air and limited bridging capabilities are preventing Russia from effectively resupplying their forward troops with even basic essentials such as food and fuel,” the ministry said in its latest intelligence update.

“Incessant Ukrainian counterattacks are forcing Russia to divert large number of troops to defend their own supply lines. This is severely limiting Russia’s offensive potential,” it added.

Australia has placed sanctions on 11 additional Russian banks and government organisations, covering the majority of the country’s banking assets along with all entities that handle Russia’s sovereign debt.

“With our recent inclusion of the Central Bank of Russia, Australia has now targeted all Russian government entities responsible for issuing and managing Russia’s sovereign debt,” Minister for Foreign Affairs Marise Payne said in a statement.

She said Australia is also placing sanctions on two more Russian billionaires with links to business interests in the country – Oleg Deripaska and Viktor Vekselberg.

Huge fire at Kharkiv market; rescue worker reported dead

Russian shelling has caused a fire at Kharkiv’s Barabashovo market, among the largest in Eastern Europe, according to Ukraine’s public broadcaster, Suspilne.

Within five hours, the fire “engulfed almost the entire area” and spread to private homes nearby, it said.

“As emergency workers were extinguishing the fire, Russian troops struck the market again with missiles: one rescuer was killed and another was hospitalized with multiple injuries,” it added.

Rescue effort at Mariupol theatre hampered by ‘continuous shelling’

Mariupol city council says rescuers are continuing to clear rubble at the drama theatre and searching for survivors despite “continuous shelling”.

It said information about the victims “is still being clarified”.

More than a day after the air raid, there are no reports of deaths, and it is not clear how many people have emerged from the rubble.

One woman who said she had been preparing food for the people sheltering in the theatre said nearly 800 civilians were in the building when it was hit.

“I’d say only a hundred or so managed to disperse,” she said in a video circulated by Ukraine’s far-right Azov Battalion. The rest “are likely under rubble because there were a lot of people in the basement under the stage. And it’s the stage that got hit.”

Ukraine urges FATF to blacklist Russia

Dmytro Kuleba, the Ukrainian foreign minister, has called on member states of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global financial crimes watchdog, to exclude Russia from the consortium.

Kuleba said the member states must also designate Russia on “FATF’s blacklist without delay”.

Zelenskyy thanks Italy for offer to rebuild Mariupol theatre

Ukraine’s Zelenskyy has thanked the Italian government for offering to rebuild the theatre in the southern city of Mariupol that Kyiv says was bombed by Russian forces.

Italy’s Culture Minister Dario Franceschini had said his country is ready to reconstruct the building, adding that “theatres of all countries belong to the whole [of] humanity”.

“You set a good example to follow. Together we will rebuild the country to the last brick,” Zelenskyy responded on Twitter.

A no-fly zone is a ‘military operation’: Analyst

A US-enforced no-fly zone over Ukraine would effectively be a “military operation” that risks escalating the conflict, Alyssa Demus, a senior policy analyst at the RAND Corporation think-tank, has said.

“In theory, it sounds like a good idea,” Demus told Al Jazeera. “But then when you get into the nitty-gritty of what a no-fly zone means in practice, it really is a military operation. So I think Russia would perceive that as a pretty significant escalation, and they’re a nuclear state.”

Former Russian foreign minister condemns Kremlin’s diplomats

A former Russian foreign minister who served under Boris Yeltsin has condemned the Kremlin’s diplomats, calling their conduct during the country’s invasion of Ukraine “disgusting”.

Speaking to United Kingdom broadcaster Sky, Andrei Kozyrev said that Russian diplomats should resign, accusing them of having “disgraced themselves” by defending the invasion.

“They just spread the propaganda, and it’s not for decent diplomats to spread propaganda,” he said.

“They’ve disgraced themselves and listening to them or kind of negotiating with them under the circumstances is just a waste of time and waste of your own self-respect,” Kozyrev added.

US pushing China to pressure Russia to end war: AJE correspondent

Al Jazeera’s Rosiland Jordan has said the Biden administration is ramping up its public pressure campaign on China, urging the country to exert influence on Putin to end the invasion.

So far, China has taken what it describes as a neutral stance on the war, as it largely shies away from intervening in the affairs of other nations, Jordan reported from Washington.

“They have this ‘don’t meddle’ policy,” she said. “But the US is trying to pressure Beijing into actually taking a stand – not just a legal stand, but a moral stand, as well.”

5,000 children born into Ukraine conflict: UNICEF official

A spokesperson for the UN’s child agency, UNICEF, has said at least 5,000 children have been born into the conflict raging in Ukraine.

“Each one of these [children] is an individual story, it’s a child who’s had their life turned upside down. It’s a family who have had their family torn apart,” Joe English told Al Jazeera from the western Ukrainian city of Lviv.

“The children of Ukraine need peace urgently and they need it now,” English added.

Why Security Council will not vote on Russia’s ‘humanitarian’ draft resolution

Al Jazeera’s Kristen Saloomey, reporting from the UN, said Ukraine’s ambassador delivered “an impassioned response” at the Security Council to Russia’s denial that it is the aggressor in the conflict.

Russia had put forward a humanitarian resolution that was expected to come up for a vote on Friday, Saloomey explained, but Moscow said it would no longer bring that measure to a vote.

“It was clear the US was not going to back that without wording in that resolution acknowledging that the reason for the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding there is the Russians’ aggression,” she said.

Friday’s meeting will still take place, she said, but the focus will be on Russia’s allegation of US-backed biological laboratories in Ukraine – a claim the US, Ukraine and other allies have rejected.

Ukraine says 3,810 people evacuated from cities: Interfax agency

A total of 3,810 people have been evacuated from Ukrainian cities through humanitarian corridors on Thursday, the Interfax Ukraine news agency cited a senior official as saying, a far smaller number than on Wednesday.

Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk told a briefing that approximately 2,000 people managed to leave the besieged city of Mariupol. President Zelenskyy said more than 60,000 people had been evacuated on Wednesday.

Moscow rejects reports of Russian atrocities as ‘propaganda’

Russian Ambassador to the UN Vasily Nebenzya has rejected reports of atrocities in Ukraine as “propaganda”.

Nebenzya described allegations that Russia is targeting hospitals and residential areas, including recent accusations that Russian forces bombed a theatre sheltering civilians in the besieged southern city of Mariupol, as “fakes”.

“The hyped-up campaign of lies and disinformation in Ukraine is reaching new and new heights,” Nebenzya told the Security Council.

US Congress moves to revoke Russia’s ‘most favoured nation’ trade status

The US House of Representatives has overwhelmingly approved legislation to revoke Russia’s “most favoured nation” trading status, bringing the US closer to imposing higher tariffs and restrictions on Russian imports.

The House’s 428-8 vote sends the bill, requested by President Biden, to the Senate for likely approval as soon as next week.

The bill also would allow Biden to impose more penalties on Russian officials under the US’s Global Magnitsky Sanctions law.

‘War is causing suffering well beyond Ukraine’s borders,’ says UK envoy

British Ambassador to the UN Barbara Woodward has called on Russia to end the war, saying that the conflict is causing suffering worldwide, not just in Ukraine.

“President Putin’s war is causing suffering well beyond Ukraine’s borders,” Woodward told the UN Security Council.

“Thousands of students – many from nations around this table – have been caught up in the violence. The war is spiking food and energy prices, bringing further pain to countries in the developing world already suffering from the impact of COVID and famine and conflict and climate. Millions of refugees have been taken in by countries across Europe.”

More than 700 civilians killed so far in Ukraine, UN says

More than 700 civilians – including 52 children – have been killed in Ukraine since Russia invaded but the “actual number is likely much higher”, UN political affairs chief Rosemary DiCarlo told the Security Council.

“Hundreds of residential buildings have been damaged or destroyed, as have hospitals and schools,” DiCarlo said.

She added that the UN human rights agency has recorded 726 deaths, as well as 1,174 people injured, including 63 children, between February 24 and March 15. DiCarlo did not specify who was to blame. “This demands a thorough investigation and accountability,” she said.

US envoy to UN calls on Putin to ‘end this madness’

Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US envoy to the UN, has said the only way to end the war is for Putin to stop the invasion and withdraw Russian troops from Ukraine.

“There’s only one way, one way to end this madness,” Thomas-Greenfield told the UN Security Council.

“President Putin, stop the killing; withdraw your forces; leave Ukraine once and for all.”

Canada unveils new pathway to temporary residency for Ukrainians

Canada has unveiled details of a new immigration scheme that will allow Ukrainians to stay in the country for up to three years as temporary residents.

The government said overseas applicants must apply for a Canadian visitor visa online and provide fingerprints and a photo, and it also encouraged applicants to apply for a three-year work permit at the same time.

Ukrainian workers, students and visitors and their relatives already in Canada can also apply to extend their stay for up to three years, Ottawa said.

Blinken accuses Russia of committing ‘war crimes’

The US Secretary of State has accused Russia of committing war crimes in Ukraine, echoing Biden, who on Wednesday called Putin a “war criminal”.

“Intentionally targeting civilians is a war crime. After all the destruction of the past three weeks I find it difficult to conclude that the Russians are doing otherwise,” Blinken told reporters.

Still, Blinken said US State Department experts are in the process of documenting and evaluating potential war crimes to help international efforts towards accountability.

DRIVING THE DAY: WHAT THE UKRAINE WAR MEANS FOR ELECTIONS

CAMPAIGN MODE: Less than three months ago, Playbook predicted in our first newsletter of 2022 that a series of elections this spring would be crucial for the EU. Those elections in France and Hungary are still taking place as planned. But the arrival of war within the Continent has upended everything. Here’s how the war in Ukraine is shaping the election debates as voters in France and Hungary prepare to go to the polls in the coming weeks:

VIVE LA FRANCE: The French will vote in the first round of the presidential election on April 10 with a runoff scheduled for April 24. Incumbent President Emmanuel Macron, whose La République en Marche party stormed to victory in 2017, announced his candidacy on March 3 as the Russian invasion of Ukraine was in full swing. Having faced criticism from the French press for only giving a handful of fully-fledged press conferences during his mandate, he is expected to be grilled on his election manifesto at a three-hour press conference later today.

Latest polls: Macron was already the favorite going into this election, but his chances of victory now look even more solid. With just over three weeks to go, he has opened up a 12 percentage point lead over his nearest rival, Marine Le Pen from the far-right National Rally, sitting comfortably at 30 percent support for the first round of voting, according to POLITICO’s Poll of Polls. For comparison, Macron’s margin of victory in 2017 was much tighter after the first ballot, at 24 percent to Le Pen’s 21.3 percent.

His lead in the second round, however, looks narrower than the last time around: If he faces off against Le Pen again in the runoff, polls show he’d win 58 percent to Le Pen’s 42 percent, while in 2017, the results were 66.1 percent to 33.9 percent.

**A message from EBB: The transport sector represents a quarter of the EU’s total GHG emissions, and is the only European sector with emissions continuing to increase. Electrification cannot happen overnight, or in all transport modes. Sustainable biodiesel is today’s most widely used renewable fuel in the transport sector — why not invest more in what’s already working?**

Wartime president: Macron’s decision to keep talking to Russia’s Vladimir Putin as the bombs rain down may have divided opinions in Europe, where he is accused of everything from naivety to appeasement. But it appears to be playing well domestically where he is benefiting from the “rally round the flag” effect.

His performance at the first televised face-off among candidates (which wasn’t quite a debate, per Macron’s preference) on Monday night demonstrated this leader’s advantage. As our Paris colleagues report, his rivals had a hard time matching the gravitas of France’s commander-in-chief and he was barely criticized for his handling of the war, even by candidates with very different foreign policy platforms. His plan to raise France’s retirement age to 65 and reform France’s pension system may be a more difficult sell, however.

Surprise trends: There are some interesting developments regarding the other candidates. Remarkably, Le Pen’s well-documented links with Russia don’t seem to be hurting her. She is polling second to Macron and has seen her support rise slightly in recent weeks. Eric Zemmour, the TV pundit who is seeking to beat out Le Pen for right-wing support, is trending down in the polls, while the defection of Le Pen’s niece Marion Maréchal to Zemmour is not proving to be the ratings boost the Zemmour camp had hoped for. POLITICO’s Clea Caulcutt explains that Le Pen’s early focus on energy prices and knack for homing in on cost-of-living issues may have paid off.

Où est Valérie? The conservative candidate Valérie Pécresse, who beat figures like former EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier for her party’s nomination, is failing to make an impact amid signs that voters are gravitating toward Macron. POLITICO’s Poll of Polls has her at 11 percent, tied with the far-left politician Jean-Luc Mélenchon in the first round.

What’s next? Macron is expected to present his full campaign plan at today’s event in Aubervilliers, outside Paris, but has indicated he may not participate in any upcoming debates before the first round of voting.

ORBAN’S CLOSE RACE: While France looks poised to re-elect its incumbent leader Macron, on the other side of the Continent, Hungary’s own right-wing Prime Minister Viktor Orbán is facing a make-or-break ballot on April 3. Orbán is the longest-serving national leader at the European Council table, holding office uninterrupted since 2010 and previously serving as PM from 1998 to 2002.

His Fidesz party has moved steadily to the right over the years, prompting a clash with Brussels over rule-of-law standards and finally parting ways with the European People’s Party in the European Parliament last year.

Election dynamics: Six opposition parties have joined forces to try to oust Orbán, led by Péter Márki-Zay, the charismatic and feisty mayor of Hódmezővásárhely. (You can read Playbook’s interview with him here.)

With just over two weeks to go until the election, the Ukraine war is featuring heavily in the campaign. Orbán, who is considered Putin’s closest ally in the EU, reiterated his pledge not to send help to Ukraine or get involved in the war, stating that no Hungarian should be “left between the Ukrainian anvil and the Russian hammer” at a rally on Tuesday. Márki-Zay has highlighted Orbán’s links with Putin, casting the election as a chance for Hungary to reaffirm its commitment to the EU and the West. Former Polish Prime Minister and ex-European Council President Donald Tusk also spoke at this week’s opposition rally.

Poll predictions: The few reliable polls in Hungary suggest the opposition coalition is narrowly trailing Fidesz, but Orbán’s message of stability may resonate. The timing of a war on Hungary’s doorstep, coupled with a media landscape that is far from free, may be just the election boost Orbán needs as he seeks a fourth consecutive term in office.

Some reprieve for Orbán? Meanwhile, the conflict in Ukraine seems to have taken some pressure off of Orbán, at least in Brussels, with the EU’s campaign to uphold the rule of law temporarily running aground amid the fog of war. In the months before the war, the Commission had been turning up the heat on wayward members like Poland and Hungary, but now Brussels’ attention has shifted. Lili Bayer has the full story on how fears are mounting that the EU will prioritize wartime unity over policing democratic standards.

UKRAINE LATEST

BOMBING OF MARIUPOL: Russian bombs hit a theater in the southern Ukrainian port city of Mariupol on Wednesday, local authorities said — the latest atrocity in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. While the number of casualties was still unknown overnight, Ukrainian officials said up to 1,200 people may have been sheltering at the theater. Could this be the red line that tips the West toward further action?

Russia continues to deny it’s targeting civilians and has blamed a far-right Ukrainian militia for the Mariupol attack, Reuters reports.

Sanctions debate: The horrific attack comes as the EU weighs its next steps in terms of sanctions, ahead of a key meeting of EU ambassadors on Friday. Moving to the next level of penalties may expose some old diplomatic faultlines: Germany is highly wary of Polish and Baltic exhortations to hit Putin where it hurts and sever the all-important energy income that helps fuel his war in Ukraine. Read more on the decisions facing the EU as it mulls further retaliatory measures here.

Warning about loopholes: As the EU continues to focus on enforcing sanctions that have already been agreed, EU Financial Stability Commissioner Mairead McGuinness warned that “there will be consequences” for lawyers and accountants who help oligarchs to evade sanctions. “We need to ensure that those who provide services — financial, legal and others — to oligarchs to facilitate sanctions evasion are fully aware of the risks they run,” she said after Wednesday’s meeting of G7 justice and finance ministers.

BIDEN CALLS PUTIN A ‘WAR CRIMINAL’: U.S. President Joe Biden dramatically stepped up his criticism of Putin on Wednesday, calling the Russian leader a “war criminal” — a comment that predictably provoked a furious response from Moscow, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov describing the remarks as “unacceptable and unforgivable.”

The U.S. on Wednesday also announced it will give an extra $800 million in new military aid to Ukraine, including so-called “switch-blade” drones. But the package stopped short of meeting the demands of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who urged the U.S. to send jets and introduce a no-fly zone in his powerful address to the U.S. Congress on Wednesday.

Nothing new from NATO: Similarly, there were few signs from NATO of any substantive change in position. Speaking after a meeting of defense ministers Wednesday in Brussels, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said “we have no plans for deploying NATO troops on the ground in Ukraine,” despite Poland’s suggestion of sending a peace-keeping mission to Ukraine. Stoltenberg will meet German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Berlin today.

EU WEIGHS MORE DEFENSE FUNDS: EU ambassadors will consider a proposal to use another €500 million under the European Peace Facility at a meeting today of the Political and Security Committee (PSC), the Council body that deals with defense and security issues.

Explainer: Top EU diplomat Josep Borrell prematurely said EU leaders had considered this move at their meeting in Versailles last week, only to be contradicted by a number of leaders after the summit, who said that no figure had been discussed. Nonetheless, leaders did commit to “an increased use of the European Peace Facility” in their Versailles declaration. The EU has already signed off on a €500 million package for Ukraine, €450 million of which is for lethal defense equipment — the first time the EU has provided lethal weaponry to a third country.

Next steps: If agreed today, the proposal will go to ambassadors on Friday, and then to foreign affairs ministers for approval when they meet in Brussels on Monday.

NEW PROPOSALS IN MAY: The prospect of new defense funding for Ukraine comes as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the Inter-parliamentary Conference on Stability, Economic Coordination and Governance in the European Parliament this week that she will bring forward new defense proposals in May.

The Commission will present a new analysis that will examine “defense investment needs, gaps and opportunities both at national and at European level,” she said. “It will be crucial that our resources are invested strategically on joint European projects that ensure interoperability in the field and enable defense industry to scale up across national borders,” she told MEPs. “We need to spend not only more, but more together.”

AIRPLANE PROBLEMS: Another issue for the EU to work out: How to get back a massive number of airplanes leased to Russian airlines by European owners, after Putin approved a law this week switching the jets over to the Russian airplane registry, making their return very difficult. Mari Eccles has the story.

COUNCIL OF EUROPE LATEST: The Council of Europe’s committee of ministers expelled Russia on Wednesday over its invasion of Ukraine, a day after Moscow walked out of the organization. The Russian flag was lowered outside the Council of Europe’s headquarters in Strasbourg shortly after the vote — a potent visual reminder of how far Russia has fallen within the international community. Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba welcomed the move, saying there is “no place for Russia in European bodies.”

TALK OF PEACE: Despite the deteriorating situation on the ground, there appeared to be some optimism about potential peace talks. Zelenskyy said talks with Russia were becoming “more realistic,” while the Financial Times reported on a 15-point “peace plan” that is under consideration.

NOW READ THIS: POLITICO’s Douglas Busvine takes us inside the diary of a Chechen warlord, Ramzan Kadyrov, aka “Putin’s attack dog,” who has posted a series of voice messages, videos and written texts online since Russian troops launched their all-out assault on Ukraine last month.

PARIS COURT OPENS WAR CRIME PROBE: France’s antiterrorism prosecution office opened an investigation into possible war crimes after the killing of Fox News journalist Pierre Zakrzewski, a French-Irish national, AFP reports.

IMMIGRATION IMPACT

WHERE’S THE MONEY? With the EU taking in millions of Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion, talk has turned to how countries on the front line can cope with the influx of people.

Top topic: The issue will be front and center at the eighth EU Cohesion Forum, which begins this afternoon and will feature top leaders like von der Leyen and other commissioners. The event takes place every few years and is intended to provide an update on the use of EU cohesion funds — money directed to poorer EU countries to help narrow the gap between richer and poorer members. But, as with every aspect of EU policy, this year’s event will be overshadowed by the Ukraine war.

EU response: The EU is looking at ways to redirect unused cohesion funds to help support countries. As we reported in Playbook last month, countries were already struggling to use their cohesion allocations as they raced to prioritize accessing NextGenerationEU coronavirus recovery money — an issue vocally raised by Bulgarian MEP Andrey Novakov.

Redirecting funds: Speaking to Playbook ahead of today’s conference, Cohesion Commissioner Elisa Ferreira said the EU executive is fast-tracking ways to deploy funding to countries dealing with a substantial number of refugees.

“While cohesion funding is a long-term policy tool to help poorer regions catch up and converge, we have been able to create some margins of flexibility as we did during the COVID pandemic,” she said.

Options: Countries will immediately be able to access funds under the REACT-EU program, but will also be eligible for money under the Cohesion’s Action for Refugees in Europe (CARE) initiative. The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) can be tapped for any type of measure to support people fleeing Ukraine.

Timeframe: Accessing resources under CARE needs to be approved by both Parliament and Council. But the Portuguese commissioner told Playbook she is confident this can be achieved by the end of this month or early April. “As was the case during COVID when we had agreement very quickly, I’m hoping that the process will be swift once again.”

With an estimated 3 million Ukrainians fleeing their country so far, and more likely to come to the EU, the clock is ticking to offer robust resources quickly.

COVID CORNER

IRISH PM TESTS POSITIVE FOR COVID WHILE IN WASHINGTON: Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin tested positive for COVID-19 while in Washington to meet President Biden and for St. Patrick’s Day celebrations, POLITICO’s Myah Ward reports. Martin had to leave an Ireland Funds Gala event, where he was photographed sitting maskless beside U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. More details here.

IS FRIDAY THE NEW SATURDAY? After two years of pandemic-induced working-from-home, the notion of a four-day work week has been gaining momentum. Just last month, the Belgian government agreed to give employees the possibility of compressing the country’s statutory 38 working hours into four days, provided their bosses agree. Paola Tamma has more on why Friday could become the new Saturday for more people.

BRUSSELS CORNER

NEW JOB: Former EU Transport Commissioner Violeta Bulc has joined the board of the Joint European Disruptive Initiative (JEDI), a European funding agency that promotes disruptive technology.

BLUE + YELLOW = GREEN: It may be St. Patrick’s Day, but you may not see iconic buildings around Brussels illuminated in the traditional emerald green this year. Instead, the Bozar center will be lit up in blue and yellow, for instance. The Irish government’s global “greening” initiative has been paused to allow buildings the world over to display the colors of the Ukrainian flag instead.

**A message from EBB: The transport sector is the only European sector with emissions continuing to increase. That’s a huge challenge for EU countries, which need to reduce those emissions by 90 percent by 2050. There’s no silver bullet to achieve this, but one answer is right in front of us: biodiesel. The EU is the leading biodiesel producer at global level, and the demand for this renewable fuel is set to skyrocket over the next decades, especially from hard to decarbonize sectors like freight, aviation and maritime transport. Biodiesel is now most commonly used to fuel passenger cars, but its benefits don’t stop at the pump — its byproducts are growing in importance in fields like cosmetics or plastics. Since electrification cannot happen overnight, it’s time for the EU to take its role as the leading biodiesel producer to a whole new level and accelerate the green transition. Learn more here.**
