Greenfield told the international body that the U.S. believes Russia could use chemical or biological agents for assassinations as part of a false flag incident or to support tactical military operations.

“And we are deeply concerned that Russia’s calling for this meeting is a potential false flag effort in action — exactly the kind we have been warning about, including from Secretary Blinken here in the security council last month,” she said.

The U.S. has “serious concerns” that Russia may be planning to use chemical or biological agents against the Ukrainian people.

According to Greenfield, Russia has a “track record of falsely accusing other countries of the very violations that Russia itself is perpetrating.”

She added that the U.N. security council meeting revealed Russia’s objectives to the world, and “exposed Russia’s lies,” which she called “a malicious effort to cover for the atrocities being committed by Russia as part of their illegal and unprovoked attack on Ukraine.”

Greenfield also backed previous statements by U.S.officials warning of Russia’s potential use of biological weapons in Ukraine and said, “the intent behind these lies seems clear, and it is deeply troubling.”

The ambassador excoriated the pretext for the security council hearing and added, “Russia is attempting to use the Security Council to legitimize disinformation and deceive people to justify President Putin’s war of choice against the Ukrainian people.”

The former assistant secretary of State for African Affairs said that China has also been spreading disinformation in support of Russia’s “outrageous claims.”

She added that the U.N. is not aware of any biological or chemical weapons programs in Ukraine.

“Ukraine does not have a biological weapons program. There are no Ukrainian biological weapons laboratories supported by the United States — not near Russia’s border or anywhere,” she said.

Her remarks came shortly after the Russian permanent representative to the U.N., Vasily Nebenzya, alleged that there was a biological weapons plot by Ukraine and the U.S to use migratory birds and bats to spread pathogens, The Guardian reported.

Multiple administration officials on Wednesday pushed back against Russian allegations that the United States was developing bioweapons in Ukraine as “false” and “laughable.”

President Biden on Friday warned that Russia would pay a severe price if it launched a chemical weapons attack during its invasion of Ukraine.

“I’m not going to speak about the intelligence … but Russia would pay a severe price if they use chemical weapons,” Biden said.",https://thehill.com/policy/international/russia/597899-us-says-russia-lying-about-chemical-plot-to-set-up-attack/

Security Council meeting Friday for “lying and spreading disinformation” as part of a potential false-flag operation by Moscow for the use of chemical or biological agents in Ukraine.

Watch Thomas-Greenfield’s remarks in the player above.

U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Russia was playing out a scenario put forth in the council last month by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken — that President Vladimir Putin would “fabricate allegations about chemical or biological weapons to justify its own violent attacks against the Ukrainian people.”

“The intent behind these lies seems clear, and is deeply troubling,” she said. “We believe Russia could use chemical or biological agents for assassinations, as part of a staged or false-flag incident, or to support tactical military operations.”

Russia had requested the council meeting to address its allegations of U.S. “biological activities” in Ukraine — a charge made without any evidence and denied by both Washington and Kyiv.

Britain’s U.N. Ambassador Barbara Woodward, called the allegations “utter nonsense” and said “Russia is sinking to new depths today, but the council must not get dragged down with it.”

U.N. disarmament chief Izumi Nakamitsu told the council she was aware of media reports about allegations of biological weapons programs and said: “The United Nations is not aware of any biological weapons programs.”

Thomas-Greenfield said Ukraine doesn’t have a biological weapons program or biological weapons laboratories supported by the United States, as Russia claimed. Ukraine does own and operate its own public health laboratory facilities which make it possible to detect and diagnose diseases like COVID-19 which the U.S. has assisted Ukraine in doing “safely and securely.”

Thomas-Greenfield said that ever since Russia began building up forces near Ukraine’s borders, Washington’s strategy has been to counter Moscow’ tactics and share what it knows with the world.

“We’re not going to let Russia get away with lying to the world or staining the integrity of the Security Council by using it as a venue for legitimizing Putin’s violence,” she said.

“We do not sit in this chamber to be an audience for Russia’s domestic propaganda,” Thomas-Greenfield added. “And we should not allow Russia to abuse its permanent seat to spread disinformation and lies nd pervert the purpose of the Security Council.”

The U.N. human rights office has received “credible reports” that Russian forces are using cluster munitions in Ukraine, including in populated areas which is prohibited under international humanitarian law, Undersecretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo told the Security Council.

“Indiscriminate attacks, including those using cluster munitions, which are of a nature to strike military objectives and civilians or civilian objects without distinction, are prohibited under international humanitarian law,” DiCarlo said. “Directing attacks against civilian and civilian objects, as well as so-called area bombardment in towns and villages, are also prohibited under international law and may amount to war crimes.”

Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia replied that the allegations are “refuted repeatedly by our Ministry of Defense.”

The Russian request for the Security Council meeting, tweeted Thursday by its first deputy U.N. ambassador, Dmitry Polyansky, followed a U.S. rejection of Russian accusations that Ukraine is operating chemical and biological labs with U.S. support.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova had made the accusation earlier this week, following a warning from White House press secretary Jen Psaki that Russia might use chemical or biological weapons against Ukraine in the invasion.

Psaki called Russia’s claim “preposterous” and tweeted: “This is all an obvious ploy by Russia to try to justify its further premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified attack on Ukraine.”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also denied Russia’s accusation. Like Psaki, he said the accusation itself was a bad sign.

“That worries me very much because we have often been convinced that if you want to know Russia’s plans, they are what Russia accuses others of,” he said late Thursday. “No chemical or any other weapon of mass destruction has been developed on my land. The whole world knows this.”

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby called the Russian claim “a bunch of malarkey.”

Olivia Dalton, spokesperson for the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, said “Russia has a well-documented history of using chemical weapons and has long maintained a biological weapons program in violation of international law” as well as “a track record of falsely accusing the West of the very violations that Russia itself is perpetrating.”

U.N. disarmament chief Izumi Nakamitsu and U.N. political chief Rosemary DiCarlo also were scheduled to brief the council Friday.

U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric reiterated Thursday that the World Health Organization, which has been working with the Ukrainian government, “said they are unaware of any activity on the part of the Ukrainian government which is inconsistent with its international treaty obligations, including on chemical weapons or biological weapons.”

The United States for months has warned about Russian “false flag” operations to create a pretext for the invasion, which began Feb. 24.

The White House warning, and Dalton’s statement Thursday, suggested Russia might seek to create a pretense for further escalating the 2-week-old conflict that has seen the Russian offensive slowed, but not stopped, by stronger-than-expected Ukrainian defenders.

The international community for years has assessed that Russia used chemical weapons in carrying out assassination attempts against President Vladimir Putin’s opponents such as Alexei Navalny, now in a Russian prison, and former spy Sergei Skripal, who lives in the United Kingdom. Russia also supports the Syrian government, which has used chemical weapons against its people in an 11-year civil war.",https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-u-s-accuses-russia-of-using-u-n-council-to-spread-disinformation-about-bioweapons-in-ukraine

Thomas-Greenfield also recalled that the United States had warned the world about the Kremlin's intentions to create a pretext for invading Ukraine, including with narratives about the alleged development of chemical and biological weapons in Ukraine.

Russia called the meeting of the 15-member U.N. Security Council to reassert through its envoy Vassily Nebenzia, without providing evidence, that Ukraine ran biological weapons laboratories with U.S. Defense Department support.

Member countries called the claim ""a lie"" and ""utter nonsense"" and used the session to accuse Russia of deliberately targeting and killing hundreds of civilians in Ukraine, assertions that Russia denies in a 15-day offensive it calls ""a special military operation.""

Izumi Nakamitsu, the U.N. High Representative for Disarmament Affairs, told the council the United Nations is ""not aware"" of any biological weapons program in Ukraine, which joined an international ban on such arms, as has Russia and the United States along with 180 other countries.

Under a 2005 agreement, the Pentagon has assisted several Ukrainian public health laboratories with improving the security of dangerous pathogens and technology used to research. Those efforts have been supported by other countries and the World Health Organization.

The WHO told Reuters on Thursday that it had advised Ukraine to destroy high-threat pathogens housed in its public health laboratories to prevent ""any potential spills"" that would spread disease among the population. read more

The U.S. envoy to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said Washington was ""deeply concerned"" that Russia called the session as a ""false flag effort"" to lay the groundwork for its own use of biological or chemical weapons in Ukraine.

Although she provided no evidence of an imminent Russian threat during the meeting, she said: ""Russia has a track record of falsely accusing other countries of the very violations that Russia itself is perpetrating.""

She added: ""We have serious concerns that Russia may be planning to use chemical or biological agents against the Ukrainian people.

""The intent behind these lies seems clear, and it is deeply troubling,"" she said. ""We believe Russia could use chemical or biological agents for assassinations, as part of a staged or false flag incident, or to support tactical military operations.""

RUSSIA CITES U.S. 2003 IRAQ ASSERTION

Responding to Thomas-Greenfield's statement, Nebenzia recalled then-U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell's 2003 Security Council testimony when he presented what Washington claimed was proof that Iraq was hiding banned weapons of mass destruction programs.

The United States used the assertion, which turned out to be false, to justify its 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq.

Answering the Russian envoy, Thomas-Greenfield said: ""I know that you expect me to respond but we're not going to give any more airtime to the lies that you're hearing today.""

U.S. allies echoed Thomas-Greenfield's concerns that Russian President Vladimir Putin's government was spreading the claim of a U.S.-backed bioweapons program in Ukraine to prepare its own chemical or biological attacks in Ukraine.

""The council should not be served with fantasies or starry-eyed stories, but with proof independently verified and collaborated,"" said Ferit Hoxha, the ambassador of NATO member Albania.

""We should therefore be very worried that in spreading such disinformation, a crescendo of allegations about weapons of mass destruction could serve as yet another pretext for Russia to prepare the ground and use chemical or biological weapons during its ongoing invasion of Ukraine,"" he said.

French Ambassador Nicholas de Riviere noted, as did several other envoys, that Russia allegedly used a nerve agent in failed attempts to kill jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny and a former Russian intelligence officer, Sergei Skripal, who defected to Britain, and his daughter.

Russia denies these allegations.

Speaking to reporters earlier on Friday, U.S. President Joe Biden warned Russia that it would pay a ""severe price"" if its military should use chemical weapons against Ukraine.

KVIV: Russia gave holdout Ukrainian soldiers an ultimatum on Sunday to lay down arms in the pulverized southeastern port of Mariupol which Moscow said its forces nearly completely controlled in what would be its biggest capture of the nearly two-month war.

Several hours after the 0300 GMT deadline there was no sign of compliance by Ukrainian fighters holed up in the vast Azovstal steelworks overlooking the Sea of Azov.

Having failed to overcome Ukrainian resistance in the north since President Vladimir Putin’s Feb. 24 invasion, the Russian military has refocused on the eastern Donbas region where Mariupol is the main port.

The Russian Defense Ministry said its troops had cleared the urban area of Mariupol, which has seen some of the fiercest fighting and worst civilian suffering with bodies littering streets and thousands hunkered down in atrocious conditions underground.

The steelworks, one of Europe’s biggest metallurgical plants with a maze of rail tracks and blast furnaces, has become a last stand for the outnumbered defenders.

“The Russian Armed Forces offer the militants of nationalist battalions and foreign mercenaries from 06:00 (Moscow time) on April 17, 2022, to stop any hostilities and lay down their arms,” the defense ministry said in a statement.

“All who lay down their arms are guaranteed that their lives will be spared,” it said, offering the defending “remnants” a four-hour window to leave the plant without arms or ammunition.

There was no immediate response from Kyiv to the ultimatum, though Ukraine’s military said Russian air strikes on Mariupol continued along with assault operations near the port.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia on Saturday of “deliberately trying to destroy everyone” in Mariupol and said his government was in touch with the defenders. But he did not address Moscow’s claim that Ukrainian forces were no longer in urban districts.

He said killing his troops would put paid to peace efforts.

“Our soldiers are blocked, the wounded are blocked. There is a humanitarian crisis... Nevertheless, the guys are defending themselves,” he told the Ukrainska Pravda news portal.

If Russia’s capture of the port is confirmed, it would be the first major Ukrainian city to fall since the invasion and a strategic prize for Moscow: connecting territory that it holds in Donbas with the Crimea region it annexed in 2014.

Russia calls its action a special military operation aimed at demilitarizing Ukraine and clearing out what it calls dangerous nationalists.

Russia said Ukraine had lost more than 4,000 soldiers in Mariupol as of Saturday. Kyiv says between 2,500 and 3,000 Ukrainian troops have died so far in the war nationwide

It was not known how many soldiers were in the steelworks. Satellite images have shown smoke and fire coming from the area, which is riddled with tunnels underneath.

Mariupol’s defenders have included Ukrainian marines, motorized brigades, a National Guard brigade and the Azov Regiment, a militia created by far-right nationalists that was later incorporated into the National Guard.

Elsewhere around Ukraine, there were reports of more Russian long-range strikes on Sunday.

Local media reported an explosion in the capital Kyiv, though deputy mayor Mykola Povoroznyk said air defense systems had thwarted Russian attacks. The mayor of Brovary city, close to Kyiv, said a missile attack had damaged infrastructure.

And Russia said it had destroyed an ammunition factory near the capital, according to the RIA news agency.

Ukraine resisted Russian ground advances in the early phase of the war, in part by successfully deploying mobile units armed with Western-supplied anti-tank missiles against armored convoys confined to roads by muddy terrain.

Despite the desperate situation in Mariupol, Ukraine says it has so far held off Russian forces elsewhere in the Donbas regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.

Western sanctions have squeezed Russia’s economy but failed to pressure Putin into a withdrawal.

“The intent behind these lies seems clear, and it is deeply troubling,” Linda Thomas-Greenfield said. “We believe Russia could use chemical or biological agents for assassinations, as part of a staged or false-flag incident, or to support tactical military operations.”

Thomas-Greenfield was responding to her Russian counterpart, Vasily Nebenzya, who had accused the US of funding bioweapons research in Ukraine involving the “spreading of particularly dangerous infections using migratory birds.”

“There was another project where the vectors or potential agents of biological weapons, bats were considered amongst priority areas for study,” Nebenzya claimed. ‘”They include the bacterial and viral pathogens that could spread from bats to people such as plague, leptospirosis, as well as … coronaviruses.”

He further alleged the work “is being done and funded and supervised by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency of the United States.”

The White House has publicly admonished Russia for making such claims and warned this week of possible false-flag operations.

“Russia has a track record of accusing the West of the very violations that Russia itself is perpetrating,” press secretary Jen Psaki said on Twitter Wednesday. “In December, Russia falsely accused the U.S. of deploying contractors with chemical weapons in Ukraine.”

“This is all an obvious ploy by Russia to try to justify its further premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified attack on Ukraine,” she added before warning that “we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them. It’s a clear pattern.”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has called the Russian claims worrying.

“We have often been convinced that if you want to know Russia’s plans, they are what Russia accuses others of,” he said Thursday. “No chemical or any other weapons of mass destruction have been developed on my land. The whole world knows this.”

“There’s nothing to it. It’s classic Russian propaganda,” he told reporters. “And, and I wouldn’t, if I were you, I wouldn’t give it a drop of ink worth paying attention to.”

Friday’s UN Security Council meeting came at Russia’s request so it could make the allegations before an international audience. The claims were first made by Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova earlier this week.

The ministry doubled down on Friday, tweeting: “Radical Ukrainian groups under the control of US special services’ representatives have prepared several potential scenarios of using of toxic #chemicals to carry out #provocations. Objective – to accuse Russia of chemical weapons use vs civilians.”

While there is a network of biological labs in Ukraine that have received funding and support from the US since the 1990s, they are owned and operated by the Eastern European country and are a part of an initiative called the Biological Threat Reduction Program, according to the Associated Press.

The program works to reduce the likelihood of natural and manmade outbreaks.

UNITED NATIONS -- The United States accused Russia of using a U.N. Security Council meeting Friday for ""lying and spreading disinformation"" as part of a potential false-flag operation by Moscow for the use of chemical or biological agents in Ukraine.

U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Russia was playing out a scenario put forth in the council last month by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken -- that President Vladimir Putin would ""fabricate allegations about chemical or biological weapons to justify its own violent attacks against the Ukrainian people.""

""The intent behind these lies seems clear and is deeply troubling,"" Thomas-Greenfield said. ""We believe Russia could use chemical or biological agents for assassinations, as part of a staged or false-flag incident, or to support tactical military operations.""

The United States has warned about such Russian operations in conjunction with an invasion, which began Feb. 24.

Russia had requested the meeting to address its allegations of U.S. ""biological activities"" in Ukraine -- an accusation made without any evidence and denied by both Washington and Kyiv.

Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said its Defense Ministry had documents alleging that Ukraine has at least 30 biological laboratories carrying out ""very dangerous biological experiments"" involving pathogens, and its work ""is being done and funded and supervised by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency of the United States.""

Ukraine does have a network of biological labs that have gotten funding and research support from the U.S. -- but they are owned and operated by Ukraine and are part of an initiative called the Biological Threat Reduction Program that aims to reduce the likelihood of deadly outbreaks, whether natural or man-made.

Britain's U.N. Ambassador Barbara Woodward called the allegations ""utter nonsense"" and said that ""Russia is sinking to new depths today, but the council must not get dragged down with it.""

""We do not sit in this chamber to be an audience for Russia's domestic propaganda,"" Thomas-Greenfield said. ""And we should not allow Russia to abuse its permanent seat to spread disinformation and lies and pervert the purpose of the Security Council.""

She also accused Russia's ally, China, of ""spreading disinformation in support of Russia's outrageous claims."" China's U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun expressed concern at Russia's accusations and urged an investigation to ""provide a comprehensive clarification and accept a multilateral verification.""

Woodward said the Security Council must not be ""an audience for Russia's domestic propaganda"" and must remain focused on Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine's U.N. Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya said Moscow's accusations ""may actually point at Russia preparing another horrific false-flag operation.""

The U.N. human rights office, meanwhile, has received ""credible reports"" that Russian forces are using cluster munitions in Ukraine, including in populated areas which is prohibited under international humanitarian law, Undersecretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo told the Security Council.

Russia requested the emergency meeting to discuss its claims that Ukraine had an active bioweapons and chemical weapons program supported by the US and sought to blunt criticism it has faced for days that its allegations are false.

“Western colleagues are going to be saying now that all of this information is fake and Russian propaganda,” Russia’s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said. “But this is self-delusion.”

UN officials said they have no evidence of such facilities and Thomas-Greenfield said the US has long supported legitimate medical research to help officials counter disease outbreaks.

“These facilities make it possible to detect and diagnose diseases like COVID-19, which benefit us all,” Thomas-Greenfield said.

“The United States has assisted Ukraine to do this safely and securely. This is work that has been done proudly, clearly, and out in the open.”

American and European officials could have rallied to oppose the Russian request for the hearing, but they signaled their view that it was better to go forward to have more public debate.

Russia’s critics said it was trying to turn the tables on an international body where it was largely isolated in the weeks leading up to the war and to use the symbolic forum of the UN Security Council to promote unsubstantiated claims.

“The Council should not be served with fantasies or starry-eyed stories but with proof, independently-verified and corroborated,” Albania’s UN ambassador, Ferit Hoxha, said. “This is not the case.”

China provided some support for Russia’s claims and said they should be properly addressed. And the country’s ambassador, Zhang Jun, rejected US charges that Beijing spreads disinformation.

He countered with criticism that the US maintains or supports biological research institutions around the world. And he called for diplomatic efforts between Moscow and Kyiv to accelerate.

“What is most needed now continues to be to intensify diplomatic efforts, reduce tension and bring the Ukrainian issue back to the track of a political settlement as soon as possible,” Zhang said.

Thomas-Greenfield didn’t cite specific evidence to back up her claim that Russia may be preparing a false-flag event that would be a pretext to the use of chemical or biological weapons.

But she cited Russia’s support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has repeatedly used chemical weapons; it’s alleged poisoning of dissidents abroad; and said the accuracy of American intelligence in the lead up to the war provided support for the US claim.

“From the beginning, our strategy to counter Russia’s tactics has been to share what we know with the world transparently,” Thomas-Greenfield said. “And candidly, we have been right more often than we’d like.”

Russia rejects charges it poisons dissidents and has called Ukraine and NATO the aggressors in the Ukraine war.

Responding to the criticism from other envoys, Russia’s Nebenzia took the microphone again to dispute charges a maternity hospital in Mariupol was damaged by a Russian missile strike, calling the event fake news and saying Ukrainians mined their own hospital to make Moscow look bad.

“We’re not going to give more air time to the lies you’re hearing here,” Thomas-Greenfield said in response.
