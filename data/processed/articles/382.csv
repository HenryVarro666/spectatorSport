The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Journalists in Bucha, a suburb northwest of Kyiv, watched as Ukrainian soldiers backed by a column of tanks and other armoured vehicles used cables to drag bodies off of a street from a distance, fearing they may have been rigged to explode.

Locals said the dead were civilians who were killed by departing Russian soldiers without provocation.

One AFP reporter said they had seen at least 20 bodies on the ground. Bucha’s mayor, Anatoliy Fedoruk, said more than 300 residents had been killed.

“Those people were just walking and they shot them without any reason. Bang,” said a Bucha resident who declined to give his name citing safety reasons. “In the next neighborhood, Stekolka, it was even worse. They would shoot without asking any question.”

Ukraine said on Saturday its forces had seized back all areas around Kyiv, claiming complete control of the capital region for the first time since Russia launched the invasion.

Troops have retaken more than 30 towns and villages around Kyiv since Russia pulled back from the area this week, Ukrainian officials said.

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky warned in his nightly video address that departing Russian troops were creating a “catastrophic” situation for civilians by leaving mines around homes, abandoned equipment and “even the bodies of those killed”.

Boris Johnson spoke with Mr Zelensky on Saturday evening, a Downing Street spokesperson said.

“He congratulated Ukraine’s brave armed forces for successfully pushing back Russia’s invading army in a number of areas, but recognised the huge challenges that remain and the immense suffering being inflicted on civilians,” they added.

The prime minister updated Mr Zelensky on the progress made at the recent military donor conference, convened by the UK with 35 countries, No 10 said, and “committed to continue to step up defensive support”.

Russia has vowed to target UK weapons shipped into Ukraine after one of its helicopters was reportedly shot down by a British-made missile.

Andrey Kelin, Moscow’s ambassador in London, claimed Britain’s decision to send arms supplies to the Ukrainian army had made the war “even bloodier”.

His comments came after the Starstreak high-velocity missile system, supplied to Ukraine by Britain in March along with anti-tank weapons, was involved in an attack on a Russian aircraft in the Luhansk region.

They also follow British defence secretary Ben Wallace’s promise to send more lethal aid to Kyiv.

Mr Kelin told the Tass news agency: “All arms supplies are destabilising, particularly those mentioned by Wallace.

David Arakhamia, a Ukrainian negotiator, reportedly indicated draft peace treaty documents were at an advanced enough stage to allow for direct consultations between the two nations’ leaders.

The Interfax Ukraine agency quoted Mr Arakhamia as telling Ukrainian television Russia accepted Ukraine’s overall position, with the exception of its stance on Crimea.

In the east, a Red Cross convoy was again seeking to evacuate civilians from the besieged port city of Mariupol after abandoning an attempt on Friday because of a lack of security guarantees. But that renewed mission was not expected to reach the port until at least Sunday.

The Russian Defence Ministry blamed the Red Cross for humanitarian aid columns being unable to reach the city on Friday or Saturday.

RIA news agency cited a senior official as saying due to the actions of the Red Cross, the convoys had left very late and were not able to reach Mariupol on time.

Russia has depicted its drawdown of forces near Kyiv as a goodwill gesture in peace negotiations, but Ukraine and its allies say Russian forces have been forced to regroup after suffering heavy losses.

Pope Francis on Saturday came the closest he has yet to criticising Russian president Vladimir Putin since the invasion began on 24 February.

During a visit to Malta, the head of the Catholic Church criticised the “infantile” war in Ukraine, saying the world thought such behaviour was a thing of the “distant past”.

He said: “Once again, some potentate, sadly caught up in anachronistic claims of nationalist interests, is provoking and fomenting conflicts, whereas ordinary people sense the need to build a future that, will either be shared, or not be at all.”

Missing Ukrainian photographer and videographer Maksim Levin, who was working for a Ukrainian news website and was a long-time contributor to Reuters news agency, was found dead in a village north of Kyiv on Friday.

Concerns were raised for the 41-year-old journalist after he went missing on 13 March while photographing fighting taking place near the capital.

The big picture: Bucha Mayor Anatoly Fedoruk tweeted Saturday images of bodies with hands tied behind their backs in the city, northwest of Kyiv. ""We have already buried 280 people in mass graves,"" he told AFP, which also captured images of bodies in Bucha's streets.

""These people were not in the military. They had no weapons. They posed no threat,"" Fedoruk said in his Twitter post.

Meanwhile, Ukraine's Defense Ministry tweeted Saturday that during several weeks of Russian occupation of Bucha, ""civilians were being executed arbitrarily,"" some had their hands tied behind their backs, their bodies scattered in the streets of the city.""

The defense ministry shared a video on Twitter of Ukrainian troops driving through Bucha that showed bodies strewn in the streets.

Axios has deemed images of the bodies too graphic to publish, but the devastation of the city is clear from the shells of buildings left behind.

Some lie face down on the pavement while others are collapsed on their backs, mouths open in a tragic testament to the horrors of Russian occupation .

The hands of one man are tied behind his back with a piece of white cloth. Another man lies alone, tangled up in a bicycle by a grassy bank. A third man lies in the middle of the road, near the charred remains of a burned-out car.

The shocking images of the carnage in Bucha were captured by Agence France-Presse on Saturday, the same day Ukraine declared the town liberated from Russian troops. Accounts of alleged Russian atrocities are emerging as its forces retreat from areas near Kyiv following a failed bid to encircle the capital.

The town of Bucha has endured five weeks of near-constant firefights. Now officials and human rights groups are blaming the civilian deaths on the departed Russian forces.

""Corpses of executed people still line the Yabluska street in Bucha. Their hands are tied behind their backs with white 'civilian' rags, they were shot in the back of their heads. So you can imagine what kind of lawlessness they perpetrated here,"" Bucha mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk told Reuters on Saturday.

Ukrainian soldiers are pictured in Bucha on Saturday, after Russian troops retreated from the area.

In a video address Sunday after the reports out of Bucha, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for an end of Russian ""war crimes.""

""The world has already seen many war crimes. At different times. On different continents. But it is time to do everything possible to make the war crimes of the Russian military the last manifestation of such evil on earth,"" he said.

Zelensky called on Russian leaders to be held accountable for the actions of the nation's military.

""I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being fulfilled. Such orders. Such a fulfillment. And joint responsibility. For these murders, for these tortures, for these arms torn off by explosions that lie on the streets. For shots in the back of the head of tied people. This is how the Russian state will now be perceived. This is your image,"" Zelensky said.

The alleged atrocities in Bucha have drawn international outrage, with Western leaders, including US Secretary of State Antony Blinken , calling for war crimes investigations and increasing sanctions on Russia.

CNN has not been able to independently confirm the details around the men's deaths.

In his address, Zelensky announced a ""mechanism of justice"" would be established to investigate crimes committed by Russian soldiers in Ukrainian territory. The mechanism would be supported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Prosecutor General's Office, the National Police, the Security Service, the Intelligence Service and other government branches, he said.

""This mechanism will help Ukraine and the world bring to concrete justice those who unleashed or in any way participated in this terrible war against the Ukrainian people and in crimes against our people,"" he said.

Zelensky said he will provide more information on the state of Ukrainian territory that was occupied by Russian forces.

""All partners of Ukraine will be informed in detail about what happened in the temporarily occupied territory of our state. War crimes in Bucha and other cities during the Russian occupation will also be considered by the (United Nations) Security Council on Tuesday,"" he said.

He also noted that efforts are underway to restore electricity and water to Bucha, as well as reestablishing medical institutions and infrastructure.

Zelensky once again invoked the need for stronger sanctions against Russia.

""There will definitely be a new package of sanctions against Russia. But I'm sure that's not enough. More conclusions are needed. Not only about Russia, but also about the political behavior that actually allowed this evil to come to our land,"" he said.

Asked during an appearance earlier Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" if Russia was carrying out genocide in his country, Zelensky said: ""Indeed. This is genocide.""

""The elimination of the whole nation, and the people. We are the citizens of Ukraine. We have more than 100 nationalities. This is about the destruction and extermination of all these nationalities,"" he said.

The Russian Ministry of Defense has claimed the extensive footage of Bucha was ""fake,"" saying ""not a single local resident suffered from any violent actions"" during Russia's occupation of the city. ""In the settlements of the Kiev region, Russian military personnel delivered and issued 452 tons of humanitarian aid to civilians,"" it said in a statement.

A separate statement claimed the footage was staged. ""Stories about Bucha appeared in several foreign media outlets at once, which looks like a planned media campaign,"" the statement said. ""Taking into account that the troops left the city on March 30, where was the footage for four days? Their absence only confirms the fake.""

The Russian government has consistently responded to allegations of civilian casualties inflicted by Russian forces with blanket denials. After the Russian air force bombed a maternity hospital on March 9, Russian officials attempted to cast doubt on widespread media reports, with one Russian diplomat accusing a victim of the bombing -- a woman who escaped from the bombing, bloodied and still pregnant -- of being an actor and not a real victim.

Mass grave

The toll of the Russian invasion was apparent at a mass grave in Bucha. People cried as they attempted to locate the bodies of lost loved ones at a grave located in the grounds of the Church of St. Andrew and Pyervozvannoho All Saints on Sunday, according to a CNN team at the scene.

Bucha residents told CNN that bodies were first buried in the grave in the first few days of the war. They believe 150 people are buried in the site, many of whom were civilians killed in the fighting around Bucha.

CNN saw at least a dozen bodies in body bags piled inside the grave. Some were already partially covered.

The mayor of Bucha said in public remarks Saturday that up to 300 victims could be buried at the site.

CNN was unable to independently verify those numbers or the identities and nationalities of those buried in the grave.

The earth on the church grounds appeared to have been recently moved so it is feasible that more bodies could be buried there.

Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said Sunday that reports emerging from towns in the Kyiv region revealed a ""post-apocalyptic picture"" of life under Russian occupation.

""This is a special appeal aimed at drawing the world's attention to those war crimes, crimes against humanity, which were committed by Russian troops in Bucha, Irpin and Hostomel,"" Arestovych said. ""These are liberated cities, a picture from horror movies, a post-apocalyptic picture.""

""Victims of these war crimes have already been found, including raped women who they tried to burn, local government officials killed, children killed, elderly people killed, men killed, many of them with tied hands, traces of torture and shot in the back of the head. Robberies, attempts to take gold, valuables, carpets, washing machines. It, of course, will be taken into account by the Prosecutor's Office of Ukraine and law enforcement agencies and international criminal courts.""

Bodies lie in a street in Bucha on Saturday. A portion of this photo has been blurred to protect the victim's identity.

The evidence of apparent atrocities in Bucha came as Human Rights Watch (HRW) announced it had documented allegations of war crimes in the occupied areas of the Kyiv, Chernihiv and Kharkiv regions.

HRW said Sunday that the allegations include ""a case of repeated rape; two cases of summary execution, one of six men, the other of one man; and other cases of unlawful violence and threats against civilians between February 27 and March 14, 2022.""

In Bucha, Russian forces ""rounded up five men and summarily executed one of them"" on March 4, HRW wrote. A witness told the group that soldiers forced the men to kneel on the road and pulled their shirts over their heads, before shooting one of the men in the back of the head.

HRW also alleges that on February 27, six men were rounded up in the village of Staryi Bykiv in the Chernihiv region and later executed.

In Malaya Rohan, a village in the Kharkiv region, a Russian soldier repeatedly raped a woman in a school where she was sheltering with her family on March 13, the victim told HRW. ""She said that he beat her and cut her face, neck, and hair with a knife,"" HRW wrote. The woman fled to Kharkiv the following day, ""where she was able to get medical treatment and other services.""

And in the village of Vorzel, 31 miles northwest of Kyiv, Russian soldiers ""threw a smoke grenade into a basement, then shot a woman and a 14-year-old child as they emerged from the basement, where they had been sheltering,"" HRW said.

""The cases we documented amount to unspeakable, deliberate cruelty and violence against Ukrainian civilians,"" Hugh Williamson, HRW's Europe and Central Asia director, said in the statement. ""Rape, murder, and other violent acts against people in the Russian forces' custody should be investigated as war crimes.""

CNN has not independently verified the details of the HRW report and has requested comment from the Russian defense ministry.

Sunday's developments in Ukraine have hastened calls for war crimes investigations.

Blinken said the State Department would help document any atrocities the Russian military committed against Ukrainian civilians.

""You can't help but see these images as a punch to the gut,"" he told CNN's Dana Bash on ""State of the Union"" Sunday, when asked about the civilian killings in Bucha.

""Since the aggression, we've come out and said that we believe that Russian forces have committed war crimes, and we've been working to document that, to provide the information we have to the relevant institutions and organizations that will put all of this together. And there needs to be accountability for it.""

UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said in a statement Sunday that ""indiscriminate attacks against innocent civilians during Russia's illegal and unjustified invasion of Ukraine must be investigated as war crimes.""

European Union Council President Charles Michel vowed further sanctions on Russia, while United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said an ""independent investigation"" into the civilians killed in Bucha was ""essential.""",https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/03/europe/bucha-ukraine-civilian-deaths-intl/index.html

On the streets of Bucha – a town of roughly 35,000 near the capital Kyiv – bodies of what appear to be civilians lay, some with evidence suggesting they were killed at close range.

What happened in Bucha, Ukraine?

Over the weekend, news outlets began to report the deaths of civilians in the streets of Bucha as Ukrainian forces reentered the town.

Taras Shapravskyi, deputy mayor of Bucha, said 50 of some 300 bodies found were the victims of extra-judicial killings carried out by the Russians. The Kremlin has rejected those accusations.

“Half measures are not enough anymore. I demand most severe sanctions this week, this is the plea of the victims of the rapes and killings. If you have doubts about sanctions, go to Bucha first.”

Where is Bucha in Ukraine?

Bucha is a small town on the outskirts of the capital, Kyiv.

It had a population of roughly 35,000 before the war began, and is a neighbour to the towns of Irpin and Hostomel.

According to Google Maps, Bucha is roughly 28 kilometres away from downtown Kyiv.

Last week, Russia announced it would begin to scale back its operations in northern Ukraine and around Kyiv following peace talks in Istanbul.

However, despite the promise, Russian has continued its barrage of those areas while redistributing troops to the country’s east.

Why are the bodies just being found?

Ukraine’s forces have been fighting Russian troops around Kyiv since the full-scale war began just over a month ago.

Ukraine has put up a stiff resistance, and has begun recapturing towns outside the capital, including Bucha.

Shapravskyi said Moscow’s troops withdrew late last week from Bucha. Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said scores of killed civilians found on the streets of Bucha, and the Kyiv suburbs of Irpin and Hostomel, looked like a “scene from a horror movie.”

War crimes probe could take years, experts say

Last month, the International Criminal Court’s chief prosecutor said he had opened an investigation into possible war crimes in Ukraine.

Even before Bucha, Ukraine and its Western allies accused Russian forces of targeting civilians indiscriminately, referencing the bombing in the southern port of Mariupol of a maternity hospital and a theatre marked as housing children.

Canada has sent RCMP officers to assist in the investigation, but prosecution of Putin or other Russian leaders would face hurdles and could take years, legal experts say.

The International Criminal Court defines war crimes as “grave breaches” of the post-Second-World-War Geneva Conventions, agreements which set out the international humanitarian laws to be followed in war time.

Breaches include deliberately targeting civilians and attacking legitimate military targets where civilian casualties would be “excessive,” experts said.

Investigators could issue an arrest warrant if prosecutors can show “reasonable grounds to believe” war crimes were committed. To obtain a conviction, prosecutors would have to prove a defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

For most charges, that requires proving intent, and one way prosecutors could do it is to show there were no military targets in the area of an attack, and that it was not an accident.

“If it keeps happening again and again and the strategy appears to be to target civilians in urban areas, then that can be very powerful evidence of an intent to do so,” Alex Whiting, a visiting professor at Harvard Law School, told Reuters.

Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed serious sanctions on Russia in an effort to force it to withdraw its forces.

Zelenskyy has described Russia’s campaign as “genocide,” a term he has used at different times during the war, saying Putin was intent on eliminating the nation and its people.

One corpse had his hands bound by the white cloth, and appeared to have been shot in the mouth.

Russia's defence ministry issued a statement on Sunday saying that all photographs and videos published by the Ukrainian authorities alleging ""crimes"" by Russian troops in Bucha were a ""provocation.""

Bucha lies 37 km (23 miles) northwest of Kyiv city and this weekend when journalists visited and the authorities began making allegations of atrocities, it was a scene of shattered buildings and streets strewn with corpses.

""Any war has some rules of engagement for civilians. The Russians have demonstrated that they were consciously killing civilians,"" Fedoruk said.

Fedoruk said on Saturday that more than 300 residents of the town had been killed.

Reuters, which was taken to the scene by Ukrainian authorities, was not immediately able to verify the mayor's allegations.

Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, a Putin ally, said in a statement on Feb. 26 that Chechen forces would be fighting in Ukraine as part of Russia's special military operation, which was launched two days earlier.

Reuters was unable to determine if they operated in Bucha. A spokesman for Kadyrov did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In its statement, the Russian defence ministry said further that ""During the time that Russian armed forces were in control of this settlement, not a single local resident suffered from any violent actions"". It added that before Russian troops withdrew on March 30 they delivered 452 tons of humanitarian aid to civilians around the Kyiv region.

""For the entire time that the city was under the control of the Russian armed forces and, and afterwards, until today, in Bucha, local residents freely moved around the city and used cellular communications,"" the ministry said.

On Saturday Ukraine said its forces had retaken all areas around Kyiv and that it now had complete control of the capital region for the first time since the Russian invasion began on Feb 24.

AFTERMATH

Bucha lies in a strategically significant cluster of towns on the northwestern outskirts of Kyiv, near Irpin and Hostomel military airport. It was captured in the days immediately after the invasion by Russian forces who swept south toward the capital.

Bucha and the northern outskirts of Irpin were the point at which the main body of Russian troops and armour advancing from the northwest was halted after meeting with unexpectedly fierce resistance from Ukrainian forces.

The area witnessed some of the bloodiest fighting for the capital, until Russia pulled forces back from north of Kyiv saying it planned to focus on eastern Ukraine.

On Saturday, Reuters journalists saw bodies in civilian clothes lying in the streets of Bucha or half-buried in the soil, Ukrainian soldiers took photos of each other next to incinerated Russian armoured vehicles. read more

Hands and other body parts could be seen poking out from the soil, while on the streets bodies lay beside the bicycles people had apparently been riding when they were killed.

Alexander Syrsky, the Ukrainian general in command of Kyiv's defense, told reporters that the prosecutor's office, police and other agencies were working to de-mine the areas from with Russians had withdrawn, to identify bodies and ""to identify those who committed these crimes"".

Speaking at newly recaptured Hostomel airport, Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov said on Sunday: ""these are inhumans who simply committed crimes against civilians, raped, killed, shot them in the back of the head. The whole world needs to know about this"".

Reuters could not immediately verify his allegations.

The Kremlin denies that it has invaded Ukraine, saying it is carrying out a ""special military operation"" to degrade the Ukrainian armed forces and that it is targeting military installations rather than carrying out strikes on civilian areas.

WAR CRIMES INVESTIGATIONS

On Sunday the New York-based advocacy group Human Rights Watch (HRW) issued a statement saying it had found ""several cases of Russian military forces committing laws-of-war violations"" in Russian-controlled regions such as Chernihiv, Kharkiv, and Kyiv - citing Bucha as one location. read more

Russia's defence ministry did not immediately respond to questions about the specific allegations in the HRW statement.

On March 1, asked about separate allegations of war crimes related to strikes on civilians, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov asserted in a conference call with reporters that the government categorically denied this. He dismissed allegations made the previous day by Ukraine's ambassador to the United States of Russian strikes on civilian targets and the use of cluster bombs and vacuum bombs as fakes.

The International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, said last month he had opened an investigation into possible war crimes in Ukraine but said it represents ""myriad challenges, opportunities and difficulties"". Several legal experts said a prosecution of President Vladimir Putin or other Russian leaders would face high hurdles and could take years. read more

As Ukrainian armoured columns rolled into Bucha, a town north-west of the capital, they found streets blocked by burned-out Russian tanks and military vehicles, and strewn with the bodies of civilians whom locals said had been killed by the invading forces without provocation.

Photographs from the town showed a scene of devastation, with hunks of charred and destroyed tanks and armoured vehicles lined up along one street, along with dead bodies.

Reporters from Agence France-Presse saw at least 20 bodies, all in civilian clothing, strewn across a single street in Bucha, and the body of a missing Ukrainian photographer, Maksim Levin, was discovered in a nearby village.

Three of them were tangled up in bicycles after taking their final ride, while others had fallen next to bullet-ridden and crushed cars, AFP reported.

One had his hands tied behind his back with a white cloth, and his Ukrainian passport left open beside his corpse, said journalists who accessed the ravaged town.

“All these people were shot,” Bucha’s mayor Anatoly Fedoruk told AFP, adding that 280 other bodies had been buried in mass graves in the town. “These are the consequences of Russian occupation.”

Ukrainian soldiers in Bucha, who were welcomed warmly by residents of the town, attached cables to the bodies and pulled them off the street for fear they may be booby-trapped.

Soldiers also cleared barricades and inspected suspicious objects, placing red rags on remnants of unexploded ordnance to draw attention to the possibility of explosions.

As the town was liberated, one woman, Halyna Tovkach, 55, told the Guardian that she was searching for the body of her husband, Oleg, 62. He was killed by Russian soldiers along with their neighbours, two young boys and their mother, as they tried to escape the town on 5 March. “It is a war crime,” said Tovkach’s son.

Also allegedly among the civilians killed by the Russians was Olha Sukhenko, the head of the village of Motyzhin east of Kyiv, and her entire family.

An in another accusation of war crimes, Russian troops allegedly used children as “human shields” while regrouping.

Ukraine’s attorney general is gathering a dossier of claims about the Russian use of local children to avoid fire when in retreat from around Ukraine’s capital and elsewhere. Coaches of children were said to have been placed in front of tanks in the village of Novyi Bykiv, close to the encircled city of Chernihiv, 100 miles north of Kyiv.

Britain’s foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said she was “appalled by atrocities in Bucha and other towns in Ukraine”.

“Reports of Russian forces targeting innocent civilians are abhorrent. The UK is working with others to collect evidence and support @IntlCrimCourt war crimes investigation. Those responsible will be held to account,” Truss tweeted late on Saturday.

Ukraine and its western allies reported mounting evidence of Russia withdrawing its forces from around Kyiv and building its troop strength in eastern Ukraine. The visible shift did not mean the country faced a reprieve from more than five weeks of war or that the more than 4 million refugees who have fled Ukraine will return soon.

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, again repeated his warning that Russian troops want to capture the Donbas and the south of Ukraine. In his nightly video address on Saturday, Zelenskiy said “we are aware that the enemy has reserves to increase pressure in the east”.

He nevertheless promised to take the fight to the Russians in the Donbas and as they retreated from the Kyiv region.

“We are strengthening our defences in the eastern direction and in Donbas,” Zelenskiy said. “What is the goal of Russian troops? They want to capture both the Donbas and the south of Ukraine.”

But Zelenskiy complained that the “global security architecture has failed” and that Ukraine has “not yet received enough modern western anti-missile systems” from its western allies, nor given aircraft. He added: “Every Russian missile that hits our cities, and every bomb dropped on our people, on our children, only adds black paint to the history that will describe everyone on whom the decision depended.”

Sources reported a series of explosions in the southern port city of Odesa on Sunday morning.

“Odesa was attacked from the air. Some missiles were shot down by air defense,” the city council said in a brief statement on the Telegram messaging app. It said fires were reported in some areas but gave no indication what was hit in the attack.

Ukraine’s peace negotiator, David Arakhamia, reportedly said that Russia “verbally” accepts the Ukrainian position on peace talks, AFP reported, except for the issue of Crimea. Moscow had also agreed that a referendum on the neutral status of Ukraine “will be the only way out of this situation”.

Arakhamia also told Ukrainian television channels that any meeting between Zelenskiy and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, would “with a high probability” take place in Turkey.

Elsewhere, Poland’s deputy prime minister has accused France and Germany of being too close to Russia in an interview published on Sunday, as he condemned Berlin’s behaviour towards Moscow before the invasion of Ukraine.

“Germany, like France, has a strong bias in Moscow’s favour,” Jarosław Kaczyński, who is also leader of the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, told German daily Die Welt in an interview.

Kaczyński saved his strongest words for Berlin, saying that for years the German government did not want to see what Russia was doing under the leadership of Putin “and we see the result today”. He added that “Poland is not pleased with Germany’s role in Europe”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/03/they-were-all-shot-russia-accused-of-war-crimes-as-bucha-reveals-horror-of-invasion

“During the time this settlement was under the control of Russian armed forces, not a single local resident suffered from any violent actions,” the ministry said in a statement, saying Russia’s military delivered 452 tons of humanitarian aid to civilians there.

The ministry said all residents “had the opportunity to freely leave the settlement in the northern direction,” while the southern suburbs of the city “were fired at around the clock by Ukrainian troops.”

Photo and video of corpses strewn across the streets of Bucha were “another production of the Kyiv regime for the Western media,” it added.

The ministry said that all Russian units withdrew from Bucha on March 30, a day after Russia’s military announced it would be significantly reducing activity in northern Ukraine.

The statement came amid emerging evidence of the massacre of civilians as invading Russian troops retreated from Ukrainian areas they had been occupying.

Reporters saw dozens of bodies, all in civilian clothing, strewn along one street in the town of Bucha.

Residents of Bucha have given harrowing accounts of how Russian troops shot and killed civilians without any apparent reason.

At a logistics compound that residents said was used as a base by Russian forces, the bodies of eight men could be seen dumped on the ground, some with their hands tied behind their backs.

Residents said Russian troops would go from building to building, take people out of the basements where they were hiding from the fighting, check their phones for evidence of anti-Russian activity, and take them away or shoot them.

Ukrainian prosecutors investigating possible war crimes by Russia have found 410 bodies in towns near Kyiv, and 140 of them had been examined, Prosecutor General Iryna Venedyktova said on television on Sunday.
