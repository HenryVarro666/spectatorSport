On a call with reporters Friday afternoon, a senior Biden administration official said the president did not make specific requests of Xi in their call but made clear that China should not support Moscow in its invasion. Biden outlined for Xi the United States’ view of the conflict and Putin’s “actions and miscalculations,” the official said, and stressed that China would suffer “consequences” if it did offer assistance to Moscow. The official did not outline the specifics of the possible consequences or Xi’s reaction to the warning.

Xi did not indicate whether China would aid Russia or not, according to the official, who described the two-hour call as “direct,” “substantive” and “detailed.”

The Biden-Xi meeting comes as Russia continues to escalate its attacks on the sovereign nation, and is a potential watershed moment for the countries’ relationship. The United Nations has already confirmed nearly 2,000 civilian casualties, though the numbers are likely higher.

The Chinese Embassy readout of the call notably did not mention Russia by name, though it said the “Ukraine crisis is not something we want to see.” The White House has not yet released a statement on the almost two-hour-long secure video call, which ended around 11 a.m.

“The events again show that countries should not come to the point of meeting on the battlefield. Conflict and confrontation are not in anyone’s interest, and peace and security are what the international community should treasure the most. As permanent members of the UN Security Council and the world’s two leading economies, we must not only guide the China-US relations forward along the right track, but also shoulder our share of international responsibilities and work for world peace and tranquility,” the Chinese readout said.

Last week, China announced a “six point” plan for preventing a widespread humanitarian crisis in Ukraine and called the situation inside the country “deeply” concerning. Xi reiterated the six points during his call with Biden on Friday but didn’t suggest China had any meaningful role in encouraging Russia to end the conflict, according to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs readout of the call. Xi instead conveyed that this was the responsibility of the U.S. and its NATO allies.

Ahead of the Biden-Xi meeting, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said Friday that the Chinese president faces a historic choice amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine: Be a “true leader on the world stage” by siding with Ukraine, the U.S. and its allies or stand with Moscow as it launches its full-fledged attack on Ukraine. She said Biden would urge Xi to use his influence with Putin to “end this horrible war.”

“We hope that he chooses the right side of history here,” Sherman told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Friday. “That he ends this carnage, these attacks on civilians.”

Beijing has tried to walk a delicate line as Russian troops bombard Ukrainian cities and destroy civilian infrastructure. China has thus far avoided direct condemnation of its neighbor, maintaining its trade relationship with Moscow while expressing “concern” about the civilian deaths.

“We are all very candid, very direct about .. what the responsibility is of Xi Jinping if he wants to be a true leader on the world stage. If he wants to sign up to the principles of the U.N. Charter, which he says he does,“ Sherman said. “So we will see, whether in fact Xi Jinping makes the right choice here. His future is with the United States, with Europe, with developing countries around the world. His future is not with Russia and Vladimir Putin.“

Tension with Beijing built over the weekend, when Washington revealed intelligence and told reporters that Russia had requested economic and military assistance from China for its war against Ukraine. A senior U.S. official said the Chinese government had “responded to that request,” though offered no details on what the response was. Both Beijing and Moscow denied that such a request was made.

Nearly four hours after the call ended, and hours after China put out its own version of events, the White House released a readout of the meeting. While lacking concrete details, the 164-word U.S. account stressed that Biden made clear the ""implications and consequences"" if China aligns with Russia and provides it ""material support"" for its attacks.

""President Biden detailed our efforts to prevent and then respond to the invasion, including by imposing costs on Russia. He described the implications and consequences if China provides material support to Russia as it conducts brutal attacks against Ukrainian cities and civilians,"" the White House said.

A readout from China, released ahead of the White House's, described the call as ""constructive"" -- a word the Biden administration did not use.

A senior administration official described the video meeting as ""direct,"" ""substantive,"" and ""detailed,"" adding that Biden and Xi spend the ""preponderance of their time"" on Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

After that official said Biden ""really wasn't making specific requests of China"" on the call and that he was, instead, ""laying out his assessment of the situation, what he thinks makes sense, and the implications of certain actions,"" ABC News Senior White House Correspondent asked White House press secretary Jen Psaki, ""Why not, given the stakes here?""

""Because China has to make a decision for themselves about where they want to stand and how they want the history books to look at them and view their actions,"" Psaki replied. ""And that is a decision for President Xi and the Chinese to make.""

Psaki said Biden ""made clear what the implications and the consequences would be if China provides material support to Russia"" -- a line she repeated throughout the briefing, but she would not elaborate on whether the U.S. views military or economic aid as more of a concern or which direction they could be leaning towards if they provide help.

She also wouldn't say if Xi ever referred to Putin's war as an ""invasion,"" saying that the White House doesn't ""speak for other countries"" and the Chinese can ""speak for themselves.""

According to China's readout, Xi told Biden the ""situation in Ukraine has developed to such a point that China does not want to see it. China has always advocated peace and opposed war.""

But China has yet to directly condemn Russia for its actions in Ukraine.

China supports negotiations, Xi said, but deferred to the U.S. and NATO to ""conduct dialogue with Russia to solve the crux of the Ukraine crisis and resolve the security concerns of both Russia and Ukraine"" -- appearing to reaffirm China's view that the NATO expansion is the root cause of the war.

The readout said Xi's used two Chinese idioms to Biden: ""One hand cannot clap,"" meaning the two sides need to come together to make any progress in ending the war, and, he said, ""Only the one who tied the bell to the tiger can untie it,"" implying that the U.S. and NATO will need to ""untie the bell"" themselves, and China will support efforts.

China's president also criticized U.S. sanctions saying that it is the common people who suffer from them and that sanctions have the potential of triggering crises in the global economy, according to the readout

White House press secretary Jen Psaki had said Biden would be candid and that the call provided a chance for him to ""assess where President Xi stands."" The conversation would center on ""managing the competition between our two countries as well as Russia's war against Ukraine and other issues of mutual concern,"" according to the White House.

Biden was expected to warn Xi that if China directly helps Russia in its assault on Ukraine there will be consequences -- but it's still unclear if he laid out specific actions the U.S. will take if China were to supply Russia with military equipment or economic assistance to offset the impact of global sanctions.

In what appeared to be a warning shot to the West, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Friday that any foreign supplies to Ukraine containing military equipment will be considered ""legitimate targets"" for Russian strikes after Biden announced this week a slate of weapons the U.S. is supplying to Ukraine.

""We clearly said that any cargo moving into the Ukrainian territory which we would believe is carrying weapons would be fair game. This is clear because we are implementing the operation the goal of which is to remove any threat to the Russian Federation coming from the Ukrainian soil,"" Lavrov said in an English-language interview with the RT television channel.

Ukrainians woke up Friday to the first strike on the outskirts city of Lviv, considered a safe haven until now, and not far from the Polish border. It follows a stark warning from the Pentagon that Russia was broadening its target and escalating attacks this week.

While the Biden administration has hesitated from drawing red lines of what would change its position on not supporting a no-fly zone or troops on the ground in Ukraine, Lavrov's message raises concerns that Russia could fire at military bases in neighboring NATO ally Poland to Ukraine, triggering an Article 5 response.

Earlier this week, national security adviser Jake Sullivan had a seven-hour meeting with his Chinese counterpart in Rome, which was described as ""intense."" A senior Biden administration declined to tell reporters whether China had expressed an openness to providing Russia with military or economic support or if it had already provided support to Russia since it invaded Ukraine.

""We do have deep concerns about China's alignment with Russia at this time, and the national security adviser was direct about those concerns and the potential implications and consequences of certain actions,"" the official said.

That meeting had been ""long-planned"" and ""long-discussed"" as a way to maintain communication with China, but it happened to take place at ""a really timely and important moment in this crisis,"" the official added.

Biden and Xi's critical call comes on the heels of Biden labeling Putin a ""war criminal,"" a ""murderous dictator,"" and a ""pure thug"" in the last 48 hours. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Thursday he ""personally"" agrees with Biden that Russia has committed war crimes in Ukraine.

Sanger', 'Edward Wong']",2022-03-18 00:00:00,"U.S. and European officials see China’s role in the conflict as critical, and decisions by Mr. Xi could push the war in different directions — perhaps toward a cease-fire or more robust diplomatic talks, or toward renewed momentum by the Russian forces in their deadly offensive. Mr. Xi, who has built a bond with Mr. Putin over years, gave no indication he would help seek a diplomatic solution, according to an official Chinese readout of the call.

That summary emphasized the friction between China and the United States over Taiwan before addressing Ukraine. It said Mr. Xi pointed out that “the situation in Ukraine has developed to this point, which China does not want to see.” He reiterated standard talking points that China would provide humanitarian aid and that Russia and Ukraine should hold peace talks. Mr. Xi did not suggest any role China could play in ending the war, and instead said the United States and NATO should talk to Russia to resolve the crisis.

Mr. Xi also used a phrase he and other Chinese officials have previously employed when blaming troubles on the United States: “Let he who tied the bell on the tiger take it off.”

Tensions between the United States and China have grown since the invasion because of Beijing’s persistent alignment with Moscow, even as the Russian military kills thousands of Ukrainian civilians.

On Thursday, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken delivered his strongest public warning yet to China, saying the United States “will not hesitate to impose costs” if China gives military aid or other support to Russia. He and other officials say China’s strategy is to keep up a pretense of neutrality while siding with Russia.

Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden’s national security adviser, gave similar warnings to Yang Jiechi, a top Chinese foreign affairs official, when the two met in Rome on Monday. U.S. officials told reporters a day before those talks that Russia had asked China for military and economic aid after it began its war, and a Pentagon official said there were indications China was leaning toward obliging Russia on military support.

China could be held responsible for violating international law if it gives military aid to Russia, according to two prominent law professors, Oona A. Hathaway of Yale and Ryan Goodman of New York University.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/18/world/europe/biden-xi-russia-china.html

Washington/Beijing, March 19

US President Joe Biden warned his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping that there would be ""implications and consequences"" for Beijing if it chose to provide direct ""material support"" to Russia amid its invasion of Ukraine and increasing attacks on civilians, the White House has said.

The 110-minute secure video call on Friday was the first conversation between the two leaders since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The talks between Biden and Xi largely focused on Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the implications for the US-China relationship and international order, a senior White House official told reporters.

""He (President Biden) described the implications and consequences if China provides material support to Russia as it conducts brutal attacks against Ukrainian cities and civilians,"" the White House said in a readout of the lengthy conversation between the two presidents.

Later, a senior Biden administration official refused to publicly detail what those consequences might be for Beijing, a close ally of Moscow.

""I'm not going to, sort of, publicly lay out our options from here,"" the senior official said.

Ever since Russia launched a 'special military operation' in Ukraine on February 24, China has been treading a fine line, declining to condemn it as an invasion.

The call between the two presidents was about making sure there is a ""direct, candid and detailed and very substantive conversation at the leader level,"" the senior administration official said.

""President Biden detailed our efforts to prevent and then respond to the invasion, including by imposing costs on Russia,"" the White House readout of the meeting said.

Biden underscored his support for a diplomatic resolution to the crisis. The two leaders also agreed on the importance of maintaining open lines of communication, to manage the competition between our two countries, it said.

Biden and Xi also tasked their teams to follow up on their conversation in the critical period ahead, the White House said.

At the same time, President Xi underscored that there have been and will continue to be differences between China and the US. What matters is to keep such differences under control. A steadily growing relationship is in the interest of both sides, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement in Beijing.

On the situation in Ukraine, President Biden expounded on the US position, and expressed readiness for communication with China to prevent the situation from exacerbating, it said.

""China does not want to see the situation in Ukraine to come to this. China stands for peace and opposes war. This is embedded in China's history and culture,"" the statement quoted Xi as telling Biden.

""China makes a conclusion independently based on the merits of each matter. China advocates upholding international law and universally recognised norms governing international relations,"" Xi said.

According to a White House readout of the call, Biden “described the implications and consequences if China provides material support to Russia as it conducts brutal attacks against Ukrainian cities and civilians” and “underscored his support for a diplomatic resolution to the crisis.”

It wasn’t immediately clear how Xi will respond to Biden’s warnings or if he’s decided whether to help Russia, a senior administration official said during a briefing for reporters.

“The president really wasn’t making specific requests of China. He was laying out his assessment of the situation, what he thinks makes sense, and the implications of certain actions,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “We will see ... what decisions China makes in the days and weeks ahead,” the official said.

The call, the first contact between the leaders in four months, followed a lengthy and tense meeting between the countries’ national security officials earlier this week in Rome. The potentially difficult call on Friday could mark a pivotal moment in Russia’s war against Ukraine and Washington’s long-term relations with Beijing.

Beijing’s official summary of the call described the conversation as “candid and in-depth” and did not condemn Russia’s invasion. It called for direct dialogue to “ease the security concerns of both Russia and Ukraine” and stated that China “stands for peace and opposes war.”

“All sides need to jointly support Russia and Ukraine in having dialogue and negotiation that will produce results and lead to peace,” the Chinese government stated.

That statement of at least outward neutrality is notable coming just a month after Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin declared their countries enjoyed a “friendship without limits.”

The call began at 9:03 a.m. Washington time and ended 1 hour and 50 minutes later, the White House said.

As the West has rallied around Ukraine’s cause, imposing severe economic sanctions against Russia, Putin has become increasingly isolated and desperate. Russian forces, somewhat surprisingly, have been hammered by fierce Ukrainian resistance and failed to make deep incursions into the country after more than three weeks of fighting.

Given the way the war has gone, China offers Russia one of its last economic and military lifelines.

And while there is no question that Xi and Putin have been aligned on many issues, Beijing must balance its allegiance to a weakened autocrat against its relationships with major trading partners and the long-term risks of escalating a major conflict with the U.S. and Europe.

Biden on Wednesday authorized an additional $800 million in defense aid for Ukraine, a package that includes anti-tank and surface-to-air missiles, heavy munitions and drones. That came just hours after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky gave an impassioned address to a joint session of Congress in which he asked Biden and the U.S. to do more to help defend his country.

Although Russia and Ukraine have engaged in peace talks, there has been little evidence that Putin is serious about negotiating an end to the conflict, even after losing an estimated 7,000 to 9,000 fighters and amid difficulties with maintaining supply lines and finding reinforcements. With Russia’s ground assault struggling to make progress, Putin has

increasingly turned the fight into one of attrition, indiscriminately bombing Ukrainian cities with little regard for civilians.

Xi also brought up Taiwan, the senior administration official said. Biden expressed U.S. support for the long-standing “One China” policy, under which Taiwan is viewed as part of mainland China, and for the maintaining of the current status quo.

Tensions across the Taiwan Strait have risen in recent months, as the self-ruling island of 24 million people has been bracing for a potential invasion by Chinese forces given the increase in provocative military exercises and the apparent likelihood of the Chinese Communist Party attempting to fulfill its long-held goal of “reunifying” Taiwan with the mainland.",https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-03-18/biden-speaks-with-chinas-xi-about-not-aiding-russias-war-in-ukraine

“President Biden detailed our efforts to prevent and then respond to the invasion, including by imposing costs on Russia,” said a White House readout of the call published hours after it concluded. “He described the implications and consequences if China provides material support to Russia as it conducts brutal attacks against Ukrainian cities and civilians.”

The White House has not detailed what those consequences would be. Biden administration officials also repeatedly declined to characterize Xi’s comments on the call.

The two leaders spoke for nearly two hours on Friday morning on a secure video call, which a senior administration official described as “direct,” “substantive” and “detailed” and largely focused on Russia’s war in Ukraine.

“We’re concerned that they’re considering directly assisting Russia with military equipment to use in Ukraine,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters on Thursday, the day the White House announced plans for the phone call.

The senior administration official told reporters that Biden did not make “specific requests” of Xi when questioned if Biden asked China to intervene to stop the Russian assault.

“The president really wasn’t making specific requests of China,” the official said. “He was laying out his assessment of the situation, what he thinks makes sense and the implications of certain actions.”

Asked why that was the case later Friday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters: “Because China has to make a decision for themselves about where they want to stand.”

Psaki said that, following the call, the administration was still concerned about the possibility of China aiding Russia militarily.

“That is something we will be watching and the world will be watching,” she said.

A Chinese readout of the call said that Xi told Biden “that China does not want to see the situation in Ukraine to come to this.” Xi also affirmed support for peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, according to the readout, which also indicated he did not condemn Russia’s actions in Ukraine.

“All sides need to jointly support Russia and Ukraine in having dialogue and negotiation that will produce results and lead to peace,” the readout posted by China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. “The US and NATO should also have dialogue with Russia to address the crux of the Ukraine crisis and ease the security concerns of both Russia and Ukraine.”

Both readouts indicated the two leaders tasked their teams to follow up on the conversation in the days ahead.

China, which has deepened relations with Russia in recent years, has tried to portray itself as a neutral party in the Ukraine conflict. U.S. officials have urged China to condemn Russia’s behavior while raising concerns about China’s ties to Russia.

Reports surfaced earlier this week that Russia was seeking military assistance from China as it continues its invasion.

During a lengthy meeting with China’s top diplomat earlier this week in Rome, Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan said that Beijing would face consequences if it helped Russia with the invasion financially or militarily.

White House officials have also raised concerns about China amplifying Russian claims that the U.S. is developing biological weapons in Ukraine, which the U.S. has called disinformation meant to lay the foundation for a possible Russian chemical attack.

The senior administration official told reporters Friday that Biden directly expressed concerns to Xi about China echoing Russian disinformation about bioweapons labs in Ukraine during the call.

Russia has escalated its attacks on Ukraine since it first launched its invasion three weeks ago, despite officials and experts saying the Russian advance has not moved as quickly or as effectively as the Kremlin had hoped.

Russia has launched missiles targeting hospitals and civilian areas, prompting Biden and Blinken to call Russian President Vladimir Putin a “war criminal.”

The U.S. has provided Ukraine with billions of dollars in humanitarian and security assistance. Biden this week announced a total of $1 trillion in aid that will be used to supply anti-aircraft defense systems, anti-tank weapons and other arms to Ukraine.

Separate from talks on Ukraine, Biden reiterated that the U.S. has not changed its policy on Taiwan and “emphasized that the United States continues to oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo,” according to the White House readout.

The senior administration official said Xi was the one who raised the issue of Taiwan.

Taiwan has been a source of some tension between the U.S. and China, and Russia’s aggression in Ukraine has prompted concerns among some international watchdogs that China may try to invade or lay claim to the island.

Biden has previously told Xi the U.S. is committed to the “One China” policy, under which the U.S. does not recognize Taiwan as a separate state from China, but had also mistakenly said the U.S. had an obligation to send troops to Taiwan if it were attacked by China.

Under the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, the U.S. is committed to providing Taiwan with arms for its defense. The law does not commit the U.S. to sending troops to Taiwan to defend it.

A senior administration official told reporters that the conversation was direct.

It was substantive and it was detailed. The two leaders spent the preponderance of their time discussing Russia's unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine, as well as the implications of the crisis for U.S.-China relations and the international order, the official said.

Biden shared with Xi a detailed review of how things have developed to this point, his assessment of the situation today, and President Biden underscored his support for a diplomatic resolution to the crisis, the official said, adding that Biden described the US' assessment of Putin's actions and his miscalculations.

He also described the unity of the United States and its allies and partners, the unprecedented coordination with our European, NATO, and Indo-Pacific partners, and the overwhelming global unity and condemnation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, as well as the support for Ukraine, said the official.

Biden made clear the implication and consequences of China providing material support—if China were to provide material support—to Russia as it prosecutes its brutal war in Ukraine, not just for China's relationship with the United States but for the wider world, the official said.

US President Joe Biden has informed Chinese President Xi Jinping of the “implications and consequences” should Beijing provide material support to Moscow in the war in Ukraine, the White House said, after the two leaders spoke in a video call.

Friday’s talks, which the US said lasted just under two hours and ended at 10:53am in Washington (1453 GMT), was months in the making and follows the first virtual meeting between Biden and Xi in November.

Biden “described the implications and consequences if China provides material support to Russia as it conducts brutal attacks against Ukrainian cities and civilians”, the White House said in a statement on the discussion. It did not elaborate on what those consequences would be.

The call came amid increasing US concerns that China may come to Russia’s aid – either by giving military equipment or bypassing Western sanctions – in its increasingly brutal offensive in Ukraine, which continues to test already shaky relations between Washington and Beijing.

Earlier on Friday, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV reported Xi as telling Biden that “state-to-state relations cannot go to the stage of military hostilities”. Xi also said: “Peace and security are the most valued treasures of the international community.”

Prior to the exchange on Friday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US president would make clear to Xi that China will bear responsibility if it supported Russia’s “aggression” and that Washington “will not hesitate to impose costs”.

He said the US administration was concerned China was considering directly assisting Russia with military equipment for use in Ukraine – something Beijing has denied despite reports that Moscow has formally lodged the request.

Beijing, for its part, maintains close economic ties to both Kyiv and Moscow and has stressed Ukraine’s sovereignty while avoiding direct condemnation of Russia.

However, Chinese officials also have insisted that Russia has legitimate security concerns that need to be addressed and echoed Russian claims the US has been secretly working on biological weapons in Ukraine, a claim that has been rejected by the US and the United Nations.

In a longer readout on Friday’s call published by the Chinese foreign ministry, Xi said “all sides” need to support “dialogue” between Russia and Ukraine. He also appeared to put some responsibility for Russia’s invasion of its neighbour on the West, saying “the US and NATO should also have dialogue with Russia to address the crux of the Ukraine crisis and ease security concerns of both Russia and Ukraine”, the ministry noted.

Reporting from Washington, Al Jazeera’s Kimberly Halkett said “the West, and the United States specifically, has had this sense that China has really been trying to play both sides with regard to this conflict”.

“The West is hoping that they can really encourage China to use its economic might over Russia, its influence to try and even bring about a ceasefire in this conflict,” she said.

Meanwhile, speaking to MSNBC on Friday shortly before the call, US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman called on Xi to tell Russian President Vladimir Putin “to end this war of choice, this war of carnage” in Ukraine.

She also told CNN: “China needs to stand on the right side of history. It needs to ensure that it does not backfill, financially or in any other way, sanctions that have been imposed on Russia.”

But while China remains tightly bound to the US and other Western economies, it remains unclear what leverage Biden has to employ in his appeal to Xi, Ross Feingolf, an Asia political risk analyst, told Al Jazeera.

“Especially keeping in mind that [Washington] does want China to buy more from the United States as well and fulfill the terms of the phase one trade agreement,” he said. “This is a tough call literally and figuratively for Biden.”

The Biden-Xi call came after US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and Yang Jiechi, China’s top diplomat, held what the White House called a “substantial” seven-hour meeting in Rome this week.

Brookings Institution fellow Ryan Hass, a former adviser on China to US President Barack Obama, said Beijing has to sort through its clashing priorities. “China’s and Russia’s interests are not in alignment. Putin is an arsonist of the international system and President Xi sees himself as an architect for remaking and improving the international system,” Hass told the AFP news agency.

“President Xi is trying to balance competing priorities. He really places a lot of value in China’s partnership with Russia but at the same time he does not want to undermine China’s relations in the West.”

9,08a037c8-1cf3-42be-b300-c5cfbc755e46,"['Sky Uk Limited', 'Martha Kelner', 'Us Correspondent']",,"Joe Biden has told China's president of the ""implications and consequences"" Beijing faces if it gives Russia material support for its war in Ukraine, as Xi Jinping said the conflict needs to end as soon as possible.

The pair spoke for almost two hours in a video call as the US sought to deter China from providing military or economic assistance for President Vladimir Putin's invasion, where there have been ""brutal attacks on civilians"".

A White House statement said the American president had laid out efforts to prevent and then respond to the invasion, including by ""imposing costs"" on Russia, believed to mean sanctions.

""He described the implications and consequences if China provides material support to Russia as it conducts brutal attacks against Ukrainian cities and civilians,"" it said. ""The president underscored his support for a diplomatic resolution to the crisis.""

Those ""implications and consequences"" were not detailed in the statement.

The White House also said the two leaders agreed on the importance of maintaining open lines of communication, to ""manage the competition"" between the two countries.

According to Chinese state media, Mr Xi told his American counterpart: ""The top priorities now are to continue dialogue and negotiations, avoid civilian casualties, prevent a humanitarian crisis, cease fighting and end the war as soon as possible.""

Russian leader Mr Putin has not called his military offensive, now in its fourth week, a ""war"", instead referring to it as a ""special military operation"".

Earlier on Friday, he hailed the country's ""special operation"" in Ukraine at a rally marking the anniversary of the 2014 annexation of Crimea.

Mr Xi told Mr Biden that all parties should support Russia-Ukraine dialogue and negotiations.

And he said the US and NATO should have discussions with Russia to solve the ""crux"" of the crisis and resolve the security concerns of Russia and Ukraine.

Biden unlikely to have received assurances that China won't help Putin Martha Kelner US correspondent @marthakelner The White House would not be drawn on whether President Xi gave President Biden any assurances that China would not be helping Russia out with military assistance. But it seems unlikely, given that the focus of the comments from the Biden administration following the call have been reiterating the threat of sanctions should China answer Russia's call. On that key issue, it seems, there is no change since US intelligence suggested China could be willing to help out its ally. There was no specific detail on the sanctions that have been threatened, but it is worth bearing in mind that China's economic relationship with the US and Europe is worth trillions of dollars and far outweighs its economic relationship with Russia. This is just the latest in a flurry of diplomatic telephone calls between world leaders and their deputies. But it is the first between Presidents Biden and Xi since November, and comes at a time when US-China relations are at a crunch point. A senior administration official described the call between the two leaders as ""direct, substantive and detailed"" but there was no condemnation from China of Vladimir Putin himself or the wider Russian attack on Ukraine.

China earlier accused the US of provoking Russia and fuelling the conflict by sending arms to Ukraine.

""China has called for every effort to avoid civilian casualties all the time,"" foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, told reporters.

""Which do the civilians in Ukraine need more: food and sleeping bags or machine guns and artillery? It's easy to answer.""

Ahead of the video call, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Mr Biden would question Mr Xi about Beijing's ""rhetorical support"" of Mr Putin and an ""absence of denunciation"" of Russia's invasion, which began on 24 February.

With Russia trying to regain the initiative in a stalled campaign, three missiles landed at an airport near the western city of Lviv, which has until now been far from Ukraine's battlefields further east.

US officials concerned by 'Russia's request for military assistance from China'

Russia's defence ministry said it was ""tightening its encirclement"" around the besieged southern port of Mariupol, where officials said more than 1,300 people may still be trapped in a bomb shelter under a destroyed theatre.

Ukraine said it had rescued at least 130 people from the basement after the building was flattened, reportedly by a Russian airstrike, on Wednesday. Moscow denies attacking the theatre, insisting it does not target civilians.

In the days after Mr Putin sent tens of thousands of his forces into neighbouring Ukraine, the Chinese government tried to distance itself from the offensive but avoided criticising Moscow.

At other times, Beijing has repeated unverified Russian claims that Ukraine ran biological weapons laboratories with US support.

Earlier this week, the US said its intelligence found China had signalled to Russia it would be willing to given military support and financial backing to help stave off the impact of the West's severe sanctions.

Russia and China have both denied the claims.",https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-biden-tells-chinas-xi-of-consequences-if-beijing-gives-russia-material-support-for-invasion-12569525
