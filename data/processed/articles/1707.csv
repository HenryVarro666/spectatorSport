The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making “the most important decision of their life -- to fight.”

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.”

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the major developments on Russia's invasion, how Kyiv is fighting back, the plight of civilians, and Western reaction. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.

Zelenskiy noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.”

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

The quote at the top of this page was written by Dr. Dornberger in his book V-2, referring to the first successful flight of a V-2 missile from the German facility which he commanded at Peenemunde. Implicit in these words is the recognition that the ballistic rocket had unlocked the key to successful exploration of space. Recent events – the Russian Sputniks and the American Explorer – have driven this fact home. Fortunately, in its space endeavors, this nation is in a position to call upon the resources of the mightiest single military project the country has ever known, exceeding in magnitude even the Manhattan Project, which produced the first atomic bomb.

This is the Air Forces’ ballistic missile program, a logical springboard into space. Ballistic missiles can be considered the first true space weapons, since they are outside the atmosphere for some ninety percent of an intercontinental flight. As an introduction to our discussion of the USAF ballistic missile program we could find no better source than its boss, Maj. Gen. Bernard A. Schriever, who runs the show from his position as Commander of the Ballistic Missile Division of the Air Research and Development Command.

The following excerpt is from an address by General Schriever; made long before the various satellites – Russian and American – had sullied the virgin reaches of outer space. The occasion was an Astronautics Symposium, jointly sponsored by the USAF Office of Scientific Research and Convair at San Diego, Calif., in February of last year. We think it remains the best explanation of the important implications of the USAF ballistic missile program in the US conquest of space and serves as a fitting introduction to our examination of the program in its historical, developmental, and operational context.— The Editors.

How have the ICBM and IRBM programs contributed to the conquest of space? They have contributed in a very concrete sense from the standpoint of hardware that has been developed or is being developed for this program. A tremendous industrial capability is being built up and production know-how is being established in many new areas. These airframe, propulsion, and guidance subsystems development and the data, which will become available as ballistic missile test flights are made, will make possible a whole gamut of follow-on projects.

Take, for example, the propulsive unit. The same propulsive unit that boosts a heavy nose-cone warhead to 25,000 ft/sec, could boost a somewhat lighter body to the escape velocity of 35,000 ft/sec or to an orbital path around the Earth. Using the same number of stages, the ratio of thrust to weight would be greater by using a lighter payload, and higher accelerations and velocities could be reached before burnout. Or with our present state of knowledge, it would be relatively easy to add another stage. We have already done that successfully on our reentry test vehicle, the X-17. The same guidance system that enables the warhead of a ballistic missile to reach its target within a permissible accuracy would also be sufficiently accurate to hit a target much smaller than the moon. Or, if we are talking about circular orbits around the Earth, errors in guidance could be easily observed over a period of time and corrected, and the satellite kept on an accurate orbit. And, of course, these same propulsive and guidance components could also be used for surface-to-surface transport vehicles of various sorts to experimentally carry mail or strategic military materiel to critical sites. The same applies to structural advances of the ICBM that have brought us to new heights in the ratio of total weight to structural weight. I would be willing to venture a guess that ninety percent of the unmanned follow-on projects that one cold visualize for the future can be undertaken with propulsive guidance, and structural techniques, presently under development in the Air Force ballistic missile program.

It is reasonable to expect that it will not be too difficult to extend these present developments to surface-to-surface transport of personnel by rocket propulsion, or space travel of personnel at some time in the future. However, before man can be committed to space vehicles, a tremendous amount of human factors research will be necessary…. Granted this research, there are other problems as well. A specific example of the kind of advanced development probably necessary for manned spaceflight to distant planets is sustained thrust through space. This will permit us to reach higher velocities and cut down the flight time, which would otherwise be impractically long for a human passenger even to the closest planets. Such long sustained thrust, at a small enough magnitude level to be tolerable to a man, requires a type of propulsion technique that is not well suited to takeoff thrust and general ICBM requirements. The successful achievement of the required propulsion system is clearly indicated by today’s science, but it has to be developed a program beyond the current ICBM program.

Space technology, probably for some decades, will not revolve primarily around apparatus for controlled movement of vehicles from one point to another in empty space. Perhaps not only initially but for all time, space technology will include as its most characteristic problem the need for going from the surface of one terrestrial body to another with successful passage through the atmosphere of each. The first big problems, then, are how to bring a substantial mass up to empty space with velocity sufficient to continue interbody space travel, with adequate precision in the velocity vector control, and how to bring it back through an atmosphere without disintegration. In each of these respects, if one for the moment bypasses human cargo ambitions, the ICBM is attaining the necessary capability and, even for manned flight, the ICBM flight-test program will provide experimental data of direct interest.

Granted then that the ICBM program is a major pioneering and foundation step for space technology, what appears to be a logical future program? The answer is not easy. It is very difficult to make a firm prognosis on military need during a twenty-year period for something as new and revolutionary as ballistic missiles, Earth satellites, and space vehicles. We are somewhat in the same position today as were military planners at the close of the First World War when they were trying to anticipate the employment of aircraft in future wars. Consequently, my prognoses will go from those which are reasonably firm to those, which might be considered visionary. Fortunately, there is a considerable overlap between the advances in the state of the art which are required for the firm needs and those now considered visionary.

First, we should consider those changes in the operational and technical characteristics of our long-range ballistic missiles to make them superior, reliable weapons. Almost any military planner would agree that if we can increase the range, increase the payload, reduce the gross weight, increase the accuracy, reduce the cost, or simplify the operational procedures, we will have made a worthwhile contribution. Now, in order to achieve any or all of thee objectives, it will be necessary to advance the sate of the propulsion art, the structures art, or the guidance art, or perhaps all three. When these advances are made, they will be applicable also to the more visionary projects. The basic science underlying these engineering arts has been well surveyed in the past two years. It tells us that considerable advance is possible on all fronts.

A word is necessary on the relationship between military need and scientific feasibility in space technology. In the long haul our safety as a nation may depend upon our achieving “space superiority.” Several decades from now the important battles may not be sea battles or air battles, but space battles, and we should be spending a certain fraction of our national resources to ensure that we do not lag in obtaining space supremacy. Besides the direct military importance of space, our prestige as would leaders might well dictate that we undertake lunar expeditions and even interplanetary flight when the appropriate technological advances have been made and the time is ripe. Thus, it is indeed fortunate that the technology advances required in support of military objectives can, in large part, directly support these more speculative space ventures….

Where does all this lead? My thought is that the evolution of space vehicles will be a gradual step-by-step process, with the first step beyond ballistic missiles being the unmanned, artificial Earth satellite and then perhaps unmanned exploratory flights to the moon or Mars. These first flights would no doubt be research vehicles to gather scientific data and to accumulate information on pace environmental conditions for future design use. The information gathered form these flights will supplement the information gathered from ballistic missile test flights. Many of the things that we can learn from satellites will lead not only to a better understanding of conditions to be encountered in space, but will lead to a better understanding of our own planet. Weather reconnaissance can be accomplished in a more effective manner. This will lead to a better understanding of the movements of polar air masses and the courses of jet streams and will permit improved long-range weather forecasts and improved aircraft and missile operations. A better understanding of the Earth’s magnetic field will lead to better radio communications, more reliable navigation instruments, and perhaps new ideas for propulsive devices. Refined data on the Earth’s gravitational effects will lead to improved guidance. Much remains to be known about cosmic rays. Unmanned satellites will be the means for obtaining this information.

I have described some of the benefits to be derived from our early ventures into space, and the contributions the ICBM program is making in this direction.

Payload capability of a future satellite could be in the order of hundreds or even a thousand pounds. Such payload would permit more instrumentation and many varied types of space experiments.

Vehicles with additional complications could be made to have the ability to return intact from space. However, without fundamental extension the environment during spaceflight would not be suitable for a human passenger. Therefore, manned spaceflight cannot be attempted with such apparatus, but many of the associated physiological questions can be answered by experiments with animals. We may, in fact, be able to fill nearly all the gaps in our knowledge which are now holding back the design of manned spacecraft.

Given vehicles with these capabilities, still another avenue for a scientific achievement is immediately opened – for with additional rocket thrust a lunar research vehicle is highly possible. In view of the small additional cost of such an experiment, it seems certain that in the not too distant future it will be tried.

The ICBM program, through the technology it is fostering, the facilities that have been established, the industrial teams being developed, and the vehicles themselves, is providing the key to the further development of spaceflight. Many fascinating new horizons are sure to open within the next decade as a direct result.

There is ample precedent in history for the utilization of military capability to explore unknown regions. Over the centuries the great exploration of this planet have been conducted by military men, usually with no precise idea of what the ultimate value of their discoveries might be – either in a military or an economic sense. But the exploring was done, and the value usually followed.

Columbus discovered America as an admiral in the service of Spain. Magellan and Sir Francis Drake were military men. The Lewis and Clark expedition, which opened the West, was a military enterprise. Likewise Admiral Byrd’s exploits at both Poles.

So it is quite fitting that the Air Force should be interested in furthering the knowledge of its new medium, just as did the Army and Navy in their in the past. It has been estimated that during the next five to seven years, American exploration in space must be based on ICBM technology. Hence this section will be devoted to the ICBM program, with charts beginning on Page 76, a chronology of ICBM milestones on page 80, and a text beginning on page 84.—The Editors",https://www.airforcemag.com/article/0358missiles/

Bilateral agreement between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. requiring each nation to notify the other party, ""no less than twenty-four hours in advance, of the planned date, launch area, and area of impact for any launch of a strategic ballistic missile."" The treaty entered into force on May 31, 1988.

Narrative

The Agreement on Notifications of ICBM and SLBM Launches, signed during the 1988 Moscow Summit, reflects the continuing interest of the United States and the Soviet Union in reducing the risk of nuclear war as a result of misinterpretation, miscalculation, or accident.

A number of earlier U.S.-Soviet agreements address advance notification of some, but not all, strategic ballistic missile launches.

The 1971 ""Accidents Measures"" Agreement requires each Party to notify the other in advance of any planned missile launches if such launches will extend beyond its national territory in the direction of the other Party.

The 1972 ""Incidents at Sea"" Agreement provides for advance notice, through Notices to Airmen and Mariners of actions on the high seas which represent a hazard to navigation or aircraft in flight. Planned ballistic missile launches which will take place in international waters represent such a hazard, and, under the ""Incidents at Sea"" Agreement, notification must be provided. The Notices to Airmen and Mariners, however, consist of warnings which announce ""closure areas"" due to a hazard to navigation or aircraft in flight; they need not identify the nature of the hazard.

Article XVI of the SALT II Treaty, which was never ratified, would have obligated each Party to notify the other well in advance before conducting multiple ICBM launches, or single ICBM launches planned to extend beyond its national territory. There was no obligation, however, to notify single launches not intended to extend beyond national territory. There were also no provisions in the SALT II Treaty for the notification of SLBM launches.

None of these earlier agreements, therefore, provided total coverage of all strategic ballistic missile (ICBM and SLBM) launches. In 1982, President Reagan proposed a number of new confidence-building measures for discussion at the U.S.-Soviet Strategic Arms Reductions Talks (START). Among these was a proposal for prior notification of all launches of ICBMs and SLBMs. During the course of the START negotiations, both sides drafted similar launch notification procedures which were incorporated into the joint draft of the START agreement text.

In May 1988, the United States proposed to the Soviets that, as a confidence-building measure, the sides conclude a separate agreement calling for advance notification of ICBM and SLBM launches. The Soviets agreed, and on May 31, 1988, in Moscow, U.S. Secretary of State Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze signed the Agreement on Notifications of ICBM and SLBM Launches. The Agreement provides for notification, no less than 24 hours in advance, of the planned date, launch area, and area of impact for any launch of an ICBM or SLBM. The Agreement also provides that these notifications be provided through the Nuclear Risk Reduction Centers. The Agreement entered into force on the date it was signed.

The U.S.-Soviet Joint Statement issued following the Moscow Summit included the following statement:

The agreement between the United States and the USSR on notifications of launches of Inter-continental Ballistic Missiles and Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missiles, signed during the Moscow summit, is a practical new step, reflecting the desire of the sides to reduce the risk of outbreak of nuclear war, in particular as a result of misinterpretation, miscalculation, or accident.

Afterwards, the START I Treaty was signed in 1991. This Treaty contains an obligation to notify any flight test of an ICBM or SLBM, including those used to launch objects into the upper atmosphere or space. In addition to the requirements under the Ballistic Missile Launch Notification Agreement (i.e., that the notifying Party provide planned launch date, launch area, and reentry impact area), the START I Treaty requires that the notifying Party must also specify the telemetry broadcast frequencies to be used, modulation types and information as to whether the flight test is to employ encapsulation or encryption.",https://www.atomicarchive.com/resources/treaties/launch-notification.html

The Ukrainian state security service has officially reported that a rocket attack on Zhytomyr Airport - located some 93 miles west of Kiev - was launched from the territory of Belarus.

Belarusian special forces were seen loading onto airplanes in preparation for an air assault on Kyiv in what could be a widening of the war, military sources stated.

Ukrainian intelligence has reportedly learned from within Belarus that ‘special ops’ troops have been spotted loading up planes for a major attack.

Videos have circulated of the explosion at Zhytomyr Airport, with reports of shockwaves nearby.

A widening of the conflict to potentially include Russian ally Belarus could signal Vladimir Putin’s growing fury and frustration as the Russian campaign appears to get bogged down in fierce fighting around Kyiv and Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second biggest city. It could also run the risk of sucking in other states including NATO allies, triggering a pan-European conflict.

In a bizarre rant on Sunday, Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko warned that the war in Ukraine will ‘become a meat grinder’.

Speaking at a polling station during a referendum on constitutional change that would give the despot further power, the Putin ally thundered: ‘The conflict in Ukraine is the thin edge of the wedge. Believe me, I know what I’m talking about. If it continues like this, the worst will happen.

‘He [Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky] will not be hidden in any American or some other bunker. That’s why the war should be ended today. I wouldn’t even call it the war. This is a conflict. The war will last for one-two days, but there will be a meat grinder in three days.’

Andriy Zagorodnyuk, Kyiv’s former defence minister, has claimed that Belarus is about to declare war on Ukraine. The Guardian quoted Zagorodnyuk as saying: ‘Republic of Belarus is highly likely to join the Russian war against Ukraine. On Russian side. There is an information about airborne troopers from Republic of Belarus loaded on the planes to enter Ukraine.

‘This is a terrible development as it involves a country, which until very recently was a great friend of Ukraine; which people always considered Ukraine as a brotherly nation. Ukraine and Belarus has never been to war one with another in their many hundred years of history.

‘We believe that the only reason for that decision was personal demand from President of Russia, which completely depends from Putin in its policy.’

Footage of the explosion at Zhytomyr Airport 93 miles west of Kiev has been widely circulated online

In a bizarre rant on Sunday, Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko (pictured) warned that the war in Ukraine will ‘become a meat grinder’

Kremlin forces invaded Ukraine on Thursday from the south, east and from Belarus in the north, having spent weeks building up Russia’s elite Spetsnaz troops on so-called ‘exercises’ with their Belarusian counterparts.

Volodymyr Zelensky’s office said on the Telegram messaging app on Sunday that Russia and Ukraine would meet at an unspecified location on the Belarusian border and did not give a precise time for the meeting.

Russia had announced that its delegation had flown to Belarus to await talks. Ukrainian officials initially rejected the move, saying any talks should take place elsewhere than Belarus, where Moscow placed a large contingent of troops before it invaded Ukraine starting Thursday.

It is thought that the Kremlin underestimated the level of resistance they would meet from Kyiv’s troops and were overly reliant on trying to panic Ukraine into surrender.

The sluggish Russian effort has sparked Western fears that he could resort to drastic measures to crush the Ukrainian resistance. This could include the use of thermobaric bombs, among the most lethal non-nuclear bombs ever developed.

It comes as Putin ordered Russian nuclear deterrent forces put on high alert on Sunday amid tensions with the West over his invasion of Ukraine.

Putin's regime 'set for real economic pain' after West removes Russian banks from Swift Britain, the US, Canada and the European Union have announced that selected Russian banks would be excluded from the Swift global payments system. Boris Johnson and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky both welcomed the 'increased willingness' to take action against Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. Here, the PA news agency answers key questions about Swift and why the issue is so important. What is Swift? The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (Swift) is a secure messaging system used by financial institutions to move money around the world. Instead of holding or transferring funds, Swift allows banks and companies to alert each other of transactions that are about to take place. Who uses it? The platform, founded in the 1970s, connects more than 11,000 banking and securities organisations, market infrastructures and corporate customers in more than 200 countries and territories. It averaged 42 million messages daily last year to enable payments, with about half of all high-value transactions crossing national borders going through it. Why is it being mentioned following Russia's invasion of Ukraine? It is the latest announcement following a number of sanctions that have hit Russia. The Prime Minister told broadcasters during a visit to RAF Brize Norton: 'It is incredibly important for tightening the economic ligature around the Putin regime.' The move has been described by Armed forces minister James Heappey as the 'ultimate economic sanction'. Why does the UK want Russia to be excluded? Banning Russian banks from the platform would hit the country's access to financial markets across the world. This would cause delays and extra costs for the Russian economy, and would make it harder for other countries to make payments to Russia. How significant would the blow to Russia's economy be? In an explanatory Twitter threat, investment specialist Sahil Bloom wrote: 'Cutting off a nation's banks from SWIFT access restricts flows into and out of that nation. 'Russia is a massive economy with tentacles that reach all around the world… 'It is a key energy supplier to Europe and the world. It is an exporter of materials critical to the manufacturing of jet engines, semiconductors, automotives, electronics, and fertilizers. Cutting off Russia from SWIFT would impact the flow of payments for these industries.' Some commentators have suggested the move could increase energy prices if European countries are unable to pay Russian suppliers of fossil fuels. Advertisement

Speaking at a meeting with his top officials, the Russian president claimed that leading NATO powers had made ‘aggressive statements’ along with the West imposing hard-hitting financial sanctions against Russia, including the president himself.

He ordered the Russian defence minister and the chief of the military’s General Staff to put the nuclear deterrent forces in a ‘special regime of combat duty’.

‘Western countries aren’t only taking unfriendly actions against our country in the economic sphere, but top officials from leading NATO members made aggressive statements regarding our country,’ Putin said in televised comments.

His order raised the threat that the tensions with the West over the invasion in Ukraine could lead to the use of nuclear weapons.

The Russian leader this week threatened to retaliate harshly against any nations that intervened directly in the conflict in Ukraine.

Estonia’s former defence chief Riho Terras claimed that Putin’s war is not going to plan because Russia is fast running out of money and weapons, and will have to enter negotiations with Volodymyr Zelensky’s government if Kyiv holds off the Russians for 10 days.

The Russian president allegedly convened a meeting with the oligarchs in a bunker in the Ural Mountains, at which it is claimed that he furiously vented that he thought the war would be ‘easy’ and ‘everything would be done in one to four days’.

Citing Ukrainian intelligence sources, Terras claimed that the war is costing Russia around £15billion-per-day, and that they have rockets for three to four days at most, which they are using sparingly.

Street fighting broke out in Ukraine’s second-largest city and Russian troops squeezed strategic ports in the country’s south Sunday, advances that appeared to mark a new phase of Russia’s invasion following a wave of attacks on airfields and fuel facilities elsewhere in the country.

Kyiv was eerily quiet after huge explosions lit up the morning sky and authorities reported blasts at one of the airports. Only an occasional car appeared on a deserted main boulevard as a strict 39-hour curfew kept people off the streets. Terrified residents instead hunkered down in homes, underground garages and subway stations in anticipation of a full-scale Russian assault.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said: ‘The past night was tough – more shelling, more bombing of residential areas and civilian infrastructure.

‘There is not a single facility in the country that the occupiers wouldn’t consider as admissible targets.’

Following its gains to the east in the city of Kharkiv and multiple ports, Russia sent a delegation to Belarus for peace talks with Ukraine, according to the Kremlin. Zelensky suggested other locations, saying his country was unwilling to meet in Belarus because it served as a staging ground for the invasion.

Until Sunday, Russia’s troops had remained on the outskirts of Kharkiv, a city of 1.4million about 12.4 miles south of the border with Russia, while other forces rolled past to press the offensive deeper into Ukraine.

Videos posted on Ukrainian media and social networks showed Russian vehicles moving across Kharkiv and Russian troops roaming the city in small groups. One showed Ukrainian troops firing at the Russians and damaged Russian light utility vehicles abandoned nearby.

The images underscored the determined resistance Russian troops face while attempting to enter Ukraine’s bigger cities. Ukrainians have volunteered en masse to help defend the capital, Kyiv, and other cities, taking guns distributed by authorities and preparing firebombs to fight Russian forces.

Ukraine’s government also is releasing prisoners with military experience who want to fight for the country, a prosecutor’s office official, Andriy Sinyuk, told the Hromadske TV channel Sunday. He did not specify whether the move applied to prisoners convicted of all levels of crimes.

Putin hasn’t disclosed his ultimate plans, but Western officials believe he is determined to overthrow Ukraine's government and replace it with a regime of his own, redrawing the map of Europe and reviving Moscow’s Cold War-era influence.

The pressure on strategic ports in the south of Ukraine appeared aimed at seizing control of the country’s coastline stretching from the border with Romania in the west to the border with Russia in the east. A Russian Defence Ministry spokesman, Major General Igor Konashenkov, said Russian forces had blocked the cities of Kherson on the Black Sea and the port of Berdyansk on the Azov Sea.

He said the Russian forces also took control of an airbase near Kherson and the Azov Sea city of Henichesk. Ukrainian authorities also have reported fighting near Odesa, Mykolaiv and other areas.

Cutting Ukraine’s access to its sea ports would deal a major blow to the country’s economy. It also could allow Moscow to build a land corridor to Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014 and until now was connected to Russia by a 12 mile bridge, the longest bridge in Europe which opened in 2018.

The paranoid 'old man in the bunker': Isolated Putin spends time 'stewing in his own fears' after 'withdrawing into himself' during pandemic and only has contact with his inner circle Questions have been raised over whether Covid-19 has fueled Vladimir Putin's paranoia after claims emerged the isolated president spent time 'stewing in his own fears' after 'withdrawing into himself' during the pandemic. Putin reportedly only had contact with his inner circle during the pandemic, but even they were asked to present faecal samples several times a week to check for infection and, in some cases, asked to isolate for two weeks before face-to-face meeting. It is the latest in a string of questions being asked about the Russian leader's state of mind after he announced the invasion of Ukraine in 'rambling, terrifying, apocalyptic' fashion. Rumours surrounding the Russian leader's health have been swirling for years, with repeated reports suggesting that he is suffering from cancer and Parkinson's disease, or been affected by long Covid-19 causing 'brain fog'. Fears were raised again yesterday after US Senator Marco Rubio appeared to suggest he believes Putin is mentally unwell in a tweet that warned it was 'pretty obvious' that 'something is off' with the Russian president amid his invasion of Ukraine. 'I wish I could share more, but for now I can say it's pretty obvious to many that something is off with #Putin', the Republican Senator for Florida wrote. 'He has always been a killer, but his problem now is different & significant It would be a mistake to assume this Putin would react the same way he would have 5 years ago.' Advertisement

Flames billowed from an oil depot near an airbase in Vasylkiv, a city 23 miles south of Kyiv where there has been intense fighting, according to the mayor. Russian forces blew up a gas pipeline in Kharkiv, prompting the government to warn people to cover their windows with damp cloth or gauze as protection from smoke, the president's office said.

The number of casualties so far from Europe’s largest land conflict since World War Two remains unclear amid the fog of combat.

Ukraine’s health minister reported Saturday that 198 people, including three children, had been killed and more than 1,000 others wounded. It was unclear whether those figures included both military and civilian casualties. Russia has not released any casualty information.

Ukraine’s UN ambassador, Sergiy Kyslytsya, tweeted Saturday that Ukraine appealed to the International Committee of the Red Cross ‘to facilitate repatriation of thousands of bodies of Russian soldiers’. An accompanying chart claimed 3,500 Russian troops have been killed.

Laetitia Courtois, ICRC’s permanent observer to the UN, told The Associated Press that the situation in Ukraine was ‘a limitation for our teams on the ground’ and ‘we therefore cannot confirm numbers or other details’.

The United Nations’ refugee agency said Sunday that about 368,000 Ukrainians have arrived in neighbouring countries since the invasion started Thursday. The UN has estimated the conflict could produce as many as 4million refugees, depending how long it continues.

Zelensky denounced Russia’s offensive as ‘state terrorism’. He said the attacks on Ukrainian cities should be investigated by an international war crimes tribunal and cost Russia its place as one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.

‘Russia has taken the path of evil, and the world should come to depriving it of its UN Security Council seat,’ he said.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said a Russian delegation of military officials and diplomats had arrived Sunday in the Belarusian city of Gomel for talks with Ukraine. Zelensky on Friday offered to negotiate a key Russian demand: abandoning ambitions of joining NATO.

Ukraine’s president said his country was ready for peace talks but not in Belarus.

Peskov claimed Ukraine had proposed holding talks in Gomel. He added that the Russian military action was going forward pending the talks start.

Zelensky adviser Mykhailo Podolyak dismissed Moscow's offer as ‘manipulation’.

As Russia pushes ahead with its offensive, the West is working to equip the outnumbered Ukrainian forces with weapons and ammunition while punishing Russia with far-reaching sanctions intended to further isolate Moscow.

The US pledged an additional $350million in military assistance to Ukraine, including anti-tank weapons, body armor and small arms. Germany said it would send missiles and anti-tank weapons to the besieged country and that it would close its airspace to Russian planes.

The US, European Union and Britain agreed to block ‘selected’ Russian banks from the SWIFT global financial messaging system, which moves money around more than 11,000 banks and other financial institutions worldwide, part of a new round of sanctions aiming to impose a severe cost on Moscow for the invasion. They also agreed to impose ‘restrictive measures’ on Russia’s central bank.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, meanwhile, said Sunday that his country is committing $112.7billion to a special fund for its armed forces, raising its defence spending above 2 per cent of gross domestic product. Scholz told a special session of the Bundestag the investment was needed ‘to protect our freedom and our democracy’.

Putin sent troops into Ukraine after denying for weeks that he intended to do so, all the while building up a force of almost 200,000 troops along the countries’ borders. He claims the West has failed to take seriously Russia’s security concerns about NATO, the Western military alliance that Ukraine aspires to join. But he has also expressed scorn about Ukraine’s right to exist as an independent state.

Russia claims its assault on Ukraine is aimed only at military targets, but bridges, schools and residential neighbourhoods have been hit.

Ukraine’s ambassador to the US, Oksana Markarova, said Ukraine was gathering evidence of shelling of residential areas, kindergartens and hospitals to submit to an international war crimes court in The Hague as possible crimes against humanity. The International Criminal Court's prosecutor has said he is monitoring the conflict closely.

British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss warned Sunday that Putin could use ‘the most unsavoury means’, including banned chemical or biological weapons, to defeat Ukraine.

‘I urge the Russians not to escalate this conflict, but we do need to be prepared for Russia to seek to use even worse weapons,’ Truss told Sky News.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10557221/Ukraine-war-Belarus-poised-declare-war-special-forces-loaded-planes-in.html

Blasts have been heard overnight in several of Ukraine's cities including the capital Kyiv, Kharkiv, the country's second biggest city and Chernihiv, north of the capital, but overall, it was a quiet night on the streets of the capital with an almost two-day curfew lifted on Monday morning.

Those still residing in the capital must know the worst is surely still to come.

Today marks the start of a crucial 24 hours for the country with tensions at their highest following a threat by Russian President Vladimir Putin to put his nuclear deterrent forces on 'alert'.

The mood is not exactly promising for talks but Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has said Kyiv and Moscow will hold peace talks at the northern border with Belarus later on Monday.

Zelensky has said there are no preconditions attached but holds little hope of a breakthrough that the conflict will be resolved. Zelensky will not be part of the delegation in person.

It wasn't immediately clear when the meeting would take place, nor what the Kremlin was ultimately seeking, either in those potential talks on the border or, more broadly, from its war in Ukraine. Western officials believe Putin wants to overthrow Ukraine's government and replace it with a regime of his own, reviving Moscow's Cold War-era influence.

Ukraine has managed to slow the advance of Putin's troops but Russia is still gaining ground, closing in on the capital, showing no sign of turning back.

Satellite imagery released by Maxar Technologies on Sunday depicted a three-mile long convoy of Russian military vehicles lined up on roads leading to Kyiv, thought to be less than 40 miles away from the city of three million people.

While Russian advance forces have been fighting in Kyiv for several days, the main bulk of Putin's assault force is still some distance outside the city.

The convoy consisting of tanks and military hardware are almost certainly preparing for a ground assault, but they remain vulnerable from the air. Ukraine on Sunday released video footage of a drone attack where several Russian tanks were blown up in a missile strike.

If the Russians were expecting Ukraine to roll over, the first four days have proved them wrong.

Russian forces have encountered strong resistance from Ukraine's defenders, and U.S. officials say they believe the invasion has been more difficult, and slower, than the Kremlin envisioned, though that could change as Moscow adapts.

On Sunday night, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog said missiles had hit a radioactive waste disposal site in Kyiv.

International Atomic Energy Agency director general Rafael Grossi said Ukrainian authorities informed his office about the overnight strike, but there were no reports of damage to the buildings or indications of a release of radioactive material. He said his agency expects to soon receive the results of on-site radioactive monitoring.

The report came a day after an electrical transformer at a similar disposal facility in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv was damaged. Such facilities typically hold low-level radioactive materials such as waste from hospitals and industry, but Mr Grossi said the two incidents highlight a 'very real risk'.

Aside from blasts heard in the early hours of the morning, Kyiv had been mainly quiet overnight according to information provided by Ukrainian officials. It may well be seen as the calm before the storm.

In one video, shot in the darkness of Kharkiv that was posted to Twitter, several rounds of gunfire can be heard in the distance.

'Kharkiv airport and residential areas are under heavy shelling,' read a message posted to social media.

An air raid alert sounded in the city at about 4.30am local time with residents urged to head to the nearest shelter.

An apartment building was also seen to be ablaze after being hit by a missile in the centre of Chernihiv, a city about 100 miles north of Kyiv.

It saw a fire break out on the lower floors of the building.

'A rocket hit a residential building in the centre of Chernihiv. A fire broke out, two lower floors are on fire. The number of injured is currently unknown,' a statement on Twitter read.

Later on Monday, U.S. President Joe Biden is planning to conduct a call with allies on to discuss the deteriorating situation in Ukraine and any coordinated response, according to the White House.

The call will take place at 11:15am EST.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken underlined the importance of a 'unified response to Russia's invasion,' during a call with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba.

The timing comes as another of Ukraine's neighbors, Belarus, is also said to be preparing to send soldiers into Ukraine in support of Russia.

'It's very clear Minsk is now an extension of the Kremlin,' said an anonymous official to the Washington Post.

On Monday morning, Ukraine's defense minister issues a defiant message following another night where Russian troops failed to take Kyiv.

'We will not give up the capital, Ukraine is already winning,' Oleksii Reznikov said describing it as '96 hours of resistance' and 'four days of dedication, courage and faith'.

'The enemy who came to our land will go in a known direction. Therefore, we advise the occupiers to go home. It'snot too late,' a statement posted on the Ukrainian ministry of defense website read.

'It is useless to intimidate Ukrainians. It will not be possible to break our defenders.'

Early on Monday morning, the Mayor of Kharkiv issued a message to residents of the city of 1.4million people where he described how he was attempting to keep the city functioning while attempting to hold off Russian forces

Early on Monday morning, the Mayor of Kharkiv issued a message to residents of the city of 1.4million people where he described how he was attempting to keep the city functioning while holding off Russian forces.

'Starting from this morning multiple units of Russian Army made a breakthrough into Kharkiv. You saw them into residential areas of the city. Yesterday night there was an enormous artillery bombardment. But we have held the line. And we will forever,' wrote Mayor Igor Terekhov.

'Dear Inhabitants of Kharkiv. My dears. We must stick together. Me and our utility service are doing all what we can: we reconnect central heating. This morning, we reinitiated garbage collection. But were had to stop because we were under gunfire.

'Bread. We do our best. Unfortunately, the bakery was not working because it was also coming under shelling. We maintain water supply in the city.

'I beg you to take care of yourself. We are doing everything possible and sometimes — have to admit it — that it is impossible together with our utilities service to ensure the functioning of the city of Kharkiv.

'We will withstand. We are Kharkovites.'

On Sunday night, President Zelensky again spoke to Boris Johnson on Sunday night, who told him he will do 'all he could' to ensure further military aid reaches Ukrainian forces.

The Prime Minister praised the 'heroic' resistance of the Ukrainian people in the face of the Russian attack, according to the No 10 readout of the call.

'The Prime Minister lauded the bravery of the Ukrainian people following the Russian invasion and praised the leadership of President Zelensky in the face of such adversity,' a No 10 spokesman said. 'The resistance of the Ukrainian people was heroic, the Prime Minister added.

'President Zelensky said he believed the next 24 hours was a crucial period for Ukraine, and the Prime Minister said he would do all he could to help ensure defensive aid from the UK and allies reached Ukraine.

'The leaders agreed to continue to stay in close contact and the Prime Minister reiterated the UK's staunch support for Ukraine's sovereignty.'

It came as Ursula von der Leyen last night insisted Ukraine is 'one of us' as she led calls for the war-torn nation to join the European Union - which unveiled a fresh package of sanctions against Vladimir Putin's regime, including closing off its airspace to all Russian planes and banning Kremlin propaganda outlets Russia Today and Sputnik.

Earlier on Sunday, Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko issued a chilling threat that the West's sanctions on Russia are pushing the Kremlin into a Third World War.

'Now there is a lot of talk against the banking sector, gas, oil, SWIFT,' Lukashenko said. 'It's worse than war. This is pushing Russia into a Third World War. We need to be restrained here so as not to get into trouble. Because nuclear war is the end of everything.'

Ukraine's health ministry said on Sunday that 352 civilians, including 14 children, had been killed since the beginning of Russia's invasion. It also said that 1,684 people, including 116 children, had been wounded

President Zelensky's office had earlier said the two delegations will meet 'without preconditions' near the Pripyat River, to the north of Chernobyl, in a deal brokered in a phone call with Lukashenko himself.

A spokesperson added that Lukashenko has taken responsibility for ensuring that all planes, helicopters and missiles stationed on Belarusian territory remain on the ground during the Ukrainian delegation's travel, talks and return.

Mr Zelensky described his discussion with Lukashenko as 'very substantive', adding that he had made it clear he did not want troops to move from Belarus to Ukraine and Lukashenko 'assured him of this'.

He added: 'I do not really believe in the outcome of this meeting, but let them try, so that later not a single citizen of Ukraine has any doubt that I, as president, tried to stop the war.'

It came as Putin declared, in his own televised address, that he had ordered troops operating the nuclear deterrent onto a 'special regime of duty' in light of 'aggressive statements' from NATO leaders and 'unfriendly economic actions'. Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg responded: 'This is dangerous rhetoric'.

Citing 'aggressive statements' by NATO and tough financial sanctions, Putin issued a directive to increase the readiness of Russia's nuclear weapons, raising fears that the invasion of Ukraine could lead to nuclear war, whether by design or mistake.

The Russian leader is 'potentially putting in play forces that, if there's a miscalculation, could make things much, much more dangerous,' said a senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss rapidly unfolding military operations.

Ukraine filed a lawsuit against Russia at the Hague, with Mr Zelensky requesting that the UN International Court of Justice orders Russia to stop its attack against Ukraine and starts trials soon.

The United States also condemned Putin's order to put his nuclear forces on high alert as dangerous and 'unacceptable.' The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield also said nothing was 'off the table' when asked about the possibility of Putin being tried in international court as a war criminal.

Boris Johnson, meanwhile, dismissed Putin's announcement as a 'distraction' from the struggle his troops are facing in Ukraine. The Prime Minister also cast doubt on possible negotiations between Russian and Ukrainian delegations to try to resolve the crisis.

'There's nothing I've seen so far in his behaviour that leads me to think that he could possibly be sincere,' he said.

Earlier Russian television footage showed Mr Putin meeting with his defence minister and the chief of the general staff, and instructing them to put the nuclear deterrent on a 'special regime of combat duty'.

'Western countries aren't only taking unfriendly actions against our country in the economic sphere, but top officials from leading Nato members made aggressive statements regarding our country,' he said.

But on a day when the expected assault on Kyiv again failed to materialise and the Ukrainians claimed to have driven Russian forces out of the country's second city Kharkiv, Mr Johnson said his words were 'a distraction from the reality of what's going on'.

'This is an innocent people who are facing a totally unprovoked act of aggression against them, and what's actually happening is that they are fighting back perhaps with more effect, with more resistance, than the Kremlin had bargained for,' he said.

'You can see some of the logistical difficulties that the Russian forces are experiencing. The Russian defence ministry have themselves conceded that they're having casualties. This is a disastrous misbegotten venture by President Putin.'

Elsewhere, oil giant BP announced on Sunday it is ditching its controversial 20 per cent stake in the Russian energy group Rosneft 'with immediate effect'.

Chief executive Bernard Looney revealed the move today, saying he was 'saddened' and 'shocked' by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

It comes after he was summoned to a meeting with Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng on Friday amid growing unease about the BP's Russian dealings.

As Russian troops draw closer to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv's mayor is filled with pride over his citizens' spirit but remains anxious about how long they can hold out.

After a gruelling night of Russian attacks on the outskirts of the city, mayor Vitali Klitschko was silent for several seconds when asked if there were plans to evacuate civilians if Russian troops managed to take Kyiv.

'We can't do that, because all ways are blocked,' he finally said. 'Right now we are encircled.'

Russian troops entered Ukraine on February 24 prompting the country's president to declare martial law and triggering a series of announcements by Western countries to impose severe economic sanctions on Russia

When Russian troops invaded Ukraine on Thursday, the city of 2.8 million people initially reacted with concern but also a measure of self-possession. However, nerves started fraying when grocery stores began closing and the city's famously deep subway system turned its stations into bomb shelters.

The mayor confirmed to the AP that nine civilians in Kyiv had been killed so far, including one child.

A Klitschko-ordered curfew began about sundown on Saturday and is to extend until at least 8 a.m. Monday. His order pointedly stated that any unauthorized person outside could be considered a saboteur.

'We are hunting these people, and it will be much easier if nobody is on the street,' Klitschko explained, saying that six Russian 'saboteurs' were killed Saturday night.

Russian troops' advance on the city has been slower than many military experts had expected.

'I just talked to the president [Volodymyr Zelenskyy]. Everybody is not feeling so well,' Klitschko said, adding that the Ukrainian city government employees were in shock but not depressed. 'We show our character, our knowledge, our values.'

In the last few days, long queues of people - both men and women - were spotted waiting to pick up weapons throughout the capital, after authorities decided to distribute weapons freely to anybody ready to defend the city.

'There are concerns, however, about arming nervous civilians with little military experience amid warnings of Russian saboteurs disguised as Ukrainian police or journalists.

'To be honest, we don't have 100% control,' said Klitschko. 'We built this territorial defense in a short amount of time - but these are patriotic people.'

'Right now, the most important question is to defend our country,' he added.

Responding to a question about the city's capacity to replenish dwindling stocks of food and medicine, Klitschko's view darkened, however.

'We are at the border of a humanitarian catastrophe,' he said. 'Right now, we have electricity, right now we have water and heating in our houses. But the infrastructure is destroyed to deliver the food and medication.

Ukrainian forces in Kyiv destroyed a column of Russian vehicles in the city's northwest after surviving a 'brutal' night of shelling.

Volunteers, among them the former Miss Ukraine Anastasiia Lenna, have taken up arms to fight off Vladimir Putin's army, with 'long queues' of citizens waiting to be issued weapons at recruitment centres in Kyiv.

Ukrainian forces have managed to halt the advance of Russian troops on the capital, blowing bridges into the city to hinder the advance of Moscow's soldiers.

Russian forces were on Sunday afternoon destroyed in Bucha, near the Gostomel air base in the north west of Kyiv, after becoming trapped when the Irpin bridge into the city was destroyed.

Footage posted online purported to show the harrowing aftermath of what military experts said was likely a drone strike on the Russian Airborne Forces column, with parts of vehicles strewn across the road in a warp, fiery heap.

Earlier on Sunday, Ukrainian servicemen were pictured roaming in the centre of Kyiv to enforce a 39-hour curfew to keep people off the streets.

Earlier on Sunday, in a speech to mark Russia's special forces day, Putin thanked soldiers for 'heroically fulfilling their military duty' in Ukraine, before parroting his propaganda line that his armies are providing assistance to the 'people's republics of Donbas' - referring to two rebel-held areas in eastern Ukraine that Russia recognised as independent states ahead of its invasion.

'I want to thank the command, the personnel of the special operations forces, veterans of the special forces units for their loyalty to the oath, for their impeccable service in the name of the people of Russia and our great motherland,' he said.

In a televised address, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the peace talks were called after Belarus prepared its forces to join the Russian invasion.

'Today, we were as close as ever to the entry of Belarus armed forces into the war. This is why President Zelensky and President Lukashenko spoke today,' he said in his address.

'We have to defend our northern flank and we have to minimise the threats coming from there. So we agreed to send a delegation to the location on the Ukranian-Belarus border and we go to there to listen to what Russia has to say.

'We are going there without preliminary agreement on what the outcome of these talks can be. We are going there to say what we think of this war and Russia's actions.'

Mr Kuleba said Belarus had assured Ukraine that no Belarusian military force will be use against Kyiv while the talks take place, but he insisted Ukraine's military military would continue to 'fiercely defend' the country against Russia attacks in the meantime.

'I think the fact Russia wants to talk without any pre-conditions or any ultimatums, without any demands addressed to Ukraine, is already a victory for Ukraine,' he added.

Iskander missiles were launched from Belarus to Ukraine around 5pm (3pm GMT), an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister said.

Russia's flagship carrier announced Sunday it was suspending flights to Europe after the European Union closed its airspace to Russian aircraft for Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.

The announcement came after the EU said Sunday it would close its airspace to Russian carriers, adding to a litany of sanctions imposed on Russia over its attack on Ukraine.

'Aeroflot is suspending flights of the European route network from February 28, 2022 until further notice,' the company said on its website.

The EU's airspace ban prohibits flights into or over the EU by all Russian planes, including private jets.

The measure consolidated what was already de facto largely in place, with many of the EU's 27 nations having individually announced airspace closures to Russian flights.

In response, Russia has barred flights from a number of countries such as Britain, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Poland and the Czech Republic.

Russian forces entered Ukraine's second largest city of Kharkiv today after failing in their overnight efforts to seize control of the capital city of Kyiv

Ukraine's Ministry of Defence today claimed it has killed more than 4,300 Russian soldiers in the first three days of fighting. Russia has not released an updates on its military losses. Pictured: An Ukrainian Territorial Defence fighter examines a destroyed Russian infantry mobility vehicle GAZ Tigr after the fight in Kharkiv

Russian forces stormed Ukraine's second largest city of Kharkiv on Sunday after failing in their overnight efforts to seize control of the capital city of Kyiv.

However reports in Ukraine suggest troops have managed to successfully repel the Russian advance on Kharkiv, which is close to the Russian border, with one British reporter on the ground confirming that the city remains under Ukrainian control despite this morning's attack.

Oleh Sinehubov, head of the Kharkiv regional administration, said Ukrainian troops had managed to reclaim the city. In a post on Telegram, he said: 'Control over Kharkiv is completely ours!

'The armed forces, the national police, and the defence forces are working and the city is being completely cleansed of the enemy.'

Kharkiv's defence came as Ukraine's Ministry of Defence claimed Ukrainian troops had killed or injured more than 4,300 Russian soldiers in the first three days of fighting. Russia has not released an updates on its military losses.

The Kremlin accepted it had lost troops in the conflict for the first time yesterday, but did not provide a number. 'There have been killed and wounded among the Russian military during the course of the special military operation,' the defence ministry in Moscow said in a statement quoted by TASS news agency

A US official told Reuters that Russia had committed around two-thirds of its combat power inside Ukraine and launched more than 320 missiles over the course of the conflict.

In an article yesterday, UK Armed Forces minister James Heappey has insisted Putin's 'days are numbered' if he fails in Ukraine, with his campaign falling 'well behind' its planned timeline.

Mr Heappey, a former major in the Rifles, said Putin's forces had been unable to capture key cities in the first few days of fighting as intended and had left pockets of 'well-armed' Ukrainians to the rear of their front line.

A picture is emerging of a haphazard and disorganised invasion effort, with armoured columns running out of fuel or getting lost, and some having to advance without air cover.

Mr Heappey wrote in the Telegraph: 'After three days of intense fighting, spurred by dogged Ukrainian resistance, Russia is well behind its planned timeline.

'Progress to Kyiv has been much slower than they'd expected, they were unable to take key cities early and now must try to bypass them.

'This leaves pockets of well-armed and well-trained Ukrainians to the rear of the Russian front line, exposing a vulnerable logistics tail - an omen for what awaits Putin.'

At the same time, Ukrainians are volunteering in their droves, with 'long queues' at recruitment centres, the minister wrote.

Meanwhile, footage from the town of Koryukivka, near the Russian border, showed hundreds of locals massing on a road to block the advance of a Russian tank column.

Mr Heappey believes that if Putin fails and ordinary Russians realise 'how little he cares for them ... [his] days as president will surely be numbered and so too will those of the kleptocratic elite that surround him,' he wrote.

'He'll lose power and he won't get to choose his successor.'

There have been fresh questions raised about Putin's mental state, including whether Covid-19 has fueled his paranoia after claims emerged the isolated president spent time 'stewing in his own fears' after 'withdrawing into himself' during the pandemic.

A total of 4,000 Russians have now been arrested at anti-war protests in recent days, according to independent monitoring group OVD-Info, with a demonstration outside the Kremlin near the site where opposition leader Boris Nemtsov was gunned down.



This morning, footage shared on social media showed Putin's army trucks rolling through Kharkiv - a city of 1.41 million people - which sits in Eastern Ukraine close to the border with Russia.

Soldiers were also seen marching on foot, with a very dramatic clip showing Russians slowly advancing along a road before running and firing their guns as Ukrainians opened fire on them.

Another clip shared online shows an army vehicle said to belong to the Russians ablaze, with locals saying it had been torched by Ukrainians seeking to defend their city. Meanwhile, the UK's Ministry of Defence released its latest intelligence update, saying there had been an 'intensive' exchange of rocket artillery in the city, followed by 'heavy fighting' between Ukrainian and Russian forces. It said fighting in the capital Kyiv had been 'less intense' than previous nights.

As the fighting continued, The Kremlin announced that a Russian delegation had arrived in the Belarusian city of Homel for talks with Ukrainian officials. However, while Zelensky said that while said the Ukraine was ready for peace talks, he said they would not be taking place in Belarus - which was a staging ground for Russia troops prior to the invasion.

Putin's regime 'set for real economic pain' after West removes Russian banks from Swift Britain, the US, Canada and the European Union have announced that selected Russian banks would be excluded from the Swift global payments system. Boris Johnson and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky both welcomed the 'increased willingness' to take action against Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. Here, the PA news agency answers key questions about Swift and why the issue is so important. What is Swift? The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (Swift) is a secure messaging system used by financial institutions to move money around the world. Instead of holding or transferring funds, Swift allows banks and companies to alert each other of transactions that are about to take place. Who uses it? The platform, founded in the 1970s, connects more than 11,000 banking and securities organisations, market infrastructures and corporate customers in more than 200 countries and territories. It averaged 42 million messages daily last year to enable payments, with about half of all high-value transactions crossing national borders going through it. Why is it being mentioned following Russia's invasion of Ukraine? It is the latest announcement following a number of sanctions that have hit Russia. The Prime Minister told broadcasters during a visit to RAF Brize Norton: 'It is incredibly important for tightening the economic ligature around the Putin regime.' The move has been described by Armed forces minister James Heappey as the 'ultimate economic sanction'. Why does the UK want Russia to be excluded? Banning Russian banks from the platform would hit the country's access to financial markets across the world. This would cause delays and extra costs for the Russian economy, and would make it harder for other countries to make payments to Russia. How significant would the blow to Russia's economy be? In an explanatory Twitter threat, investment specialist Sahil Bloom wrote: 'Cutting off a nation's banks from SWIFT access restricts flows into and out of that nation. 'Russia is a massive economy with tentacles that reach all around the world… 'It is a key energy supplier to Europe and the world. It is an exporter of materials critical to the manufacturing of jet engines, semiconductors, automotives, electronics, and fertilizers. Cutting off Russia from SWIFT would impact the flow of payments for these industries.' Some commentators have suggested the move could increase energy prices if European countries are unable to pay Russian suppliers of fossil fuels. Advertisement

On another sensational day in the conflict, the EU unveiled a new package of sanctions against Putin's regime, closing off its airspace to all Russian planes and banning Kremlin propaganda outlets Russia Today and Sputnik.

European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen announced the new measures in a press conference this afternoon, which will include funding the purchase and delivery of weapons to Ukraine.

Ms von der Leyen said this was the first time the EU had done this for a country under attack.

She said: 'We are shutting down the EU's airspace for all Russian aircraft, including the private jets of oligarchs.

'Second, in another unprecedented step, we will ban, in the EU, the Kremlin's media machine.

'The state-owned Russia Today and Sputnik, as well as their subsidiaries, will no longer be able to spread their lies to support Putin's lies.'

The breach of Ukraine's defences came hours after Russia was dealt a significant blow when a column of Chechen special forces sent to assassinate Ukrainian President Zelensky were blown up by locals just two days into their mission.

Among the Chechens said to have been wiped out was general Magomed Tushaev. He was commander of the 141th motorized national guard brigade - Chechen head of state Ramzan Kadyrov's elite force.

Tushaev had also been pictured with Kadyrov, in a measure of his importance to the Chechen regime, which shot to notoriety in the west for hunting down, torturing and killing gay men.

It came as Ramzan Kadyrov, the warlord leader of the Chechen Republic, complained Russia's tactics had been 'too sluggish' as he appeared to pave the way for a further escalation of violence against Ukraine.

He said the Ukrainians were 'armed to the teeth with new weaponry and ammunition, and new generation heavy artillery' and that he is 'hoping they will come to their senses' and surrender.

He then asked Putin to 'give all special forces the order to finish off the Nazis and terrorists' in the country. The idea that Russia is 'de-Nazifying' Ukraine is a common propaganda line spouted by Kremlin allies.

The armed group - famed for their barbaric violence and human rights abuses - are said to have been obliterated after their convoy of 56 tanks was blown to smithereens near Hostomel, just northeast of Kyiv, by Ukrainian missile fire on the second day of the Chechens' deployment. It is unclear how many died - but the number is likely to run into the hundreds.

Their deaths were reported by The Kyiv Independent news outlet as officials in Kyiv revealed that they'd managed to maintain control of Ukraine's capital city throughout combat on Saturday night and into Sunday morning.

First Deputy Chairman of Kyiv City State Administration Mykola Povoroznyk said: 'The situation in Kyiv is calm, the capital is fully controlled by the Ukrainian army and the terror defence. At night there were several clashes with sabotage group.'

But Russian forces were seen entering Ukraine's second-largest city of Kharkiv on Sunday morning. Footage shared on social media showed Russian tanks and trucks rolling through the city, which sits in eastern Ukraine, close to the Russian border, with gunshots also heard ringing out.

Other videos shared online showed Russian troops walking in to the city of 1.419 million people on foot, as well as an army truck said to be Russian consumed by flames.

Ukraine's foreign ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko, meanwhile, said their airforce had shot down a missile aimed at the capital Kyiv, by a plane that flew in from Russian ally Belarus.

But while fighting raged in the north, Russian forces said they had successfully blocked Kherson and Berdyansk in the south, effectively opening up a land bridge between Russia and the Crimean peninsula - which it annexed in 2014.

The reported killings of the Chechen assassination squad are a crushing psychological blow for Putin's stalled efforts to conquer Ukraine. The Russian premiere had dispatched the group to capture or kill Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, knowing full well that the fighters' brutal reputation would strike further fear into the hearts of besieged Ukrainians.

Each fighter had been given a deck of cards complete with photos of Ukrainian officials they'd been told to target.

But Zelensky remains standing, and has become a global hero for his brave dispatches from the front line - while his would-be assassins' reported killings have brought huge disgrace and widespread grief to Chechnya.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10557953/Kyiv-encircled-Satellite-images-hundreds-Russian-soldiers-surrounding-Ukrainian-capital.html
