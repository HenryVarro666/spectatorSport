Despite pleas from the international community, Putin rebuffed condemnation and sanctions, warning other countries that attempts made by other states to interfere would lead to “consequences you have never seen.”

On Saturday, Russia ordered its troops to advance in Ukraine “from all directions” as the Ukrainian capital Kyiv imposed a blanket curfew and officials reported 198 civilian deaths. Kyiv residents took shelter to the sound of explosions as Ukraine’s army said it had held back an assault on the capital but was fighting Russian “sabotage groups” which had infiltrated the city.

Startling footage continues to emerge from Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces are attempting to repel Russia’s ongoing invasion. As of Saturday night, Russian forces are still reportedly facing stiff resistance, but the battle for Kyiv is intensifying. As the Washington Post reported Saturday, it is thus far difficult to determine the scale of the bloodshed. Ukraine’s health minister said Saturday that nearly 200 Ukrainians had been killed in the fighting, and 1,000 injured. It is meanwhile impossible to confirm how many casualties there have been among Ukrainian and Russian forces. Below are more scenes from inside as the country as the war rages on (some of this footage is disturbing).

Ukraine’s burning energy infrastructure

An oil depot in the city of Vasylkiv was reportedly targeted by Russian missile strikes on Saturday night, resulting in an enormous fire which could be seen on the horizon from Kyiv, nearly 20 km away to the north.

Doomed Ukrainian border guards telling off a Russian warship

Another remarkable recording captured the defiant last stand of Ukrainian border guards on Snake Island, a tiny outpost in the Black Sea, when they were confronted by a Russian warship on Thursday. In the audio recording, the Russian warship can be heard asking the guards “to lay down your arms and surrender to avoid bloodshed and unnecessary deaths” — to which the Ukranians respond: “Russian warship. Go fuck yourself.”

3,9e214131-2a49-4cd6-9023-441bdd916247,[],2022-02-24 00:00:00,"The European Union approved a second round of sanctions on Russia Friday, joining the United States and other allies in targeting the country’s economy over its attack on Ukraine.

The package takes aim at a range of sectors including finance, transport and energy. It imposes export controls, includes new visa measures and adds more Russians to a sanctions list.

“The package of massive and targeted sanctions European leaders approved tonight clearly demonstrates that it will have maximum impact on the Russian economy and the political elite,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said at a news conference early Friday.

“Our unity is our strength,” she said. “The Kremlin knows this. And it has tried its best to divide us but it has utterly failed.”

More details are expected Friday. But in a series of tweets, von der Leyen said that the sanctions would affect everything from Russia’s ability to upgrade its oil refineries to the ability of businessmen and diplomats to obtain visas.

She said that the sanctions target 70 percent of the Russian banking market and ban the sale of aircraft to Russian airlines.

One question going into the talks was whether the E.U. would heed calls from eastern European countries to cut Russia off from the Swift global payment system. However, President Joe Biden said Thursday Swift was not part of the plan because, “that’s not the position the rest of Europe chooses to take” — suggesting they were overruled.

European leaders have warned for weeks of devastating sanctions, but have been divided on when and how to proceed. Some countries initially hoped to deter a Russian invasion by hitting the country with one big sanctions package, others pressed for an incremental approach.

There has also been public disagreement about whether certain sectors, such as energy, should be excluded because of the potential economic impact on Europe. However, the sight of tanks rolling into eastern Ukraine seemed to quiet the chatter.

On Tuesday, the E.U. announced a first round of penalties that targeted Kremlin officials, lawmakers, three banks and also restricted Russian access to E.U. financial and capital markets.

Putin invaded anyway, sending the bloc scrambling for next steps.

E.U. officials promised that the second tranche would be a tougher blow.
