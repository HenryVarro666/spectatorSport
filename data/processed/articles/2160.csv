The ambassador said his country expected solidarity from NATO member Turkey and that it should not remain impartial after Russia launched an offensive.

Speaking to reporters after holding talks at the Turkish Foreign Ministry, Ambassador Vasyl Bodnar said Turkey will evaluate a Ukrainian request to close the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits to Russian ships.

The request puts NATO member Turkey, which shares a maritime border with Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea and has good relations with both countries, in a difficult position. Under a 1936 pact, Ankara has control over the straits and can limit warship passages during wartime or if threatened.

""We are calling for the air space, Bosporus and Dardanelles straits to be closed. We have conveyed our relevant demand to the Turkish side. At the same time, we want sanctions imposed on the Russian side. Particularly, we demand the seizure of the shares of the Russian business world here,"" Bodnar told a news conference in Ankara.

He underlined the importance of providing defense weapons, as well as financial and humanitarian assistance.

""We also call for support to the citizens of Ukraine currently in Turkey, especially those who need additional protection and security,"" he added.

He stressed that this is the first time in the region that a nuclear-armed country has launched an ""open attack"" on another independent country and ""started a war.""

He said Russia was attacking Ukraine on all fronts, including the borders with Crimea and Belarus as well as the eastern Donbas region.

""The Ukrainian armed forces and our regional security units are fighting against the Russian invaders,"" he said.

Ukraine has declared martial law, he said, adding that they have decided to end diplomatic relations with Russia.

""We call on the whole world to form a coalition against (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and to prevent the expansion of the war, especially in this region. All masks have now been taken down and we are now at war,"" he said.

""We hope that all Turkish people will support Ukraine in this just cause,"" he added.

Later, Bodnar met with Deputy Foreign Minister Sedat Önal at the Turkish Foreign Ministry for 20 minutes.

According to reports, Russia is using weapons and missiles to target key areas in Ukrainian cities.

Early in the day, explosions were reported in several Ukrainian provinces, including the capital Kyiv, and tanks were reported to have crossed the border from Belarus into Ukraine.

The news came shortly after Putin announced a military intervention in Ukraine, just days after recognizing two separatist-held enclaves in eastern Ukraine. The recognition drew international condemnation and threats of tougher sanctions against Moscow.

Russia had amassed over 100,000 troops around Ukraine in recent months, but Putin denied any intention of invading.

Turkey has opposed sanctions on Russia. President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has said Ankara would try managing the crisis without abandoning ties with either Moscow or Kyiv, but has also called Russian steps against Ukraine unacceptable, while also offering to mediate.

While building close cooperation with Russia on defense and energy, Ankara has also sold sophisticated drones to Ukraine and signed a deal to co-produce more, angering Moscow.

Turkey opposes Russian policies in Syria and Libya, its annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its 2008 recognition of two Georgian regions.

Under the 1936 Montreux Convention, NATO member Turkey has control over the Bosporus and Dardanelles straits, linking the Mediterranean and Black seas. The pact gives Ankara the power to regulate the transit of naval warships and to close the straits to foreign warships during wartime and when it is threatened.

Erdoğan said Wednesday that Turkey, which has good ties with both Ukraine and Russia, could not abandon its ties with either country and that it would take steps to ensure relations remain intact.

""It is not possible for us to abandon either (country),"" he said and called on both Ukraine and Russia to resume negotiations, while urging NATO to ""determine its stance"" and ""do whatever it will"" after a summit on Wednesday.

""Our aim is that we take such a step that, God willing, we sort this out without abandoning either one.""

Erdoğan cut short a trip to Africa amid the flurry of diplomacy over the crisis and returned to Turkey late on Tuesday.

He has proposed a trilateral summit in Turkey with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Erdoğan also told Putin on Wednesday that Turkey did not recognize steps against Ukraine's territorial integrity, after Russia recognized two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine.

In a call, Erdoğan told Putin that military conflict in the region would not benefit anyone and repeated his offer to help solve the crisis, his office said in a statement, adding Erdoğan said he valued Putin's close cooperation on regional issues and wanted to continue this.

""President Erdoğan, who renewed his call for the matter to be resolved through dialogue, stated that it was important to bring diplomacy to the forefront, and that (Turkey) continued its constructive stance in NATO as well.""

""Turkey is ready to do its part to reduce tensions and maintain peace,"" he told Putin.

Putin expressed disappointment to Erdoğan at what he said were attempts by Washington and NATO to ignore Russia's security demands, Interfax cited the Kremlin as saying.

On Thursday, the Turkish Foreign Ministry also said that it would provide necessary support and guidance to citizens wishing to leave Ukraine.

The ministry also advised Turkish citizens to stay at home or in a safe place and avoid traveling.

Earlier on Thursday, flag carrier Turkish Airlines (THY) said it canceled all flights to Ukraine on Feb. 24 because of the closure of Ukrainian air space.

Erdoğan also convened a summit of top security officials to discuss the Russian offensive, his office said.",https://www.dailysabah.com/politics/diplomacy/ukraine-asks-turkey-to-close-straits-for-russian-warships

Turkey cannot stop the passage of warships through its straits leading to the Black Sea as Ukraine has requested, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu told the Turkish Hurriyet newspaper on Friday, referencing a clause in the Montreux Convention that allows vessels to return to their home base.

Ukraine appealed to Turkey to block Russian warships from passing through the Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits. Çavuşoğlu said that Turkey is limited in its ability to do so.

“In the case of a war where Turkey is not a party, there are measures that can be taken regarding the countries that are parties in the war,” he said.

“If there is a demand for the ships of the warring countries to return to their bases, then it must be allowed,” he added, referring to Russia.

“Russia had its own clause put in [to the Montreux Convention]. Articles 19, 20 and 21 stipulate that if the ship of a country that is on the Black Sea wishes to pass with a request to return to its base, this is allowed,” Çavuşoğlu said.

More background: The Montreux Convention, signed in 1936, gives Turkey control over the passage of vessels through those two key straits. In peacetime, civilian vessels can pass freely, although there are certain restrictions on the passage of ships not belonging to Black Sea countries.

Black Sea nations — which, along with Turkey, Russia, and Ukraine — also include Bulgaria, Georgia and Romania.

Warships can navigate through the straits during peacetime, but under conditions that restrict aggregate tonnage depending on if they are or are not a Black Sea country and limits the duration of stay in the Black Sea for non-Black Sea nations. There are also limitations on the caliber of weapons they can carry, and Turkey needs to be notified of the request.",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-news-02-25-22/h_b1dac846833337ccfe54d84d5672d68b

I thank my friend Mr. President of 🇹🇷 @RTErdogan and the people of 🇹🇷 for their strong support. The ban on the passage of 🇷🇺 warships to the Black Sea and significant military and humanitarian support for 🇺🇦 are extremely important today. The people of 🇺🇦 will never forget that! — Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa) February 26, 2022

Turkey has so far made no public statements on closing the straits to Russian warships, although President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan spoke with Zelenskiy by phone earlier on Saturday, stating that Ankara is attempting to push for an immediate ceasefire.

Turkish officials have briefed no decision has been taken and the Russian news agency Interfax reported that Russia has received no official notification from the Turkish side about a closure.

Cutting off the Bosphorus and Dardanelles to Russian warships, preventing them from accessing the Black Sea, would be a significant move, not only in terms of cutting off long-term Russian support to its troops in Ukraine but also as a significant show of support to Ukraine.

A ban would prevent Russian warships normally permanently stationed around the world from sailing into the Black Sea to assist troops in Ukraine. However, Turkey is unable to prevent ships permanently stationed in the Black Sea from returning to their bases.

Shipping industry experts Lloyd’s List on Friday pointed out that commercial traffic through the Bosphorus has already slowed significantly in the past two days.

Turkey’s foreign ministry described the Russian invasion as “unacceptable” but described it as a “military operation” rather than a war, as doing so has implications for the Montreux convention.

The convention defines Turkish control of the straits as well as setting limits on the size, tonnage and duration of warships that can cross the straits, although warships belonging to countries bordering the Black Sea are normally able to pass unrestricted.

Foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu on Friday laid out Turkey’s position regarding the closure of the straits to the daily newspaper Hürriyet, stating that officials are discussing whether the conflict meets the definition of a war under the Montreux convention.

If officials decide that the definition has been met, this allows them to block warships from both Ukraine and Russia from passing through the straits, although the move is likely to be far more significant for the Russian side.

“Turkey can stop the passage of warships through the straits,” he said, adding that the convention stipulates that “if there is a demand for ships from the warring countries to return to their bases, then it must be allowed”.

“If we accept the state of war legally, this process will begin,” he added. “Secondly, if we accept the state of war we will prohibit the passage of warships... but even if we ban them, the Russians have such a right.”

Turkey maintains alliances with both Russia and Ukraine, and has so far emphasised its neutrality in the conflict despite selling its Bayraktar TB2 drones to Ukraine and condemning Russia’s actions.

Turkey’s own Nato membership was put under pressure by its decision to buy Russia’s S400 missile defence system in 2017, although Erdoğan has recently sought to show how much Turkey values membership of the organisation, telling journalists that “Nato should have taken a more decisive step”.

The conflict in Ukraine and a rebuke from Russia should Turkey choose to close the straits is likely to heavily affect Turkey’s economy, already hobbled from a year where the lira lost half of its value and as rising energy costs spark protests and discontent. Turkey imports roughly a third of its natural gas supply from Russia, as well as much of its wheat from Russia and Ukraine.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/26/kyiv-piles-pressure-on-ankara-to-close-straits-to-russia-warships-ukraine

Ukraine has appealed to Turkey to block Russian warships from passing through the Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits which lead to the Black Sea, after Moscow on Thursday launched a full-blown assault on Ukraine from land, air and sea.

Under the 1936 Montreux Convention, Turkey has control over the straits and can limit the passage of warships during wartime or if threatened, but the request has put the NATO member in a difficult position as it tries to manage its Western commitments and close ties with Russia.

Speaking in Kazakhstan, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Turkey was studying Kyiv's request but said Russia had the right under the Convention to return ships to their home base, in this case the Black Sea.

So even if Turkey decided after a legal process to accept Ukraine's request and close the straits to Russian warships, he said, they would only be prevented from travelling in the other direction, away from their home base into the Mediterranean.

“If countries involved in the war make a request to return their vessels to their bases, that needs to be allowed,” the Hurriyet daily quoted Cavusoglu as saying.

Turkey’s balancing act

Cavusoglu added that Turkish legal experts were still trying to determine whether the conflict in Ukraine could be defined as a war, which would allow the convention mandates to be invoked.

Ukraine’s ambassador to Turkey, Vasyl Bodnar, said on Friday Kyiv was expecting a “positive response” from Ankara to its request.

Cavusoglu also reiterated Ankara’s opposition to imposing economic sanctions against Russia, a stance that has set Turkey apart from most of its NATO allies which have already announced such measures.

Turkey has cultivated good ties with both Russia and Ukraine. It has said the Russian attack is unacceptable and that it supports Ukraine’s territorial integrity but has avoided using words such as “invasion” to describe what is happening.

Ankara has pursued cooperation with Moscow on defense and energy but has also sold drones to Ukraine and inked a deal to co-produce more. It also opposes Russian policies in Syria and Libya, as well as its annexation of Crimea in 2014.

However, Cavusoglu also made it clear that Russian naval vessels would be still allowed to cross the straits even if the waterway is closed to them during the conflict with Ukraine, as per the agreements established in the 1936 Montreux Convention.

“Turkey can stop the passage of warships through the straits. But there is something else in the Montreux Convention. If there is a demand to [let] the ships of countries at war to return to their bases, it must be allowed,” Turkey’s top diplomat declared.

Cavusolgu also highlighted that Turkish experts are studying the issue and in case “a war-time situation is officially declared, the process will begin.”

“Clearly, all it requires is for Turkey to describe Russia’s attack as a war,” the foreign minister explained.

On 24 February, Kiev made an formal request to Ankara to close the route connecting the Black and Mediterranean Seas for the Russian Navy.

“We demand the closure of the Dardanelles. We want sanctions on the Russian side,” the Ukrainian envoy to Turkey, Vasyl Bondar, said during a news conference in front of the country’s embassy in Ankara.

The Montreux Treaty was established in 1936 with the aim of regulating the movement of warships and merchants through the Turkish Straits to the Black Sea.

Since the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the treaty saw major shifts in response to several countries bordering the Black Sea moving towards the west’s sphere of influence.

According to the agreement, the countries bordering the Black Sea are obliged to inform Turkey of the date their ships will pass through the straits, and the number of ships passing simultaneously should not exceed nine.",https://thecradle.co/Article/news/7282

Under the international Montreux Convention, NATO member Turkey has control over passage of vessels between the Mediterranean and Black Sea, making it a potentially key player in any military conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

Earlier this month, six Russian warships and a submarine transited Turkey's Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits to the Black Sea for what Moscow called naval drills near Ukraine waters. read more

Here are details of the pact and supervisory powers it grants to Turkey, which neighbours Russia, Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria and Georgia on the Black Sea:

TURKEY'S POWERS

Under the 1936 accord, Turkey has control over the Bosphorus and Dardanelles and the power to regulate transit of naval warships. It also guarantees the free passage of civilian vessels in peacetime and restricts the passage of ships not belonging to Black Sea countries.

In wartime, or when it is threatened by aggression, Turkey is authorised to close the straits to all foreign warships. It can also refuse transit for merchant ships from countries at war with Turkey and to fortify the straits in case of conflict.

All non-Black Sea countries wishing to send vessels must notify Turkey 15 days in advance, while Black Sea nations must give eight days notification.

Passage is limited to nine warships of a specific aggregate tonnage at any one time, with no ship above 10,000 tonnes allowed to pass. A non-Black Sea country's ships cannot exceed a total 30,000 tonnes at any time, and the vessels are allowed to stay in the region no more than 21 days. Black Sea states may transit ships of any tonnage.

Black Sea countries can send submarines through the straits with prior notice, as long as they have been built, purchased or sent for repair outside the Black Sea.

Civil aircraft can be transited along routes authorised by the Turkish government. The accord does not contain restrictions on the passage of aircraft carriers, but Ankara says it has control over that as well.

TURKEY'S OPTIONS

Since tensions flared over Ukraine, Turkish officials have said only that Montreux is instrumental in keeping regional peace. President Tayyip Erdogan has said Turkey will do what is necessary as a NATO ally if Russia invades, without elaborating.

Turkey is reliant on Russia for energy and tourism, and has forged close cooperation with Moscow on energy and defence in recent years. It has also sold drones to Ukraine and called the Russian moves against Ukraine unacceptable. read more

Erdogan said Turkey would try to manage the crisis without abandoning ties with either Ukraine or Russia.

In 2008, when Russia recognised the independence of the two Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Ankara rejected U.S. requests to let its warships pass the straits at a time when it depended on Russia for commodities and trade.

During World War Two, the Montreux accord prevented the Axis powers from sending naval forces through the Straits to attack the Soviet Union.
