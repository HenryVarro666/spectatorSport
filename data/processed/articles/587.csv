'The United States will share in the responsibility of caring for the refugees, so the cost do not fall entirely on the European countries bordering Ukraine,' Biden said during remarks at the White House.

Ukraine is experiencing a humantarian crisis because of Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion.

Thus far, 2 million people have fled the Ukraine in what the United Nations has called the biggest humantarian crisis since World War II.

More than 1,000 Ukrainian civilians have been killed since Russia invaded on February 24.

Food and other basic supplies are running short in besieged cities. Additionally, around 700,000 people lack electricity and heating after the destruction of infrastructure.

A further one million Ukrainians are said to have been forced from their homes and internally displaced, according to the United Nations.

It took one week for the refugee numbers to hit one million, the UN pointed out, and, in just five days since then, that figure has doubled.

Neighboring countries flooded with refugees - mostly women and children - and Poland has welcomed more Ukrainians than any other neighboring country.

Vice President Kamala Harris will visit Poland on Wednesday.

Hungary, Slovakia and Romania have each accepted tens of thousands of refugees while other European countries have received some 210,000 refugees in total.

To help ease Europe's financial burden, Biden on Tuesday called on Congress to pass the $10 million Ukrainian assistance package he's requested.

'We're working with humanitarian organizations to send tens of thousands of tons of food, water, medical supplies into Ukraine. With more on the way,' the president said.

Congress is expected to act on an aid package this week.

Demmocratic and Republicanic lawmakers on Capitol Hill are finishing up the pckage of humanitarian, military and economic assistance for Ukraine. It will be tied to the bill to fund the U.S. government, legislation that Congress must adopt before midnight Friday or the federal government will shut down.

The number could hit $14 billion, Senator Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday.

Biden, in his remarks, did not specifically say the United States would be accepting refugees in its borders.

The Biden administration last week granted Ukrainians already in the United States Temporary Protected Status (TPS) status, which shields them from deportation and lets them get work permits for 18 months.

Secretary of State Athony Blinken visited the border between Poland, Ukraine and Moldova on Saturday to visit refugee camps.

Blinken on Saturday visited a welcome center set up by Polish authorities in what once was a shopping mall in Korczowa, close to the border with Ukraine, where roughly 3,000 refugees are taking shelter.

'The United States is committed to doing anything we can, first of all to support the countries that are bearing the immediate burden of taking in Ukrainians, and then, as appropriate, if people seek refugee status in the United States, of course we will look at that and, I'm sure, act on that,' Blinken told CNN on Sunday.

Meanwhile the United Kingdom has come under criticism for the number of refugees it has accepted so far.

Ministers have been slammed by critics over the slow pace of processing applications amid wider calls for Britain to put in place a more generous scheme to help people fleeing the Russian invasion.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10591045/Biden-says-share-responsibility-looking-one-million-Ukrainian-refugees.html

War in Ukraine

What's happening Ukraine's military and citizens continue to resist the Russian invasion. As Russia's attacks escalate, casualties grow and the refugee situation becomes a major crisis. Why it matters The US and Europe have imposed severe economic sanctions on Russia, but that may be just the start in a new era of hostility between the West and Moscow.

Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, in a move Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called a ""war against the whole of Europe."" International leaders joined US President Joe Biden in condemning the ""brutal attack."" The US, EU and UK have imposed economic sanctions on Russia, including ones aimed directly at Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Tensions had been growing for months and were marked by a buildup of Russian forces along Ukraine's borders. Ukraine, which had been part of the Soviet Union for much of the 20th century, declared its independence in 1991. Since then, the country has been establishing closer ties with Western Europe and the US.

Kaspersky deemed US national security threat by FCC

United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi says in a news conference during a visit to Stockholm that ""the time is now to try to help at the border"" rather than discuss how to distribute refugees between countries. Grandi added that Moldova, which is not a member of the European Union, in particular is facing a tide of refugees.

4:24 p.m. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says the bloc has bought enough liquefied natural gas that it should be independent of Russian imports up until the end of the winter. Von der Leyen also told Germany's ARD television that sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine were designed to cause maximum impact on Moscow while causing the least damage possible to Western economies.

3:12 p.m. Britain says Ukraine's air defenses are having success against Russian jets, likely preventing Russia from controlling the airspace. ""Ukrainian air defences appear to have enjoyed considerable success against Russia's modern combat aircraft, probably preventing them achieving any degree of control of the air,"" the defense ministry says in an intelligence update posted on Twitter.

12:00 p.m. Indonesian President Joko ""Jokowi"" Widodo called for a cease-fire in the war between Russia and Ukraine and said continued dialogue rather than economic sanctions on Russia is the way to resolve the crisis.

7:57 a.m. Credit rating agency Fitch downgrades Russia's sovereign rating by six notches further into junk territory to C from B, saying a default is imminent as sanctions and trade restrictions undermine its willingness to service debt.

3:15 a.m. The BBC says it has decided to resume English-language reporting in Russia, which it had suspended last week in light of a new law that makes it illegal to report news that could discredit the Russian armed forces.

Here's the full thread:

1/12 We - Russia - want to be a nation of peace. Alas, few people would call us that now.

2/12 But let's at least not become a nation of frightened silent people. Of cowards who pretend not to notice the aggressive war against Ukraine unleashed by our obviously insane czar.

3/12 I cannot, do not want and will not remain silent watching how pseudo-historical nonsense about the events of 100 years ago has become an excuse for Russians to kill Ukrainians, and for Ukrainians to kill Russians while defending themselves.

4/12 It's the third decade of the 21st century, and we are watching news about people burning down in tanks and bombed houses. We are watching real threats to start a nuclear war on our TVs.

5/12 I am from the USSR myself. I was born there. And the main phrase from there - from my childhood - was ""fight for peace."" I call on everyone to take to the streets and fight for peace.

6/12 Putin is not Russia. And if there is anything in Russia right now that you can be most proud of, it is those 6824 people who were detained because - without any call - they took to the streets with placards saying ""No War.""

7/12 They say that someone who cannot attend a rally and does not risk being arrested for it cannot call for it. I'm already in prison, so I think I can.

8/12 We cannot wait any longer. Wherever you are, in Russia, Belarus or on the other side of the planet, go to the main square of your city every weekday and at 2 pm on weekends and holidays.

9/12 If you are abroad, come to the Russian embassy. If you can organise a demonstration, do so on the weekend. Yes, maybe only a few people will take to the streets on the first day. And in the second - even less.

10/12 But we must, gritting our teeth and overcoming fear, come out and demand an end to the war. Each arrested person must be replaced by two newcomers.

11/12 If in order to stop the war we have to fill prisons and paddy wagons with ourselves, we will fill prisons and paddy wagons with ourselves.

12/12 Everything has a price, and now, in the spring of 2022, we must pay this price. There's no one to do it for us. Let's not ""be against the war."" Let's fight against the war.

U.S. officials raise doubts about Poland jet plan U.S. officials expressed doubts Tuesday about Poland's plan to transfer MiG-29 jets to the U.S. amid Russia's invasion and war against Ukraine. Poland had announced earlier that it was ready to send its MiG fighters to Ramstein Air Base, Germany, ""and place them at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America.""

""The prospect of fighter jets ‘at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America’ departing from a U.S./NATO base in Germany to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance,"" Kirby said in a statement. He said discussions would continue, but ""we do not believe Poland’s proposal is a tenable one."" We are now in contact with the Polish government following the statement issued today. As we have said, the decision about whether to transfer Polish-owned planes to Ukraine is ultimately one for the Polish government.

Officials in the European Union, where Russian oil accounts for one-third of the region’s imports, said Tuesday that they want to reduce Russian oil imports by two-thirds by the end of the year and halt all oil purchases by the end of the decade. Zelenskyy said he was “expecting tough decisions” from the 27-member bloc in the form of additional sanctions against the architects of the invasion of his country. Share this -







‍Fitch cuts Russia's rating further into junk, says debt default imminent Fitch on Tuesday downgraded Russia's sovereign rating by six notches further into the junk territory from ""B"" to ""C,"" saying a default is imminent as sanctions and trade restrictions have undermined its willingness to service debt. Western sanctions have thrown Russia's financial markets into turmoil after it invaded Ukraine, raising significant concerns over its ability and willingness to service debt. Fitch pointed to a presidential decree that could force a redenomination of foreign-currency sovereign debt payments into local currency for creditors in specified countries. ""‍Further ratcheting up of sanctions and proposals that could limit trade in energy increase probability of a policy response by Russia that includes at least selective non-payment of its sovereign debt obligations,"" the ratings agency said in a statement. On March 16, Russia is due to pay $107 million in coupons across two bonds, though it has a 30-day grace period to make the payments. The ""C"" rating in Fitch's assessment is only one step above default, bringing it in line with the Moody's current equivalent score of ""Ca."" The change comes less than a week after Fitch revoked Russia's investment-grade status, slashing its rating to ""B"" from ""BBB."" Peers Moody's and S&P had also lowered their sovereign ratings.

Republicans cheer Russian oil ban and jeer Biden for rising gas prices Congressional Republicans are championing President Joe Biden’s decision to ban Russian oil imports, a highly anticipated move that could continue to push gas prices to record highs. But in the same breath, GOP leaders — eager to win back the House and the Senate this fall — are trying to capitalize by blaming Biden and his energy policies for Americans paying more at the pump. Republicans argue Biden could have it both ways — sanction Russian oil but also keep American prices down by allowing a rampant increase in domestic production, which they argue Biden isn't doing in furtherance of liberal environment goals. But oil production isn't a spigot that can just be flipped on, and the domestic market has been suppressed not just by federal rules, but also due to an international market that depressed the price and made drilling unprofitable. Democrats point to the thousands of wells that have been approved but aren't being drilled. Read more here. Share this -







Poland announces deal to send fighter jets to U.S. air base Poland's minister of foreign affairs has announced a deal to send all of the nation's fighter planes, known as MiG-29s, to a U.S. air base in Germany. ""The authorities of the Republic of Poland, after consultations between the President and the Government, are ready to deploy – immediately and free of charge – all their MIG-29 jets to the Ramstein Air Base and place them at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America,"" the statement said. Poland also requested the U.S. to provide it with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities and requested that other NATO allies do the same. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that the U.S. would give a ""green light"" if Poland or another NATO member were to send jets to Ukraine and that the U.S. could ""backfill"" those jets. ""We're talking with our Polish friends right now about what we might be able to backfill their needs if, in fact, they choose to provide these fighter jets to the Ukrainians,"" he said. ""What can we do? How can we help to make sure that they get something to backfill the planes that they're handing over to the Ukrainians?"" Share this -

Russia 'has gone all in': Does Putin have a way out of his war in Ukraine? Ukraine is still standing. That may be a surprise to Russia as its invasion grinds toward a third destructive week. Not only has it seemingly underestimated its neighbor's resolve, but now its ability to wage — let alone win — a prolonged conflict has come into question. Between the stiffer-than-expected Ukrainian resistance, Russia's early military woes and the expansive penalties that have roiled Moscow's economy, could President Vladimir Putin look for an early offramp to end the war? Ukrainian officials and Russia experts did not express much optimism. Read the full story. Share this -







U.N. Women's director makes plea for humanitarian corridors Alia El-Yassir, U.N. Women’s Regional Director for Europe and Central Asia, is urging for humanitarian corridors for Ukrainians to flee the country. ""There has to be safe access to the kinds of needs, the basic items that they need, and also the humanitarian assistance that they need,"" said El-Yassir on MSNBC, pointing to specific needs women may have when fleeing. ""We have to make sure that we're looking at the gender dimensions of these issues. We cannot be gender blind,"" she continued. El-Yassir also said she is concerned the women and young girls fleeing the country ""are vulnerable to abuse, they are vulnerable to exploitation, and they are vulnerable to violence, gender-based violence, because they are women and girls.

House to vote on legislation banning Russian oil Tuesday The House of Representatives will vote Tuesday on a ban on Russian oil that goes further than the measures President Joe Biden announced earlier in the day, according to a letter from Speaker Nancy Pelosi. More than just cutting off the import of Russian energy products, the legislation will also review the country's access to the World Trade Organization. Additionally, it will reauthorize and strengthen the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, which allows the United States to impose sanctions on countries in response to human rights abuses. ""Because this legislation is an urgent imperative – both morally and for our security interests – the House will consider this legislation on the Floor today,"" Pelosi said.

Zelenskyy makes plea for continued aid in speech to U.K. Parliament Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made an impassioned plea for continued aid from the British Parliament on Tuesday, with an emphasis on aerial support. During his speech, he recounted Ukraine's experiences since Russia first began its invasion of his country nearly two weeks ago. Zelenskyy also appealed to British history, recalling instances in which the United Kingdom had to protect itself. Ukraine is proud of its resistance, he said, and continues to hold out hope as it pushes back against Russian forces. But air raids and helicopters have caused significant casualties and the country will continue to need external support, he said.

CIA director says China 'unsettled' by opposition to Russian invasion China is ""unsettled"" by what is unfolding in Ukraine as it puts up an unexpectedly fierce resistance to Russia and the U.S. and its allies impose a global sanctions regime on Moscow, CIA Director William Burns said Tuesday at a House Intelligence Committee hearing on worldwide threats. China's leaders are concerned about both the economic consequences of its relationship with Russia and the ""reputational damage that can come by their close association"" with President Vladimir Putin, he said. Russia's actions have also brought the United States and European countries closer together, Burns said — another point of concern for Beijing. ""I think they've, you know, valued their relationship with Europe and valued what they believe to be their capacity to try to drive wedges between us and the Europeans,"" he said.

European Commission plans to be Russian-energy free by 2030 The European Commission unveiled a plan Tuesday to make Europe independent from Russian energy before 2030 in response to the invasion of Ukraine. The plan would first tackle Europe's use of Russian gas by diversifying supplies to other sources and would reduce the use of Russian fossil fuels by boosting energy efficiency and relying on renewable energy. The efforts would decrease the E.U.'s demand for Russian gas by two-thirds before the end of the year, the commission said. ""We simply cannot rely on a supplier who explicitly threatens us,"" Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement. ""We need to act now to mitigate the impact of rising energy prices, diversify our gas supply for next winter and accelerate the clean energy transition."" Share this -







U.K. to phase out Russian oil imports by year's end The United Kingdom will phase out Russian oil imports and petroleum products by the end of 2022, the country's business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, announced Tuesday. ""Businesses should use this year to ensure a smooth transition so that consumers will not be affected,"" Kwarteng said in a series of tweets announcing the phaseout. He said the transition will give the market, businesses and supply chains more than enough time to replace Russian imports, which make up 8 percent of U.K. demand. The British government will also work with companies through a new task force ""to support them to make use of this period in finding alternative supplies,"" he said. Additionally, while Russian natural gas only makes up 4 percent of the U.K.'s supply, Kwarteng said he is exploring options to end its use, as well. In another economic blow to the Putin regime following the illegal invasion of Ukraine, the UK will move away from dependence on Russian oil throughout this year, building on our severe package of international economic sanctions. pic.twitter.com/E8MO6WRjPn — Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson) March 8, 2022 Share this -







U.S. intel agencies: Up to 4,000 Russian soldiers have died in Ukraine invasion U.S. intelligence agencies estimate that 2,000 to 4,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in the first two weeks of the invasion of Ukraine — possibly more than the number of American service members killed in the 20-year war in Afghanistan. Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier, the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, said during a worldwide threats hearing before the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday morning that analysts give the estimate low confidence, and that it was based in part on information from “open sources,” which can mean media and social media reports. The estimate underscores the steep price Russia is already paying for a conflict that Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines, in the same hearing, called “a shock to the geopolitical order with implications for the future that we are only beginning to understand.” An estimated 2,448 American service members were killed during two decades of war in Afghanistan, according to The Associated Press.

The New York Times to pull news staff out of Russia The New York Times has announced it will temporarily remove journalists from Russia in the wake of a new law there that effectively outlaws independent reporting on the invasion. “Russia’s new legislation seeks to criminalize independent, accurate news reporting about the war against Ukraine. For the safety and security of our editorial staff working in the region, we are moving them out of the country for now,” a spokeswoman for the Times, Danielle Rhoades Ha, said in a statement published by the outlet on Tuesday.

U.S. to ban Russian oil imports The U.S. is expected to announce it is banning imports of Russian oil as soon as Tuesday, two sources familiar with the matter told NBC News. The move, which is likely to push energy prices even higher, comes as the administration increases sanctions pressure on the Russian economy over the war in Ukraine.

Russian families fall out over clashing views of war in Ukraine When Russian actor Jean-Michel Scherbak wrote on social media that he was ashamed his country had started a war in Ukraine, his mother, a longtime supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin, blocked him online. ""She texted me on Facebook saying that I was a traitor and that I had made my choice,"" Scherbak, 30, an actor and head of a production studio's press relations, told Reuters by telephone. He declined to say which European country he was speaking from, but said he was outside Russia. The falling out between mother and son over the war in Ukraine is one of many to divide Russian families and friends since the fighting broke out on Feb. 24. Ukraine and its allies call Russia's actions a brutal invasion that has killed hundreds of civilians. Apartment blocks have been reduced to rubble, towns have been evacuated and nearly 2 million Ukrainians have fled the country. Kyiv has accused Moscow of war crimes. Putin says Russia launched a special operation to destroy its neighbour's military capabilities and remove what it regards as dangerous nationalists in Kyiv. Russia denies it has targeted civilians. Russian and international media have covered the conflict very differently. Most Russians get their news about Ukraine from pro-Kremlin outlets, which present a radically different interpretation of what is happening to others. Share this -

Ukraine accuses Russian forces of shelling key evacuation route Ukraine has accused Russian forces of violating a cease-fire agreement and shelling a humanitarian corridor from Zaporizhzhia to Mariupol as buses waited to collect evacuees from the latter city in southeastern Ukraine. ""Ceasefire violated! Russian forces are now shelling the humanitarian corridor from Zaporizhzhia to Mariupol,"" Ukraine's ministry of foreign affairs said in a tweet Tuesday. The ministry said the shelling came as eight trucks and 30 buses were ready to deliver humanitarian aid to Mariupol and to evacuate civilians to Zaporizhzhia. Russia had on Monday named Mariupol as one of several cities where humanitarian corridors would be opened. Both Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said resources to Mariupol had been cut off by Russian forces. They said a child had died of dehydration. NBC News was not able to independently verify the death. In a tweet, Kuleba said Russian forces were effectively holding ""300k civilians hostage in Mariupol"" and preventing humanitarian evacuation.

Shell to withdraw from Russian fossil fuels, shutter gas stations across Russia Oil giant Shell will withdraw from Russian fossil fuels in addition to closing all of its service stations across the country, the company announced Tuesday. Shell Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden confirmed the news in a statement and also apologized for buying Russian crude oil last week. “We are acutely aware that our decision last week to purchase a cargo of Russian crude oil to be refined into products like petrol and diesel — despite being made with security of supplies at the forefront of our thinking — was not the right one and we are sorry,"" he said. ""As we have already said, we will commit profits from the limited, remaining amounts of Russian oil we will process to a dedicated fund,"" van Beurden said, adding: ""We will work with aid partners and humanitarian agencies over the coming days and weeks to determine where the monies from this fund are best placed to alleviate the terrible consequences that this war is having on the people of Ukraine.""

'Anti-war momentum' will only keep growing across Russia, Navalny says Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny has said he believes anti-war sentiments in Russia are growing as he called on residents to continue taking to the streets to protest the war in Ukraine. In a Twitter thread Tuesday, Navalny said he believed the ""anti-war momentum"" was on the rise in Russia and would only ""keep growing across the society."" ""So, the anti-war protests should not be halted under any circumstances,"" Navalny, who is currently serving two years and eight months in prison for charges that human rights groups have criticized as being politically motivated, said via his team. Navalny said his team had run a series of ""4 quick, ultra-short online polls,"" with each survey including 700 participants from Moscow. While he acknowledged the limitations of such a survey, he said the results suggested a rise in the percentage of people who view Russia as the ""aggressor"" in the current conflict. The findings also noted a rise from late February to early March in the share of people in Moscow who believe ""conflicting parties should immediately cease all military operations and engage in peace talks."" ""Whether Russians actually support the hideous war that Putin has waged against Ukraine is a matter of utmost political importance. The answer to this question will largely define Russia’s place in the history of the 21st century,"" Navalny said. Share this -

Rising oil prices could affect thousands of products American drivers were in for another unwelcome surprise at the pump Monday. The national average for a gallon of gas rose about 5 cents overnight to $4.065, an astonishing 46 cents higher than it was only a week ago, according to AAA, and only a nickel shy of the record set in 2008. With the war in Ukraine escalating and talk of the U.S. imposing sanctions on Russian oil, the price of West Texas Intermediate crude — the U.S. benchmark — topped $120 a barrel Monday afternoon. Andrew Lipow, the president of Lipow Oil Associates, said traders were steering clear of Russian oil ahead of a possible embargo. “What you see is that the oil industry is imposing a de facto ban on oil from Russia, so, in essence, that takes oil off the market,” he said. Climbing prices at the pump are the most visible reminder of the rising cost of oil. But what people can’t see is also costing them. Petroleum derivatives hide in thousands of everyday goods and household products, from microfiber to moisturizer to medicine. Their prices are rising, too. Read the full story here. Share this -

For the latest developments of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, all times EST:

11:30 p.m.: President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he no longer expects Ukraine to be accepted into NATO and is focused on other ways to defend his country from Russian attacks.

“I have cooled down regarding this question a long time ago after we understood that … NATO is not prepared to accept Ukraine,” Zelenskyy told ABC News. “The alliance is afraid of controversial things and confrontation with Russia.”

To some observers, this signaled a willingness for negotiations with Russia which has long demanded that Ukraine abandon aspirations to join NATO. Zelenskyy said he is “ready for dialogue” in the interview but also called on both Europeans and Americans to increase their support for the country.

“We are a place in Europe, a place of freedom, a zone of freedom,” he said in the interview. “When the limits of rights and freedoms are being violated and stepped on, then you have to protect us. Because we will come first, you will come second.”

9:40 p.m.: Russia’s military failures in Ukraine, combined with crippling economic sanctions, are likely to spur Russian President Vladimir Putin to apply heavier and more indiscriminate force in his war against Kyiv, according to the latest public assessment by U.S. intelligence officials.

The officials painted a bleak picture for Ukraine Tuesday during testimony before Congress on the U.S. intelligence community’s annual Worldwide Threat Assessment, warning that despite mounting a fierce and often effective resistance, a growing number of cities will face growing desperation. VOA's Jeff Seldin has more.

9:05 p.m.: Fact checking Russian Military's So-Called Precision Strikes in Ukraine. ​

8:20 p.m.: Maj. Gen. Borys Kremenetskyi, Ukraine’s defense attaché to the U.S., said more air defenses is the priority to Ukraine now.

“It can be ground based air defense systems. It can be fighter jets, whatever possible,” he said in an interview with The Associated Press after a meeting at the Pentagon. He said many countries have Russian-made air defense systems that Ukrainians know how to use.

He said they also need anti-tank, anti-armor weapons and ways to defend their coast against Russian ships in the Black Sea.

7:49 p.m.: President Joe Biden on the Ukrainian people:

6:51 p.m.: U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken tells NATO allies their security is guaranteed.

5:45 p.m.: Short-wave radio is back.

5:40 p.m.: More Western corporations suspend operations.

5:25 p.m. The Department of State reissued the Travel Advisory for Ukraine to update information regarding the current security situation and remind U.S. citizens that they should not travel to Ukraine. The updated Travel Advisory gives specific instructions to those U.S. citizens who choose to travel to Ukraine despite the Travel Advisory. This update replaces the previous Travel Advisory issued on February 28, 2022.

4:30 p.m. Russia's central bank on Tuesday announced citizens with foreign currency accounts would not be allowed to withdraw more than $10,000 until September 9 and said banks could not sell hard currency, Reuters reports.

The bank, which earlier in the day announced a series of steps to help players, such as private pension funds and management companies, cope in a financial market hit by foreign sanctions, said in a statement that regardless of what foreign currency clients held in their accounts, withdrawals would be paid in U.S. dollars.

3:52 p.m.: A superyacht linked to Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich left Barcelona on Tuesday where it had been undergoing repairs in a local shipyard, Reuters reported. The 460-foot Solaris, which sails under a Bermuda flag according to monitoring site Marine Traffic, left Spanish company MB92's Barcelona shipyard late Tuesday, according to the same site. MB92 declined to comment.

The superyacht, which was built in a German shipyard and first took to the sea early last year, is one of a string of yachts owned by Abramovich, according to reports in luxury goods publications SuperYachtFan, SuperYacht Times and Forbes.

Abramovich, who last week put Chelsea Football Club up for sale and promised to donate money from the proceeds to help victims of the war in Ukraine, has not been the target so far of any sanctions over Moscow's invasion. A spokeswoman for Abramovich said: ""We never comment on the movements of the yacht or any other vehicles or vessels.""

French authorities last week took into temporary custody four cargo vessels and one luxury yacht linked to Russian oligarchs as the United States and other governments ramped up sanctions on Russia's super-rich with links to President Vladimir Putin. At least five other superyachts owned by Russian billionaires were anchored or cruising in the Maldives last week, an island nation in the Indian Ocean with no extradition treaty with the United States.

There are currently three other yachts reportedly tied to Russian oligarchs at the Barcelona shipyard, according to Marine Traffic. One of them is related to Sergei Chemezov, chief of Russian state aerospace and defense conglomerate Rostec, who was sanctioned last week by the United States. The other two are understood to belong to Russian oligarchs who have not been sanctioned - Andrey Molchanov, the main shareholder in Russian homebuilder LSR, and metals magnate Mikhail Prokhorov. Another superyacht, named Eclipse, which is also reportedly owned by Abramovich, was in Barcelona last autumn and is now in the Caribbean Sea near the British Virgin Islands.

3:41 p.m.: Hundreds of residents of Ukraine’s port city of Odesa have been working together to strengthen defenses against approaching Russian forces. Some welders made steel spikes called “hedgehogs” arrayed with razor wire to stop military vehicles from entering the city. The local yacht club organized the filling of sandbags for barricades and fortifications. By Tuesday, Odesa was facing food shortages and many people were leaving the city in anticipation of a Russian assault. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty has this report.

3:25 p.m.: The U.N.’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) raised concerns about safe management of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine on Tuesday. In an official statement, IAEA said the same shift of 210 technical personnel and guards have been working there since Russian forces took control of the site 13 days ago.

Staff have access to food and water, and medicine to a limited extent, the Ukrainian regulator told IAEA. However, the situation for staff was worsening, it added.

“I’m deeply concerned about the difficult and stressful situation facing staff at the Chornobyl nuclear power plant and the potential risks this entails for nuclear safety,” said IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi. “I call on the forces in effective control of the site to urgently facilitate the safe rotation of personnel there,” he added.

3:07 p.m.: Poland is ready to deploy all its MIG-29 jets to Ramstein Air Base in Germany and put them at the disposal of the United States, according to a statement released by the Foreign Ministry Tuesday. Poland also requested the United States to provide it with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities. The Polish government urged other NATO members that own planes of that type to do the same.

3:02 p.m.: Explainer: What does a U.S. ban on Russian oil accomplish?

2:59 p.m.: The U.S. is banning all imports of Russian oil and gas, President Joe Biden announced Tuesday — a move that he said ""will deal another powerful blow to Putin's war machine"" as the Russian army continues its assault on Ukraine. VOA’s White House Correspondent Anita Powell has the details.

2:47 p.m. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and French President Emmanuel Macron compared notes Tuesday on ongoing diplomacy to diminish the violence in Ukraine and bring the Kremlin’s war to a halt. VOA’s State Department Correspondent Nike Ching shared the statement on Twitter.

2:03 p.m. VOA’s Yan Boechat reports from Irpin near the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, where blasts could be heard in the distance as civilians tried to evacuate Tuesday. Boechat reports that others in the area remain in hiding.

1:34 p.m. Resistance to the Russian invasion of Ukraine takes many forms. For some people in the Donetsk region, it means flooding their local volunteer center to create supplies for Ukrainian soldiers fighting the Russians. VOA's Yaroslava Movchan has the story, narrated by Anna Rice.

1:21p.m. : Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has highlighted internal divides within Mideast nations, according to The Associated Press. Political elites closely allied with the West are wary of alienating Russia or the U.S. and Europe. But other forces — from Shiite militia factions in Iraq, to Lebanon's Hezbollah group and Houthi rebels in Yemen — vocally support Russia against Ukraine.

12:52 p.m. : Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed Britain’s Parliament Tuesday. He was greeted with a standing ovation as he prepared to make his remarks via video link. Zelenskyy appealed to Britain to do more to help his country battle Russia and punish what he called a ""terrorist state,"" striking a defiant tone that Ukraine would fight on, no matter what the cost, according to Reuters. “The question for us now is to be or not to be,” Zelensky said. “I can give you a definitive answer: It’s definitely to be.” Following Zelenskyy’s address, Britain’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his country would continue to support Ukraine with military and humanitarian assistance, and continued sanctions against Russia. The prime minister's office streamed the speech live on Twitter.

12:48 p.m.: Britain's BBC on Tuesday said it would resume English language reporting in Russia after it suspended its coverage, according to Reuters. On March 4, the BBC said it had paused its reporting in Russia after parliament passed a law there that could impose a jail term of up to 15 years for anyone found to be intentionally spreading ""fake"" news. ""We have considered the implications of the new legislation alongside the urgent need to report from inside Russia. After careful deliberation we have decided to resume English language reporting from Russia this evening (Tuesday 8 March),"" the BBC said in a statement. ""We will tell this crucial part of the story independently and impartially, adhering to the BBC’s strict editorial standards. The safety of our staff in Russia remains our number one priority.""

12:24 p.m.: Britain announced Tuesday it will phase out Russian oil imports during the course of the year, in response to Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, choking off one of Moscow’s valuable sources of income, reports VOA’s Nike Ching.

12:11 p.m.: “The European Commission on Tuesday presented a plan to cut Russian gas imports by two thirds this year, steeply reducing — but not severing — energy ties to Moscow,” the Washington Post reported. “The proposal, to be discussed by leaders at a summit in Paris this week, is a dramatic shift for a bloc that remains heavily reliant on relatively cheap and abundant Russian energy. But it falls short of the full-scale boycott that some have called for in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,” the newspaper added. The EC presented its plan on the same day that U.S. President Joe Biden announced he is banning all Russian oil and gas imports, in a move intended to punish Russia's leaders for invading Ukraine.

11:54 a.m.: U.N. and international aid agencies are calling for an end to hostilities in Ukraine as the number of civilian casualties grows and more people flee in terror to safety in neighboring countries. The situation in parts of Ukraine have been described as “apocalyptic” as people run out of essential supplies. Aid agencies say priority needs include emergency shelter, health care, food, water and sanitation, and psychosocial support to help people deal with what aid groups call an epidemic of trauma and grief. VOA’s Lisa Schlein has this report.

11:36 a.m.: U.S. President Joe Biden announced Tuesday that he is banning Russian oil and gas imports, in order to hold Russia accountable for its “unprovoked and unjustified war on Ukraine,” VOA White House Bureau Chief Patsy Widakuswara reports.



“We’re moving forward with this ban, understanding many of our European allies and partners may not be in a position to join us,” Biden said during a press conference.



“Defending freedom is going to cost us in the United States. Republicans and Democrats alike understand this,” Biden said.



“Russia’s aggression is costing us all, and it’s no time for profiteering or price gouging,” he warned.



“This crisis should motivate us to accelerate the transition to clean energy,” Biden said. “Tyrants like Putin won’t be able to use fossil fuels as weapons against other nations.”

10:55 a.m.: Humanitarian crisis on Day 13 after Russia invaded Ukraine in Pictures

10:46 a.m.: U.S. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said on Tuesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin is unlikely to be deterred and may escalate the assault on Ukraine, despite setbacks in Ukraine and economic hardships resulting from international sanctions. “Our analysts assess that Putin is unlikely to be deterred by such setbacks and instead may escalate,” she told a House of Representatives hearing on global threats. VOA's National Security Correspondent Jeff Seldin is following the testimony of Haines and others as the U.S. House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence holds its annual worldwide threats hearing.

10:42 a.m.: Ukrainians in the eastern city of Sumy were evacuating on buses amid a 12-hour-long ceasefire in that area, The Associated Press reports. Videos Tuesday showed people boarding buses, and multiple buses marked with a red cross driving along a snowy road.

Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said both sides agreed to a ceasefire from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. for the evacuation of civilians from Sumy. Those leaving include foreign students from India and China, she said. The safe corridors were agreed on by Ukrainian and Russian officials during their third round of direct talks March 7. More talks are expected.

The Russian Defense Ministry has said civilians will be allowed to also leave the southern port city of Mariupol and the capital Kyiv. The governor of the Kyiv Region, which surrounds the capital, said Ukraine was making arrangements to get people out of Irpin, which has been cut off from electricity, water and heat for four days. In Mariupol, an estimated 200,000 people – nearly half its population – are hoping to flee as hospitals there face severe shortages of antibiotics and painkillers. An official with Ukraine’s presidential office says humanitarian aid is being sent to the city.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for the expansion of humanitarian corridors on Tuesday. Russia’s ambassador to the U.N. suggested that humanitarian paths could give people a choice in where they want to go. Earlier offers from Russia indicated that humanitarian corridors would lead only to Russia or Belarus.

10:27 a.m.: Jailed Russian opposition politician Alexey Navalny has again called for protests against Moscow's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, saying the response of Russians to the war ""will largely define Russia's place in the history of the 21st century.""



Navalny, the Kremlin critic who is currently serving a 2 1/2-year sentence on what his supporters and Western legal analysts call a trumped-up fraud charge, wrote on Twitter on March 8 that anger against the war was building inside Russia and ""the anti-war momentum will keep growing across the society, so the anti-war protests should not be halted under any circumstances.""

10:07 a.m.: Thirteen days into a brutal war in Ukraine and Russian President Vladimir Putin has failed to subjugate Ukraine. He appears no nearer to replacing its defiant government with a puppet regime. An out-gunned Ukraine has defied widespread pre-war predictions that it wouldn’t be able to hold out for long against superior Russian forces, and the Kremlin now faces the prospects of a prolonged battle that’s sparking a debate among Western officials and independent analysts about whether the invasion of Ukraine may mark the beginning of the end of Vladimir Putin. VOA’s Jamie Dettmer has the story.

10:00 a.m.: The U.S. House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence will hold its annual worldwide threats hearing Tuesday morning.

Wray, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines and other senior officials are expected to appear, according to the Washington Post, which said they are likely to face questions about Ukraine, North Korea’s recent missile test, and Iran’s nuclear program.

9:43 a.m.: The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) released a progress report Tuesday, detailing efforts to protect cultural properties in Ukraine. The organization said it is in contact with Ukrainian cultural professionals and institutions and continues to assess the situation, following Russia’s invasion.



“We must safeguard the cultural heritage in Ukraine, as a testimony of the past but also as a catalyst for peace and cohesion for the future, which the international community has a duty to protect and preserve,” stated Audrey Azoulay, UNESCO Director-General, at the start of the conflict.



UNESCO says it is in contact with Ukrainian authorities to mark cultural sites and monuments with the distinctive “Blue Shield” emblem of the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict to avoid deliberate or accidental damages.



UNESCO, with its partner UNITAR (United Nations Institute for Training and Research), also analyses satellite imagery for priority sites, which are endangered or already impacted, in order to assess damage, the statement said.

9:13 a.m.: The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) on Tuesday launched its humanitarian response plan for the next six-months, aiming to reach 800,000 people inside Ukraine and the neighboring countries of Poland, Romania and Moldova. It is appealing to donors for $82 million to meet the costs of the operation, the NRC said in a press statement.



“Every second the war forces a person to flee across Ukraine’s borders, and countless are displaced within the country,” said Jan Egeland, Secretary General of the NRC. “This is the fastest-growing displacement crisis I have witnessed in my 35 years as a humanitarian worker, and it is urgent to get assistance quickly into the worst affected areas,” he added.



“We appeal to donors to dig deep into their pockets to find new funding for people affected by the armed conflict in Ukraine, but not take resources from other crises. Human suffering is at unprecedented levels across the world - from Afghanistan to Central Sahel - and Ukraine is the latest in a long list of crises with record humanitarian needs,” said Egelan

8:51 a.m.: International Women's Day, marked each year on March 8, is a global day to celebrate women, but many fleeing Ukraine feel only the stress of finding a new life for their children as husbands, brothers, and fathers stay behind to defend their country from Russia's invasion. As The Associated Press reports, Ukrainian women refugees find themselves in “some kind of terrible dream.”

8:32 a.m.: U.S. First Lady Jill Biden released a statement Tuesday to mark International Women's Day, making special mention of women caught in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. ""To our sisters from Ukraine who are fighting to keep their country free and their families alive: We stand with you in solidarity,"" she said.

Shell Chief Executive Officer, Ben van Beurden, said in a company statement published online March 8, ""We are acutely aware that our decision last week to purchase a cargo of Russian crude oil to be refined into products like petrol and diesel – despite being made with security of supplies at the forefront of our thinking – was not the right one and we are sorry.""

He added, ""As we have already said, we will commit profits from the limited, remaining amounts of Russian oil we will process to a dedicated fund. We will work with aid partners and humanitarian agencies over the coming days and weeks to determine where the monies from this fund are best placed to alleviate the terrible consequences that this war is having on the people of Ukraine.""

7:12 a.m. : In an article titled ""Putin's Iron Fist vs. Zelensky's Moral Clarity,"" The Harvard Gazette interviewed faculty historian Nancy Koehn, author of ""Forged in Crisis: The Power of Courageous Leadership in Turbulent Times.""

Blinken said the United States and NATO “are prepared to meet any threat from any direction it comes.” He called on Russia to allow humanitarian access for civilians in Ukraine, and said Ukraine’s allies will do “everything we can” to ensure Ukrainians have what they need to defend themselves.

“This is President Putin’s war to subjugate a sovereign, democratic country. And until he ends it, the world will hold him accountable,” Blinken said.

6:13 a.m.: Jodep Borrell, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, said Tuesday the EU should use a “broader toolbox” to curb the spread of disinformation to protect democracies from foreign interference, citing Russian propaganda and state-owned media such as Russia Today.

“I will propose a new mechanism that will allow us to sanction those malign disinformation actors,” Borrell said.

5:30 a.m.: As much of the world celebrates International Women’s Day on Tuesday, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian women are displaced from their homes, fleeing a Russian inspired war in their homeland. A decree by Ukraine’s government that prohibits men 18 to 60 years of age from leaving the country means that most of those fleeing Ukraine are women and children.

The number of people fleeing Ukraine since the war began last week has reached 2 million Tuesday, according to the U.N. refugee agency, in what they called Europe’s fastest-growing refugee crisis since World War II.

Most refugees are seeking safety in Poland — more than 1 million had entered the country as of Monday — while some 180,000 had crossed Ukraine's border into Hungary.

Ukraine and Russia agreed to allow civilian evacuations from some areas on Tuesday.

Additionally, Australia’s Ministry for Foreign Affairs issued a statement Tuesday announcing further sanctions on Russia’s military commanders and those it says are responsible for state propaganda and disseminating disinformation.

The measure targets 10 people Australia says are “of strategic interest to Russia” and have been “driving and disseminating false narratives about the “de-Nazification” of Ukraine, making erroneous allegations of genocide against ethnic Russians in eastern Ukraine, and promoting the recognition of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic as independent,” the ministry said in the statement.

12:30 a.m.: The World Bank approved $723 million in financial support for Ukraine. The package voted on by the bank’s board of executive directors includes $489 million in loans and guarantees, $134 million in grant financing and $100 million in parallel financing.

The bank said it is working to create an additional $3 billion support package for Ukraine and will help support neighboring countries taking in refugees.

“The World Bank Group is taking quick action to support Ukraine and its people in the face of the violence and extreme disruption caused by the Russian invasion,” said World Bank President David Malpass in a statement. “The World Bank Group stands with the people of Ukraine and the region. This is the first of many steps we are taking to help address the far-reaching human and economic impacts of this crisis.”

12:00 a.m.: The U.S. is refuting Russian claims that its military is “preventing war” in Ukraine instead of causing it.

“This is a flat out lie,” U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price tweeted. “Russia’s military operation is instigating a war in Ukraine. Ukraine does not want a war. #StopTheLies.”

Russia has tried to justify its invasion with various claims including saying it is protecting ethnic Russians in the country and is trying to “de-nazify” the country. Price referred to a statement by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov who said: “The goal of Russia's special military operation is to stop any war that could take place on Ukrainian territory or that could start from there.”

8:30 p.m.: First lady of Ukraine pens open letter to media

The first lady of Ukraine, Olena Zelenska, wrote an open letter to the media on Tuesday blaming Russia for the “mass murder of Ukrainian citizens.”

“When Russia says that it is 'not waging war against civilians,' I call out the names of these murdered children first,” the letter said.

Zelenska names some of the war’s youngest victims and details the current harrowing reality on the ground in Ukraine.

“Local communities on social media are full of despair. Many people, including the elderly, severely ill and those with disabilities, have been debilitatingly cut off, ending up far from their families and without any support. War against these innocent people is a double crime,” Zelenska said.

The first lady also praised the bravery and determination of Ukrainians fighting back on the frontlines but also those continuously showing up to provide necessary aid.

“The aggressor, Putin, thought that he would unleash blitzkrieg on Ukraine. But he underestimated our country, our people, and their patriotism. Ukrainians, regardless of political views, native language, beliefs, and nationalities, stand in unparalleled unity,” Zelenska said.

Zelenska added thanks to countries worldwide for the continued support being provided and to the media for continued coverage of the war.

4:25 p.m. - Thousands evacuated from eastern city of Sumy on Tuesday: Ukrainian official

Authorities evacuated thousands of people from the eastern city of Sumy on Tuesday, a senior Ukrainian official said.

Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said that 5,000 people, including 1,700 foreign students, were evacuated from Sumy.

Vereshchuk reaffirmed that Ukraine will not accept Moscow’s offer to establish safe corridors for civilians to head toward Russia, saying it will only agree to safe exits leading westward.

Vereshchuk said that the evacuation from the southern port of Mariupol failed Tuesday because the Russian troops fired on a Ukrainian convoy carrying humanitarian cargo to Mariupol that was to carry civilians from the city on its way back. She said the city was in a “catastrophic situation” cut from water, power and communications, adding that a child in Mariupol has died of dehydration.

The Russian military has denied firing on convoys and charged that the Ukrainian side was blocking the evacuation effort.

3:00 p.m. - Russia offers humanitarian ceasefire again

The Russian military offered again on Tuesday to provide humanitarian corridors for civilians to leave five Ukrainian cities after several previous attempts to establish safe exits have failed.

Ukrainian officials said that Russian shelling again made it impossible for civilians to use the corridors on Tuesday despite a deal reached a day earlier. The Russian military has countered the claim, alleging that Ukraine only has allowed civilians to use one corridor from the city of Sumy and blocked other routes from Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol.

1:15 p.m. - New York Times pulls news staff from Russia

The New York Times has temporarily pulled its journalists from Russia amid new repressive laws targeting the news media.

“Russia’s new legislation seeks to criminalize independent, accurate news reporting about the war against Ukraine. For the safety and security of our editorial staff working in the region, we are moving them out of the country for now,” Times spokeswoman Danielle Rhoades Ha said in a statement.

“We look forward to them returning as soon as possible while we monitor the application of the new law,” Rhoades Ha said. “We will continue our live, robust coverage of the war and our rigorous reporting on Russia’s offensive in Ukraine and these attempts to stifle independent journalism.”

Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a bill into law Friday that criminalizes the intentional spreading of what Moscow deems to be “fake” reports. Those convicted of the offense would face up 15 years in prison.

But in an open letter to employees, McDonald's President and CEO Chris Kempckinski said closing those stores is the right thing to do because McDonald's can't ignore the “needless human suffering in Ukraine.”

McDonald's owns 84% of its Russian restaurants. In a recent financial filing, the company said Russia and Ukraine contributed 9% of the company's revenue last year.

12:30 p.m. - Biden: Putin ‘seems determined to continue on his murderous path’

President Biden said Russian President Vladimir Putin “seems determined to continue on his murderous path no matter the cost.”

But the Russian leader “will never” see victory in Ukraine, Biden said from the White House as he announced the U.S. was banning Russian oil imports.

President Biden: ""This much is already clear; Ukraine will never be a victory for Putin. Putin may be able to take a city, but he'll never be able to hold a country."" pic.twitter.com/4eI6xzrAlK — CSPAN (@cspan) March 8, 2022

“He has already turned two million Ukrainians into refugees,” Biden said. “Russia may continue to grind out its advance at a horrible price, but this much is already clear: Ukraine will never be a victory for Putin. Putin may be able to take a city, but he'll never be able to hold the country. And if we do not respond to Putin's assault on global peace and stability today, the cost of freedom, and to the American people, will be even greater tomorrow.”

The invasion of Ukraine is also taking its toll on Russian forces, with U.S. intelligence agencies estimating that between 2,000 and 4,000 Russian soldiers have been killed since the invasion began on Feb. 24, Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier, the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, told the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday.

Berrier cautioned that the estimate is of low confidence and includes information from “open sources,” NBC News reported. But it shows the price Russia is paying for the invasion nearly two weeks after it began.

At the same congressional hearing, director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said the conflict is “a shock to the geopolitical order with implications for the future that we are only beginning to understand.”

Putin believes “he cannot afford to lose” the war, Haines said, and intelligence analysts expect a drawn-out conflict with a “persistent and significant insurgency” from Ukrainians.

11:30 a.m. - Biden announces ban on Russian oil imports

President Joe Biden announced that the U.S. is banning all imports of Russian oil and gas.

Speaking from the White House, Biden said, “I’m announcing the United States is targeting the main artery of Russia’s economy. We’re banning all imports of Russian oil and gas and energy. That means Russian oil will no longer be acceptable at U.S. ports and the American people will deal another powerful blow to Putin’s war machine.”

Biden said the latest sanction has “strong bipartisan support in Congress and, I believe, in the country.” The announcement comes amid rising pressure from Democrats and Republicans, and it reflects a willingness to accept the political risk of rising gas prices to economically retaliate against Russia.

“Americans have rallied to support the Ukrainian people and made it clear we will not be part of subsidizing Putin’s war,” the president said.

The decision was made “in close consultation with allies and partners around the world, especially in Europe,” Biden said.

The president said some allies, particularly in Europe, “may not be in a position to join us,” given their dependency on Russian oil.

“The U.S. produces far more oil domestically than all the European countries combined,” Biden noted.

“So we can take this step when others cannot,” he said. “But we’re working closely with Europe and our partners to develop a long-term strategy to reduce their dependence on Russian energy as well.”

As the average price of a gallon of gas in the U.S. hit a record high of $4.17 on Tuesday, the president warned “there will be costs as well here in the United States.”

“With this action it’s going to go up further,” Biden said of gas prices, adding that Americans are “hurting at the gas pump” because of “Putin’s war.”

“I’m going to do everything I can to minimize Putin’s price hike here at home,” the president said.

Biden told pool reporters Tuesday blamed rising gas prices on Russia go up saying, he ""can't do much right now ... Russia is responsible.""

Notably, he said prices are ""going to go up.""

Around the same time as Biden's announcement, Britain said it would join the U.S. in banning imports of Russian oil.

Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said oil and oil products from Russia will be phased out by the end of the year. He said the transition period “will give the market, businesses and supply chains more than enough time to replace Russian imports,” which account for 8% of U.K. demand.

Kwarteng said the U.K. would work with its other oil suppliers, including the U.S., the Netherlands and the Gulf states, to secure extra supplies.

11:00 a.m. - US believes Russia underestimated Ukrainian resistance

President Joe Biden’s top intelligence official said Tuesday the U.S. believes Russia underestimated the strength of Ukraine’s resistance before launching an invasion that has likely caused thousands of Russian casualties.

Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told a congressional panel that U.S. officials believe Russian President Vladimir Putin feels “aggrieved” by Russia’s failure to subdue Ukraine and that he perceives that he cannot afford to lose the war. But what Putin might consider a victory could change given the escalating costs of the conflict to Russia, Haines said.

Despite Putin’s announcement that he would raise Russia’s alert level for nuclear weapons, Haines said the U.S. has not observed unusual changes in Russia’s nuclear force posture.

Haines said it is “unclear at this stage” whether Russia will try to conquer all of Ukraine, something that would require more resources than Putin has committed.

10:30 a.m. - Average price for gallon of gas hits record $4.17 in US

The average price for a gallon of gasoline in the U.S. hit an all-time record of $4.17 as the country prepares to ban Russian oil imports.

The average price rose by 10 cents per gallon in one day, and it's up 55 cents since last week, according to AAA data.

Gasoline stocks in the U.S. fell last week even as demand is on the rise with summer approaching.

The increase in gas demand and a reduction in total supply is contributing to rising prices at the pump, but skyrocketing oil prices are playing an increasingly large role.

The price of benchmark U.S. crude jumped 8% Tuesday to more than $129 per barrel.

Americans can expect the current trend at the pump to continue as long as crude prices climb, the AAA said.

8:45 a.m. - Biden expected to ban Russia oil imports

President Joe Biden has decided to ban Russian oil imports, toughening the toll on Russia’s economy in retaliation for its invasion of Ukraine, a source told the Associated Press.

The move follows pleas by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to U.S. and Western officials to cut off the imports, which had been a glaring omission the massive sanctions put in place on Russia over the invasion. Energy exports have kept a steady influx of cash flowing to Russia despite otherwise severe restrictions on its financial sector.

Biden was set to announce the move as soon as Tuesday, the source said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The White House said Biden would speak at 10:45 a.m. to announce, “actions to continue to hold Russia accountable for its unprovoked and unjustified war on Ukraine.”

The U.S. will be acting alone, but in close consultation with European allies, who are more dependent on Russian energy supplies. European nations have said they plan to reduce their reliance on Russia for their energy needs, but filling the void without crippling their economies will likely take some time. Natural gas from Russia accounts for one-third of Europe’s consumption of the fossil fuel. The U.S. does not import Russian natural gas.

8:30 a.m. - Temporary ceasefire appears to hold in Ukraine

Civilians in one eastern Ukrainian city were leaving on buses Tuesday amid a 12-hour-long cease-fire in that area after Russia and Ukraine agreed on establishing five safe corridors for people to escape the fighting.

Ukraine has submitted routes to evacuate the capital and communities north of Kyiv, as well as several eastern cities. While Russia hadn’t confirmed the routes, the shelling had quieted enough that the Ukrainians were trying to move people onto buses out and to get trucks of aid in.

“We think this is obviously a welcome step, that the ceasefire seems to be being observed by the Russians,” Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said. “They don’t exactly have a good track record in that regard. So it’s welcome to see that people are able to get out.”

Meanwhile, Russian aircraft continued to bomb cities in eastern and central Ukraine overnight. Shelling pounded suburbs of the capital, Kyiv.

8:00 a.m. - ‘Creditable reports’ that Russian forces are ‘targeting civilians’: NATO official

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg says Russia’s armed forces may be deliberately targeting civilians as they try to flee the military assault on Ukraine.

Stoltenberg said Tuesday “there are very creditable reports of civilians coming under fire as they try to evacuate. Targeting civilians is a war crime, and it’s totally unacceptable.”

He told reporters in Latvia that the humanitarian impact of the almost two-week long war “is devastating.”

“We need real humanitarian corridors that are fully respected,” he said.

Asked what NATO can do to help, Stoltenberg said: “We have a responsibility to ensure the conflict does not spread beyond Ukraine.”

7:30 a.m. - Dozens of kids reportedly among 474 civilians killed

The U.N. human rights office says it has confirmed 474 civilian deaths in Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on Feb. 24.

The office said Tuesday that the number of confirmed civilian injuries now stands at 861.

The U.N. office uses strict methodology and only reports casualties it has been able to verify. It acknowledges that the real figures are much higher.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov released new estimates of casualties and damage from the Russian war, saying Russian military actions have killed 38 children and wounded more than 70.

Overall at least 400 civilian deaths have been recorded and 800 wounded, though “these data are definitely incomplete,” Reznikov said in a video address.

7:00 a.m. - Zelenskyy wants humanitarian corridors expanded

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called for the expansion of humanitarian corridors for Ukrainian civilians fleeing war, and more support from the Red Cross.

In a video address Tuesday from an undisclosed location, he said a child died of dehydration in the blockaded southern seaport of Mariupol, in a sign of how desperate the city’s population has become.

He pleaded again with Western countries to provide air support.

He said evacuation buses have been sent to Mariupol but that there was no firm agreement on the route, so “Russian troops can simply shoot on this transport on the way.”

6:30 a.m. - Shell to stop buying Russian oil, natural gas

Energy giant Shell said it will stop buying Russian oil and natural gas as well as shut down its service stations and other operations in the country amid international pressure for companies to sever ties over the invasion of Ukraine.

Shell said in a statement Tuesday that it would withdraw from all Russian hydrocarbons, including crude oil, petroleum products, natural gas and liquefied natural gas, “in a phased manner.”

The decision comes just days after Ukraine’s foreign minister criticized Shell for continuing to buy Russian oil.

6:00 a.m. - 2 million people have fled Ukraine since invasion began: UN

The number of refugees fleeing Ukraine reached 2 million on Tuesday, according to the United Nations, the fastest exodus Europe has seen since World War II.

Today the outflow of refugees from Ukraine reaches two million people.



Two million. — Filippo Grandi (@FilippoGrandi) March 8, 2022

“Today the outflow of refugees from Ukraine reaches two million people. Two million,” Filippo Grandi, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, wrote on Twitter.

The update came as a new effort to evacuate civilians along safe corridors finally got underway Tuesday. The route out of the eastern city of Sumy was one of five promised by the Russians to offer civilians a way to escape the Russian onslaught.

The Associated Press contributed to this report.
