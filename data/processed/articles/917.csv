“It is impossible to say the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is safe after a totally pointless attack by the Russians,” Mykhailo Podolyak said.

“This is one of the most serious threats in Europe today,” he added.

Last night the Russians were also reported to have threatened another power plant in the south of Ukraine.

They set up howitzers near Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, and threatened to fire, according to Mariana Bezugla, a Ukrainian MP and deputy head of the defence and security committee.

“This will be a disaster for the whole of Europe,” she added.

It comes a day after a Ukrainian nuclear safety expert warned i of the dangers posed by nuclear power plants and waste storage facilities across the country if they were caught in crossfire.

The Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, said this afternoon that Russian forces were “trying to seize the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant”.

One Ukrainian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Russian shelling had hit a radioactive waste repository and that a rise in radiation levels had been reported.

However the UN nuclear watchdog said that Ukraine’s operational nuclear power plants were running safely and securely and there had been no “destruction” at the remaining waste and other facilities at Chernobyl.

“Ukraine has informed the IAEA that ‘unidentified armed forces’ have taken control of all facilities of the State Specialised Enterprise Chernobyl NPP, located within the exclusion zone,” the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement.

“The counterpart added that there had been no casualties nor destruction at the industrial site.”

Russian troops had been attempting to seize the Chernobyl site, with reports that a nuclear waste storage facility on the site was at risk of being destroyed, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior ministry said.

Soldiers invading from Belarus in the north entered the area around the former nuclear power plant earlier today, where an accident in 1986 resulted in the worst nuclear disaster in history, which sent a radioactive cloud across Europe.

The nuclear plant, which still had three operating units after reactor 4 was destroyed in the accident, was finally shut down in 2000.

He implied Ukrainians had died while trying to defend it, saying: “Our defenders are giving their lives so that the tragedy of 1986 will not be repeated.”

He added: “This is a declaration of war against the whole of Europe.”

It comes just hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a military assault on Ukraine, with cities currently under siege from Russian shelling.

According to Reuters, parts of Ukraine’s southern Kherson region are no longer under Kyiv’s control, the regional administration said, following Russian attacks by land, sea and air.

If caught in the crossfire of the Russian invasion, Ukraine’s nuclear power plants would pose a risk of radioactive pollution across Europe.

Radiation could contaminate air, soil and waterways, affecting not only Ukraine but also Russia and much of the continent, according to Dmytro Gumenyuk, head of safety analysis at the State Scientific and Technical Centre for Nuclear and Radiation Safety, a body within the state nuclear inspectorate.

It is believed that a military strike earlier today hit an area close to Chernobyl.

There are 22,000 assemblies of spent nuclear fuel at the storage site in the exclusion zone at Chernobyl, kept in special casks to protect them.

However, Mr Gumenyuk told i that these were not protected against military firepower: “In case of the destruction of these casks, radioactive materials could be released and transferred to Ukraine and other European territories. This is a very dangerous situation.”

While some experts say any disruption to the site would be localised, Mr Gumenyuk said: “I disagree, the number of the fuel assemblies is very big and if all the casks were destroyed it would not only be the problem of Ukraine, maybe not all Europe, but many countries.”

Ukraine also has 15 nuclear reactors in four power plants, which provide 52 per cent of the country’s electricity: Khelnitsky and Rivne in the northwest, and Zaporizhzhia and the South Ukrainian plants in the west and south respectively.

The plant at Zaporizhzhia is only about 150 miles from the front line in Donetsk, while the South Ukrainian plant is about another 160 miles further west.

While a direct attack is unlikely, military invasion raises the risk of possible accidental hits from missiles or artillery. On Tuesday the thermal power station at Shchastya, near the conflict line in Luhansk, caught fire amid shelling, leaving 40,000 residents without electricity.

Mr Gumenyuk said: “Our NPP [nuclear power plant] wasn’t designed for military protection. Of course it wasn’t designed against tanks, bombs, missiles and so on.

ArrowRight “The Chernobyl zone — the exclusion zone — and all installations of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant have been taken under control of Russian armed groups,” Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said in a televised statement. He said no casualties have yet been confirmed there.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky previously announced that fighting over the area was underway.

“Our defenders are giving their lives so that the tragedy of 1986 will not be repeated,” Zelensky said on Twitter. “This is a declaration of war against the whole of Europe.”

The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, recalling the catastrophe that ranks as the world’s worst nuclear power plant accident, said the Russian attack “may cause another ecological disaster.” If the war continues, it said, Chernobyl “can happen again in 2022.”

There was no immediate way to confirm what Russian forces were doing in the zone, located about 80 miles north of Kyiv and 12 miles from the border with Belarus. Russia massed forces in Belarus in the weeks leading up to Thursday’s attack on Ukraine.

A senior U.S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the Pentagon, said the United States has seen signs that Russian troops moved through the site but could not confirm that they had taken control of it.

A video shared on social media appeared to show tanks parked on a road running past the Chernobyl facilities. Explosions could be heard in the background.

A Ukrainian Interior Ministry adviser, Anton Gerashchenko, said Russian forces arriving from Belarus battled Ukrainian national guardsmen, who were “fighting hard” to protect storage facilities for “unsafe nuclear radioactive waste.” His account could not immediately be confirmed.

If artillery hits the facilities, “radioactive nuclear dust can be spread over the territory of Ukraine, Belarus” and European Union countries, he warned.

Rafael Mariano Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said in a statement Thursday that the agency was “following the situation in Ukraine with grave concern and is appealing for maximum restraint to avoid any action that may put the country’s nuclear facilities at risk.”

Ukraine informed the IAEA that “unidentified armed forces” had taken control of the power plant site, Grossi’s statement said, but that there had been no casualties or destruction there.

“It is of vital importance that the safe and secure operations of the nuclear facilities in that zone should not be affected or disrupted in any way,” the statement said.

In April 1986, core explosions and fires broke out at the Chernobyl plant, then under the control of the Soviet Union. Two workers died from the explosions. Large quantities of radioactive material contaminated the surrounding land, and a nearby city was evacuated. Vast swaths of Europe were affected, and a radioactive cloud spread as far away as Norway.

A United Nations report found that 134 first responders were diagnosed with acute radiation syndrome after the accident. Twenty-eight of them died within four months, and 19 more died over the next two decades. Acute radiation syndrome can damage bone marrow, suppress a patient’s immune system and cause intestinal problems, among other effects. There were no cases among the general population living in towns around the power plant.

Radiation poses an invisible threat. It’s impossible to smell or see without a special measuring device, and its health effects are not immediately apparent unless a person has been exposed to a very large dose. But a dangerous isotope of cesium present at Chernobyl has been linked to higher risk of developing leukemia later in life, according to Lydia Zablotska, a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California at San Francisco, who has studied the health effects of radiation from the Chernobyl accident.

In the decades since the accident, studies also showed that radiation from the Chernobyl accident led to thyroid conditions, particularly in children. The United Nations estimated that at least 4,000 people may have died as a result of exposure to radiation.

The Chernobyl zone, one of the most radioactively contaminated places in the world, has remained closed since 1986, although a small number of people still live in the area — mostly elderly Ukrainians who refused to evacuate or who quietly resettled there later.

A concrete shelter was built in 1986 to prevent the release of about 220 tons of highly radioactive material. A new and safer structure was moved into position over the site in 2016, and operation was handed over to Ukrainian authorities in 2020. The structure is “strong enough to withstand a tornado,” according to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. It was designed to last at least 100 years and built to withstand temperatures ranging between minus-45 degrees and 113 degrees Fahrenheit.

The structure “was built to be secure for a very long period of time, so I hope it stays that way,” Zablotska said.

The bigger danger would be any damage to a waste storage facility on the site containing radioactive material, Zablotska said. There are also hot spots containing the cesium isotope inside the Chernobyl zone, she added. Staff at the site know to avoid those areas — but newcomers, including invading troops, may not. They could put their own health at risk or inadvertently contaminate tanks and other vehicles and machinery, according to Zablotska.

Staff have been operating at reduced capacity this month due to a coronavirus outbreak among employees. But workers charged with maintaining nuclear and radiation safety continued to report to work.

“What really worries me is there’s staff there, there are scientists working there. How are they doing? They dedicated their lives to protecting the world from the most contaminated area on Earth,” Zablotska said.

Yevgeniya Kuznetsova, a spokeswoman for the Ukrainian state agency charged with managing the Chernobyl zone, told CNN that Russian troops overran the plant Thursday.

“When I came to the office today in the morning [in Kyiv], it turned out that the [Chernobyl nuclear power plant] management had left. So there was no one to give instructions or defend,” she said.

For Russia, the site may hold particular significance, since the accident there 36 years ago led to social changes and new cooperation with the West that transformed the Soviet Union.

Former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev later suggested that the Chernobyl disaster was “perhaps the real cause of the collapse of the Soviet Union” — more so than his liberalizing reforms.

Under extremely hazardous conditions, thousands of ""Liquidators"" worked to contain the remains of the fourth reactor. The shelter surrounding the reactor was completed less than six months after the explosion during peak radioactivity levels. The massive concrete and steel ""Sarcophagus"", quickly constructed using ""arms length"" methods, has deteriorated over the years, creating a potentially hazardous situation. Several repairs were made to the current shelter, including the stabilisation of the ventilation stack and reinforcement of the roof. In addition, a plan for the construction of a more secure and permanent structure to be built around the existing Sarcophagus was drafted; work has already begun on the infrastructure of this new shelter. The plan, called the Shelter Implementation Plan, is a project of the Chernobyl Shelter Fund. Both efforts, whose combined expected expenditures over the next eight or nine years exceed $765 million, are administered by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.",https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/focus/chernobyl/faqs

Humans have colonized nearly every corner of planet Earth, and each day more and more land once thought inhospitable or unusable is being utilized for transportation, agriculture, and buildings. By the early 21st century, it seems only the highest mountain peaks and the most remote parts of ice caps and deserts fall into the category of areas not frequently visited by human beings. However, there are two large human-free zones that were made so intentionally—because of serious nuclear accidents. The areas around the sites of the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters have been closed off and designated as nuclear exclusion zones because of the ongoing dangers of radiation and its effects.

The Chernobyl accident occurred on April 25–26, 1986, at the nuclear power station in Pryp’yat, Soviet Union (now in Ukraine), some 65 miles (104 km) north of Kiev. Uncooled control rods in a reactor core created a chain reaction that blew off the heavy steel and concrete lid of the reactor, which, along with the resulting fire in the graphite reactor core, released large amounts of radioactive material into the atmosphere. Millions of acres of nearby forest and farmland were scorched by radioactive fallout. The disaster, which released more radiation than the combined load of the atom bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killed as many as 49 people outright, and dozens of others later developed radiation sickness. More than 300,000 people were eventually evacuated from Pryp’yat and the surrounding area, yet hundreds of thousands more remained in nearby contaminated areas.

Following the disaster, the Soviet Union placed a circle-shaped exclusion zone with an 18-mile (about 30-km) radius around the plant. The total area of the zone was about 1,017 square miles (2,634 square km), which was later expanded to 1,600 square miles (4,143 square km) to include additional areas that were later found to be heavily radiated. While no people actually live in the exclusion zone, scientists and others can file for permits that allow them to enter for limited amounts of time. Like the Demilitarized Zone between North Korea and South Korea, the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone has become a de facto biological reserve. Although gamma radiation can be detected in the area some 1,000 times above the background level, and birth defects and deformities have been detected in local wildlife, some of the area’s flora and fauna have shown a remarkable resilience. Scientists note that the geographic extent of the radiation in the region is patchy, and thus they suggest that many large mobile mammals, such as wolves, boars, Przewalski’s horses, and foxes only receive the occasional high dose of radiation. At least so far, this has not been enough to bring about declines in the populations of these species. In fact, free from human persecution, the populations of these mammals—which were visibly smaller when humans occupied the region—have multiplied. Some ecologists argue that large mammals are attracted to the area, which gives the impression of a naturally rising population, but they believe that ultimately the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone is a population sink, a region that claims more lives than it produces. Other studies note that genetic damage has occurred in many plants and animals within the zone and that some animals, namely certain species of birds, have reproductive abnormalities, reduced brain size, and cataracts.

The Fukushima nuclear accident, a disaster which rivaled the magnitude of Chernobyl, began on March 11, 2011, after a massive offshore earthquake produced a tsunami that washed ashore and damaged the backup generators of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, a facility located on the eastern shore of Japan’s Honshu island. The loss of power caused cooling systems to fail in each of the facility’s four reactors. Days later, before power could be restored, the uncooled reactor cores melted through their containment vessels. Several smaller releases of radiation, coupled with explosions in the containment buildings housing three of the facility’s reactors, over the next four days expelled radioactive material from the plant, which contaminated the surrounding countryside. Water used in an attempt to cool the reactors became radioactive in the process and mixed with water from the nearby Pacific Ocean. Over the following days, due to concerns about possible radiation exposure, government officials established an 18-mile no-fly zone around the facility, and the land area within a radius of 12.5 miles (20 km) around the plant, covering an area of 230 square miles (600 square km), was evacuated. In a third area that extended to a radius of 30 km around the plant, residents were asked to remain indoors. Ultimately, nearly 165,000 people left their homes and the area.

As more information about the path of fallout emerged, 80 square miles (207 square km) of land northwest of the initial exclusion zone were also declared dangerous by the Fukushima prefectural government and included in the greater exclusion zone (which increased the total area off-limits to 311.5 square miles [807 square km]). However, starting in August 2015, some areas in the greater exclusion zone that earlier had been declared contaminated were considered safe enough for former residents to either visit their homes and businesses for short periods or return to them permanently. By 2017 the exclusion zone had declined to 143 square miles (371 square km). Despite this seemingly good news, few people have returned so far, most of them elderly. Some studies investigating the effects of the Fukushima nuclear disaster on birds and insects have reported population declines in some species, as well as declines in overall biodiversity among these groups in the exclusion zones. However, as in Chernobyl, some populations of persecuted wild animals, such as wild boar, have increased.",https://www.britannica.com/story/nuclear-exclusion-zones

The site of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in northern Ukraine has been surrounded for more than three decades by a 1,000-square-mile (2,600-square-kilometer) exclusion zone that keeps people out. On April 26, 1986, Chernobyl’s reactor number four melted down as a result of human error, releasing vast quantities of radioactive particles and gases into the surrounding landscape – 400 times more radioactivity to the environment than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Put in place to contain the radioactive contaminants, the exclusion zone also protects the region from human disturbance.

Where is Chernobyl?

Apart from a handful of industrial areas, most of the exclusion zone is completely isolated from human activity and appears almost normal. In some areas, where radiation levels have dropped over time, plants and animals have returned in significant numbers.

Some scientists have suggested the zone has become an Eden for wildlife, while others are skeptical of that possibility. Looks can be deceiving, at least in areas of high radioactivity, where bird, mammal and insect population sizes and diversity are significantly lower than in the “clean” parts of the exclusion zone.

I’ve spent more than 20 years working in Ukraine, as well as in Belarus and Fukushima, Japan, largely focused on the effects of radiation. I have been asked many times over the past days why Russian forces entered northern Ukraine via this atomic wasteland, and what the environmental consequences of military activity in the zone might be.

As of the beginning of March 2022, Russian forces controlled the Chernobyl facility.

Why invade via Chernobyl?

In hindsight, the strategic benefits of basing military operations in the Chernobyl exclusion zone seem obvious. It is a large, unpopulated area connected by a paved highway straight to the Ukrainian capital, with few obstacles or human developments along the way. The Chernobyl zone abuts Belarus and is thus immune from attack from Ukrainian forces from the north. The reactor site’s industrial area is, in effect, a large parking lot suitable for staging an invading army’s thousands of vehicles.

The power plant site also houses the main electrical grid switching network for the entire region. It’s possible to turn the lights off in Kyiv from here, even though the power plant itself has not generated any electricity since 2000, when the last of Chernobyl’s four reactors was shut down. Such control over the power supply likely has strategic importance, although Kyiv’s electrical needs could probably also be supplied via other nodes on the Ukrainian national power grid.

The reactor site likely offers considerable protection from aerial attack, given the improbability that Ukrainian or other forces would risk combat on a site containing more than 5.3 million pounds (2.4 million kilograms) of radioactive spent nuclear fuel. This is the highly radioactive material produced by a nuclear reactor during normal operations. A direct hit on the power plant’s spent fuel pools or dry cask storage facilities could release substantially more radioactive material into the environment than the original meltdown and explosions in 1986 and thus cause an environmental disaster of global proportions.

Environmental risks on the ground in Chernobyl

The Chernobyl exclusion zone is among the most radioactively contaminated regions on the planet. Thousands of acres surrounding the reactor site have ambient radiation dose rates exceeding typical background levels by thousands of times. In parts of the so-called Red Forest near the power plant it’s possible to receive a dangerous radiation dose in just a few days of exposure.

Radiation monitoring stations across the Chernobyl zone recorded the first obvious environmental impact of the invasion. Sensors put in place by the Ukrainian Chernobyl EcoCenter in case of accidents or forest fires showed dramatic jumps in radiation levels along major roads and next to the reactor facilities starting after 9 p.m on Feb. 24, 2022. That’s when Russian invaders reached the area from neighboring Belarus.

Because the rise in radiation levels was most obvious in the immediate vicinity of the reactor buildings, there was concern that the containment structures had been damaged, although Russian authorities have denied this possibility. The sensor network abruptly stopped reporting early on Feb. 25 and did not restart until March 1, 2022, so the full magnitude of disturbance to the region from the troop movements is unclear.

If, in fact, it was dust stirred up by vehicles and not damage to any containment facilities that caused the rise in radiation readings, and assuming the increase lasted for just a few hours, it’s not likely to be of long-term concern, as the dust will settle again once troops move through.

But the Russian soldiers, as well as the Ukrainian power plant workers who have been held hostage, undoubtedly inhaled some of the blowing dust. Researchers know the dirt in the Chernobyl exclusion zone can contain radionuclides including cesium-137, strontium-90, several isotopes of plutonium and uranium, and americium-241. Even at very low levels, they’re all toxic, carcinogenic or both if inhaled.

Possible impacts further afield

Perhaps the greater environmental threat to the region stems from the potential release to the atmosphere of radionuclides stored in soil and plants should a forest fire ignite.

Such fires have recently increased in frequency, size and intensity, likely because of climate change, and these fires have released radioactive materials back into the air and and dispersed them far and wide. Radioactive fallout from forest fires may well represent the greatest threat from the Chernobyl site to human populations downwind of the region as well as the wildlife within the exclusion zone.

Currently the zone is home to massive amounts of dead trees and debris that could act as fuel for a fire. Even in the absence of combat, military activity – like thousands of troops transiting, eating, smoking and building campfires to stay warm – increases the risk of forest fires.

It’s hard to predict the effects of radioactive fallout on people, but the consequences to flora and fauna have been well documented. Chronic exposure to even relatively low levels of radionuclides has been linked to a wide variety of health consequences in wildlife, including genetic mutations, tumors, eye cataracts, sterility and neurological impairment, along with reductions in population sizes and biodiversity in areas of high contamination.

There is no “safe” level when it comes to ionizing radiation. The hazards to life are in direct proportion to the level of exposure. Should the ongoing conflict escalate and damage the radiation confinement facilities at Chernobyl, or at any of the 15 nuclear reactors at four other sites across Ukraine, the magnitude of harm to the environment would be catastrophic.

Russian troops have reportedly seized the remnants of the Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine, a move that signals the likelihood of their trying to assault Kyiv and that risks decades of united efforts to contain one of the worst nuclear disasters.

In a tweet early Thursday, BuzzFeed News' Christopher Miller quoted Mykhailo Podoliak, an advisor to the head of the plant, as saying: ""After a fierce battle, Ukrainian control over the Chernobyl site was lost. The condition of the former Chernobyl nuclear power plant, confinement, and nuclear waste storage facilities is unknown.""

The Associated Press described unnamed Ukrainian officials as saying that Russian shelling had hit a radioactive-waste repository. Reports of the fighting and possible damage could not be independently confirmed.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had earlier warned that fighting was underway. ""Russian occupation forces are trying to seize the #Chornobyl_NPP,"" he tweeted early Thursday. ""Our defenders are giving their lives so that the tragedy of 1986 will not be repeated.""

A roughly 20-mile exclusion zone encircles the site of the 1986 nuclear disaster. Parts of the zone are not expected to support human life for another hundred years. Weather conditions at the time of the incident mean some areas contain far more radiation than others.

Lydia Zablotska, a radiation expert at the University of California at San Francisco who grew up in Ukraine, told Insider before the reports of the attacks on Thursday that the zone remained ""the most contaminated place"" on Earth.

""No one should go into those areas,"" Zablotska said. ""It's dangerous for a reason. A number of studies both in humans and animals and from different branches of science say it's dangerous, unadvisable, and no one should go into that area.""

The Ukrainian military has in recent months ramped up deployments to the zone — largely a no-man's-land — in anticipation that Russian forces could assault through it from Belarus, a close Russian ally where troops have been training. The area is still of strategic importance, and thus a broader war could unfold in the shadow of a nuclear disaster. The New York Times reported earlier this year that the deployments had allowed the Ukrainians to map the highly radiated areas of the zone. Radiation exposure is monitored via a dosimeter attached to a soldier's uniform.

Containing the nuclear disaster has been a decades-long and costly endeavor. In 2016, a billion-dollar containment dome was erected over the No. 4 nuclear reactor, the site of the 1986 explosion. The dome, the world's largest moveable metal structure, was built to last a century and be capable of withstanding corrosion and tornadoes. It's not clear how much combat damage it could sustain.

A small team maintains the dome. It was not clear on Thursday amid the reports of fighting in the zone whether its members were still on the ground. Special permission is required to enter the zone, though some thrill-seeking tourists occasionally wander into the area.

Chernobyl remains a lasting symbol of Soviet-era mismanagement. The Kremlin stood silent about what happened for days in 1986 until the Swedish government forced its hand. Meanwhile, life largely went on as normal — a reality that undergirded the public pushback against Moscow and that remains a low point in Ukrainian-Russian relations.

Two workers were killed in the initial explosion, and 28 first responders died in the months after. Pripyat, then a town of just under 50,000 people, was evacuated within 36 hours.

This brutal assault violates the security guarantees that Moscow provided in 1994, when Kyiv allowed it to remove nuclear weapons left in Ukrainian territory after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In recent days, trying to justify his aggression, Russian President Vladimir Putin has invoked the specter of a nonexistent Ukrainian nuclear weapons program—a cynical ploy to justify regime change and perhaps a pretext for trashing those earlier security guarantees.

Even more menacingly, Putin stated that Russia “is today one of the most powerful nuclear powers in the world.” He added that “no one should have any doubts that a direct attack on our country will lead to defeat and dire consequences for any potential aggressor.” U.S. President Joe Biden’s decision not to intervene directly reduces the danger of deliberate nuclear escalation significantly. Yet there is a small but real risk of inadvertent escalation, which could be sparked, for example, by an engagement between NATO and Russian aircraft on the border between Poland and Ukraine.

The most immediate nuclear danger, however, comes from Ukraine’s nuclear power plants. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has already stated that “Russian occupation forces are trying to seize” the Chernobyl nuclear plant, site of the infamous 1986 accident, and footage purportedly shows Russian forces there. Various storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste are located nearby. However, the bigger risk comes from the potential for fighting around Ukraine’s four active nuclear power plants, which contain fifteen separate reactors and generated over half of the country’s electricity in 2020.

Chernobyl is inside a large exclusion zone, and the uninhabited space would mitigate the consequences of a second nuclear accident there. Ukraine’s other reactors are not similarly isolated. Moreover, much of the fuel in these other reactors is substantially more radioactive than the fuel at Chernobyl. To put it simply, nuclear power plants are not designed for war zones. It seems exceedingly unlikely that Moscow would authorize deliberate attacks on these facilities, but they could nonetheless become targets in a war that will, in any case, disrupt their operations.

For Ukrainian nuclear power plant staff, merely traveling to work may be a dangerous act—making it potentially challenging to ensure the reactor can be operated safely. In the event of an accident, backup personnel, such as firefighters, may not be able to reach the plant—not least because they could be involved in civilian relief efforts

Moreover, nuclear power plants might be targeted inadvertently. These facilities use power from the state’s electricity grid to help cool the reactor in the event it is forced to shut down. While backup power systems, such as diesel generators, are available, the power grid is one important line of defense. There is a very real risk of such power being lost in Ukraine if Russian forces attack the country’s electricity infrastructure—as NATO forces did against Serbia during the 1999 Kosovo War and Russia itself did against Ukraine in 2015 using cyber tools.

Even if Moscow doesn’t authorize direct attacks against nuclear power plants, such attacks might occur anyway. A weapon aimed at a nearby target could hit a nuclear power plant if its navigation system failed. If Russian forces believed that Ukrainian defense forces were inside a nuclear power plant, they could call in an airstrike, perhaps in contravention of an order not to attack nuclear power plants. This concern isn’t hypothetical: In 2017, U.S. special operation forces in Syria called in an attack against a dam that was on a “no strike” list. The resulting damage almost caused the dam to fail, which would likely have led to the drowning of tens of thousands of civilians.

The CEO of the company that operates Ukraine’s nuclear power plants has stressed that they are designed to withstand an aircraft crash. However, munitions are often designed to penetrate thick layers of protective concrete. One particularly serious risk is that a direct attack might drain the pools in which spent fuel is stored, often in large amounts. Without cooling, this fuel could melt, releasing very large quantities of radioactivity. This kind of accident was the “worst-case” outcome envisioned by officials as the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant accident in Japan unfolded in 2011.

I set out these scenarios with some hesitation. The likelihood of a serious nuclear accident is probably quite small. Drawing attention to it risks a loss of focus on the certain consequences of Putin’s invasion—Ukraine’s loss of autonomy, the deliberate killing of its service members, the unintentional killing of its civilians, and the war crimes that inevitably accompany any military operation of this scale. (For that matter, we shouldn’t forget the deaths of rank-and-file Russian service members who have no choice but to fight in a war ordered by their autocratic leader.)

Nonetheless, even if a nuclear accident is still quite unlikely, its effects could be severe and would add significantly to the long-term consequences of this invasion for Ukraine’s population. Moscow will be directly responsible for any nuclear accident that is caused, directly or indirectly, by its aggression. If it doesn’t want such an accident to be added to its growing list of crimes, it must take exceptional measures to avoid one.

Troops overran the plant on the first day of Russia's multi-pronged invasion of Ukraine , a spokesperson for the State Agency of Ukraine on Exclusion Zone Management, Yevgeniya Kuznetsovа, told CNN.

Alyona Shevtsova, advisor to the commander of Ukraine's Ground Forces, said on Facebook that Russian forces have taken control of the power station and that the staff are being ""held hostage.""

According to Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian presidential adviser, control of the Chornobyl zone was lost after a ""fierce battle.""

Podolyak said the condition of the former Chernobyl power plant's nuclear waste storage facilities is unknown.

The site still contains radioactive debris, which the world has worked to contain in the 36 years since the disaster.

Russian troops seized the nuclear power plant today, according to scattered reports from officials, including Ukrainian presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak.

“It is impossible to say the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is safe after a totally pointless attack by the Russians ... This is one of the most serious threats in Europe today,” Podolyak said, according to Reuters. The International Atomic Energy Agency, however, said in a statement that the Ukraine regulatory body reported “no casualties nor destruction at the industrial site.”

Ongoing conflict in Ukraine makes this already sensitive location even more difficult to manage

The Verge spoke with experts on nuclear policy and the Chernobyl disaster about what we might be able to expect out of this rapidly changing situation. A worst-case scenario is unlikely, but ongoing conflict in Ukraine makes this already sensitive location even more difficult to manage.

The 200 metric ton elephant in the room is the “highly radioactive material” still held in the remains of the reactor that exploded at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in 1986, according to the trade group World Nuclear Association. That reactor failed catastrophically during a test run — releasing radioactive particles in the ensuing explosion and fire. About 50 people died in the following two decades as a direct result of the incident, according to a 2005 United Nations report, and tens of thousands more people might have been affected by the radiation.

To try to keep radioactive material from spreading, a “sarcophagus” was quickly built afterwards to entomb the reactor’s remains. Nearly a decade later, officials decided to construct a more secure cover for it — a gigantic steel New Safe Confinement Arch that was just completed in 2017 at a cost of $1.7 billion. That structure is also supposed to facilitate cleanup; workers can remotely operate a crane and other equipment inside to dismantle the rest of the the reactor and remove radioactive fuel.

If that structure gets damaged and there are explosions inside it, it could stir up remaining radioactive material that might release radioactive emissions according to James Acton, a physicist and co-director of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. But that would take a a direct hit — either on accident or through a concentrated effort to damage the containment unit which was designed to withstand a tornado.

A bigger concern is spent fuel from three other decommissioned reactors at Chernobyl that continued operating for years after the 1986 disaster, according to Acton and retired nuclear scientist Cheryl Rofer. Used fuel from those reactors is more radioactive than what’s been sequestered inside the giant confinement arch since it’s been more recently removed from the reactors. It was transferred to nearby cooling ponds for interim safekeeping. To date, Acton says, there has never been a serious accident involving spent fuel anywhere. But if something happened to cause the less protected cooling pools to sustain damage and drain out, the remaining fuel could melt and release radioactive gases and particles.

Some of that spent fuel has already been transferred to a newer and more permanent dry storage facility completed in 2020. More of it is supposed to move over in the next several years. Dry storage facilities don’t require water cooling, and steel or cement casks inside house materials that have already had some time to cool off in wet pools.

A bigger concern is spent fuel from three other decommissioned reactors

“Those casks are not designed to withstand attacks, but nonetheless, they are extremely strong and robust,” Acton says. Nevertheless, if they’re broken, they can release radioactive material.

Acton is clear that such “doomsday” scenarios are very unlikely to unfold. “Not least because the Russians have no conceivable reason to want to attack the reactor,” he tells The Verge. It would be risky for the entire region, especially for Russian ally Belarus that borders Chernobyl. In an accidental strike, it would still be unlikely that the cooling pools or casks would be catastrophically damaged. Even then, there would be some time to react — potentially dousing the exposed fuel with water to keep it cool.

On top of that, much of the area surrounding Chernobyl is desolate, with very few people who might be affected by any smaller-scale event. The region was evacuated in the wake of the 1986 disaster and remains a cordoned off Exclusion Zone.

There is still radioactive material in the debris, soil, and leaf litter around the power plant. Rofer says that radioactive material has decayed to the point where it’s not immediately dangerous — although it could potentially still be carcinogenic to people with enough exposure.

That worries Kate Brown, MIT distinguished professor in history of science. Disturbances, human or natural, defy the purpose of the containment zone, which was engineered to keep people away from the area’s radioactivity.

In 2020, smoke from fires that ripped through the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone carried slightly radioactive particles across parts of East and Central Europe. The doses from those fires were “radiologically insignificant and no health impact on the European population is expected,” according to an article published that year in the journal Nature. But Brown remains concerned about future fires and other disturbances that could spread radioactivity outside the exclusion zone.

“It’s a continuing problem,” Brown tells The Verge. “It’s supposed to be contained. It’s supposed to be left untouched. And that’s that’s the problem with any kind of nuclear site. It demands stability and peace.”",https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/24/22949329/russia-invasion-ukraine-chernobyl-nuclear-reactor-radioactive-waste
