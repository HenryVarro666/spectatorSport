WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration ordered new sanctions blocking Russian business oligarchs and others in President Vladimir Putin’s inner circle on Thursday in response to Russian forces’ fierce pummeling of Ukraine.

President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke late Thursday as Russian forces shelled Europe’s largest nuclear plant, in the eastern Ukraine city of Enerhodar. The assault sparked a fire and raised fears that radiation could leak from the damaged power station.

The White House said Biden joined Zelenskyy in urging Russia to “cease its military activities in the area and allow firefighters and emergency responders to access the site.”

Those targeted by the new U.S. sanctions include Putin’s press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, and Alisher Burhanovich Usmanov, one of Russia’s wealthiest individuals and a close ally of Putin. The U.S. State Department also announced it was imposing visa bans on 19 Russian oligarchs and dozens of their family members and close associates.

“The goal was to maximize impact on Putin and Russia and minimize the harm on us and our allies and friends around the world,” Biden said as he noted the new sanctions at the start of a meeting with his Cabinet and Vice President Kamala Harris.

The White House said the oligarchs and dozens of their family members will be cut off from the U.S. financial system. Their assets in the United States will be frozen and their property will be blocked from use.

The White House described Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, as ”a top purveyor of Putin’s propaganda.”

The property of Usmanov and the others will be blocked from use in the United States and by Americans. His assets include his superyacht, one of the world’s largest, and his private jet, one of Russia’s largest privately owned aircraft.

The Usmanov superyacht, known as Dilbar, is named after Usmanov’s mother and has an estimated worth of between $600 million and $735 million, according to Treasury. Dilbar has two helipads and one of the world’s largest indoor pools ever installed on a yacht, and costs about $60 million per year to operate. The jet targeted is believed to have cost between $350 million and $500 million and was previously leased out for use by Uzbekistan’s president.

Others targeted Thursday include Nikolai Tokarev, a Transneft oil executive; Arkady Rotenberg, co-owner of the largest construction company for gas pipelines and electrical power supply lines in Russia; Sergei Chemezov, a former KGB agent who has long been close to Putin; Igor Shuvalov, a former first deputy prime minister and chairman of State Development Corp.; and Yevgeniy Prigozhin, a Russian businessman with close ties to Putin.

Prigozhin, who is known as “Putin’s chef,” was among those charged in 2018 by the U.S. government as being part of a wide-ranging effort to sway political opinion in America during the 2016 presidential election.

According to the indictment then, Prigozhin and his companies provided significant funding to the Internet Research Agency, a St. Petersburg-based group accused of using bogus social media postings and advertisements fraudulently purchased in the name of Americans to influence the White House race.

Deputy U.S. Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said Thursday that the Biden administration would continue to target Russian elites as it builds sanctions against the country. He said elites are already “attempting to get their money out of Russia, because the Russian economy is shrinking.”

“We’re going to make it hard for them to use the assets going forward,” Adeyemo said at an event hosted by The Washington Post. He added, “Our goal then is to find that money and to freeze that money and to seize it.”

The Biden administration has been unveiling new sanctions targeting Russian individuals and entities daily since the start of last week’s invasion, with officials saying they want to make certain Putin’s decision to attack Ukraine will come with enormous cost to Russia’s economy.

A notable aspect of the latest sanctions is the extent to which the U.S. penalized the family members of oligarchs and those closest to Putin. Recently passed anti-money-laundering legislation passed by Congress has helped Treasury unveil and target such people.

For example, the oil executive Tokarev’s family members — including his wife, Galina Tokareva, and daughter, Maiya Tokareva — have benefited from his proximity to Putin and Russian government and were hit by the sanctions. Maiya Tokareva’s real estate empire has been valued at more than $50 million in Moscow, according to Treasury.

Russian elites that have yet to be targeted by the U.S. or other Western countries have taken notice of the sanctions.

Faced with the threat of financial sanctions targeting Russians, Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich announced Wednesday he is trying to sell the Premier League soccer club that became a trophy-winning machine thanks to his lavish investment. Abramovich made his fortune in oil and aluminum during the chaotic years that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.

Biden had thus far been reluctant to hit the Russia energy sector with sanctions out of concern that it would hurt the U.S. and its allies as well as the Russians.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said, “We don’t have a strategic interest in reducing the global supply of energy.”

3 Mar 2022 16.59 Given the situation in Ukraine, the US politics live blog is closing down earlier than usual at the moment, to provide more resources to our round-the-clock, round-the-world Ukraine crisis live blog covering developments in the war perpetrated by Russia. So we won’t have live coverage of Joe Biden signing a new law that will provide greater justice for victims of sexual assault and sexual harassment. The Washington Post has the goods on this, however. Here are the details. President Biden is poised to sign into law Thursday a bill that ends forced arbitration in workplace sexual assault and harassment cases, allowing survivors to file lawsuits in court against perpetrators. The new law would nullify agreements between employees and their employers in which the employees waive their rights to sue in the case of sexual assault or harassment and instead are required to settle their disputes by arbitration. A bill-signing ceremony is scheduled for 5 p.m. Thursday at the White House. “President Biden has long spoken against forced-arbitration clauses in employment contracts, and today marks an important milestone in empowering survivors of sexual assault and sexual harassment and protecting employee rights,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday afternoon. Critics of forced arbitration say that the practice has served only to further cultures of abuse in workplaces and that the new law would be critical for holding perpetrators of sexual misconduct accountable. About 60 million Americans are subject to arbitration clauses, and many of them do not know it because the provisions are buried in the fine print of their employment contracts. “We can’t ignore a basic reality of these clauses: They deprive victims of sexual harassment and assault of their basic rights by mandating that they seek remedy only behind the closed doors of private arbitration, with no other alternative,” Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on the Senate floor Thursday morning. The Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act, which was first introduced in 2017 by Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), was a rare product of bipartisan congressional support. The #MeToo movement helped spur momentum for the bill after more victims spoke out about how they could not sue perpetrators because they had unwittingly signed such clauses. Last month, the House passed the bill, 335-97; the Senate passed it on a voice vote. Gillibrand touted it then as “one of the most significant workplace reforms in American history,” while Graham defended the bill against some Republican criticism that it would be bad for businesses. “It does not hurt business to make sure that people who are harassed in the workplace get treated fairly,” Graham said then. Former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson, who was a key proponent of the bill, said in advocating for it that she had been shocked to learn that her employment contract included a forced arbitration clause. Her lawyers initially said the clause meant she could not sue then-Fox News CEO Roger Ailes, whom she accused of sexual harassment. The full report is here.



3 Mar 2022 16.52 Kimberly Guilfoyle, a prominent pro-Donald Trump Republican figure, who also happens to be engaged to Don Trump Jr, has been subpoenaed to provide evidence to the House select committee investigating the insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6 last year and attempts by the-then US president to overturn his election defeat. Kimberly Guilfoyle speaks at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC22) in Orlando, Florida last month. Photograph: Joe Marino/UPI/REX/Shutterstock The committee issued the subpoena this afternoon, Reuters reports. Guilfoyle is also a television personality. The agency writes: Guilfoyle, who worked on the elder Trump’s presidential campaign, abruptly ended an interview with the select committee on February 25, criticizing House of Representatives members who were present. Her attorney issued a statement afterward saying Guilfoyle had agreed to meet only with attorneys for the Democratic-led House committee, not members of Congress. As a result, the committee said it would issue a subpoena to compel Guilfoyle’s cooperation. The panel asked Guilfoyle to appear for a deposition on March 15. “Guilfoyle met with (former President) Donald Trump inside the White House, spoke at the rally that took place before the riot on January 6th, and apparently played a key role organizing and raising funds for that event,” Representative Bennie Thompson, committee chairman, said in a statement. Her attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Select Committee is trying to establish the actions of Trump and associates before and during the assault on the Capitol by thousands of his supporters. The mobs attacked police, vandalized the building and sent members of Congress and then-Vice President Mike Pence running for their lives as they gathered to certify Democrat Joe Biden’s presidential election victory over Trump. The Select Committee has so far interviewed more than 560 witnesses and issued more than 80 subpoenas as it probes the causes of the attack and the role played by Trump, who continues to push false claims that his election defeat by Biden was the result of fraud. Earlier on Thursday, the panel interviewed Judd Deere, a former White House spokesman who is now a Republican congressional aide.



3 Mar 2022 16.42 Hugo Lowell The House select committee investigating the Capitol attack is hoping to show through public hearings in April how it believes Donald Trump came to violate federal laws in his efforts to overturn the 2020 US election results, the panel has indicated in court documents. Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., and Vice Chair Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., of the House panel investigating the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol insurrection, testify before the House Rules Committee at the Capitol in December. Lawmakers on the committee said for the first time last night that they have enough evidence to suggest Trump committed crimes. Photograph: J Scott Applewhite/AP The hearings are set to be a major and historical political event in America as the panel seeks to publicly show the extent of its investigations so far into the shocking events that saw a pro-Trump mob invade the Capitol in an attempt to stop the certification of the election of Joe Biden by Congress. The panel alleged in a court filing on Wednesday that Trump and his associates obstructed Congress and conspired to defraud the United States on 6 January, arguing it meant the former Trump lawyer John Eastman could not shield thousands of emails from the inquiry. But the public hearings – which are likely to come late next month, the chair of the select committee, Bennie Thompson, told the Guardian – will address just how Trump came to interfere with the joint session of Congress through rhetoric he knew to be false or unlawful. “The president’s rhetoric persuaded thousands of Americans to travel to Washington for January 6, some of whom marched on the Capitol, breached security, and took other illegal actions. The select committee’s hearings will address those issues in detail,” the filing said. The panel also said in its court submission that the public hearings would address how Trump appeared to lay the groundwork for his rhetoric inciting the Capitol attack by promoting claims of election fraud in the 2020 election that he had been told were without merit. “Despite being repeatedly told his allegations of campaign fraud were false, the President continued to feature those same false allegations in ads seen by millions,” the filing said. “The select committee will address these issues in detail in hearings this year.” The select committee indicated the public hearings would serve as the opportunity to cast a light on Trump’s secret efforts to overturn the election, from his attempts to pressure the then vice-president, Mike Pence, to return him to office, to abuse of the justice department. “We want to paint a picture as clear as possible as to what occurred,” Thompson told reporters on Capitol Hill on Thursday. “The public needs to know what to think. We just have to show clearly what happened on January 6.” Read the full report here.



3 Mar 2022 16.16 Donald Trump will turn over some documents to New York’s attorney general, Letitia James, for her civil probe into his business practices, but need not answer questions under oath while he appeals a judge’s order that he testify. The developments are part of an agreement struck today between the former US Republican president, his oldest children Don Jr. and Ivanka Trump, and AG James.

The Trumps appealed on February 28. James’ three-year probe and a parallel criminal probe led by Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg have focused on whether the Trump Organization misstated the values of its real estate properties to obtain favorable loans and tax benefits. The Trumps have denied wrongdoing, and none has been accused of criminal wrongdoing. Today’s agreement, which Engoron approved, requires Donald Trump to comply “in full” with James’ subpoena for documents and information by March 31. It also requires the Trumps to submit for questioning within 14 days if the state appellate division rejects their appeal, unless that court or the state’s highest court puts the case on hold. Both sides will speed up the appeals process, with briefing completed by March 31. In their appeal, the Trumps have said testifying in James’ probe would violate their constitutional rights because their words could be used against them in Bragg’s criminal probe.

3 Mar 2022 16.04 Joan E Greve Congressman Tom Malinowski, a Democrat of New Jersey, is calling for the frozen assets of Russian oligarchs to be sold to benefit the Ukrainian people.

Malinowski, a former assistant secretary of state under Barack Obama, has introduced a bill with Congressman Joe Wilson, a Republican of South Carolina, to sell the oligarchs’ luxury assets like yachts. A $600 million yacht can help pay for rebuilding Ukraine.



So today, I'm introducing a bipartisan bill with @RepJoeWilson to give the administration a new authority to dispose of sanctioned Russian oligarchs' frozen assets, and to use the proceeds to help Ukrainians. pic.twitter.com/dE0EyHA6ae — Tom Malinowski (@Malinowski) March 3, 2022 “A $600 million yacht can help pay for rebuilding Ukraine,” Malinowski said on Twitter. “So today, I’m introducing a bipartisan bill with @RepJoeWilson to give the administration a new authority to dispose of sanctioned Russian oligarchs’ frozen assets, and to use the proceeds to help Ukrainians.”



The introduction of Malinowski’s bill comes as Joe Biden announced a new round of sanctions on Russian oligarchs and their families, restricting their access to American banks and banning them from traveling to the US.

“Our interest is in maintaining the strongest unified economic impact campaign on Putin in all of history, and I think we’re well on the way to doing that,” Biden said in his cabinet meeting this afternoon. Business Insider has more details on the bill from Malinowski and Wilson calling on the federal government to sell seized Russian assets to benefit the Ukrainian people:

“Funds from such sales could be used on post-conflict reconstruction in Ukraine, humanitarian support, weapons for Ukraine’s armed forces, provisions for refugees, and technology goods. Cash could also be diverted to humanitarian assistance for Russians, ‘including democracy and human rights programming and monitoring,’ according to the bill.

Authority provided by the bill would last for two years after its passage, giving President Joe Biden prolonged power over Russian oligarchs parking their wealth in the US.



The idea could gain further bipartisan traction in Congress. Democratic representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington said she was ‘absolutely’ on board.

3 Mar 2022 15.50 Possible nuclear deal with Iran near but issues remain - US State Dept American diplomacy is on hold with Russia right now but alive and well with Iran. There has been significant progress in nuclear talks with Iran and world powers may be close to reaching a deal with Tehran, Reuters reports, while quoting the US government saying a number of difficult issues still remain unresolved. There will not be an Iran nuclear deal unless those issues are quickly resolved, State Department spokeswoman Jalina Porter told reporters. Marathon talks recently hit a roadblock. It’s not clear yet what might have cleared along the way for a deal to be closer to fruition, but there are reports of “significant progress”. Talks had been going on in Vienna between the west, Russia, Iran and China. Iran is pushing for all sanctions in place against it to be lifted, but the US says some sanctions are linked to human rights and terrorists abuses, and are not linked to the nuclear deal. The Guardian’s Patrick Wintour previously noted that an agreement is designed to bring the US, and subsequently Iran, back into the original nuclear deal signed in 2015 from which the US withdrew in 2018. The talks have been held against a backdrop of repeated warnings from the west stretching back months that the talks can continue only for a few more weeks because Iran is coming ever closer to obtaining irreversibly the material and knowledge required to make a nuclear weapon.



3 Mar 2022 15.33 The American version of RT, the Russia-controlled TV network that pumps out Putin propaganda and has now been banned in Europe and dropped by platforms around the world, is apparently seeing an impact in the US of the invasion of Ukraine. The production company behind the RT operation in the US laid off most of its staff today, CNN has reported. The cable network promises more reporting, but for now writes on its website that: Misha Solodovnikov, the general manager of the production company, T&R Productions, told staff that it will be “ceasing production” at all of its locations “as a result of unforeseen business interruption events.””Unfortunately, we anticipate this layoff will be permanent, meaning that this will result in the permanent separation from employment of most T&R employees at all locations,” Solodovnikov wrote in his memo to employees. The layoffs would mean an effective end to RT America. The network, one of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s main mouthpieces in the US, was dropped earlier this week by DirecTV. The satellite carrier was one of the two major television providers in the US to carry the network.

3 Mar 2022 15.13 Biden: 'Strongest unified economic impact campaign on Putin in all history' Joe Biden made remarks a little earlier at the top of a meeting of his cabinet about the new sanctions announced by the US against oligarchs close to Russian president Vladimir Putin, over the invasion of Ukraine. The US president did not take questions from the pool reporters gathered to see the top of the meeting. But Biden talked from prepared remarks of his latest announced measures against Russian oligarchs as: “Severe economic sanctions on Putin and all of those folks around him, choking off access to technology as well as cutting off access to the global financial system.” He added: “It’s had a profound impact already. The goal was to maximize the impact on Putin and Russia and minimize the harm on us and our allies and friends around the world. “Our interest is in maintaining the strongest unified economic impact campaign on Putin in all history and I think we’re well on the way to doing that.” Biden referred to his State of the Union address on Tuesday evening, his first, in which he vowed that Putin would pay for his “unprovoked” attack on Russia’s southern, democratic neighbor. He said: “I announced that the Department of Justice is going after the crimes of Russian oligarchs…who line their pockets with Russian peoples’ money while Ukraine and the people are hiding in the subway from Russian missiles that are being fired indiscriminately... “Today I’m announcing that we’re adding dozens of names to the list including one of Russia’s wealthiest billionaires and I’m banning travel to America by more than 50 Russian oligarchs, their families and their close associates. And we’re going to continue to support Ukrainian people with direct assistance.” Joe Biden speaks during a cabinet meeting in the White House this afternoon.

3 Mar 2022 14.05 'We want him to feel the squeeze' – White House on extra sanctions on Russian oligarchs close to Vladimir Putin Joan E Greve The White House will shortly issue new sanctions on Russian oligarchs and their families, as Vladimir Putin showed no sign of deescalating Russia’s devastating military attacks on Ukraine. The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, confirmed the forthcoming sanctions and said the move was meant to put more pressure on Putin by targeting his inner circle of allies. “We want him to feel the squeeze. We want the people around him to feel the squeeze,” Psaki said. “I don’t believe this is going to be the last set of oligarchs.” Psaki did not provide many details on the sanctions, although she did indicate they would include a US travel ban on the oligarchs. Joe Biden is expected to provide more details on the sanctions at his cabinet meeting on Thursday afternoon. The announcement marks an escalation by the Biden administration, which had already imposed sanctions on Putin, his foreign minister and some of the top executives of Russia’s largest companies following the invasion of Ukraine. Biden indicated in his State of the Union speech on Tuesday that his administration would crack down on oligarchs’ assets as part of the West’s efforts to further isolate Putin. “I say to the Russian oligarchs and the corrupt leaders who’ve bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime: no more,” Biden said Tuesday. “We’re joining with European Allies to find and seize their yachts, their luxury apartments, their private jets. We’re coming for your ill-begotten gains.” The new sanctions came as the White House asked Congress for another $10bn in aid to Ukraine. Shalanda Young, acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, said the money would be used to provide Ukraine with more defense equipment and emergency food assistance, as well as bolster enforcement of the sanctions against Russia. “Given the rapidly evolving situation in Ukraine, additional needs may arise over time,” Young said. House speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that she supports including the funding for Ukraine in the omnibus spending package currently being debated in Congress. Pelosi also echoed demands to ban US imports of Russian oil, telling reporters, “I’m all for that. Ban it. Ban the oil coming from Russia.” But the White House has voiced a more skeptical opinion of sanctioning Russian oil companies, amid concerns that the crisis in Ukraine could drive gas prices higher. “We don’t have a strategic interest in reducing the global supply of energy,” Psaki said. “That would raise prices at the gas pump for the American people.” Any sanctions imposed by the White House may be coming too late for millions of Ukrainians. More than 1 million people have already fled the country because of the Russian invasion, and the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has begged for more assistance from Western allies to end Putin’s airstrikes. “If you do not have the power to close the skies, then give me planes!” he said Thursday. “If we are no more, then, God forbid, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia will be next.” Expectations are low for the second round of peace talks between Ukrainian and Russian officials in Belarus. A phone call between Putin and French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday yielded no major breakthroughs, and concerns are mounting over a massive Russian convoy of tanks and artillery outside the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. The French Élysée palace said after the call, “We expect the worst is yet to come.”

3 Mar 2022 13.56 US not planning to engineer Russian no-fly zone over Ukraine - White House White House press secretary Jen Psaki reiterated moments ago that the US has no plans to take action to impose a no-fly zone for Russian military aircraft over Ukraine. A reporter pointed out to Psaki that Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has asked for the west to create a no-fly zone over his imperiled nation. Psaki said: “The reason why that has not been a step the president [Joe Biden] is willing to take because it requires implementation. It requires essentially the US military shooting down Russian planes and causing a potential direct war with Russia - the exact step that we want to avoid.” She added that Biden has increased support to Ukraine, including military equipment and weapons “but we are not taking steps that would prompt a war between the US and Russia.” Today’s ongoing press briefing at the White House with Jen Psaki.

3 Mar 2022 13.24 The US believes that Russian forces have not, in fact, yet taken over the southern Ukrainian port city of Kherson, known for its shipbuilding industry, a senior US defense official has said. This is in contrast to most media reports so far, including the Guardian’s, which say that the Black Sea port on Wednesday became the first major Ukrainian city to fall under the de facto control of Russia forces. This was after Kherson’s mayor, Igor Kolykhaiev, said in a Facebook post that Russian troops were in control of the city hall and that residents should obey a curfew imposed by “armed visitors”. But the Reuters news agency is now reporting that the Russian military offensive on Kherson could be part of a strategy for potentially moving to the much larger port of Mykolaiv a little to the west of Kherson on that southern coast of Ukraine. And then on to the city of Odesa on the Black Sea, which has a population close to a million. Children look out from a carriage window as a train prepares to depart from a station in Lviv, western Ukraine, enroute to the town of Uzhhorod near the border with Slovakia, today. Photograph: Daniel Leal/AFP/Getty Images Reuters is citing an unnamed senior US defense officia. The agency further reports: Tanks entered the port town of Kherson, a provincial capital of around 250,000 people, and Russian forces occupied the regional administration building, regional governor Hennadiy Laguta said in an online post on Thursday.

“There’s still fighting there, so we’re not ready to call it one way or another,” the U.S. official told reporters, adding that the situation on the ground was changing quickly. If Kherson were to be captured, it would be the first significant urban center to fall into the hands of Russian troops. “What they may want to do is move on (Mykolaiv) so that they can then position themselves to the northeast of Odessa in case, in fact, they want to move on Odessa, not just from the sea, but from the ground,” said the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The invasion, which started eight days ago, has not seen Russian aircraft control Ukraine’s airspace. Russian troops are still stalled about 16 miles outside Kyiv’s city center. The official said that Russia had moved about 90% of its pre-staged combat power into Ukraine so far and about 480 missiles had been fired by Russian forces at Ukrainian targets. British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace earlier on Thursday said Putin had deployed thermobaric weapons systems in Ukraine. The U.S. official said: “We know that they have the launching systems available to them in Ukraine that could be used for rockets that have a thermobaric warhead on them. But we cannot confirm that those weapons are in Ukraine and we cannot confirm any examples of use.” Meanwhile, a massive Russian military convoy outside the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv is stalled for a third day.

3 Mar 2022 12.34 Martin Pengelly Bad news for Republicans not wholly on the Trump Train, it seems, from Arizona. Doug Ducey. Photograph: Kirby Lee/USA Today Sports The governor, Doug Ducey, has decided not to run for Senate against Mark Kelly, a former astronaut and one of two Democrats who currently represent Arizona in Washington. Ducey* notified donors of his decision in a letter reported by the Arizona Republic. “Right now I have the job I want,” Ducey wrote, adding that he was “fully committed to helping elect a Republican US senator from Arizona”. The other current senator in Arizona, Kyrsten Sinema, is unpopular with Democrats in her state and nationally but is up for re-election in 2024. Some fear she could drag down votes for Kelly. The Senate is split 50-50 and controlled by the vote of the vice-president, Kamala Harris. Mitch McConnell, the Republican minority leader, has now seen three popular Republican governors decline to run for Senate: Larry Hogan, in Maryland, and Chris Sununu in New Hampshire are the others. There’s also the question of what effect the Trump Train itself might have. In Missouri, for instance, Trump has not yet bestowed his endorsement in the race for the Republican nomination to replace a retiring Republican senator, Roy Blunt. There are some rather extreme candidates about, including Eric Greitens, a former governor who resigned in 2018 over allegations of sexual assault. As in the House, some think too-extreme candidates could jeopardise Republicans’ chances of taking control, by turning off the sort of independent or “moderate” voters who notably swung Republican in last year’s gubernatorial election in Virginia. *Note on Doug Ducey: he’s the Republican governor of a state key to Donald Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 election through lies about electoral fraud who was certifying results when Trump called him … and who let the call go through to voicemail**. **Note to the note about Doug Ducey: he’s also the governor who recently said he needed the support of a far-right state senator who associates with white nationalists and muses about building gallows for her enemies, because at least she isn’t a Democrat.

3 Mar 2022 12.17 Sam Levine In the late summer of 2020, Bruce Bartman went to Pennsylvania’s voter registration website and signed up his mother and mother-in-law to vote. Both were dead. A few months later, Bartman, who is white, requested a mail-in ballot for his late mother and cast her vote for Donald Trump. Bartman was arrested that December and charged with perjury and unlawful voting. Months later, he pleaded guilty, admitted he made a “stupid mistake”, was sentenced to five years of probation and barred from serving on a jury or voting for four years. “There’s not public benefit to him being incarcerated,” Jack Stollsteimer, the local district attorney said at the time. “This defendant from the beginning has accepted responsibility for his actions, and he has paid the price for them.” When Bartman pleaded guilty, nearly 1,000 miles away, in Memphis, a Black Lives Matter activist named Pamela Moses was facing her own election-related criminal charges. A few years previously, Moses, who is Black, permanently lost the right to vote after committing a felony. But no one had actually removed Moses from the voter rolls or told her she couldn’t vote. And in 2019, when state officials began looking into her eligibility, a probation officer signed a certificate saying Moses had completed her sentence and was eligible to vote. So she applied to do so. Even though corrections officials conceded they made an error, Moses was indicted anyway. Moses was convicted by a jury in November. In late January, she was sentenced to six years and one day in prison. Full story:

Those targeted by the new sanctions include Putin’s press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, and Alisher Burhanovich Usmanov, one of Russia’s wealthiest individuals and a close ally of Putin. The U.S. State Department also announced it was imposing visa bans on 19 Russian oligarchs and dozens of their family members and close associates.

“These individuals and their family members will be cut off from the U.S. financial system; their assets in the United States will be frozen and their property will be blocked from use,” the White House said in a statement announcing the new penalties.

The White House described Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson, as a ""top purveyor of Putin’s propaganda.”

4,01094ff9-e857-4af9-b63d-b8781875e18b,"['Abc News', 'Ben Gittleson', 'Molly Nagle', 'March']",,"The U.S. on Thursday announced new sanctions against members of the Russian elite, including Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, and said it would block 19 oligarchs and 47 of their relatives and close associates from traveling to the United States.

The sanction targets include Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, as well as one of Russia's richest men, Alisher Usmanov, according to the White House.

Germany had already seized Usmanov's superyacht, and the White House said both the boat and Usmanov's private jet -- which it said was one of the largest privately-owned aircraft in Russia -- would be blocked for use in the U.S. or by Americans.

""These are significant steps that will impact the people who are closely around President Putin,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters.""We want him to feel the squeeze. We want the people around him to feel the squeeze.""

President Joe Biden touched on the latest U.S. actions against Russia at the top of the fourth Cabinet meeting of his administration, saying the steps his administration and its allies have already taken are having a ""profound impact.""

Biden said the Russian oligarchs being sanctioned ""line their pockets with Russian people's money and while Ukraine and the people are hiding in subways from missiles that are being fired indiscriminately from Russian cities.""

In a news release, the Treasury Department said it and the State Department had intensified pressure on Russia by ""sanctioning numerous Russian elites and their family members, identifying certain property of these persons as blocked, and sanctioning Russian intelligence-directed disinformation outlets.""

It said the elites sanctioned provided direct and indirect support to the Russian government through their business empires, wealth, and other resources. ""The aid of these individuals, their family members, and other key elites allows President Vladimir Putin to continue to wage the ongoing, unprovoked invasion of Ukraine,"" the release said.

It described Usmanov as one of Russia’s wealthiest billionaires with vast holdings across multiple sectors of the Russian Federation economy as well as internationally.

""Usmanov’s Kremlin ties enrich him and enable his luxurious lifestyle. Evidencing his wealth, Usmanov owns one of the world’s largest superyachts, known as Dilbar ... named after Usmanov’s mother ... This superyacht’s estimated worth is believed to be between $600 and $735 million. Dilbar has two helipads and one of the world’s largest indoor pools ever installed on a yacht. The estimated cost to run Dilbar is $60 million per year,"" Treasury said.

Usmanov’s aircraft, an Airbus A340-300, the release said, is believed to have cost between $350 and $500 million.

Shortly after he arrived in Brussels for a full day of meetings Thursday with NATO, the G-7, and European Union counterparts, among other allies, Secretary of State Antony Blinken weighed in on the new sanctions.

""These actions make it clear there is nowhere to hide for individuals and entities that support Russia's flagrant war against Ukraine,"" he said in a statement.

The statement also said the Department of State is imposing substantial costs on Russia’s defense enterprises by sanctioning 22 defense-related firms. ""These far-reaching sanctions target entities that develop and produce fighter aircraft, infantry fighting vehicles, electronic warfare systems, missiles, and unmanned aerial vehicles for Russia’s military. These sanctions strike at the core of Putin’s war machine,"" he said.

“We’re going to make it hard for them to use the assets going forward,"" Adeyemo said at an event hosted by The Washington Post. He added, “Our goal then is to find that money and to freeze that money and to seize it.”

The White House imposed sanctions on 19 wealthy Russian individuals and 47 of their family members and close associates, including President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, and Alisher Usmanov, one of the wealthiest men in Russia.

Unwilling to engage Russia’s military directly, the U.S. and Europe have also increased their shipments of weapons and other materiel to Ukraine in recent days, as television coverage of Russia’s unprovoked aggression and social media posts from Ukraine have galvanized the West.

Biden, outlining the new sanctions at the start of a Cabinet meeting Thursday, said prior actions to cut Russia off from the global financial system have had a “profound effect” already.

“The goal was to maximize the impact on Putin and Russia and minimize the harm on us and our allies and friends around the world,” he continued. “Our interest is in maintaining the strongest unified economic impact campaign on Putin in all history, and I think we’re well on the way to doing that.”

The U.S. restrictions will prohibit those sanctioned from traveling to the United States. By targeting the elites’ family members, the administration is aiming to prevent them from easily transferring assets to spouses or children, a loophole often used in similar situations to evade sanctions.

The latest move came amid new indications from Putin that he has no intention of halting the war until he has overrun all of Ukraine. And it marked the latest effort by Washington to force him to recalculate his strategy through a devastating economic pressure campaign.

On Wednesday, the Justice Department announced a team to enforce sanctions and export restrictions and to seize luxury assets belonging to Russia’s wealthiest citizens.

The administration and European allies have thus far avoided sanctioning Russia’s energy sector, attempting to mitigate the impact on global energy markets and consumers. By putting the financial screws to Russian millionaires and billionaires, the administration hopes it will be able to force those oligarchs to distance themselves from Putin and urge him to find a diplomatic offramp to end the war in Ukraine.

But so far the economic and geopolitical effects of the swift global response to Moscow — the ruble has nose-dived, Russian planes have been barred from European and U.S. airspace, and long-neutral countries such as Finland and Sweden have suggested a newfound interest in joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization — have not deterred Putin. On Thursday after the Russian leader’s 90-minute telephone call with French President Emmanuel Macron, an Elysee Palace official concluded that Putin was determined to conquer Ukraine no matter the cost, stating flatly that “the worst is yet to come.”

As the shelling of Ukraine’s major cities continues a week after Putin began the invasion, political pressure continues to build in Washington for sanctions on Russia’s energy sector.

Republicans argue that going after the country’s energy exports would cripple Russia far more dramatically than other actions the U.S. has taken.

“Their Achilles’ heel is that their economy depends on oil and gas revenue. Never in the history of warfare have we had a chance to deliver such a decisive blow without firing a shot,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). “If the Ukrainians can stand up to a tank, if a grandmother can get a rifle, surely to God we can produce more oil and gas.”

Several Republicans as well as Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Jon Tester of Montana have introduced bills to ban the U.S. import of Russian oil.

Although Europe is far more dependent on Russian energy resources, the U.S. buys almost 700,000 barrels of oil per day from Russia, according to Sen. Daniel Sullivan (R-Alaska).

“That’s $17 billion that we are putting into Putin’s war chest,” he said. “This is national security suicide.”

So far, the administration has hesitated to impose energy sanctions. The move, likely to wreak hardship on ordinary Russians, could rally them behind their leader. At the same time, such measures would probably increase oil prices on the global market and could lead to significant economic and political consequences in the U.S.

“The president’s objective has been to maximize impact on President Putin and Russia while minimizing impact to us and our allies and partners,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday. “We don’t have a strategic interest in reducing the global supply of energy.”

Many Democrats are skeptical of the idea, in part because it would require the U.S. to increase domestic production to make up for it, but top House Democrats are on board.

“I’m all for that. Ban it,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco). House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) reiterated that position.

Although Sen. Christopher S. Murphy (D-Conn.) said that not buying Russian oil “feels like the right thing to do,” he expressed skepticism that Congress should start freelancing foreign policy separately from the White House.

“There’s no reason for us to doubt the competence and effectiveness of this administration on Ukraine policy,” he said. “They have performed beyond people’s wildest expectations, and I don’t know that this is the moment for Congress to be setting a different direction from the administration.”

What you should know What are the roots of the Russia-Ukraine hostilities? Ukraine won its independence in 1991 with the fall of the Soviet Union. Russian President Vladimir Putin contends it was never a state. Why won't the U.S. and NATO approve a no-fly zone over Ukraine? A no-fly zone, many officials say, would draw the U.S. and its NATO allies into direct combat with Russia — an escalation many liken to a world war. Air combat missions would have to be supported by ground-based operations and the U.S. and its NATO allies would have to be prepared to go in over land, making it “a slippery slope from there to a shooting war.” Who gets to decide if Putin is a war criminal? There are set definitions and processes for determining who’s a war criminal and how they should be punished. The investigations into Putin’s actions already have begun. The U.S. and 44 other countries are working together to investigate possible violations and abuses, and there’s another inquiry by the International Criminal Court. Want to help Ukraine? Here's how Several organizations in California, as well as international aid groups, are helping refugees, wounded soldiers and others in and around Ukraine. Here’s how you can contribute.

Also on Thursday, a spokesman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement confirmed that it has paused deportation flights to Ukraine because of the “ongoing humanitarian crisis” there.

“ICE will continue to monitor the ongoing situation and make operational changes as necessary,” the spokesman said.

Six members of Congress on Thursday introduced bipartisan legislation to grant Ukrainians in the U.S. temporary protected status to prevent their deportation. The Center for Migration Studies of New York estimates that 28,000 Ukrainians in the U.S. could benefit from the designation.

“One of the first things we need to do is assure Ukrainians here in the U.S. that we will not send innocent Ukrainians back to this war zone — which would only exacerbate conditions in Ukraine and inflict trauma on those already facing an unimaginable situation,” Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) said in a news release.

The Department of Homeland Security on Thursday designated Ukraine for temporary protected status for 18 months. To be eligible, Ukrainians must have continuously resided in the U.S. since March 1. Countries can be designated for TPS as a result of ongoing armed conflict, environmental disasters or other extraordinary conditions.

“Russia’s premeditated and unprovoked attack on Ukraine has resulted in an ongoing war, senseless violence, and Ukrainians forced to seek refuge in other countries,” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro N. Mayorkas said in a news release. “In these extraordinary times, we will continue to offer our support and protection to Ukrainian nationals in the United States.”
