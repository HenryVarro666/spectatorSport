0,61600319-ba42-4a67-ad13-9dd4e1f57dee,[],,"BRUSSELS, Belgium — Top European Union officials on Thursday condemned Russia’s bombing of a maternity hospital in the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol as a “war crime.”

“Mariupol is under siege. Russia’s shelling of [a] maternity hospital is a heinous war crime,” the bloc’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell wrote in a tweet.

“Strikes of residential areas from the air and blocks of access of aid convoys by the Russian forces must immediately stop. Safe passage is needed, now,” he added.

European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen called the attack “inhumane, cruel and tragic.”

“I am convinced that this can be a war crime. We need a full investigation,” she tweeted.

The children’s and maternity hospital in Mariupol was attacked on Wednesday in what Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described as a Russian “war crime,” and which sparked global outrage.

Local officials said Thursday that at least three people were killed in the bombing, including a young girl.

Video shared from the site by rescue workers showed a scene of complete devastation, with the wounded being evacuated, some on stretchers, past charred and burning cars, and a massive crater by the building.

The Russian army claimed Thursday that the attack was a “staged provocation” by Ukraine.

“The Russian aviation carried out absolutely no missions to hit targets on the ground in the Mariupol area,” Russian defense ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov claimed. “The airstrike that allegedly took place is a completely staged provocation to maintain anti-Russian hype for a Western audience,” he said.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/eu-condemns-russian-bombing-of-mariupol-maternity-hospital-as-a-war-crime/

#Ukraine's cities are being devastated. Civilians are dying. Indiscriminate attacks, including those using cluster munitions, of a nature to strike military objectives and civilians or civilian objects without discrimination are prohibited by international law. Stop the war now. https://t.co/LiTXXsnPrQ — Rosemary A. DiCarlo (@DicarloRosemary) March 11, 2022

The situation is particularly alarming in Mariupol, Kharkiv, Sumy and Chernihiv, she said, where shelling of residential areas and civilian infrastructure has resulted in an increasing number of civilians killed and injured.

“The utter devastation being visited on these cities is horrific,” she stressed.

Civilians ‘inexcusably’ targeted

As of 11 March, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 1,546 civilian casualties - including 564 killed and 982 injured - since the start of the Russian invasion.

The real casualty figures are likely “considerably higher”. Most have been caused by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including heavy artillery, multi-launch rocket systems and air strikes.

Further, she said OHCHR has received credible reports of Russian forces using cluster munitions in populated areas - indiscriminate attacks, which are prohibited under international humanitarian law.

As of 10 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) verified 26 attacks on health facilities, health workers and ambulances, causing 12 deaths and 34 injuries. This includes the bombing of the Mariupol maternity hospital on 9 March, which she condemned.

Ms. Di Carlo went on to describe the targeting of civilians, residential buildings, hospitals, schools and kindergartens as “inexcusable and intolerable”, emphasizing that all alleged violations of international humanitarian law must be investigated, and perpetrators held accountable.

Millions in dire need of aid

Ms. Di Carlo said humanitarian aid is being scaled up in areas where security permits and has reached more than 500,000 people. The UN and partners have developed operational plans to meet humanitarian needs where they are most acute, she said, appealing to donors who pledged over $1.5 billion to the appeal last week, to release the funding quickly.

Evacuations must continue

It is critical to achieve a ceasefire to allow for the safe passage of civilians from besieged areas, she told ambassadors.

On 9 March, more than 51,000 people were reportedly evacuated through five out of six agreed-upon safe passages. These evacuations must continue.

The number of refugees fleeing the violence has reached 2.5 million – all of whom, including third country nationals, need access to safety and protection, in line with the principle of non-refoulement, and without discrimination.

‘Logic of dialogue’ must prevail

“The need for negotiations to stop the war in Ukraine could not be more urgent”, she said, noting that three rounds of talks held thus far between Ukrainian and Russian delegations must be intensified – notably to secure humanitarian and ceasefire arrangements as a matter of priority. “The logic of dialogue and diplomacy must prevail over the logic of war.”

Perhaps most alarming are the risks the violence poses to the global framework for peace and security, she said, adding that: “We must do everything we can to find a solution and put an end to this war; we must do it now.”

Russia biological weapons claim refuted

Today’s meeting comes on the heels of claims by Russian Ministry of Defence Spokesperson Major General Igor Konashenkov on 6 March, his country’s military had uncovered evidence of US-funded military biological programmes in Ukraine, including documents confirming the development of “biological weapons components”.

Addressing those concerns, High Representative for Disarmament Affairs, Izumi Nakamitsu, said the “United Nations is not aware of any biological weapons programmes”.

Nor is it in a position to confirm or deny” reports that public health facilities are in areas impacted by armed conflict, placing the safety of those facilities at risk. She appealed to all parties in the conflict to ensure the safety of all such facilities in Ukraine.

Explaining that the Russian Federation and Ukraine are both States parties to the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention - which prohibits their development, production, acquisition, transfer, stockpiling and use - and that Moscow is a depositary Government, she said biological weapons have been outlawed since the Convention entered into force in 1975.

With 183 States parties to the treaty, biological weapons are “universally seen as being abhorrent and illegitimate,” she stressed.

Assessing compliance: A State responsibility

However, the Convention lacks a multilateral verification mechanism overseen by an independent organization, such as the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), meaning that the responsibility of assessing compliance rests with States parties.

The treaty does contain several measures for States to address concerns or suspicions about the activities of their peers, Ms. Nakamitsu said. Under Article V, for example, States parties can consult and cooperate to resolve any problems which may arise. An annual exchange of information has been established, based upon the submission of confidence-building measures.

The Russian Federation and Ukraine both participate annually in the confidence-building measures, and their annual reports are available to all States parties for the purposes of transparency and reassurance.

Complaints procedure

In addition, she said that under Article VI, a State Party which finds that its peer is in breach of its obligations can lodge a complaint with the Security Council. An investigation based on the complaint can then be initiated, if agreed by the Council.

Noting that Article VI has never been activated – and that these provisions have not been regularly used – they are nonetheless internationally agreed procedures available to defuse tensions.

“I would, therefore, encourage the Biological Chemical Weapons States parties to consider making use of the available procedures for consultation and cooperation to resolve these issues,” she said. “Situations such as this demonstrate the need to strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention, to operationalize and institutionalize it.”

Addressing other concerns, she warned that an accident involving the nuclear facilities in Ukraine could have severe consequences for public health and the environment and all steps must be taken to avoid it.

“The possibility of an accident caused by failure to a reactor’s power supply or the inability to provide regular maintenance is growing by the day,” she stressed. The forces in effective control of nuclear power plants in Ukraine must ensure their safe and secure operation.

‘Extreme concern’ over nuclear plants

She expressed extreme concern that four of the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA) seven pillars for the safe and secure operation of facilities, are reportedly not being implemented at Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhya – Europe’s largest reactor.

“Communications must be fully restored, and operating staff must be allowed to properly carry out their duties and to do so free of undue pressure,” she asserted.

The Council has held three briefings on the situation in Ukraine since the Russian Federation launched its military assault on 24 February, addressing humanitarian needs (28 February and 7 March) and the safety of nuclear sites (4 March).

Russian allegations

Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said his delegation convened the meeting because during what it still maintains is a “special military operation”, it had discovered a “truly shocking” emergency clean up by “the Kyiv regime” of traces of a biological military operation, with support from the United States Department of Defense.

He said the Russian Ministry of Defence has documents on its website confirming that a network of 30 biological labs across Ukraine – in Odessa, Kyiv, Dniper Kherson and elsewhere - were conducting “very dangerous” experiments to strengthen the pathogenic qualities of the plague, anthrax, cholera and other lethal diseases using synthetic biology.

Some were aimed at spreading infection through migratory birds and bats, while others – funded by the United States – used excto-parasites, like lice and fleas, a particularly reckless endeavour as it would not allow for controlling how a situation could develop.

He said the results were being sent to the military biological centres in the United States, including the Walter Reade Army Institute of Research, the Naval Medical Research Center, and the Biological Warfare Laboratories, at Fort Detrick in Maryland.

“Biological threats know no borders,” he warned. “No region in the world can feel safe”. He accused the United States of blocking a legally binding protocol to create a verification mechanism, leading Moscow to believe that “they have something to hide”. The Russian Federation will not exclude the possibility of invoking the Convention’s Articles V and VI, he said, but for now, it expects to hear responses from the United States.

US accuses Russia of lies, disinformation

To those claims, United States Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Moscow called today’s meeting for “the sole purpose of lying and spreading disinformation”.

Last month, she said, United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken, laid out with “tragic accuracy” what Russia would do, warning it would manufacture a pretext for an attack, even cautioning it would fabricate claims of biological or chemical weapons activities to justify its own violent attacks against Ukrainians.

“The Russian Federation is attempting to use the Security Council to legitimize disinformation and deceive people to justify President [Vladimir] Putin’s war of choice against the Ukrainian people,” she said, adding that China too has spread disinformation in support of Russia’s “outrageous” claims.

“I will say this once: Ukraine does not have a biological weapons programme. There are no Ukrainian biological weapons laboratories supported by the United States - not near Russia’s border or anywhere,” she affirmed.

Laying out the facts, she said Ukraine owns and operates its own public health laboratory infrastructure, with facilities that make it possible to detect and diagnose disease like COVID-19, “which benefit us all.” The United States has assisted Ukraine to do this safely, with work undertaken proudly, clearly and in the open.

She accused the Russian Federation of having long maintained a biological weapons programme, with a well-documented history of nerve agent attacks, notably against Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny and former Russian military intelligence officer Sergei Skripal.

“It continues to shield the [Bashar al] Assad regime in Syria from accountability when the United Nations and OPCW found that it had used chemical weapons repeatedly over the years. Its call for the Council meeting is “potential false flag operation in action,” she said.

China’s concerns

“Biological weapons are weapons of mass destruction,” said China’s Ambassador Zhang Jun. “Any information on bio-military activities should trigger high attention from the international community.”

He noted with concern, credible information released by Moscow, stressing that its concerns should be “properly addressed”. He pressed States parties to implement their Convention obligations, provide clarification and accept multilateral verification.

He also took note of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) press report advising Ukraine to destroy pathogens in its laboratories to prevent spread of infectious diseases, and looked forward to receiving more information in this regard.

He firmly rejected claims against China made by the United States representative. The international community has raised awareness around the US military’s biological activities, with 336 labs around the world. “If the United States believes information is fake, all they can do is to provide relevant data to us so the international community can draw its conclusions on its own”.

Russian aggression ‘threatens us all’ warns Ukraine

Ukraine’s Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya directed his comments to “the representative of the aggressor State, who sits in the seat of the Soviet Union” – whose aggressor State status was recognized by General Assembly resolution ES 11/1, adopted overwhelmingly on 2 March at an emergency session.

He quoted Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov who said on 10 March that “we do not plan to attack other countries; we did not attack Ukraine either”. The Russian Embassy in London then Tweeted that a pregnant woman was “wearing makeup and playing multiple roles of pregnant women in Mariupol.”

He said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov then told reporters in aftermath of the strike on 9 March that “Russian forces do not fire on civilian targets”, before clarifying later that the Kremlin would “look into the incident because you and I do not have clear information on what happened there”.

On 10 March, Mr. Lavrov claimed without evidence that the attack on the Mariupol hospital was warranted because the building had been seized by Ukrainian armed groups.

“Whatever the gentleman in the Soviet seat may say in reply is most probably useless,” he cautioned.

By calling today’s meeting, the aggressor State has “shot itself in the foot”, he said, as Ukraine runs a health system that is in full compliance with its international obligations.

He underscored that Ukrainians are being killed and cities are being destroyed. People are being buried in mass graves in Ukraine's cities, for the first time since the Second World War. He urged the world to be ""resolute in countering such barbaric actions.""

“Russian aggression threatens us all” he said.

The attack came despite Russia agreeing to a 12-hour pause in hostilities to allow refugees to evacuate a number of towns and cities.

Mariupol city council posted a video of the devastated hospital in the city and accused Russian forces of dropping several bombs on it from the air.

""The destruction is enormous,"" said the council. ""The building of the medical facility where the children were treated recently is completely destroyed.""

Police in the Donetsk region said that according to preliminary information at least 17 people were injured, including mothers and staff, as a result of the attack.

Zelensky repeated his call for the NATO military alliance to declare a no-fly zone over Ukraine, as he expressed his outrage at the attack.

""Close the sky right now! Stop the killings! You have power but you seem to be losing humanity,"" he said on Telegram.

""Direct strike of Russian troops at the maternity hospital,"" Zelensky said, adding, ""People, children are under the wreckage. Atrocity! How much longer will the world be an accomplice ignoring terror?""

Later Wednesday, Zelensky called the strike ""final proof, proof of a genocide of Ukrainians taking place.""

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova claimed, without providing evidence, that Ukrainian forces had ""equipped combat positions"" within the hospital.

Evacuation corridors

On Wednesday, Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said both sides had agreed to a ceasefire and planned evacuation corridors from a number of cities in order to allow people to leave.

The attempted evacuation corridors were scheduled to operate from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m local time, with routes including Energodar to Zaporizhia; Mariupol to Zaporizhia; Volnovakha to Pokrovsk; Izium to Lozova; and four separate routes from Vorzel, Bucha, Irpin, Borodyanka, and Gostomel to the capital city of Kyiv.

A corridor also operated between Sumy and Poltava, a route that enabled about 5,000 Ukrainians to evacuate on Tuesday, according to Ukrainian Presidential Office Deputy Kirill Timoshenko.

But several hours after the evacuation was due to begin, there was no sign of people being brought out of Vorzel, Borodyanka, Hostomel, Irpin and Bucha in the bus convoys that had been organized.

The city council of Bucha accused Russian forces of blocking the evacuation in a statement on Facebook.

""The occupants are disrupting the evacuation. Currently, 50 buses are blocked by Russian military in the parking lot,"" the post read.

An attempted evacuation from Demidova, a town north of Kyiv that was not among the agreed corridors, ran into trouble. One police officer was killed and two more people seriously injured during an attempted evacuation of civilians, according to regional authorities.

In the east, it was impossible to evacuate civilians from the town of Izium ""as we constantly hear explosions,"" said Oleh Syniehubov, administrative head of Kharkiv region.

However, greater progress appeared to be made in organizing buses to get people out of the central city of Enerhodar, as well as Irpin and Vorzel.

""The evacuation from the city continues,"" wrote Оleksandr Markushyn, mayor of Irpin, on Facebook. ""There are buses in the center of Irpin. We are evacuating as many people as possible.""

In Vorzel, all of the children that had been stranded in an orphanage have been evacuated, as has the local maternity hospital, according to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, an adviser in the president's office.

At least 2 million refugees have fled Ukraine since the beginning of the invasion, the UN estimates. But millions more remain trapped in towns and cities that have come under sustained attacks by Russian forces in recent days.

And on Tuesday Ukrainian Minister of Defense Oleksii Reznikov claimed more than 400 civilians have been killed, including 38 children, with the real death toll expected to be higher.

Reznikov accused Russia of ""a real act of genocide"" and ""war crimes,"" claiming that Russian forces had fired on the evacuation corridors.

Kharkiv encircled

The city of Kharkiv in northeastern Ukraine is encircled by Russian forces and continues to suffer heavy shelling, the UK Ministry of Defence tweeted Wednesday.

On Tuesday, Kharkiv Mayor Igot Terekhov told CNN the situation was ""difficult"" and there was ""constant shelling from heavy artillery"" on residential neighborhoods and civilian infrastructure.

""They're hitting our water and heating and gas supply,"" said Terekhov. ""They're trying to interrupt our power supplies.""

Kharkiv is home to 1.5 million people, said Terekhov, adding that utility services were working to keep people warm as cold weather approaches.

Terekhov said he regards indiscriminate shelling as ""an act of genocide."" He added that any aid or assistance would be gratefully received, and expressed hope about the ultimate outcome.

""I am absolutely confident that we will defeat the Russians,"" he added.

Zelensky calls for action to prevent 'catastrophe'

Russian forces also continue to bear down on the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, and on Tuesday the head of the Kyiv Regional Military Administration, Oleksiy Kuleba, said the humanitarian situation in areas around the city remains difficult.

""The main issue today remains humanitarian aid. Bucha, Irpin, Gostomel, Makariv, Borodyanka, Vorzel - residents of these settlements are forced to stay in bomb shelters for days without water and food. The occupiers do not give humanitarian corridors, do not give guarantees,"" Kuleba said, naming five districts to the north and west of Kyiv.

On Wednesday, these five districts were named among evacuation corridors agreed by Ukraine and Russia.

Also on Wednesday, Zelensky repeated his call for military intervention from Western allies.

""Ukraine has been saying this to its partners from the first day of the war: If you don't close the skies, you will also be responsible for this catastrophe, a massive humanitarian catastrophe,"" he said.

The Ukrainian government has meanwhile announced that it will ban exports on key agricultural goods, including wheat, corn, grains, salt, and meat, after passing a cabinet resolution Tuesday.

Ukraine's minister of agrarian policy and food, Roman Leshchenko, said the steps had been taken ""to prevent a humanitarian crisis in Ukraine"" and ""meet the needs of the population in critical food products.""",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/09/europe/russia-invasion-ukraine-evacuations-03-09-intl/index.html

After talks with Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Turkey, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said there had been “no progress”, even on a 24-hour ceasefire, although Lavrov said Moscow would keep talking.

Turkey hosts first meeting of top Russian, Ukrainian diplomats since invasion Foreign ministers from Russia and Ukraine will meet in Turkey on Thursday in the first high-level talks between the two countries since Moscow invaded its neighbour, with Ankara hoping they could mark a turning point in the raging conflict.

Moscow’s military advances have sparked fears the capital Kyiv could soon be surrounded. Russian forces were encircling at least four major Ukrainian cities Thursday and armoured vehicles rolled up to Kyiv’s northeastern edge, where suburbs including Irpin and Bucha have endured days of heavy bombardment.

Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said half the population had fled, adding that the city “has been transformed into a fortress”.

“Every street, every building, every checkpoint has been fortified.”

The besieged southern port city of Mariupol, meanwhile, came under fresh assault Thursday, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accusing Moscow of launching a “tank attack” targeting a humanitarian corridor where he had dispatched a convoy to try to get food, water and medicine into the city.

The attack, which Zelenskyy described in a video statement as “outright terror”, came a day after the bombing of a children’s hospital there that local officials said killed three people, including a young girl.

Zelenskyy branded that attack a Russian “war crime”, a position backed by top Western officials.

The White House slammed the “barbaric” use of force against civilians, while European Union foreign policy chief Joseph Borrell echoed Zelenskyy in calling the hospital attack a “heinous war crime”.

The Russian army claimed the hospital bombing was a “staged provocation” by Ukraine.

Around 100,000 people have been evacuated in two days, Ukraine’s government said Thursday.

They managed to leave areas around the northeastern city of Sumy, sites northwest of Kyiv and the eastern city of Izyum.

Moscow said it would also open daily humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians to Russian territory, but Kyiv has insisted no evacuation routes should lead to Russia.

‘Apocalyptic’

The UN Refugee Agency estimates more than 2.3 million refugees have left Ukraine since Russia shocked the world by invading its pro-Western neighbour on 24 February and some 1.9 million Ukrainians have been internally displaced.

Overall, at least 71 children have been killed and more than 100 wounded in Ukraine since the war began, said Lyudmyla Denisova, the Ukraine parliament’s point person on human rights.

The situation in Mariupol is particularly dire, with 10 days of constant attacks having left more than 1,200 civilians dead, according to the mayor.

The UN said in addition to Mariupol, two other Ukrainian maternity hospitals had been attacked and destroyed, including one in Zhytomyr, west of Kyiv.

Mariupol’s city council reported new Russian air attacks Thursday on residential buildings and aid agencies say it faces an “apocalyptic” situation, with no water, power or heat for more than a week.

The International Committee of the Red Cross said some residents had started fighting for food, and many had run out of drinking water.

While the hospital attack triggered global outrage, Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said there were no Russian air strikes in the area, and described the incident as a “staged provocation” to stoke anti-Russian sentiment.

Lavrov, at the Turkey talks, claimed Moscow’s operations have been purely defensive.

Asked by a Turkish reporter if Moscow was planning to attack other nations, Lavrov replied “we don’t plan to attack other countries”, claiming Russia “did not attack Ukraine”.

He said Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the operation as the situation in Ukraine “posed a direct threat to the Russian Federation”.

‘Nowhere to run’

On Kyiv’s northeastern edge, Ukrainian soldiers described fierce fighting for control of the main highway leading into the capital.

An AFP team witnessed missile strikes in Velyka Dymerka just outside Kyiv’s city limits.

Ukrainian forces only had minimal presence in the village, which locals said witnessed heavy battles overnight.

“It’s frightening, but what can you do?” said Vasyl Popov, a 38-year-old advertising salesman. “There is nowhere to really run or hide. We live here.”

Across Ukraine, the invasion has so far destroyed about $100 billion in roads, bridges and businesses, said Oleg Ustenko, Zelenskyy’s chief economic advisor.

The conflict has raised fears of a nuclear accident in a country with two major plants now under Russian control: Chernobyl, location of the world’s worst nuclear disaster, in 1986, and Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s largest nuclear plant.

Ukraine sees risk of radiation leak at Chernobyl, IAEA sees 'no critical impact' on safety Ukraine said on Wednesday (9 March) there was a danger of a radiation leak at the Chernobyl nuclear power station after electricity was cut off to the plant, but the UN nuclear watchdog saw “no critical impact on security”.

The UN’s atomic watchdog IAEA warned of a “dire” situation, with power out at the Chernobyl plant and all communications with Ukraine there severed.

Russian forces bombarded the Ukrainian city Mariupol again on Thursday amid international outrage over the bombing of a children's hospital there, while a massive convoy that has been stalled for over a week outside Kyiv appeared to split up into surrounding towns and forests.

Civilians in the port city of Mariupol are facing increasingly dire conditions with scarce food, fuel and electricity. Bodies are being buried in mass graves.

The Kremlin displayed harried confusion in its response to criticism Thursday, at times completely denying the Mariupol hospital bombing and at other moments alleging an elaborate propaganda ploy by the West.

Photos and video of the bombing's aftermath clearly show severely injuried people - including a pregnant woman - being taken by stretcher from the rubble.

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, however, has said the building was a hospital and called the attack an ""atrocity.""

The hospital complex in Mariupol bombed Wednesday resulted in at least three deaths, including one child, Ukraine authorities say. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov dismissed the claim Thursday, saying the hospital had been emptied of patients and was being used as an extremist base.

The attack was condemned internationally and branded a ""war crime"" by Ukrainian and Western leaders. French President Emmanuel Macron called it “a shameful and immoral act of war.” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said it was ""horrific"" and ""barbaric.""

""This is not the first time when we see pathetic cries about so-called atrocities committed by the Russian armed forces,"" Lavrov said. ""Our delegation presented facts at a meeting of the U.N. Security Council proving that the maternity hospital had long been seized by fighters of the Azov battalion and other radicals. They kicked all patients, all nurses, and all service personnel out.""

Later, Russia denied responsibility entirely and claimed the attack was staged to make the Kremlin look bad. Russia’s Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov denied the strike. He claimed that the two explosions that ravaged the building were caused by explosive devices planted nearby in what he described as a “staged provocation to incite anti-Russian agitation in the West.”

Meanwhile, the highest-level talks yet failed to reach agreement on a humanitarian cease-fire aimed at protecting Ukraine cities battered by fierce Russian assaults.

In Poland, Vice President Kamala Harris reiterated the U.S. commitment to NATO and defense of its members is ""ironclad."" Harris, during a joint news conference in Warsaw with Polish President Andrzej Duda, said America is deeply appreciative of Poland's efforts to aid refugees fleeing the carnage in Ukraine.

""This is a moment that requires severe and swift consequences for Russian aggression against Ukraine,"" Harris said. ""What is at stake, this very moment, are some of the guiding principles around the NATO alliance.""

The meeting came after the Biden administration rejected a plan from Poland that would involve U.S. involvement in providing fighter jets to Ukraine, a decision drawing questions from some Republican senators. U.S. defense officials also have distanced themselves from Ukraine requests for a NATO-backed no-fly zone over the country.

In Turkey, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov met, the most pressing issue the southern port of Mariupol. The city has been rocked by two weeks of unrelenting bombardment leaving inhabitants struggling to obtain, food, water, shelter and other basic necessities. Multiple rounds of talks aimed at protecting Ukraine's civilians have also failed to make headway toward peace.

Latest developments:

► Congress passed $13.6 billion in humanitarian aid money for Ukraine and allies as part of a larger spending package that received bipartisan support in the Senate on Thursday.

►In addition to the more than 2.3 million people who have fled the war in Ukraine, an estimated 1.9 million people are displaced within the country, according to the U.N.

►Russian President Vladimir Putin shrugged off sanctions from the West, saying they are nothing new for Russians. ″Just as we overcame these difficulties in the previous years, we will overcome them now,"" he said at a televised meeting of government officials. He acknowledged the sanctions create “certain challenges.”

►Former Vice President Mike Pence and wife Karen visited Thursday with Ukraine refugees at the Korczowa border crossing in Poland. ""The impact of the Russian invasion on these families is heartbreaking and the need for support is great,"" Pence said on Twitter.

►The U.N. refugee agency says more than 2.3 million Ukrainians have fled the country, over 1.4 million of them through Poland. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said late Thursday that about 100,000 people have fled over the last two days through evacuation corridors.

►A Ukrainian man learned his family was killed through graphic images circulating on Twitter. Serhiy Perebyinis told The New York Times he first recognized the luggage in the photo where the lifeless bodies of his wife and two children were lying on the ground after being hit by shrapnel from a Russian mortar shelling Sunday.

Biden to call for suspending Russia's preferential trade status over Ukraine

President Joe Biden will announce Friday the U.S. will join the European Union and G7 allies in calling to revoke Russia's permanent normal trade relations status, which would allow new tariffs on Russian imports, according to a source familiar with the decision.

The move, which requires congressional action, comes as a group of bipartisan lawmakers has pressured the president to take more aggressive action to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. The source said Biden looks forward to working with Congress on legislation to revoke Russia's permanent normal trade relations status.

Biden's expected announcement would put Moscow's trade relationship with the U.S. in the same category as North Korea and Cuba. Read more here.

Zelenskyy worries Russia could use chemical or bioweapons in Ukraine

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy denied Russia’s accusation that Ukraine is preparing to attack with chemical or biological weapons, and he said the accusation itself was a bad sign.

“That worries me very much because we have often been convinced that if you want to know Russia’s plans, they are what Russia accuses others of,” he said in his nightly address to the nation.

Russia said it uncovered plans to create secret laboratories in Ukraine to produce biological weapons.

“I am a reasonable person. The president of a reasonable country and reasonable people. I am the father of two children,” Zelenskyy said. “And no chemical or any other weapon of mass destruction has been developed on my land. The whole world knows this.”

His comments came as the U.S. and other Western leaders expressed similar concerns that Russia was hinting as its possible next move in using such weapons in the war in Ukraine.

Nuclear research facility hit by Russian shelling

Russian forces shelled a nuclear research institute in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city on Thursday, setting buildings ablaze, said Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s Interior Ministry.

A shell hit a building where there is equipment that could release radiation if it were damaged, Gerashchenko said. According to the president’s office, there has been no change in the background radiation.

The shelling caused a fire, but firefighters were able to put it out.

Russian forces have already taken over two nuclear power plants in Ukraine, raising concerns about the security of nuclear facilities in the country.

State Department vows to hold Russians responsible for war crimes

The United States has seen “very credible reports” of deliberate attacks by Russians on Ukrainian civilians that would qualify as a war crime under international law, State Department spokesman Ned Price said Thursday.

That could include the recent assault on the maternity and children’s hospital complex as well as strikes on schools, residential buildings, public buses and ambulances, he said. Price said the U.S. will do everything possible to hold accountable every Russian political leader, military commander and service member who participates in a war crime.

“Criminal prosecutions are one possibility,” he said.

The U.S. has the ability to conduct its own in-depth investigations and will support the appropriate international investigations, Price said. The International Criminal Court announced last week it’s investigating possible war crimes by Russia in Ukraine. Price was also pushed on the administration’s rejection of Poland’s offer to transfer Soviet-era fighter planes to the U.S., which could then give the planes to Ukraine.

Price repeated the administration’s argument that having the planes pass through U.S. hands would risk escalating the war. Asked if the U.S. would still support the original goal of having Poland transfer its planes directly to Ukraine, Price said that’s up to Poland.

“Individual NATO allies, individual countries are going to make sovereign decisions on what… they deem to be in their best interest,” he said.

Twitter to start labeling Belarus state media content

Twitter announced Thursday it will label accounts and tweets linked to state media content in Belarus, a Russian ally. The move comes after the company launched labels on Kremlin-linked media accounts last week.

""As is standard with these labels, we’ll reduce the visibility of labeled Tweets and accounts, and show a prompt before you can share labeled Tweets,"" said Yoel Roth, Twitter's head of site integrity.

Roth said adding labels to Russian state media has shown a decrease of 30% in impressions on its content.

Big tech companies have had to grapple with how to approach state media and propaganda. Google said it would block YouTube channels linked to Russian state media. Read more here.

Some U.S. universities cutting financial, academic ties to Russia

Some public American universities with investments in Russia are cutting financial and academic ties to the country following its invasion of Ukraine, including all of Arizona’s public universities.

“Obviously we see the invasion of Ukraine as the actions of a mad despot and so we want to do as little as possible to help him in any possible way,” said Michael Crow, president of Arizona State University, one of the largest public institutions in the country.

Similar actions have been taken by the Texas A & M University and the University of Colorado systems.

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology also recently cut ties to a Russian university it helped launch, and Middlebury College withdrew students that had been studying in the country.

Ukrainian man discovers family was killed after seeing Twitter post

A Ukrainian man waited to hear that his wife and children had safely evacuated to Kyiv amid the Russian invasion. Hours later, he learned his family was killed through graphic images circulating on Twitter.

Serhiy Perebyinis told The New York Times he first recognized the luggage in the photo where the lifeless bodies of his wife, Tetiana Perebyinis, 43, and their two children, Mykyta, 18, and Alisa, 9, and church volunteer Anatoly Berezhnyi, 26, were laying on the ground after being hit by shrapnel from a Russian mortar shelling on Sunday.

They were attempting to cross a bridge to safety when the mortar detonated 12 yards away from the family in the town of Irpin. Serhiy told the outlet he was in eastern Ukraine trying to help his sick mother when Tetiana decided it was time to flee to Kyiv.

“I told her, ‘Forgive me that I couldn’t defend you,’” he said. “I tried to care for one person, and it meant I cannot protect you.”

Ukrainian Paralympic athletes protest at China games

Ukrainian athletes at the Paralympics Games in China held a demonstration on Thursday at the Athletes Village, donning blue and yellow and holding a large banner that read, ""Peace For All.""

The group held a minute of silence and called for peace before noting how personally impacted they have been by the war. Andriy Nesterenko, the head coach of the delegation, noted how members of their team were from areas that have been ravaged by the war. He said ""some of them doesn’t have the possibility to come back. Their flats, their private houses are already destroyed,"" he told reporters at the demonstration, according to The New York Times.

Already, a Ukrainian biathlete had to withdraw from a competition at the games after her father was captured by Russian troops. Anastasiia Laletina did not race in the biathlon middle distance sitting event Tuesday after she heard her father, a soldier in the Ukrainian army was taken prisoner by Russian soldiers, team spokesperson Nataliia Harach confirmed to USA TODAY Sports on Tuesday. He was beaten and being treated by doctors.

The games barred Russia from competing in the games, citing tensions in the Athletes Village. The Russian Paralympic Committee called the decision “absolutely politicized.”

Republicans attack Biden’s handling of Polish fighter jet proposal

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday attacked what he called the Biden administration’s “confusing mismanagement and mixed signals” on the Ukraine crisis. The Kentucky Republican was referring to the Polish government’s surprise offer this week to give its Soviet-era fighter jets to the U.S., which would then give the planes to Ukraine. The administration, which had anticipated Poland would directly provide the planes to Ukraine, called Poland’s offer “untenable.” Involving the U.S. and a NATO air base would run a “high risk” of escalating the war, the Pentagon said Wednesday.

At least a dozen senators urged the Biden administration to reconsider. Some accused the White House of abandoning an ally in its time of need, while others implored it to stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin or risk having him try to conquer other U.S. allies – or even America itself. Republican senators continued to rail against the administration at a press conference Thursday afternoon.

“I just want to let people know that on March the sixth, the United States policy was green-lighting MiGs to Ukraine if Poland did it. Now that Poland's asked us to be part of the transfer system, we all of a sudden say no,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. “And here's what breaks my heart. This is dishonorable. It's one thing to be incompetent. It's another thing to be dishonorable.”

Fellow Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said the U.S. isn't sending the right message to Putin. “If we continue to blink every time Vladimir Putin says ‘Boo,’ he's not going to stop in Ukraine, he's not going to stop in Europe,” Cotton said.

CIA chief: Putin can’t ‘bottle up the truth indefinitely’

Russian President Vladimir Putin has masked the costs of the Ukraine invasion in his own country through the dominance of state media and the “strangulation of independent media” but won’t be able to hide the truth indefinitely, according to CIA Director William Burns. Burns, a former ambassador to the Russian federation, told the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday that many Russians have virtual private network accounts and retain access to YouTube and other sources of independent information.

As the damage mounts, Burns said Putin’s propaganda bubble would be punctured by the number of troops killed and wounded, the economic consequences of a worldwide trade embargo and the horrific scenes of hospitals and schools being bombed.

“I don’t believe that he is going to be able to seal Russians off entirely from the truth,” Burns said. “I don’t think he can bottle up the truth indefinitely.”

Haines: ‘No evidence’ Ukraine is pursuing biological, nuclear weapons

Ukraine is not pursuing biological or nuclear weapons, as Russia has falsely spread through propaganda, the top U.S. intelligence official told a Senate panel Thursday.

Russia has accused the U.S. of sponsoring biological weapons research in Ukraine since invading the neighboring country two weeks ago. Igor Konashenkov, a spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry, accused Ukraine of preparing a chemical attack. Avril Haines, the director of national intelligence, testified that Ukraine has a dozen biological research labs developing countermeasures and how to prevent the spread of pandemics, but not weapons labs.

“I want to be absolutely clear that we do not believe that Ukraine is pursuing biological or nuclear weapons. We’ve seen no evidence of that,” Haines told the Senate Intelligence Committee. “This influence campaign is completely consistent with longstanding Russian efforts to accuse the United States of sponsoring bio weapons work in the former Soviet Union. This is a classic move by the Russians.”

Borislav Bereza, former member of Ukrainian parliament and member of Ukrainian delegation in Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, posted a statement on social media warning that Russia could have a dangerous motive: ""This is actually an announcement and confession that Russia is planning to use chemical weapons in the near future.""

Harris: UN will investigate Russian assault on hospital

Vice President Kamala Harris said Russia’s airstrikes on hospitals were “atrocities of unimaginable proportion” and said the United Nations has a process to review and investigate to investigate such attacks. The World Health Organization says at least 18 attacks have been conducted on medical facilities since the invasion began Feb. 24.

Harris noted that “the eyes of the world are on this war and what Russia has done in terms of this aggression and these atrocities.”

Ukraine said Russian bombs severely damaged a maternity and children's hospital complex in the besieged city of Mariupol on Wednesday, killing at least three people including a child and wounding at least 17 more.

“Russians are committing war crimes,"" Polish President Duda said. “I hope that also in the future, it will be obvious for a court investigating those issues who bears responsibility for that.""

Kyiv mayor: Half the city has fled

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said Thursday that about 2 million people – half the population of the capital’s metropolitan area – have fled the city amid constant bombings from the Russian military. But he said the spirit of the city remains strong. Fighting is fierce, and the city has become a fortress, he said.

“Everyone says 'Nothing will happen, we will not surrender our city,'"" Klitschko said. ""I can repeat these words: The city stood, the people will stand. They won't give up. And the enemy won't pass.""

World champion British soccer team, owned by Russian, hit with sanctions

Roman Abramovich's attempt to sell British soccer team Chelsea has been halted after the Russian oligarch was sanctioned by the U.K. government. Last year, Forbes magazine estimated Chelsea's value at $3.2 billion. Abramovich put the team up for sale last week, shortly before his assets were frozen.

The team cannot sell game tickets or merchandise. The British government is allowing the team to play its games, including one scheduled for Thursday night. Ticket-holders will be allowed to attend matches and staff will be paid. Abramovich, who made his fortune in oil and aluminum, has not condemned Russia’s invasion.

Suffering increases for Ukrainians

Ukrainian leaders say civilians are increasingly suffering and dying as Russia's assault on Ukraine enters its third week. Multiple hospitals have been shelled, more than 2.3 million people have fled the country and more are struggling to leave. On the outskirts of Kyiv, hundreds of residents in towns occupied by Russian troops fled Wednesday. Some said they hadn't eaten in days, while others told harrowing tales of war.

“Occupiers came to our house and they were ready to shoot us,"" said Iuliia Bushinska, a Vorzel resident. ""They took away our house, our car, they took away our documents. So we need to start our life from the beginning. We survived things that I never experienced in my life.""",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/03/10/ukraine-russia-invasion-live-updates/9449550002/

After talks with Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Turkey, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said there had been ""no progress,"" even on a 24-hour ceasefire, although Lavrov said Moscow would keep talking. Moscow's military advances have sparked fears the capital Kyiv could soon be surrounded. Russian forces were encircling at least four major Ukrainian cities Thursday and armored vehicles rolled up to Kyiv's northeastern edge, where suburbs including Irpin and Bucha have endured days of heavy bombardment. Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said half the population had fled, adding that the city ""has been transformed into a fortress."" ""Every street, every building, every checkpoint has been fortified."" The besieged southern port city of Mariupol, meanwhile, came under fresh assault Thursday, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accusing Moscow of launching a ""tank attack"" targeting a humanitarian corridor where he had dispatched a convoy to try to get food, water and medicine into the city. The attack, which Zelensky described in a video statement as ""outright terror,"" came a day after the bombing of a children's hospital there that local officials said killed three people, including a young girl. Zelensky branded that attack a Russian ""war crime,"" a position backed by top Western officials. The White House slammed the ""barbaric"" use of force against civilians, while European Union foreign policy chief Joseph Borrell echoed Zelensky in calling the hospital attack a ""heinous war crime."" The Russian army claimed the hospital bombing was a ""staged provocation"" by Ukraine. Around 100,000 people have been evacuated in two days, Ukraine's government said Thursday. They managed to leave areas around the northeastern city of Sumy, sites northwest of Kyiv and the eastern city of Izyum. Moscow said it would also open daily humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians to Russian territory, but Kyiv has insisted no evacuation routes should lead to Russia.

'Apocalyptic' The UN Refugee Agency estimates more than 2.3 million refugees have left Ukraine since Russia shocked the world by invading its pro-Western neighbor on Feb. 24, and some 1.9 million Ukrainians have been internally displaced. Overall, at least 71 children have been killed and more than 100 wounded in Ukraine since the war began, said Lyudmyla Denisova, the Ukraine parliament's point person on human rights. The situation in Mariupol is particularly dire, with 10 days of constant attacks having left more than 1,200 civilians dead, according to the mayor. The UN said in addition to Mariupol, two other Ukrainian maternity hospitals had been attacked and destroyed, including one in Zhytomyr, west of Kyiv. Mariupol's city council reported new Russian air attacks Thursday on residential buildings and aid agencies say it faces an ""apocalyptic"" situation, with no water, power or heat for more than a week. The International Committee of the Red Cross said some residents had started fighting for food, and many had run out of drinking water. While the hospital attack triggered global outrage, Russian defense ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said there were no Russian air strikes in the area, and described the incident as a ""staged provocation"" to stoke anti-Russian sentiment. Lavrov, at the Turkey talks, claimed Moscow's operations have been purely defensive. Asked by a Turkish reporter if Moscow was planning to attack other nations, Lavrov replied ""we don't plan to attack other countries,"" claiming Russia ""did not attack Ukraine."" He said Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the operation as the situation in Ukraine ""posed a direct threat to the Russian Federation.""

'Nowhere to run' On Kyiv's northeastern edge, Ukrainian soldiers described fierce fighting for control of the main highway leading into the capital. An AFP team witnessed missile strikes in Velyka Dymerka just outside Kyiv's city limits. Ukrainian forces only had minimal presence in the village, which locals said witnessed heavy battles overnight. ""It's frightening, but what can you do?"" said Vasyl Popov, a 38-year-old advertising salesman. ""There is nowhere to really run or hide. We live here."" Across Ukraine, the invasion has so far destroyed about $100 billion in roads, bridges and businesses, said Oleg Ustenko, Zelensky's chief economic adviser. The conflict has raised fears of a nuclear accident in a country with two major plants now under Russian control: Chernobyl, location of the world's worst nuclear disaster, in 1986, and Zaporizhzhia, Europe's largest nuclear plant. The UN's atomic watchdog IAEA warned of a ""dire"" situation, with power out at the Chernobyl plant and all communications with Ukraine there severed. But after separate talks in Turkey Thursday with Russian and Ukrainian officials, the IAEA said Moscow and Kyiv were ""ready to work"" with the agency to ensure nuclear safety.

Russia on Thursday accused the United States of funding research into the development of biological weapons in Ukraine, which has faced an assault by tens of thousands of Russian troops since Feb. 24.

Both Washington and Kyiv have denied the allegations, with the United States saying they were a sign that Moscow could soon use the weapons itself.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky dismissed Russia's allegations in a video address on Thursday, saying, ""No one is developing any chemical or any other weapons of mass destruction"" in Ukraine.

Western states have charged that Russia is employing a ruse by accusing their opponents and the United states of developing biological and chemical weapons to lay the ground for their possible use in Ukraine — something Moscow has been accused of doing in Syria.

At a monthly Security Council meeting on the use of chemical weapons in Syria — a case that remains unresolved and continues to suffer from a UN-denounced lack of information from Damascus — both Washington and London raised Ukraine.

""The Russian Federation has repeatedly spread disinformation regarding Syria's repeated use of chemical weapons,"" said the deputy U.S. envoy to the UN, Richard Mills.

""The recent web of lies that Russia has cast in an attempt to justify the premeditated and unjustified war it has undertaken against Ukraine, should make clear, once and for all, that Russia also cannot be trusted when it talks about chemical weapon use in Syria.""

Mills' U.K. counterpart, James Kariuki, denounced Moscow's attack on Ukraine and said the ""parallels with Russian action in Syria are clear.""

""Regrettably, the comparison also extends to chemical weapons, as we see the familiar specter of Russian chemical weapons disinformation raising its head in Ukraine.""

In 2018, Moscow accused the United States of secretly conducting biological weapons experiments in a laboratory in Georgia, another former Soviet republic that, like Ukraine, has ambitions to join NATO and the European Union.
