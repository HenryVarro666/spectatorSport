1,878ff695-0833-42f5-869b-16604f01e3ef,['Voa News'],,"A Ukrainian camera operator killed in Russia's airstrike on a Kyiv TV tower is the first confirmed media fatality of the war.

Yevhenii Sakun, who worked for LIVE TV, was killed along with four others in Tuesday's strike, Ukrainian police confirmed Wednesday.

Ukrainian journalists and foreign correspondents covering the war paid tribute to Sakun on social media.

The international community, including the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Association for International Broadcasting (AIB), condemned the strike.

""Broadcasting must not be attacked and illegitimately obstructed as it is vital to inform people about the situation in their country,"" Teresa Ribeiro, the OSCE media freedom representative, said on Twitter.

AIB Chief Executive Simon Spanswick told VOA the strike ""appears to be an attempt to prevent Ukrainian citizens — men, women and children — having access to critical news and information at a time when their lives are in mortal danger.""

Two rockets hit the tower and an area close to the Babyn Yar Holocaust memorial at 6 p.m. local time Tuesday and temporarily took several stations off air.

The Kyiv Independent reported that eight channels resumed broadcasting about two hours after the attack.

Ukraine’s foreign minister described the strike near Babyn Yar as “barbaric,” the Reuters news agency reported.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has denied allegations of war crimes, telling reporters, ""Russian troops don't conduct any strikes against civilian infrastructure and residential areas."" However, extensive damage to residential buildings and other civilian structures has been documented by media including the Associated Press.

Media safety

The safety of media and free flow of news must be protected during the conflict, media watchdogs say.

""It is essential that media organizations in Ukraine are able to report on the situation,"" Spanswick told VOA in an email. ""The AIB calls on Russia to guarantee the safety and security of all journalists and colleagues in media organizations in Ukraine.""

The Paris-based Reporters Without Borders estimates around 1,000 foreign correspondents traveled to Ukraine to cover the war.

Two journalists working for the Danish newspaper Ekstra Bladet were evacuated this week after being fired on while on assignment.

Reporter Stefan Weichert and photojournalist Emil Filtenborg Mikkelsen, who have worked in Ukraine for two years, were injured when their vehicle was shot at on Saturday.

At the time, the journalists were traveling to the city of Okhtyrka to investigate a bombing.

Weichert was shot in the shoulder and Filtenborg in the legs, Weichert said on Twitter after the attack.

It is not clear who fired on the news crew.

Warning that the injuries could have been fatal, RSF's Jeanne Cavelier called on all sides to ""undertake to respect the security of journalists, who have an essential role to play in continuing to report the situation in the field.""

Separately, Poland on Monday detained Pablo González, a Spanish freelancer covering the exodus of Ukrainians fleeing the war. He filed some stories for VOA in 2020 and 2021.

Around 874,000 people have fled Ukraine, the AP reported.

""I've rarely seen such an incredibly fast-rising exodus of people,"" U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi told the Security Council on Monday.

González, who contributes to Spain's Público newspaper, was arrested and questioned in the Polish town of Rzeszów.

Ukrainian security previously detained González for several hours in Kyiv in early February. Ukraine at the time said González was reporting from military zones in Donbas without the necessary accreditation, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ).

""Authorities should ensure that reporters can cover refugee movements and other vital stories of public interest without fear of prosecution, detention, or harassment,"" CPJ's Europe representative, Attila Mong, said in a statement.

Russia has detained several journalists over their coverage of anti-war protests in Moscow and St. Petersburg.

The State's Duma is also proposing a bill imposing heavy penalties for sharing information that ""distorts the purpose, role and tasks"" of Russian armed forces.

Those convicted could face up to 15 years in prison, the Vienna-based International Press Institute reported.

""It is not hard to see how this law could immediately lead to the criminalization of journalists reporting on military losses, on the human rights abuses and potential war crimes,"" the IPI deputy director, Scott Griffen, said in a statement.

If passed, the law would add to the already challenging environment for Russia's independent media, Griffen said.

The Russian media regulator has already issued warnings to several outlets over their coverage of the war, and on Tuesday took two stations off air.

Editor's note: The seventh and ninth paragraphs have been updated to clarify that the rocket strikes did not directly hit the Holocaust memorial. This article has been further updated to note that González filed a few reports for VOA in 2020 and 2021.",https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-strike-on-kyiv-tv-tower-kills-journalist-/6467412.html

Russian forces escalated their attacks on crowded urban areas Tuesday, bombarding the central square in Ukraine’s second-biggest city, Kharkiv, and Kyiv’s main TV tower in what the country’s president called a blatant campaign of terror, according to an AP report.

“Nobody will forgive. Nobody will forget,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy vowed after the bloodshed on the square in Kharkiv.

Ukrainian authorities said five people were killed in the attack on the TV tower, which is a couple of miles from central Kyiv and a short walk from numerous apartment buildings. The AP reported that a TV control room and power substation were hit, and at least some Ukrainian channels briefly stopped broadcasting, officials said.

Zelenskyy’s office also reported a powerful missile attack on the site of the Babyn Yar Holocaust memorial, near the tower. A spokesman for the memorial said a Jewish cemetery at the site, where Nazi occupiers killed more than 33,000 Jews over two days in 1941, was damaged, but the extent would not be clear until daylight, as was reported by the AP.

At the same time, a 40-mile (64-kilometer) convoy of hundreds of Russian tanks and other vehicles advanced slowly on Kyiv in what the West feared was a bid by Russian President Vladimir Putin to topple Ukraine’s government and install a Kremlin-friendly regime, the report indicated. Russian forces pressed their assault on other towns and cities across the country, including the strategic ports of Odessa and Mariupol in the south.

In yet another development on Tuesday, AP reported that Ukraine has effectively asked that Russia be kicked off the internet.

In a letter sent Monday to the president of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, Ukraine’s deputy minister for digital transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, cited the “atrocious crimes” of Russia’s invasion, including its alleged breach of the Geneva Conventions in attacking civilian targets.

The AP reported that Federov said the crimes “have been made possible mainly due to the Russian propaganda machinery” and cited cyberattacks “from the Russian side” that have impeded the ability of Ukrainians and their government to communicate.

Federov asked that ICANN revoke, permanently or temporarily, the domains .ru and .su and shut down the root servers in Moscow and St. Petersburg that match domain names and numbers.

Back in the United States, President Biden is scheduled to deliver his first annual state of the union address on Tuesday evening.

Biden originally planned to address a panoply of domestic issues such as the improving state of affairs as it pertains to the coronavirus as well as speaking about domestic policy priorities and offering hope for the skyrocketing inflation rates that Americans have been grappling with.

Now that Russia has attacked Ukraine, the speech will focus on the heroism displayed by the Ukrainian people in the face of existential peril as well as the intrepid leadership of their president Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that President Biden will speak to “the importance of the United States as a leader in the world, standing up for values, standing up for global norms. The AP reported that Biden spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy by phone a few hours before his speech at the Capitol.

In an interview with CNN and Reuters, Zelenskyy said he urged Biden to deliver a strong and “useful” message about Russia’s invasion. Ahead of the speech, the White House announced that Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova would join first lady Jill Biden in the galleries to watch Biden’s address, according to the AP report.

In another development, the number of Ukrainians who have fled their country for Poland, Moldova, Romania and Hungary has swelled to over 500,000 and the number keeps increasing. Currently, only women and children are permitted to board trains to other countries as men in Ukraine between the ages of 18-60 have been ordered to stay and fight the Russians.

A UN representative said the refugee crisis could swell to approximately four million people if the battles keep raging and peace has not been established. Many Ukrainians are following their government’s orders and are making Molotov cocktails and arming themselves with government owned rifles that have been distributed.

The media has made note of the high level of patriotism and sacrifice of the Ukrainian people in the fact of such egregious adversity.

On Monday, the first round of talks aimed at stopping the fighting between Ukraine and Russia ended with no agreement except to keep talking, while an increasingly isolated Moscow ran into unexpectedly fierce resistance on the ground and economic havoc at home, according to an AP report.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed Russian soldiers in Ukraine: “More than 4,500 of your soldiers have been killed. Put down your weapons, do not trust your commanders and this propaganda. Just save yourself and leave.”

Six days into Russia’s invasion, the Kremlin again raised the specter of nuclear war, while an embattled Ukraine moved to solidify its ties to the West by applying to join the European Union — a largely symbolic move unlikely to sit well with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has long accused the U.S. of trying to pull Ukraine out of Moscow’s orbit.

The AP reported that top Putin aide and head of the Russian delegation, Vladimir Medinsky, said that the talks lasted nearly five hours and that the envoys “found certain points on which common positions could be foreseen.” He said they agreed to continue the discussions in the coming days.

As the talks wrapped up, several blasts could be heard in Kyiv, though few details were immediately known. Russian troops, while attacking on multiple fronts, continued to advance slowly on the capital city of nearly 3 million people, as was reported by the AP.

A 17-mile (25-kilometer) convoy consisting of hundreds of armored vehicles, tanks, artillery and support vehicles was 17 miles (25 kilometers) from the center of Kyiv, according to satellite imagery from the Maxar company. People in Kyiv lined up for groceries after the end of a weekend curfew, standing beneath a building with a gaping hole blown in its side.

Also on Monday, Israel National News reported that Israel’s Ambassador to Ukraine confirmed that an Israeli Jew was shot and killed near Kyiv during an attempt to leave the city and reach the border of Ukraine.

The victim was identified as Roman Brodsky a 37-year-old man who was shot while traveling from Kyiv to join the secure bus convoys to leave the borders of Ukraine. The man’s family has been notified of his death, as was reported by INN.

Israel’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement: that Brodsky “was killed in Ukraine while part of a convoy of vehicles on their way to the border with Moldova. His vehicle was shot and he was killed.”

“The director of the Department of Israelis Abroad spoke with his wife, who is currently in Ukraine with the deceased’s children. His parents, who live in Israel, received the difficult message. The Foreign Ministry wishes to express its sincere condolences to the family in its difficult time and will continue to assist the family as much as possible,” the ministry said.

INN reported that Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett stated: “I have sadly received the sad news of the death of Roman Brodsky, an Israeli citizen, in Ukraine.”

“On behalf of all the citizens of Israel, I would like to send my condolences to the wife, children and family of the late Roman, in Israel and in Ukraine. We continue to do everything we can to help Israelis return home,” Bennett said.

Also on Monday, Zelenskyy requested that his country be granted immediate full membership in the European Union, according to the INN report. The US has decided to suspend embassy activities in Minsk, the capital of Belarus. A senior US official has said that if Belarus continues to assist in Russian aggression in Ukraine, they will also face the consequences.

The Ukrainian government on Monday afternoon reported that dozens of people had been killed in extensive bombings in Kharkiv, the second largest city in the country, as was reported by INN. A senior Ukrainian government official said that hundreds of people were injured in the attack.

Zelenskyy said 16 children have been killed and 45 injured in the past four days. “We will release prisoners with military backgrounds if they agree to enlist in the war against Russia,” he said.

The AP reported that video from Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, showed residential areas being shelled, with apartment buildings shaken by repeated, powerful blasts. Flashes of fire could be seen along with gray plumes of smoke.

Footage released by the government from Kharkiv depicted what appeared to be a home with water gushing from a pierced ceiling. On the floor lay what looked like an undetonated projectile. The AP reported that authorities in Kharkiv said at least seven people had been killed and dozens injured. They warned that casualties could be far higher.

In Israel, one hundred tons of humanitarian aid equipment is being prepared to be sent to Ukraine, including water purification systems, emergency kits for water supply, tents, blankets, sleeping bags, coats, medicines and medical equipment.

INN reported that former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and Foreign Minister Yair Lapid to exercise caution with regards to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

“These are sensitive and complex days in the global arena. On such days, caution should be exercised. Unfortunately, in recent days we have heard too many unnecessary statements and too many false predictions,” Netanyahu said at the start of the weekly Likud faction meeting Monday, according to the INN report.

“I call on the government to act responsibly: To talk less about what should not be talked about and to deal much more with the real existential threat to our security, and this is of course Iran’s return in the near future to the dangerous nuclear agreement. With regards to this matter specifically, Lapid and Bennett do not say anything and do nothing,” the opposition leader claimed.

Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid vowed Monday that Israel will back a United Nations resolution against Russia’s invasion of the Ukraine, and promised Israeli support for the country, calling it an Israeli ‘obligation’.

“Today is the fifth day of the war in Ukraine,” Lapid said Monday afternoon. “The UN will vote today or tomorrow on a resolution condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Israel will cosponsor and vote in favor of the resolution, together with a decisive majority of the world’s countries.”

INN reported that Lapid’s declaration Monday is the first time Israel has publicly committed to backing the UN resolution against the Russian invasion.

Hitherto, Israel has avoided direct criticism of Russia, or condemnation of the invasion, even as Israel voiced support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, according to the INN report.

On Sunday, Lapid made similar comments during a cabinet meeting, telling ministers Israel should vote in favor of the UN resolution against the Russian invasion.

In his statement Monday, INN reported that Lapid hinted that Israel could join other countries imposing sanctions on Moscow.

“Israel is thoroughly examining the potential impact of sanctions on Russia. We established an inter-ministry team that will examine the effects and consequences of the sanctions on the Israeli economy and policy.”

“At the same time, Israel will be part of the international effort to assist the people of Ukraine. We have a moral, historical, and ethical obligation to be part of this effort. Today and tomorrow, three planes will depart Israel for Ukraine with a large shipment of emergency aid. Thousands of coats, blankets, and sleeping bags, medical equipment, tents, and water purification equipment.”

Meanwhile, in Ukraine, messages aimed at the advancing Russian soldiers popped up on billboards, bus stops and electronic traffic signs across the capital, as was reported by the AP. Some used profanity to encourage Russians to leave. Others appealed to their humanity.

Fighting raged in other towns and cities scattered across the country. The strategic port city of Mariupol, on the Sea of Azov, is “hanging on,” said Zelenskyy adviser Oleksiy Arestovich. An oil depot was reported bombed in the eastern city of Sumy, according to the AP report.

The Russian military has denied targeting residential areas despite abundant evidence of shelling of homes, schools and hospitals, as was reported by the AP

In the resort town of Berdyansk, on the Azov Sea, dozens of protesters chanted angrily in the main square against their Russian occupiers, who captured the town Sunday. The AP reported that they described the soldiers as exhausted young conscripts.

As the invasion dragged on slower than many in the West expected, with the outgunned Ukrainians mounting stiff resistance, the Kremlin reported that its land, air and sea nuclear forces had been put on high alert following Putin’s weekend order. Stepping up his rhetoric, Putin denounced the U.S. and its allies as an “empire of lies.”

Asked on Monday if US citizens should be concerned about the possibility of nuclear war, President Biden answered, “No.”

For many, the nuclear high alert stirred up memories of the Cold War, and fears that the West could be drawn into direct conflict with Russia, as was reported by the AP. But a senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United States had yet to see any appreciable change in Russia’s nuclear posture.

Also on Monday, the US expelled 12 Russian diplomats at the United Nations over national security concerns, according to a Reuters report.

The U.S. mission to the United Nations described the Russian diplomats as “intelligence operatives” who had been “engaging in espionage activities that are adverse to our national security.”

“This action has been in development for several months,” said U.S. mission spokesperson Olivia Dalton, as was reported by Reuters.

Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told reporters the diplomats had been asked to leave by March 7. He said Russia would respond to the move “because it’s diplomatic practice.”

Reuters reported that Nebenzia then raised the issue at the start of a U.N. Security Council meeting on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, describing the U.S. move as “hostile” and a violation of its commitments as host of the U.N. headquarters in New York.

U.S. Deputy U.N. Ambassador Richard Mills responded: “Those diplomats that have been asked to leave the United States were engaged in activities that were not in accordance with their resp onsibilities and obligations as diplomats,” as was reported by Reuters.

He said they had been asked to leave “so they do not harm the national security of the host country,” adding that the decision was taken in full accordance with the U.N. headquarters agreement.

As far-reaching Western sanctions on Russian banks and other institutions took hold, the ruble plummeted, and Russia’s Central Bank scrambled to shore it up, as did Putin, signing a decree restricting foreign currency.

On Monday, Reuters reported that Nasdaq Inc (NDAQ.O) and Intercontinental Exchange Inc’s (ICE.N) NYSE had temporarily halted trading in the stocks of Russia-based companies listed on their exchanges, their websites showed.

The halts were due to regulatory concerns as the exchanges seek more information following economic sanctions imposed on Russia because of its invasion of Ukraine, people familiar with the matter said.

Reuters reported that the Nasdaq-listed stocks halted are: Nexters Inc , HeadHunter Group PLC (HHR.O), Ozon Holdings PLC (OZON.O), Qiwi PLC (QIWI.O) and Yandex (YNDX.O).

Trading halts for disclosure of material information on Nasdaq are instituted to ensure that “material information is fairly and adequately disseminated to the investing public and the marketplace, and to provide investors with the opportunity to evaluate the information in making investment decisions,” according to the exchange’s rulebook.

The NYSE-listed stocks halted were Cian PLC (CIAN.N), Mechel PAO and Mobile TeleSystems PAO .

NYSE-owner ICE also said it would not add any new debt issuances from sanctioned Russian entities to its fixed income indices, and that affected existing debt would be removed on March 31, as per the Reuters report.

The AP reported that in Moscow, people lined up to withdraw cash as sanctions drove up prices and threatened to reduce the standard of living for millions of ordinary Russians.

In yet another blow to Russia’s economy, the oil giant Shell said it is pulling out of the country because of the invasion, announcing it will withdraw from its joint ventures with state-owned gas company Gazprom and other entities and end its involvement in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project between Russia and Europe, as was reported by the AP.

The economic sanctions, ordered by the U.S. and other allies, were just one contributor to Russia’s growing status as a pariah country. The AP reported that Russian airliners are now banned from European airspace, Russian media is restricted in some countries, and some high-tech products can no longer be exported to the country. On Monday, in a major blow to a soccer-mad nation, Russian teams were suspended from all international soccer.

Bodies of the five victims of a rocket strike on Kyiv's television tower were on Wednesday morning piled into a van and removed from the site by police - as the capital's mayor Vitali Klitschko warned that Russian forces were 'getting closer'.

Klitschko also today defiantly vowed 'we will fight' to defend the city, amid fears it could soon be battered by artillery fire from a 40-mile long death convoy parked nearby.

An opening salvo on Tuesday night struck the Ukrainian capital's largest TV tower and damaged a nearby Holocaust memorial, killing five bystanders in the process. Hours later, US intelligence said the huge Russian convoy appears to have stalled near Kyiv though it could just be regrouping for a more-determined attack.

Klitschko said that fighting is still ongoing in the cities of Bucha and Hostomel, on the outskirts of Kyiv, where a large number of destroyed Russian vehicles were pictured on Wednesday. He implored people in the city 'not to lose endurance', saying all critical infrastructure is still running and humanitarian supplies are being handed out.

'I ask everyone, for security reasons, not to go outside unnecessarily. At the alarm - go to the shelters,' he said. 'The enemy is gathering forces closer to the capital... We are preparing and will defend Kyiv!'

Images showed areas of the city damaged in overnight strikes, as attacks resumed on Ukrainian cities elsewhere in the country - with paratroopers dropping into Kharkiv on Wednesday morning as missiles struck a university in the city having apparently missed a nearby police headquarters.

Biden used his first State of the Union address to highlight the resolve of a reinvigorated Western alliance that has worked to rearm the Ukrainian military and adopt tough sanctions, which he said have left Russian President Vladimir Putin 'isolated in the world more than he has ever been.'

'Throughout our history we've learned this lesson - when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos,' Biden said. 'They keep moving. And the costs and threats to America and the world keep rising.'

As the seventh day of the war dawned Wednesday, Russia found itself increasingly isolated, beset by the sanctions that have thrown its economy into turmoil and left the country practically friendless, apart from a few nations like China, Belarus and North Korea. Leading Russian bank Sberbank announced Wednesday that it is pulling out of European markets amid the tightening Western sanctions.

As fighting raged, the humanitarian situation worsened. Roughly 660,000 people have fled Ukraine, and countless others have taken shelter underground.

The death toll was less clear, with neither Russia nor Ukraine releasing the number of troops lost. The U.N. human rights office said it has recorded 136 civilian deaths, though the actual toll is surely far higher.

One senior Western intelligence official estimated that 5,000 Russian soldiers had been captured or killed in the biggest ground war in Europe since World War II.

Many military experts worry that Russia may be shifting tactics. Moscow's strategy in Chechnya and Syria was to use artillery and air bombardments to pulverize cities and crush fighters' resolve.

Britain's Defense Ministry said it had seen an increase in Russian air and artillery strikes on populated urban areas over the past two days. It also said Kharkiv and Mariupol were encircled by Russian forces and that troops had reportedly moved into the center of a third city, Kherson. Russia's Defense Ministry said it had seized Kherson, though the claim could not be confirmed.

Ukrainian authorities said five people were killed in the attack on the TV tower near central Kyiv. A TV control room and power substation were hit, and at least some Ukrainian channels briefly stopped broadcasting, officials said.

Zelenskyy's office reported that the site of the Babi Yar Holocaust memorial, which is adjacent to the TV tower, was also hit. A spokesman for the memorial said a Jewish cemetery at the site, where Nazi occupiers killed more than 33,000 Jews over two days in 1941, was damaged, but the extent would not be clear until daylight.

Zelenskyy expressed outrage Wednesday at the attack on Babi Yar and concern that other historically significant and religious sites, such as St. Sophia's Cathedral, could be targeted.

'This is beyond humanity. Such missile strike means that for many Russians our Kyiv is absolutely foreign,' Zelenskyy said in a speech posted on Facebook. 'They have orders to erase our history, our country and all of us.'

Russia previously told people living near transmission facilities used by Ukraine's intelligence agency to leave their homes. But Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov claimed Wednesday that the airstrike on the TV tower did not hit any residential buildings. He did not address the reported deaths or the damage to Babi Yar.

In Kharkiv, with a population of about 1.5 million, at least six people were killed when the region's administrative building on Freedom Square was hit with what was believed to be a missile. The Slovenian Foreign Ministry said its consulate in Kharkiv, located in another large building on the square, was destroyed.

The attack on the square - the nucleus of public life in the city - was seen by many Ukrainians as brazen evidence that the Russian invasion wasn't just about hitting military targets but also about breaking their spirit.

The bombardment blew out windows and walls of buildings that ring the square, which was piled high with debris and dust. Inside one building, chunks of plaster were scattered, and doors lay across hallways.

Another Russian airstrike hit a residential area in the city of Zhytomyr. Ukraine's emergency services said Tuesday's strike killed at least two people, burned three homes and broke the windows in a nearby hospital.

About 85 miles west of Kyiv, Zhytomyr is the home of the elite 95th Air Assault Brigade, which may have been the intended target. In the southern port city of Mariupol, the mayor said the attacks were relentless.

'They have been flattening us non-stop for 12 hours now,' Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying. 'We cannot even take the wounded from the streets, from houses and apartments today, since the shelling does not stop.'

Boychenko referred to Russia's actions as a 'genocide' - using the same word that Putin has used to justify the invasion.

Zelenskyy has mocked Russia's claim that it is going after only military targets, noting that 16 children were killed on Monday.

'Where are the children? What kind of military factories do they work at?' Zelenskyy said.

Human Rights Watch said it documented a cluster bomb attack outside a hospital in Ukraine's east in recent days. Residents also reported the use of such weapons in Kharkiv and Kiyanka village. The Kremlin denied using cluster bombs.

Cluster bombs shoot smaller 'bomblets' over a large area, many of which fail to explode until long after they've been dropped. If their use is confirmed, that would represent a new level of brutality in the war.

As the fighting raged, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that a Russian would be ready to resume talks Wednesday evening with Ukrainian officials, a day after Zelenskyy said Russia should stop bombing first.

The first talks between Russia and Ukraine since the invasion were held Monday, but ended with only an agreement to talk again.

Moscow made new threats of escalation Tuesday, days after raising the specter of nuclear war. A top Kremlin official warned that the West's 'economic war' against Russia could turn into a 'real one.'

Inside Russia, a top radio station critical of the Kremlin was taken off the air after authorities threatened to shut it down over its coverage of the invasion. Among other things, the Kremlin is not allowing the fighting to be referred to as an 'invasion' or 'war.'

Ukraine's Defense Ministry said it had evidence that Belarus, a Russian ally, is preparing to send troops into Ukraine. A ministry statement posted early Wednesday on Facebook said the Belarusian troops have been brought into combat readiness and are concentrated close to Ukraine's northern border. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has said his country has no plans to join the fight.

A senior U.S. defense official said that Russia's military progress - including by the massive convoy - has slowed, plagued by logistical and supply problems. Some Russian military columns have run out of gas and food, the official said, and morale has suffered as a result.

Overall, the Russian military has been stalled by fierce resistance on the ground and a surprising inability to completely dominate Ukraine's airspace.

The immense convoy, with vehicles packed together along narrow roads, would seemingly be 'a big fat target' for Ukrainian forces, the senior Western intelligence official said on condition of anonymity. But it also showed Russia was comfortable that they wouldn't come attack by air, rocket or missile, the official said.

The rocket attack took out broadcasting hardware, raising fears that Moscow is attempting to knock out the city's communications infrastructure. Ahead of the strikes, Russia's military urged nearby residents to flee.

The attack, along with a beef-up of assaults on other key cities, brings the Russian invasion right into the heart of the nation.

Another rocket hit a private maternity clinic near the capital Kyiv on Tuesday, leaving the clinic damaged but still standing, according to the Adonis maternity clinic chief Vitaliy Gyrin's Facebook post. Separately, a military strike tore through two apartment blocks in a town west of Kyiv.

As the rockets hit Kyiv on Tuesday, a 40-mile Russian convoy of tanks, armored vehicles and towed artillery was headed toward the Ukrainian capital, according to satellite images from Maxar Technologies.

However, a US official said the convoy has been stalled due to fuel supply issues. The Russian advance on Kyiv remains ""basically... where it was yesterday"" according to a senior defense official, who also said there were signs that they were running out of food.

While Ukraine mounts a defense against the Russian onslaught, some 677,000 people have fled the country in ""less than a week,"" with 150,000 fleeing in the last 24 hours alone, according to the United Nations.

The UN has also raised concerns for the millions of people still in the country, with UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths saying this is the ""darkest hour"" for the people of Ukraine.

""Families with small children are hunkered down in basements and subway stations or running for their lives to the terrifying sound of explosions and wailing sirens,"" he said in a statement.

In his State of the Union speech Tuesday, US President Joe Biden said President Vladimir Putin ""badly miscalculated"" when he invaded Ukraine and announced a ban on Russian aircraft from US airspace which he said would further isolate Russia and squeeze its economy.

He reiterated that US forces would not deploy to the Ukraine -- instead, they were deployed to Europe to defend America's NATO allies ""in the event that Putin decides to keep moving west.""

In an exclusive interview with CNN and Reuters from a bunker ahead of the speech, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reiterated calls for the US and NATO to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine or put boots on the ground, saying ""I do believe that leaders do have to support democratic countries and they have to help them.""

Asked if he felt Ukraine was wasting its time by talking with Russia, he said: ""We'll see."" On Monday, Ukrainian and Russian officials met for the first time since Moscow began their assault last week.

Biden and Zelensky held a 30-minute phone conversation on Tuesday. Biden, the White House said, ""underscored the United States' sustained help for Ukraine, including ongoing deliveries of security assistance, economic support, and humanitarian aid.""

The attack in Kyiv came just hours after the Russian military threatened to carry out strikes in Kyiv, though it said its targets were Ukrainian State Security Agency facilities and the country's psychological operations unit, according to a statement reported by Russian state media TASS.

In videos and social media posts shared soon after the strike, plumes of smoke were seen swirling around the red-and-white steel TV tower building, which is located near the city's Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center (BYHMC).

""Putin seeks to distort and manipulate the Holocaust to justify an illegal invasion of a sovereign democratic country is utterly abhorrent,"" said BYHMC Advisory Board Chair Natan Sharanksy, adding that it is ""symbolic"" that the attack happened In a statement, BYHMC saidthe remembrance site was struck by Russian forces. ""Putin seeks to distort and manipulate the Holocaust to justify an illegal invasion of a sovereign democratic country is utterly abhorrent,"" said BYHMC Advisory Board Chair Natan Sharanksy, adding that it is ""symbolic"" that the attack happened where an estimated 70,000 to 100,000 people were shot by the Nazis.

Russian forces also attacked key cities in Ukraine from several sides, scaling up its bombardment of Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, in the northeast and breaking through a heavily contested port city in the south.

Russia's actions on Tuesday mark a far less restrained bombing campaign, raising concerns that more civilians could be hit in strikes. The UN says that at least 102 civilians have been killed across the country and 304 injured, though those figures are likely to underestimate the true toll.

US officials also warned that the sheer breadth of Russian firepower could overwhelm Ukrainian resistance.

Russia's military is far bigger and more powerful than Ukraine's by just about every measure, but Ukraine's allies, including the European Union, are scrambling to send more weapons into the country to aid its defense.

On Tuesday, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko warned that ""the enemy is on the outskirts of the capital,"" but the Ukrainian military is ""preparing to defend Kyiv.""

""Fortifications and checkpoints have been built at the entrances to the city. I ask everyone to keep calm. Do not go outside unnecessarily and stay in shelters in case of alarm,"" he said in a video message.

The Russian convoy is seen along with smoke rising from what appears to be burning homes, northwest of Invankiv, Ukraine.

In an interview with CNN Tuesday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told CNN that Russia ""dominates in the sky"" while Ukrainian forces have sought to destroy ground forces headed towards Ukrainian cities.

""Our pilots are fighting fiercely against them, but we also have losses,"" Kuleba said. ""So the Russians use their fighting jets and bombers to attack our cities and we need to counter this threat.""

He added, ""This are the two most urgent requests that we lodged with our partners.""

Zelensky's plea

EU chief Ursula von der Leyen, left, applauds in Brussels as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky makes a speech.

President Zelensky made an impassioned plea to the European leaders earlier Tuesday to grant Ukraine immediate membership to the EU, saying his country was fighting for survival.

Zelensky's plea came as Russia accelerated strikes on Kharkiv, which was rocked by a large explosion that incinerated cars, blew out windows and destroyed a large government building in the main Freedom Square.

Emergency services said at least 10 people were killed and 24 injured in the strike, which Zelensky described as an ""act of terror"" on civilians in a Facebook post.

Late Monday, at least five separate residential areas in Kharkiv were hit by rockets, according to CNN analysis of social media videos.

During a trip to Poland on Tuesday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson called the Russian invasion ""worse than our predictions,"" pointing to attacks like those seen in Kharkiv's neighborhoods.

""It is clear that Vladimir Putin is prepared to use barbaric and indiscriminate tactics against innocent civilians to bomb tower blocks, to send missiles into tower blocks, to kill children, as we're seeing in increasing numbers,"" he said.

A Kharkiv resident named Tetyana, 66, told CNN that a shell hit her house early Tuesday morning, shattering its windows.

Tetyana -- who sleeps in her shoes and coat since the invasion began -- ran to her basement where her relative Oleg told her that his car had burned down and ""the school in the yard was totally destroyed.""

This school was destroyed as a result of a fight not far from Kharkiv's city center on February 28.

The day before, CNN confirmed five residential areas in the city had been hit by military strikes on Monday using videos shared on social media.

Dramatic video, taken by a surveillance-type camera at an apartment complex on Velyka Kil'tseva St, shows repeated explosions from one strike that landed in a parking lot and walkway.

The intense shelling -- at least eight explosions are seen but there are more heard -- lasts for 20 seconds. As the munitions rain down, people are seen running as the explosions dot the ground: one individual falls to the ground as explosions surround them. A parked car explodes after taking a direct hit.

On Klochkivska Street, graphic videos shows blood and body parts outside of a small grocery store.

""It's horrible, guys,"" a voice in the video says. ""Right in my part of the city. Boots and leg were removed, here's parts of brain.""

Russian forces enter port city

Russian-backed forces have also made gains down South. In the port city of Kherson -- west of Mariupol and north of the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014 -- Ukrainian defensive lines appear to have fallen and Russian military vehicles have been seen driving inside the city.

The leader of the self-declared separatist region in Donetsk said he expects his forces to surround Mariupol on Tuesday. The town of Volnovakha, half-way between Mariupol and Donetsk, was almost completely surrounded, Denis Pushilin added.

Ukraine has accused Russia of committing war crimes by targeting civilians, and on Monday, the International Criminal Court said it would open an investigation into Russia's invasion of Ukraine -- a move that was welcomed by Kyiv.

The Kremlin has denied the accusations, repeatedly saying it is not targeting civilian areas.

A humanitarian crisis

As bitter fighting takes place across the country, many Ukrainians are fleeing the country at a pace that could turn into ""Europe's largest refugee crisis this century,"" the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) said Tuesday.

Some 677,000 people have fled Ukraine in ""less than a week"" with 150,000 having left in the last 24 hours alone, UNHCR's deputy High Commissioner Kelly Clements said Tuesday. Clements said the UNHCR launched ""emergency appeals"" to donors for $1.7 billion in humanitarian support for people in Ukraine and refugees.

Many of them are women who have had to leave behind their fathers and husbands as men aged 18 to 60 are banned from leaving the country.

""Families with small children are hunkered down in basements and subway stations or running for their lives to terrifying sounds of explosions and wailing sirens,"" UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths said. ""Casualty figures are rising fast. This is the darkest hour for the people of Ukraine.""

Foreigners are also desperately trying to leave the country, and some have found themselves waiting in the cold to get out. Others have endured racism from border guards.

Some Ukrainians have opted to stay and join the resistance. Volunteers are pouring into the capital, where there's a feeling of defiance among many. Some are gathering bottles to make Molotov cocktails.

A confrontation between Ukrainian civilians and Russian forces in the town of Konotop ended with a defiant message from the town's mayor and — according to the Ukrainian side — an agreement to preserve peace.

Konotop is a small town in the northeastern region of Sumy.

Social media video verified by CNN shows a Russian delegation emerging from city hall to be confronted by an angry crowd. One of the Russians appears to hold up two hand grenades as he returns to his vehicle, while onlookers shout abuse and jostle the Russians, chanting ""shame.""

His vehicle and a Russian infantry fighting vehicle then left.

The Sumy regional authorities reported that “in Konotop, the invaders came to negotiate with city authorities. According to Mayor Artem Semenikhin, the Russian military came out and told him to surrender the city. They threatened to fire artillery on the city.”

But the mayor “explicitly defied threats,” the authorities said.

Video of the mayor addressing a crowd showed him saying: “They are giving me these terms now: If we start resisting, they will shell the city with artillery. If you vote for it, we will fight back! Who votes to fight back?”

There is a shout of approval, while some in the crowd said women and children should be evacuated.

“I'm voting for fighting back. But the decision has to be taken by everyone, because the artillery is aimed at us,” he said.

Later, Dmytro Zhyvytsky, head of Sumy region military administration, said an arrangement had been reached with the Russians.

“The conversation between my representative from the military administration and Russians in Konotop lasted about 12 minutes,” Zhyvytsky said.

“The agreement is as follows: There can be no question of any change of government. They are interested in law and order. There won’t be any movement of troops. The Ukrainian flag is in its place,” he said.

“There is an agreement that we will not shoot and there will be no mutual provocations. They remain in their positions. Unobstructed passage of public transport and services, ambulances, vehicles with food, humanitarian goods will be provided,” he continued.

“To ensure security in the city and control, our volunteers will additionally build checkpoints in Konotop,” he said.

There has been no word from the Russian side about such an agreement.

The BBC said this week that it would use radio frequencies that can travel for long distances and be accessible on portable radios to broadcast its World Service news in English for four hours a day in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, and in parts of Russia.

“It’s often said truth is the first casualty of war,” Tim Davie, director-general of the BBC, said in a statement. “In a conflict where disinformation and propaganda is rife, there is a clear need for factual and independent news people can trust.”

On Tuesday, Russian projectiles struck the main radio and television tower in Kyiv. Oleksii Reznikov, Ukraine’s defense minister, wrote on Twitter that Russia’s goal was “to break the resistance of the Ukrainian people and army,” starting with “a breakdown of connection” and “the spread of massive FAKE messages that the Ukrainian country leadership has agreed to give up.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/03/business/media/bbc-shortwave-radio-ukraine.html

A video released recently shows what Putin was perhaps insinuating.

On February 25, Putin urged Ukrainians to rise up against their government, which he said was made up of “neo-Nazis”, a charge Kyiv strongly rejected.

The National Guard of Ukraine posted a video on Twitter that purportedly shows Azov fighters greasing bullets with pig fat, a message targeted at battle-hardened Muslim Chechens deployed by Russia to the country.

Azov is a far-right all-volunteer infantry military regiment accused of harboring neo-Nazi and white supremacist ideology, reported Al Jazeera. They first fought with the Ukrainian army against pro-Russian separatists in the country’s east in 2014, and have subsequently been integrated into the regular armed forces.

On the other hand, the Chechens are members of the Russian National Guard Squad, notorious for battling insurgencies with severe tactics. The dreaded Chechen fighters came to the limelight during Russia’s two devastating wars against them in the 1990s that ultimately led to the establishment of a pro-Moscow regime.

Being an ally of Russia, the Chechen leader, Ramzan Kadyrov sent his troops to Ukraine as reinforcement for Putin’s troops.

A man who purportedly belongs to the Azov fighters is seen dipping bullets into what appears to be pig grease as he addresses the Chechen fighters in the footage. The EurAsian Times could not independently verify the video.

He says: “Dear Muslim brothers. In our country, you will not go to heaven. You will not be allowed into heaven. Go home, please. Here, you will encounter trouble. Thank you for your attention, goodbye.”

The Chenchan military is predominantly Muslim which is the Azov motivation to humiliate them with pig grease, prohibited in Islam. Chechens have been employed by Russia to hunt down terrorists in Syria and to fight in other countries, including Georgia. When conflicts in Donbas erupted in 2014, they were also sent to battle the Pro-Russian separatists there.

Is Russia Battling Neo-Nazis?

Despite their integration into the regular military, Azov fighters are said to have maintained to wear the Wolfsangel insignia worn by several Nazi divisions during World War II.

The Azov Battalion is part of the Ukrainian National Guard’s special operations force. The unit is based in Mariupol, on the shore of the Azov Sea.

The Azov Battalion has been branded a neo-Nazi group and “a far-right Ukrainian militia”.

Azov battalion fighters have been seen on German television wearing helmets with swastikas and “the ‘SS runes’ of Hitler’s iconic black-uniformed elite corps,” and some of the soldiers have been reported to have SS tattoos on other occasions.

The presence of such groups within the Ukrainian military was cited by Russian President Vladimir Putin as a basis for beginning his so-called “special military operation… to de-militarize and de-Nazify Ukraine.” In a press conference, the Russian military also claimed that “Nazi Battalions” are a substantial part of the opposition to their offensive.

Kadyrov, the strongman leader of Chechnya and a close Putin supporter, announced on February 26 that Chechen fighters had been sent in Ukraine and urged Ukrainians to overthrow their government.

However, according to reports emerging out of Ukraine, Putin’s decision to send much-feared Chechen to Ukraine may have backfired at first.

The soldiers may have been deployed to assassinate or kidnap key Ukrainian officials, according to observers, but those early attempts were thwarted by Ukraine’s military, said Fox News.

Their numbers have been said to range from 7,000 to tens of thousands. According to Reuters, Kadyrov stated that he supports Putin’s decision to invade and that his troops “would carry out his commands under any conditions”.

Thousands of Chechen fighters had earlier gathered in the main plaza of the region’s capital Grozny in a demonstration of willingness to fight in Ukraine, according to a brief video released by the state-backed RT on February 25.

According to some unconfirmed reports, Ukrainian forces destroyed 56 Chechen tanks and killed one of their high-ranking commanders en route to Kyiv. While the Chechen leader disputed his commander’s death, commentators said it might be a problem for Putin even thus early in the conflict, given the huge fight being waged by Ukrainian military forces against the Russian aggressor.

No Breakthrough In Sight

Ever since the invasion was launched, several casualties have been reported on both sides. Ukraine has claimed that about 5,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in combat. Putin’s ally Kadyrov also admitted to losses in Russia’s surprise invasion of Ukraine, stated The Moscow Times.

Russia’s Defense Ministry acknowledged on February 27 for the first time that there were “killed and injured” soldiers among its troops, but did not specify how many.

At least 10 people were killed and 35 wounded in rocket attacks on Ukraine’s second-largest city Kharkiv killed, Interior Ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko was quoted as saying by Reuters.

According to Al Jazeera, at least 70 Ukrainian soldiers were killed in a Russian artillery attack on a military base in Okhtyrka on February 28. Satellite images reveal that a huge Russian military convoy is inching closer to the capital Kyiv, where a television tower was blown apart allegedly by Russian forces.

The first round of talks between Russia and Ukraine hosted by Belarus did not yield any results, indicating that de-escalation is easier said than done. As of now, it looks like Russia is hellbent on capturing the capital city even as armed civilians and far-right militias are fully prepared to fight the invading troops, alongside the Ukrainian military.",https://eurasiantimes.com/ukraine-uses-pig-fat-bullets-to-counter-russian-aggression/
