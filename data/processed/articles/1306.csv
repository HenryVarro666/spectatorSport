Biden also said he would support an effort to expel Russia from the G-20 group of economies.

The president spoke after a marathon of summit meetings with the European Union, G-7 partners and NATO allies.

""We will respond if he uses it,"" Biden said, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin . ""The nature of the response depends on the nature of the use.""

President Joe Biden said Thursday that NATO would respond ""in kind"" if Russia uses weapons of mass destruction in Ukraine.

""I think that China understands that its economic futures much more closely tied to the West than it is to Russia,"" said Biden. ""And so I am hopeful that he does not get engaged,"" Biden said, referring to Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Biden said NATO leaders discussed the need for NATO and the EU to set up a system to review any sanctions violations and ""where, when and how"" Russia is able to buy banned products.

On sanctions, Biden said the reason why he asked for the NATO meeting was ""to be sure that after a month, we will sustain what we're doing, not just next month, the following month, but for the remainder of this entire year. That's what will stop (Putin).""

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, speaking to reporters from alliance headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday, said using chemical weapons would change the nature of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.

""It will be a blatant violation of international law and with far-reaching consequences,"" Stoltenberg said, adding that the use of such weapons could impact nearby NATO member countries.

The NATO alliance will be soon providing Ukraine with equipment to protect against chemical, biological, radiological as well as nuclear weapons, said Stoltenberg. He declined to elaborate on what kind of specific support the alliance would provide in order to protect operational security.

Russia has previously used chemical weapons on the battlefield, including in Syria, against Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny and against former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in London.

Frustrated with his slow progress in Ukraine, Putin has been increasingly signaling the possibility of using chemical or biological weapons to wipe out entire cities and force the country to surrender.

Biden warned earlier this week that Putin was falsely accusing the U.S. and Ukraine of using biological or chemical weapons to possibly justify Russia's own attack on Ukraine.

""Russia has a long track record of accusing others of what they are either already doing or about to do, and that is the kind of projection that we've seen in the last couple of weeks. And it's very scary,"" Biden said in an interview Tuesday.

Following the NATO meeting Biden said that U.S. allies had accomplished all three of his major goals in Brussels.

""First, to support Ukraine with military and humanitarian assistance. Second was to impose the most significant most significant economic sanctions regime ever, in order to cripple Putin's economy and punish him for his actions. Third, was to fortify the eastern flank of our NATO allies who were obviously very, very concerned and somewhat worried what would happen,"" said Biden.

Earlier in the day, the White House announced that the United States will sanction approximately 400 Russian individuals and entities, including more than 300 lawmakers from the Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, and Russian elites.

The G-7 and the EU also announced new measures to crack down on Russian efforts to evade current sanctions, including those on its central bank.

In addition to punitive measures against Russia, Biden announced several new efforts to assist Ukraine and countries dependent upon Ukraine's grain harvest, which is in jeopardy as a result of the Russian invasion.

The U.S. ""is prepared to commit more than $1 billion in humanitarian assistance to help get relief to millions of Ukrainians affected by the war in Ukraine,"" said Biden.

""Many Ukrainian refugees will wish to stay in Europe, closer to their homes, but also will welcome 100,000 Ukrainians to the United States, with a focus on reuniting families. And we will invest $320 million dollars to bolster democratic resilience and defend human rights to Ukraine and neighboring countries,"" Biden told reporters at a press conference following the meetings.

Through the U.S. government's feed the future initiative, the Biden administration will provide $11 billion over the next five years to address threats to food security and prevent malnutrition.

The lion's share of Ukraine's grain exports currently go to Africa and Asia, and the American funds will be deployed to many of the countries where the population is especially vulnerable to a rise in food prices.",https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/24/biden-says-us-would-respond-to-russia-if-putin-uses-chemical-or-biological-weapons.html

President Joe Biden warned that the United States will respond if Russia uses chemical weapons against Ukraine. Biden also promised to take in 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, provide $1 billion in humanitarian support to Ukraine, and a impose a new round of sanctions against Russian politicians, entities, and defense companies.

“Putin was banking on NATO being split,” said Biden, in Europe accompanied by Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III.

Biden said he called for the March 24 unscheduled NATO leaders summit, and subsequent meetings with European and G-7 counterparts, in order to keep allies and partners united in the punishing sanctions regiment against Russian President Vladimir Putin since “Russia began its carnage in Ukraine” one month prior, on Feb. 24.

“He didn’t think we could sustain this cohesion. NATO has never, never been more united than it is today,” he added, reflecting on December and January phone calls with Putin. “Putin is getting exactly the opposite of what he intended to have as a consequence of going into Ukraine.”

Biden also said he is working with European leaders on ways the United States can provide food and energy security amid worries created by the Russia-Ukraine war. Both Russia and Ukraine are major providers of wheat to Europe, and many European countries depend on Russian oil and gas. The U.S. has ended imports of Russian oil and gas and hopes to export more liquefied natural gas to European ports to help allies reduce their purchase of Russian energy.

The new sanctions against Russia, in unison with the European Union, target more than 400 individuals and entities. Included are more than 300 members of the Russian legislative body Duma, oligarchs, and defense companies.

Biden made note of the more than $2 billion in defense assistance already provided to Ukraine, including air defense systems, armor, and ammunition that continues to flow into Ukraine through a variety of secret overland routes from NATO eastern flank countries. The President announced no new defense package or materials, and the $800 million package of additional military support, signed March 16, has yet to begin delivery.

Biden also said 100,000 Ukrainian refugees will be permitted to immigrate to the United States with a focus on reuniting families. European countries have already absorbed more than 3.5 million refugees from the conflict. Biden is set to travel to Poland, the largest recipient of Ukrainian refugees, March 25 and March 26 for meetings with leaders and to visit refugee camps.

Much speculation has arisen as to the possibility that Biden might somehow try to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which would require either Zelenskyy to leave the besieged capital or for Biden to fly into an active war zone.

After beginning to describe his itinerary, Biden reversed course and said that he hopes to “see a lot of people.”

The President refused to admit that his early ruling out of direct military intervention before the start of the invasion had emboldened Putin, and he dismissed a reporter’s assertion that American sanctions were meant to deter an invasion by Russia.

“I did not say that … sanctions would deter him. Sanctions never deter,” Biden said, noting that the “maintenance of sanctions” for the entire year would stop Putin.

“The single most important thing is for us to stay unified, and the world to continue to focus on what a brute this guy is, and all the innocent people’s lives that are being lost and ruined,” Biden continued.

On China, Biden said that during his recent call with President Xi Jinping, he made it clear that economic access to the United States and European Union would be “in significant jeopardy” should China choose to provide economic or military assistance to Russia.

The President ended by emphasizing that the alliance must hold strong if it is to stop Putin:

The United States and allies have said they are concerned the Kremlin might resort to such a move as its invasion struggles against Ukrainian resistance and Moscow's own issues.

White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan sent a memo Feb. 28 detailing how the so-called ""Tiger Team"" would look at what might happen over the next three months of conflict, the senior administration official told NBC News.

Scenarios under discussion have included: Russia using chemical or biological weapons, Russia targeting U.S. convoys carrying weapons to Ukraine, a disruption to the global food supply, and the refugee crisis as millions of Ukrainians flee the country, the official said.

The creation of the team was first reported by the New York Times.

Sullivan's memo also established a second ""strategy group"" responsible for ""a longer-term examination of major geo-political shifts"" triggered by the invasion, the official said.

A chemical or biological attack would mark a dramatic escalation for a conflict in which Russia has increasingly turned its attacks on civilian areas. These types of weapons would also risk spilling over into neighboring NATO countries such as Poland — raising the question of whether the alliance would have to respond.

Russia is one of 193 countries to have signed the Chemical Weapons Convention, an international treaty that bans their development, production or use.

U.S. officials have previously worried that Russia's claims Ukraine might be about to use chemical weapons could be the basis for it staging a ""false-flag"" attack — deploying the weapons and seeking to pin the blame on Kyiv.

As he left the White House on Wednesday to meet with allies in Europe, President Joe Biden told reporters he thought there was a “real threat” that Putin could use chemical weapons.

During the journey to Brussels Wednesday, Sullivan told reporters on Air Force One that they were maintaining a close eye on Russia’s rhetoric.

“The main thing that we’re looking at right now is the deliberate drumbeat of misinformation, propaganda and lies on this subject that has all the markers of a precursor to them actually using these weapons,” he said.

It's a tactic that's been used in Syria, where the Russia-backed regime has often sought to blame the rebels it's fighting when it has been accused of using chemical weapons against its own people.

Biden will discuss how to respond if Russia uses chemical or nuclear weapons when he meets other world leaders for a series of high-stakes summits in Brussels, Belgium, on Thursday, Sullivan said Wednesday.

The president has already attended a gathering of NATO leaders, which was addressed remotely by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. And later Biden will meet with the Group of Seven, a club of some of the world's top industrialized democracies.

The White House is also planning additional sanctions as well discussions with European leaders about reducing their dependence on Russian oil, Sullivan said.

Speaking to journalists at a press conference at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Biden said a decision on what that response would look like would not be made until such an attack occurs, if it does.

“You’re asking if NATO would cross… we’ll make that decision at the time,” he said.

Biden asserted that NATO has “never been more united” after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, though Russian President Vladimir Putin was banking on a divided alliance.

Earlier Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned there is a “real” threat that Moscow will use chemical weapons in Ukraine, accusing Russia of having already used phosphorus bombs against civilians in the country.

“The threat of full-scale use by Russia of chemical weapons on the territory of Ukraine is real,” Zelensky told a G7 summit in Brussels via video link, adding that Kyiv had information that Russian troops “used phosphorus bombs against peaceful people in Ukraine.”

Kyiv first accused Russia of using phosphorus shells against civilians two weeks into its invasion of Ukraine.

The Ukrainian leader called for a “total embargo” on doing business with Russia, and for Russia to be prevented from using the GPS navigation system “in times of war.”

Zelensky said Russian banks should be “completely cut off from the global financial system” and frozen Russian assets “should be used towards reparations to rebuild Ukraine.”

Zelensky also warned that the war in Ukraine could lead to a “global food crisis.”

“The longer there is no peace on Ukrainian territory, the less Ukrainian food the global market will receive,” he said.

He said the war could lead to shortages of “basic products” in “many countries of Asia, Africa, and even Europe.”

Ukraine is among the biggest exporters of farm-grown food, including wheat and maize.

Putin launched his shock invasion of Ukraine one month ago.

Earlier, NATO secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance would step up its chemical and nuclear defenses for its forces in Eastern Europe in the face of fears over Russia’s war on Ukraine.

“Our top military commander General Wolters has activated NATO’s chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear defense elements, and allies are deploying additional chemical and biological and nuclear defenses to reinforce our existing and new battle groups,” Stoltenberg told journalists after a NATO summit in Brussels.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/zelensky-warns-of-real-threat-russia-will-use-chemical-weapons-in-ukraine/

President Joe Biden took questions at a news conference at NATO headquarters in Brussels, addressing warnings of a possible chemical weapons attack by Russia in Ukraine, after meeting with European leaders Thursday and following Ukraine's President Zelenskky pleading with them to do more to help.

Noting Biden has warned there's a ""real threat"" in Russia using chemical weapons in Ukraine, the first question to him was on whether the U.S. has gathered specific intelligence that suggests that Russian President Vladimir Putin is considering deploying chemical weapons and whether the U.S. or NATO respond with military action if he did use them.

""I'm not going to give you intelligence data, number one,"" Biden said. ""Number two, we would respond. We would respond if he uses it, and the nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use.""

ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Cecilia Vega followed up, and asked, ""If chemical weapons were used in Ukraine could that trigger a military response from NATO?""

""It would trigger a response in kind,"" Biden replied. ""Whether or not -- you're asking whether NATO would cross -- we'd make that decision at the time.""

But Biden did not lay out what that response might look like and whether it would involve sending U.S. troops to Ukraine, which Biden has vowed not to do.

As he began, Biden announced a range of new sanctions against Russia targeting the majority of the Duma and Russian elites, that the U.S. will welcome up to 100,000 refugees from Ukraine and provide $1 billion in new humanitarian aid, as he faces pressure from Zelenskyy to provide more deliverables to Ukraine.

""Putin is getting exactly the opposite of what he intended to have as a consequence of going into Ukraine,"" Biden said, adding later on that he was ""banking on NATO being split.""

Biden also described his call last week with China's President Xi Jinping as ""very straightforward"" and said that, while ""I made no threats,"" he did make clear Xi would be ""putting himself in significant jeopardy"" if China helped Russia with its invasion of Ukraine.

The president made the foreign trip to attend an extraordinary summit of all 30 NATO leaders to reaffirm the U.S. commitment to NATO allies, participate in a pre-scheduled meeting of the European Council -- the political body of the European Union -- and meet with leaders of the Group of Seven, or G-7, major industrial nations.

Biden also answered a definitive ""yes,"" when asked he believes that Russia should be removed from the G20, but noted that it ""would depend on the G20"" to make that decision.

He said that point was raised today by G20 leaders and that he raised the possibility that if removing Russia can't be done because of ""Indonesia and others"" not in agreement, Ukraine should be able to attend future G20 meetings.

And when he was asked if Zelenskyy needs to cede any Ukrainian territory in order to gain a cease-fire with Russia, Biden said, ""that is a total judgment based on Ukraine.""

According to senior U.S. administration officials, the mood at NATO's emergency summit has been ""sober"" and ""resolute"" so far.

""There was a very strong sense that we are facing a significant historical moment, and very strong support from all the leaders who spoke about the need to defend our democracy,"" one of the officials told reporters during a telephone briefing Thursday.

The officials said Zelesnkyy, who addressed NATO leaders remotely, spoke ""very eloquently"" and ""repeated his requests for continued and increased Western security assistance.""

""But notably, there was not a request for a no-fly zone,"" an official added. ""There was also not a request for NATO membership.""

Zelesnkyy did ask for NATO to give 1% of all its tanks and said he hasn't been given an answer.

""I have been repeating the same thing for a month now: To save people and our cities, Ukraine needs military assistance without restrictions, as Russia uses without restrictions its entire arsenal against us,"" he continued. ""Ukraine asked for your planes so that we do not lose so many people. And you have thousands of fighter jets, but we haven't been given any yet.""

""We asked for tanks so that we can unblock our cities that are now dying,"" he added. ""You have at least 20,000 tanks. Ukraine asked for a percent -- 1% -- of all your tanks to be given or sold to us. But we do not have a clear answer yet.""

Speaking after Zelenskyy's speech, Biden that Thursday marks one month since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. He discussed the sanctions that have already been imposed and expressed strong support for Ukraine as well as humanitarian and military aid and reaffirmed his support for Article 5, which is the cornerstone of NATO and states that an attack on one member is an attack on all members.

Since Russian President Vladimir Putin launches his invasion one month ago, 3.5 million Ukrainians have fled the country and millions more have become internally displaced.

Biden is scheduled to travel to Poland on Friday.

As the fighting continues, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced on Wednesday that the State Department has made a formal assessment that Russian forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine.

“We would respond if he uses it, but the nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use,” Biden said at a brisk press conference in Brussels hours after meeting with the leaders of the 29 other NATO countries.

Biden notoriously gave a similarly equivocal answer on Jan. 19 when he said Russian President Vladimir Putin might face less harsh penalties for a “minor incursion,” which drew an outcry from Ukrainian leaders who said Biden gave Moscow a “green light” to attack.

Despite the urgency of the NATO session, and how highly anticipated his press conference was, the president took questions from just six reporters and spoke for less than 20 minutes after hastily moving it an hour and a half earlier on the one-month anniversary of Russia’s invasion.

Earlier in the day, some of his events ran late and Biden stood out among world leaders in not speaking to reporters on the sidelines of summits of NATO and G7 leaders.

Biden hinted that he would visit the Ukrainian border Friday after arriving in Poland. He drew laughs from journalists when he said that he hoped to check in on some of the more than 3.5 million refugees fleeing Ukraine, but that “I guess I’m not supposed to say where I’m going, am I? But anyway, I hope I get to see a lot of people.”

The president stressed that he wanted to maintain a “thoroughly united” front with US allies on anti-Russia sanctions amid widespread destruction to major urban areas — but he did not mention Western Europe’s decision to continue importing Russian oil and natural gas, despite the US ban that Biden adopted after a bipartisan alliance in Congress threatened to force his hand.

Biden president was indecisive when asked at the press conference whether Ukraine would have to cede land to Russia in order to achieve a cease-fire.

“That is a total judgment based on Ukraine,” Biden said. “I don’t believe that they’re going to have to do that. But that’s a judgment — there’s negotiations, there are discussions, I should say, that have taken place that I’ve not been part of, including Ukrainians. And it’s their judgment to make.”

Biden gave another flexible reply when asked if Russia would be booted from the G-20 economic forum.

President Biden also discussed the possibility of kicking Russia out of the G-20 forum. AP

“My answer is yes. That would — depends on the G-20. That was raised today. And I raised the possibility that if that can’t be done, if Indonesia and others do not agree, then we should, in my view, ask to have Ukraine be able to attend the meetings … and observe,” he said.

Biden ended his press conference after lashing out at a CBS reporter who asked about the prospect of new sanctions changing Putin’s course in the war — indicating that sanctions might have to remain in effect for a full year to have an impact.

“What makes you think Vladimir Putin will alter course based on the action you’ve taken today?” the reporter asked.

President Biden said any negotiated settlement to end the war would have to involve Ukraine. REUTERS

“I did not say that, in fact, the sanctions would deter him,” Biden said. “Sanctions never deter. You keep talking about that. Sanctions never deter. The maintenance of sanctions, the maintenance of sanctions, increasing the pain … not just next month, the following month, but for the remainder of this entire year, that’s what will stop him,” Biden said.

The reporter followed up, “Do you believe the actions today will have an impact on Russia changing course in Ukraine?”

“That’s not what I said. You’re playing a game with me,” Biden bristled.

“The answer is no. I think what happens is we have to demonstrate — the purpose, the single most important thing is for us to stay unified and the world continues to focus on what a brute this guy is and all the innocent people’s lives that are being lost and ruined and what’s going on. That’s the important thing.”

Biden added: “But look, if you’re Putin and you think that Europe is going to crack in a month or six weeks or two months, why not. They can take anything for another month. But we have to demonstrate — the reason I asked for the meeting — we have to stay fully, totally, thoroughly united.”",https://nypost.com/2022/03/24/biden-us-response-to-russian-chemical-weapons-in-ukraine-would-depend-on-use/

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for clarification.

Other political leaders in the U.S. who, like Biden, are reluctant to enter into direct conflict with Russia have said in recent days that a chemical weapons attack would likely change their opinion. Sen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican, said last week that NATO should enforce a no-fly zone if Putin employs chemical weapons in Ukraine.

Putin and his top advisers have repeatedly offered conspiracy theories in recent weeks – in part as a justification for Russia’s unprovoked offensive in Ukraine – that Kyiv plans to use chemical or biological weapons against Russia and its people, including debunked claims that U.S.-backed labs in Ukraine are producing such pathogens.

Intelligence services in the U.S., U.K. and other Western powers have warned that such rhetoric from the Kremlin may serve as a pretext to Putin’s employment of chemical or biological weapons against Ukrainian troops and civilians as the disorganization of the Russian offensive threatens to devolve it into a stalemate.

“Russia could possibly be planning to use chemical or biological weapons in a ‘false-flag’ operation. Such an operation could take the form of a faked attack, a staged ‘discovery’ of agents or munitions or fabricated evidence of alleged Ukrainian planning to use such weapons,” a spokesman for the British Ministry of Defense said last week. “A ‘false-flag’ attack would almost certainly be accompanied by extensive disinformation to complicate attribution.”

That threat appears to grow as Ukrainian forces become more willing and able to defend against the Russian onslaught and in some cases regain territory. A U.S. defense official speaking on the condition of anonymity told reporters Wednesday evening that some Russian forces outside Kyiv, bogged down by disorganization, poor reinforcements and surprisingly potent opposition from the Ukrainians, had begun entrenching their positions rather than attempting to continue to try advancing into the capital city.

Biden’s warning on Thursday comes as Western powers consider other forms of punishment against Putin in response to the war. The president added that he would push for Russia to be removed from the G-20 group of global economic powers and not be allowed to attend the upcoming summit in Indonesia in October.

Russia’s ambassador to the southeast Asian nation said this week that Putin himself still planned to attend. Analysts have suggested that Indonesia likely would not unilaterally block Russian delegates from participating.

“If that can’t be done, if Indonesia and others do not agree, then we should, in my view, ask to have both Ukraine be able to attend the meetings as well,” Biden said. “Basically, Ukraine being able to attend the G-20 meeting and observe.”

Russia was removed from what was previously known as the Group of Eight, or G-8, following its invasion of Ukraine in 2014 and forced annexation of the Crimean Peninsula. Donald Trump on several occasions during his presidency openly advocated for Russia to rejoin the bloc without preconditions, drawing rebukes from leaders in other member countries.

Critics of Biden’s, particularly among Republicans seeking reelection this fall, have blamed the current president for weakness internationally and for not showing the kind of brazen military strength internationally to deter Putin from invading Ukraine.

Speaking at NATO headquarters in Brussels, he told reporters that if Russian President Vladimir Putin were to use chemical weapons in Ukraine, NATO would respond in some form, without specifying how.

At the news conference, ABC News’ Cecilia Vega asked Biden, “If chemical weapons were used in Ukraine, would that trigger a military response from NATO?”

Biden replied: “It would trigger a response in kind, whether or not, you’re asking whether NATO would cross — we’d make that decision at the time.”

Worryingly, Biden’s statement was more ambiguous even than he meant for it to be.

Biden's response marked a pivot from his usual position of ruling out the possibility of a direct confrontation between NATO and Russia except in self-defense. Now he’s signaling that if Russia uses chemical weapons against Ukraine, which is not in NATO, it would cross some kind of line that could, theoretically, prompt a military response from NATO.

The statement illustrated how Biden is moving toward a position of strategic ambiguity that some of the United States’ NATO allies have been clamoring for.

“There is a growing debate in NATO about what to do if Russia uses chemical weapons and a sense we aren’t deterring him from doing so,” Ben Judah, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Europe Center, told me. “The purpose of the comment is to re-establish ambiguity and, of course, is supposed to encompass nonmilitary [options].”

Worryingly, Biden’s statement was more ambiguous even than he meant for it to be. At first blush, his phrase “a response in kind” would seem to suggest that NATO would use chemical weapons in retaliation against Russia. But that's against international law, and it isn't actually what NATO would do. What Biden really meant to signal was that NATO would deal some kind of proportional or equivalent blow to Russia.

In his response Biden also didn’t seem to complete all of his clauses; it’s unclear where exactly he was going after he said “NATO would cross” and then seemingly shifted gears mid-sentence. A remark he made earlier during the press conference in response to a question about whether NATO would respond if Russia used chemical weapons was cleaner and more flexible: ""The nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use.""

Biden's imprecise language is the exact kind of thing international leaders want to avoid in these kinds of situations. But overall, the point of Biden's remarks was to signal that he's not ruling out any specific kind of response to a chemical weapons attack in Ukraine from Russia. It leaves open the possibility that he’s talking about a military response or a nonmilitary response like new sanctions or shutting down Russia’s oil exports.

The pivot could be a sign that pressure from NATO allies, a hawkish White House press corps and recent polling indicating most Americans want Biden to be tougher with Russia is swaying the administration’s thinking. It could aksi be a sign that the Biden administration is looking for some kind of additional leverage to slow down Putin’s intensifying destruction of Ukraine and reduce the likelihood that he deploys chemical weapons to terrorize Ukrainians or stage a false flag.

The move carries some strategic risks. Consider how former President Barack Obama famously garnered criticism for how he responded to Syria's government after it crossed what he promised would be a ""red line"" of using chemical attacks. Syria proceeded to use chemical weapons anyway, and his diplomatic response, which involved striking a deal with Russia to remove Syria's chemical weapons stockpile, didn't solve the issue of Syria using chemical attacks. In international affairs, if an actor publicly draws a line and it's crossed, they need take effective action to remain a credible actor.

Previously, Biden has preferred to spell out very clearly his disinterest in a direct confrontation with Russia. “Let me be clear, our forces are not engaged and will not engage in conflict with Russian forces in Ukraine,” Biden said during his State of the Union address earlier in March. The logic behind that strategy has been to create space for a more rapid diplomatic solution by suggesting military intervention in Ukraine is off the table.

It remains to be seen if Biden will lean more into his new ambiguity about a response to Russia or return to the more clearly restrained approach. Either way, it’s critical that Biden doesn’t behave rashly and unnecessarily enter World War III with the world’s other biggest nuclear power.",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-s-hawkish-pivot-russia-ukraine-over-chemical-weapons-n1293067
