Three missiles hit an apartment building, a migration office and a council administration building in the Novokodatsky district, setting fire to the factory.

Valentin Yermolenko, public affairs officer for the regional military administration, said there were no military facilities in the area and that one person was killed, a security guard.

The district prosecutor has opened an investigation into the attack over the possible violation of the laws of war.

Residents living close to the shoe factory said they heard the first explosion just before 6:00 am (0400 GMT) and the second at 6:10 am. The third strike was further away.

Local residents and shop owners were working Friday to clear up broken glass and board up the open frames as snow fell and temperatures dipped far below zero.

""We heard a loud explosion and the windows broke and bits of the ceiling started to fall. When there was a second one, we ran out to shelter in the metro but the entrance had also been damaged,"" said Svetlana Kalenecheko, who lives and works in a clinic next to the shoe factory.

""Today, we were supposed to host people who need a lot of support. We work with people with HIV and AIDS. Now we can't help anyone.""

The windows had also been blown out of a nearby kindergarten.

Mayor Boris Filativ said in a video statement that the situation remains under control and that there are no Russian troops in the city.

Dnipro had been considered a safe haven, suffering few attacks since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24.

As a result, it has become a hub for the coordination of humanitarian aid and for people fleeing more severe fighting in the country's east.

As firefighters battled the blaze in the morning, air raid sirens sounded on multiple occasions, forcing them to take shelter in a nearby metro station.

Sheltering in the metro, several generations of a family from besieged Volnovakha, a city close to what was the front line with Russian-backed separatists, said they had fled to Dnipro last week for safety.

After hearing this morning's attacks, they are afraid to leave the underground station, and with little money they don't know what they will do now.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-strikes-hit-central-ukraine-city-dnipro-101647005437495.html

The explosions occurred at two heating plants in the city of Lutsk, which is close to the Polish border.

“Dnipro is also under attack. Russia’s war to destroy civilians and cities continues,” Podolyak said in a Twitter statement Friday (11/3).

Ukrainian Emergency Services reported that one person in the city of Dnipro died in three air strikes that hit a kindergarten, apartment building and shoe factory.

The attack took place at around 06.10 am local time in the Novokodatskyi district of the city of Dnipro.

Not only Dnipro, the mayor of Lutsk, Lhor Polishchuk, reported that explosions also occurred at the city’s airfield, according to local Ukrainian media UNIAN. Two Ukrainian soldiers were reportedly killed in a Russian attack on a military base northwest of Lutsk.

Lutsk had never been the target of a Russian attack before.

“The explosion occurred in the direction of the airfield. Everyone took cover in the bunkers!” Polishchuk was quoted as saying CNN.

Not only that, three large explosions were reported in the city of Ivano-Frankivsk. Polishchuk said the sudden Russian bombardment prevented the authorities from turning on the warning system in the area.

“The Ukrainian Armed Forces didn’t turn it on (the warning system). Why didn’t they turn it on? Since the missile was flying at ultra-low speed or some other reason, the military would have taken care of that problem,” Polishchuk said.

“Please don’t be near the window during the explosion, don’t take photos and videos and don’t publish it on social media, because the enemy is tracking all these messages. This can be additional information for the enemy. If an explosion occurs, please enter the bunker,” he pleaded.

In video footage, firefighters can be seen battling one ferocious blaze after the first missile strike on the eastern Ukrainian city.

The country’s State Emergency Service said Russian airstrikes had hit an apartment building and landed near a kindergarten in the Novokodatsky district of the city.

A tweet from the emergency service said: “On March 11, at about 06:10 in Dnipro, there were three air strikes in the city: hitting a kindergarten and an apartment building near the kindergarten and hitting a two-story shoe factory.”

Explosions were also heard in the western cities of Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk overnight - both attacks targeted military airfields.

The head of Lutsk’s regional administration Yuriy Pohulyayko, said two Ukrainian soldiers were killed, while a further six were injured.

Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak issued an update on Friday morning, where he claimed cities were now subject to “devastating blows”.

He said: “Ukrainian big cities are again subjected to devastating blows. The 1st explosions took place in Lutsk shutting down 2 boiler houses.

“Ivano-Frankivsk - 3 powerful explosions. Dnipro is also under attack. Russia’s destructive war against civilians and major Ukrainian cities continues.”

Despite the latest attacks, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) claimed that Russian forces have yet to achieve their military objectives.

Instead, the MoD said logistic issues continue to hamper Russian advances, although it warned of increased pressure on Kyiv in the coming days.

There are fears Russia is now planning chemical attacks in Ukraine after accusing America of preparing biological weapons.

Story continues

The UN Security Council will convene on Friday at Moscow’s request to discuss its claims that the US is carrying out “military biological activities” in Ukraine.

Boris Johnson warned that Mr Putin’s “barbaric” regime may be preparing to deploy chemical weapons by claiming to be pre-empting a Ukrainian strike.

He told Sky’s Beth Rigby: “The stuff that you’re hearing about chemical weapons is straight out of their playbook. They start saying that there are chemical weapons that have been stored by their opponents or by the Americans.

“And so when they themselves deploy chemical weapons, as I fear they may, they have as a sort of a maskirovka — a fake story ready to go. You’ve seen it in Syria. You saw it even in the UK”",https://uk.news.yahoo.com/russia-attacks-dnipro-video-shows-084944130.html

Russian air strikes leave at least one person dead in fresh rocket attack near nursery

Russian air strikes in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro have left one person dead after attacks reported near a children’s nursery and an apartment block while there have also been explosions at airfields in two cities in the west of the country.

Three explosions early on Friday in the central Ukrainian city have killed at least one person, emergency services said.

A kindergarten and an apartment building were caught in the shelling as well as a shoe factory.

There have also been reports of explosions in western Ivano-Frankivsk and Lutsk in the north west of Ukraine, both at the cities' airfields.

Russian troops have launched a high-precision, long-range attack on two military airfields in the Ukrainian cities of Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk and taken them out of action, Russian news agencies quoted Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov as saying.

He also said that Russian forces had destroyed 3,213 Ukrainian military installations since the launch of what Russia calls a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.

The Kyiv Independent wrote: ""Three airstrikes by Russian forces hit residential areas in Dnipro, killing one person, according to Ukraine’s State Emergency Service.

""Explosions were reported in western Ivano-Frankivsk near its airport, according to the city’s mayor Ruslan Martsinkiv. Four explosions were also reported near an airfield in the northwestern city of Lutsk, according to the head of the Volyn Regional State Administration, Yuriy Pohulyayko.""

It comes as hundreds of thousands of civilians remain trapped in Ukrainian cities, sheltering from Russian air raids and shelling despite repeated Russian promises to provide humanitarian corridors for evacuations.

The United States, together with the Group of Seven nations and the European Union, are now preparing to revoke Russia's ""most favoured nation"" status over its invasion of Ukraine.

On Sunday, Ukraine had warned that Russia was mustering forces to encircle Dnipro, home to about one million people before the invasion started.

Russia's defence ministry said it would declare a ceasefire on Friday and open humanitarian corridors from Mariupol as well as Kyiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, Mariupol and Chernihiv, although previous ceasefires have failed.

Officials in the besieged port of Mariupol said Russian warplanes again bombed the city on Thursday, a day after a maternity hospital was pulverised in an attack the United States said was evidence of a war crime.

Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the United Nations, said Washington was ""working with others in the international community to document the crimes that Russia is committing against the Ukrainian people"".

""They constitute war crimes; there are attacks on civilians that cannot be justified by any - in any way whatsoever,"" she said in an interview with the BBC.

Lavrov said the hospital struck on Wednesday had stopped treating patients and had been occupied by Ukrainian ""radicals"".

Russia's Defence Ministry later denied having bombed the hospital at all, accusing Ukraine of a ""staged provocation"".

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday that Ukrainian authorities had managed to evacuate almost 40,000 people from the cities of Sumy, Trostyanets, Krasnopillya, Irpin, Bucha, Hostomel and Izyum.",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/breaking-russian-air-strikes-leave-26440620

For the past two weeks since the Russians invaded, he's been barely sleeping, working 20 hours a day to feed the people of Russian-occupied Kherson. Each day, the 28-year-old bakes thousands of loaves of bread, loads them into his truck or car, and drives them through the deserted streets, delivering them to people who are increasingly being cut off from outside food supplies as Russian forces choke the city of nearly 300,000.

Kherson was the first major city to fall since the war began. Unified against a common enemy, Ukrainians are finding ways to resist — without even carrying a gun.

Before the war, Servetnyk was a successful chef — he won Ukrainian MasterChef in 2019, and ran a pizza restaurant in Kherson. But on Feb. 24, the Russians invaded Ukraine — and his life changed.

As the Russians shelled his country, Servetnyk and his partner drove to his parents' house in a village on the outskirts of Kherson, desperate to flee Ukraine. ""Get into the car, we will go somewhere,"" he told them. His parents — who had witnessed other periods of tumult in their lives — laughed. ""Where would we escape? Who is waiting for us there?"" he remembers them saying. ""The Russians are coming soon, they tell us that this is Russia now and we will go on with our lives.""

So Servetnyk decided to stay and resist. Many of Kherson's bakers had either fled or gone into hiding, so Servetynyk turned his pizza restaurant into a bakery, and began making thousands of loaves of bread. To feed more people, he also roped in other bakers and distributed their bread, too.

""We did not escape, did not leave, but rather started saving people as best as we could,"" he says.
