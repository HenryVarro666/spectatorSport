DERHACHI, Ukraine, April 6 (Reuters) - Dragging trolleys and clutching plastic bags with their meagre belongings, residents of the northeastern Ukrainian town of Derhachi, near the border with Russia, boarded buses on Wednesday to be evacuated as fears of a Russian assault grew.

Since pulling back from outside the capital Kyiv last week, Russian forces have shifted their assault towards Ukraine's south and east.

Ukraine's general staff said the northeastern city of Kharkiv, the country's second-largest, remained under attack on Wednesday, and authorities expect Russian forces to launch a full-blown assault soon to try to take the city.

Many in the town of Derhachi, which lies just north of Kharkiv and 30km (19 miles) from the border with Russia, have decided to leave while they can. Buildings have already been badly damaged by Russian artillery.

""The shelling has intensified in recent days. I am very worried for my children,"" said Mykola, a father of two who declined to give his surname, hugging his young son who was keeping warm under a fleece blanket.

He said he could hear the thud of bombardments every night, and had been hunkering down with his family in the corridor of their home.

""(We'll go) wherever there are no explosions, where the children won't have to hear them. I want it to be over as soon as possible,"" he said, struggling to hold back tears.

At least eight buses and vans left the town on Wednesday in an evacuation organised by the International Committee of the Red Cross towards the city of Poltava, some 150 km to the west. A family with a dog, a mother cuddling her baby, an elderly woman with a cane waited patiently for their turn to leave.

TOWN HALL DESTROYED

""It is unbearable, it is terrifying. Everything is shaking, the glass of the windows has been blown out,"" said Nina, a middle-aged woman whose daughter had already left.

She said the balcony of her house had been hit by shelling and that she had sought shelter in the bathroom and in the basement.

Another woman, Iryna, said: ""I don't want to go, I leave everything behind. But there is no other choice.""

Even the interior of the church had been pockmarked by shrapnel and the town hall was destroyed. Nearby stood a World War Two memorial plate honouring Soviet forces who liberated Derhachi from Nazi occupiers on August 12, 1943.

Mayor Viacheslav Zadorenko, who stayed behind, said he had no information about a build up of Russian troops preparing to attack.

""Our armed forces defend the town, therefore, there is no reason for panic,"" he told Reuters, adding, however, people should be taking no chances given reports of atrocities at the hands of Russian occupiers in the region around Kyiv before Ukrainian troops retook control.

""Taking into account the events in Bucha, Hostomel, we should probably evacuate as many people as possible to save their lives,"" he said.

Ukrainian authorities have accused Russian forces of killing civilians in Bucha and other nearby towns, where Reuters reporters saw bodies of people shot dead at close range, some with their hands tied behind their backs.

The Kremlin dismisses the allegations as propaganda. Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the Security Council on Tuesday that Russian troops are not targeting civilians, dismissing accusations of abuse as lies. He said that while Bucha was under Russian control ""not a single civilian suffered from any kind of violence.""

Feldman Ecopark “is no more,” founder Alexander Feldman said in a statement on Tuesday after the zoo was “subjected to massive shelling and bombardment” from Russian forces.

The statement said the zoo’s “biggest problem” was large predators, such as lions, tigers and bears, which would pose a major danger to humans if they got out of the zoo and roamed free. Feldman said their enclosures were intact but couldn’t withstand more damage. For that reason, if the zoo can’t find a safe location for those animals to go, it may have to euthanize them.

“It is unimaginably painful to talk about this, but the main priority now is the lives of people,” Feldman said.

Feldman Ecopark emphasized in follow-up statements that euthanasia would be a last resort and that it was still attempting to evacuate animals.

The logistics of transporting large zoo animals safely is complicated even under normal circumstances. During a war, supply shortages, road damage and the constant risk of shelling make it even harder. Many animals are in an intensely stressed-out state after a month of hearing shelling.

Animal enclosures were badly damaged, and Feldman warned some animals could enter the streets. While the bears were in bad condition ""by sheer miracle, tigers and lions are alive,"" he said.

""Today we are deciding ... we have time 'till evening, whether to put them all down or transport them somewhere else,"" Feldman said. The zoo's team was working in Chutovo, trying to find a way to save the animals, he said. ""Maybe we will save baby jaguars, baby panthers, but all adult animals will probably be liquidated,"" Feldman said.

(English below) Экопарка больше нет. Сейчас об этом можно говорить совершенно определенно. Вчера и сегодня он снова подвергся массированным обстрелам и бомбардировкам. Инфраструктура разрушена, вольеры разрушены. Самая большая проблема – это крупные хищники. Их вольеры пока еще чудом сохраняют целостность, но еще один обстрел – и обезумившие от страха львы, тигры, медведи могут оказаться на воле и пойти в сторону Харькова или в близлежащие поселки. Мы этого допустить не можем. Решения проблемы на сегодня нет. Наши специалисты сейчас рассматривают возможность оборудовать для них – хотя бы для некоторых - временное жилище в Чутово Полтавской области. Если этого не получится, то единственный остающийся у нас вариант – это усыпление хищников. Об этом невообразимо больно говорить, но главный приоритет сейчас – это жизнь людей. Других все еще остающихся на территории Экопарка и выживших животных, которых можно вывезти, нам также нужно срочно эвакуировать. Для этого нам не обойтись без вашей поддержки – реквизиты для пожертвований находятся здесь: https://feldman-ecopark.com/donation/ Feldman Ecopark no longer exists. Now this can be said quite definitely. Yesterday and today it was again subjected to massive shelling and bombardment. Infrastructure destroyed, enclosures destroyed. The biggest problem is large predators. Their enclosures miraculously still retain their integrity, but one more shelling - and the lions, tigers, bears, distraught with fear, may be free and go towards Kharkov or to nearby villages. We cannot allow this. There is no solution to the problem today. Our specialists are now considering the possibility of equipping them - at least for some - with temporary housing in Chutovo, Poltava region. Failing that, the only option left to us is to put the predators to sleep. It is unimaginably painful to talk about this, but the main priority now is the lives of people. We also urgently need to evacuate other animals still remaining on the territory of the Ecopark and surviving animals that can be taken out. To do this, we cannot do without your support - details for donations are here: https://feldman-ecopark.com/en/donation/ Posted by Фельдман Экопарк on Tuesday, April 5, 2022

In the caption of the video, the zoo said its specialists were considering the possibility of equipping some animals with temporary housing in Chutovo, in the Poltava region of Ukraine. ""Failing that, the only option left to us is to put the predators to sleep. It is unimaginably painful to talk about this, but the main priority now is the lives of people,"" the caption reads.

In another statement on the Feldman Ecopark website, the zoo said the lions nearly ended up outside the enclosure after a recent round of shelling. ""We emphasize that the euthanasia of animals is an extreme measure, which we very much hope will not come to,"" the statement reads. ""Now we are negotiating with a large number of people and organizations, in particular, with those who can accept our animals in Ukraine and abroad.""

Among the big animals at Feldman Ecopark are white Bengal tigers, lions, jaguars and leopards. Feldman Ecopark

Still, there is an issue of how to move the large animals. ""Such an operation requires the presence of special transport and the participation of a fairly large number of people. Which with a high degree of probability will attract the attention of the enemy, who, as a rule, responds to activity on the territory of the Ecopark with shelling,"" the statement reads.

CBS News has reached out to Feldman Ecopark for comment and is awaiting response.

On March 4, about two weeks after Russia began its invasion, the zoo said staff were able to visit chimpanzees and orangutans for the first time since the war began. The monkeys had been sheltered by the Kharkov Zoo.

On Tuesday, the zoo was able to move Ukraine's only family of tapirs – a herbivorous animal with a short trunk – and some other exotic animals from Kharkiv.

Judy Woodruff: Hundreds of miles to the east of Kyiv and Bucha is what was once Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv. Now it is largely emptied of its residents.

While stymied from taking the city, the Russians are still pounding it with artillery, causing widespread destruction and sparking fires.

Special correspondent Jack Hewson and filmmaker Ed Ram travel with fire brigades, whose already difficult jobs have become more terrifying in the midst of war. (SOUND BLARING)

Jack Hewson: That sound means it is time to go, fireproof clothes and now bulletproof vests. Kharkiv is under a constant state of alarm. But few have felt its urgency like the city's firefighters.

Vladimir Podgorniy, Fireman (through translator): I throw all unnecessary thoughts out of my head, so nothing can interfere with me.

Jack Hewson: Before every mission, tensions are high. But it is not just fires that these men have to face.

Sergei Segienko, Fireman (through translator): Our work has become more difficult. And there was a risk before, but now has become riskier because of incoming shells.

Jack Hewson: They are on their way to northeast Kharkiv. On this day, Ukrainian authorities say more than 380 munitions landed on the city and its civilians. Incoming rounds have started yet another apartment blaze. It seems the Russians are trying to smash the people's spirit.

Sergei Segienko (through translator): Everyone experiences the situation in their own way. But people still do their duty. Everyone is worried, but no one talks about it. We keep ourselves to ourselves.

Jack Hewson: But just as the firemen are starting to get this blaze under control, the area comes under renewed attack. It is the third round of artillery that we have had incoming for the last 20 minutes.

These firefighters here behind you, they are also hiding. Everybody is trying to take cover. Let's get down, get down. You can hear the fizz of the shells landing. That means they are particularly close.

There is a pause in the shelling, and the decision is made to pull back. It is too dangerous to operate.

Vladimir Podgorniy (through translator): Once, a shell hit 15 meters away from us. The windshield of our truck was damaged.

Jack Hewson: Since the start of the war, one firefighter has been killed and at least four injured. There are more blazes than the firefighters can get to.

Moscow says it is not targeting civilians, but this residential district has faced heavy bombardment for more than a month. In the course of the morning, a gas main was struck, and this shop front incinerated in the blast. An eerie silence hangs over the street.

But, as we film the devastation, it becomes apparent the Russian guns aren't done.

(EXPLOSIONS)

Jack Hewson: We are having to stay on the ground. The shelling continues around us. It is very close, frankly. This is what people here have to live with every day.

(EXPLOSIONS)

Jack Hewson: The relentless bombardment of Kharkiv has destroyed more than 1,000 homes and public buildings. The fire service's area of operation has been divided by the front line.

Yevgen Vasylenko, Kharkiv Region Fire Service Spokesman (through translator): Yes, rescuers are working in terrible conditions from the first day of the war.

So, every fire warning call is like new training for our service. Every fire, every obstruction, every blast, every departure is never the same.

Jack Hewson: Shelling forces the firemen back to base, and as it continues into the afternoon, the order is given to move underground.

Man (through translator): Wait. I will light the way.

Jack Hewson: It is a long wait for the all-clear. And the shift commander tells me a mixture of artillery and rockets have been most commonly used the Russian forces.

Denis Mamchenko, Fireman (through translator): There was a hit of a Grad rocket in this apartment on the ninth floor. As a result, there was a fire started in two apartments.

Jack Hewson: Cluster munitions, banned in many countries, but not Russia or Ukraine, have also been used in Kharkiv, according to Human Rights Watch.

Denis Mamchenko (through translator): But this type of cluster projectile was found while putting out a fire in the city's biggest marketplace.

Jack Hewson: While Russian forces have moved away from Kyiv, they continue to terrorize Kharkiv. There is no rest for the fire service, as the city continues to burn.

For the ""PBS NewsHour,"" I am Jack Hewson in, Kharkiv, Ukraine.

Judy Woodruff: The bravery.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said fresh sanctions from the West would not be ""enough"" to respond to the atrocities Ukrainians say have been committed in the town of Bucha, near Kyiv, where grisly images purportedly show slain civilians.

""There will definitely be a new sanctions package against Russia,"" Zelenskyy said in a video address Sunday night. ""But I'm sure that's not enough,"" he said as he made an impassioned plea for a stronger international response to Russia's invasion.

Residents of Bucha have accused Russian forces of targeting civilians in a deadly campaign that Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk said left more than 300 people dead before troops pulled out of the city. Russia's Defense Ministry has denied the claims, calling them a ""provocation,"" despite photographs and video showing damaged city streets strewn with dead bodies.

Meanwhile, in southern Ukraine, heavy fighting has continued in the besieged port city of Mariupol, according to Britain's defense ministry. It said as efforts to evacuate residents from the besieged city were set to continue Monday.

Some animals that had the potential to survive on their own and don’t pose an imminent risk to people, such as deer, had simply been set loose.
