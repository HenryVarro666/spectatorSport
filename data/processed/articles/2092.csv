WASHINGTON, March 21 (Reuters) - The Pentagon on Monday accused Russian forces of committing war crimes in Ukraine and said it would help gather evidence of them, as it accused the Kremlin of carrying out indiscriminate attacks as part of an intentional strategy in the conflict.

""We certainly see clear evidence that Russian forces are committing war crimes and we are helping with the collecting of evidence of that,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told a news briefing.

""We certainly see clear evidence that Russian forces are committing war crimes, and we are helping with the collecting of evidence of that,"" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters in response to a question by VOA.

Kirby also accused Russian forces of carrying out ""indiscriminate attacks on civilians"" that were ""intentional"" in many cases.

He said the United States would wait for ongoing investigative processes and contribute to those investigations into Russian war crimes.

In Moscow, Russia's Foreign Ministry said Monday it had summoned U.S. Ambassador John Sullivan, citing ""unacceptable statements"" by U.S. President Joe Biden about Russian President Vladimir Putin, an apparent reference to Biden calling the Russian leader a ""war criminal"" last week.

""Such statements from the American president, unworthy of a statesman of such high rank, put Russian-American relations on the verge of rupture,"" it said.

Cyberattacks

The Pentagon's accusation came as Biden warned there was ""evolving intelligence"" that the Russian government was ""exploring options for potential cyberattacks"" against the U.S. amid its multifront war against Ukraine.

In a statement on Monday, the president urged the private sector to ""immediately"" harden ""cyber defenses.""

He said Russia could launch such attacks as retaliation for U.S. sanctions on Russia.

""It's part of Russia's playbook,"" he said.

The leaders of the U.S., France, Germany, Italy and Britain held a call Monday in which they discussed concerns about Russia's brutal tactics in Ukraine, underscored their continued support to Ukraine by providing security and humanitarian assistance, and reviewed recent diplomatic efforts in support of Ukraine's effort to reach a cease-fire, according to the White House.

Later this week, Biden will attend a NATO summit, a G-7 meeting, and a European Council summit in Brussels, all focused on the situation in Ukraine, before traveling to Poland.

In its latest intelligence assessment, Britain's Defense Ministry said Monday that Russia's claims that it used hypersonic missiles against targets in western Ukraine are ""likely intended to detract from a lack of progress in Russia's ground campaign.""

It also said that use of such missiles is ""highly unlikely to materially affect the outcome of Russia's campaign in Ukraine.""

Ukraine's allies are continuing to supply Ukrainian fighters through ground shipments of weapons that have not been attacked, a senior U.S. defense official said Monday. Ukrainians still have more than 90% of their combat power after nearly four weeks of fighting, the official said, in part because the U.S. and other allies have replenished them ""in real time.""

Ukraine referendum

Inside Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday said Ukrainians would need to vote in a referendum on any compromises agreed with Russia to end the war.

""The people will have to speak up and respond to this or that form of compromise,"" he said in an interview published by Ukrainian public broadcasting company Suspilne.

A day earlier, Zelenskyy told CNN, ""Russians have killed our children. You cannot reverse the situation anymore. You cannot demand from Ukraine to recognize some territories as independent republics. These compromises are simply wrong.""

Kremlin spokesman Peskov told reporters Monday that more progress needs to be made before Zelenskyy and Putin could meet to commit to any agreement. Russia's lead negotiator has said in recent days that the sides have moved closer to agreement on the issue of Ukraine dropping its bid to join NATO and adopting neutral status.

Mariupol

Ukraine rejected a Russian ultimatum to surrender the besieged city of Mariupol in the early hours before dawn Monday, as Russian forces carried out more shelling on Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital.

European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell described Russia's actions in Mariupol as ""awful.""

""What's happening in Mariupol is a massive war crime. Destroying everything, bombarding and killing everybody in an indiscriminate manner,"" Borrell said as EU foreign ministers gathered in Brussels.

Shelling hit a shopping center in Kyiv overnight, killing at least eight people, while Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko announced a new curfew until Wednesday morning.

He told The Washington Post on Monday that Russian attacks had destroyed 72 apartment buildings, preschools and other schools, injuring nearly 300 people.

A senior U.S. defense official said Russian forces are still about 15 kilometers northwest of Kyiv.

""They haven't achieved anything in terms of what we assessed to be their objectives, which was population centers, so that they could occupy and take over Ukraine,"" the official added, calling recent actions targeting civilians a ""near-desperate attempt by the Russians to gain some momentum.""

Humanitarian crisis

Millions of people have fled their homes since the invasion.

""The war in Ukraine is so devastating that 10 million have fled — either displaced inside the country or as refugees abroad,"" U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grande tweeted Sunday.

This week, the U.N. General Assembly is expected to resume an ""emergency special session"" to vote on a draft resolution prepared by France and Mexico demanding an immediate stop to Russia's hostilities against Ukraine, especially attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure.

The text also demands the full protection of civilians — including humanitarians, medical personnel, journalists and foreign nationals — and people trying to flee the conflict.

In the besieged city of Mariupol, an art school where about 400 people had found shelter was bombed by Russian forces early Sunday.

Mariupol's city council said the building was destroyed in the attack. Information about survivors was not immediately available.

U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" he thinks Russian forces are resorting to these brutal attacks on civilians because its military ""campaign is stalled.""

""This is really disgusting,"" Austin said.

Just a few days earlier, a Russian airstrike targeted a theater where hundreds of people had been sheltering. The word ""CHILDREN"" had been written in Russian in big letters outside the theater, visible from the sky and on the ground, to alert Russian forces of who was inside.

More than 100 have been rescued from the theater, and it is still unclear how many casualties the attack caused.

The city continues to resist Russian military forces, who are having to engage in attrition tactics and urban fighting that requires going from building to building.

Pentagon correspondent Carla Babb and U.N. correspondent Margaret Besheer contributed to this report.

""They are using the terminology of the Nazi party. This is a tragedy. When they wanted to destroy Europe and have it surrender, they didn’t want to leave any of you remaining. And now us. They called it the final solution to the Jewish question,"" Zelenskyy said while also criticizing Israel for not arming Ukraine.

Either way, the choice is yours to make, brothers and sisters, and you must then live with your answer, the people of Israel,"" The Ukrainian President added.

Before Zelenskyy's speech, Knesset speaker Mickey Levy condemned Russia's attack on Ukraine and sent his condolences to the families of those who were killed and injured in the war.

""I once again condemn the attack on Ukraine, and thank President Zelenskyy for sharing his feelings and the distress of the Ukrainian people with Knesset members and the government,"" Foreign Minister Yair Lapid said after the speech, ""We will continue to assist the Ukrainian people as much as we can and will never turn our back to those who know the horrors of war.""

US HAS NO KNOWLEDGE OF ACTIVITIES AT UKRAINIAN BIOLABS ONCE SEIZED BY RUSSIA: OFFICIALS

Last week, President Joe Biden called Russian President Vladimir Putin a “war criminal,” while the Kremlin called the characterization “unacceptable and unforgivable” and later summoned U.S. Ambassador John Sullivan to inform him that the president's remark ""put Russian-American relations on the verge of rupture.""

Russian forces have largely been unsuccessful in their invasion. They remain on the outskirts of major cities, including Kyiv, the capital, that had been key targets for them even after three-plus weeks. Their stymied progress is in part due to Ukraine's resistance, as well as self-induced problems, including a shortage of food and fuel.

Last week, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the attacks “we’ve seen most recently appear to be focused directly on civilians” and added, “Certainly, we’ve all been shocked by the brutality we continue to witness day in and day out.”

The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

War in Ukraine

Nearly a month after the invasion of Ukraine began, the Pentagon said there's ""clear evidence"" the Russian military is committing war crimes in the country. Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby told Fox & Friends on Tuesday, ""You can see it for yourself in just the video footage that you guys show every day.""

On Monday, Kirby told Voice of America that military forces under Russian President Vladimir Putin were carrying out ""indiscriminate attacks on civilians"" that, in many instances, are ""intentional.""

The State Department has said it's documenting evidence of war crimes in Ukraine, and Kirby told Fox that ""it's important for the investigative process to continue. We're going to contribute to that.""

Kirby's comments come days after US President Joe Biden joined the chorus of officials condemning Russia's actions in Ukraine. Speaking with reporters at the White House on March 16, Biden said of Putin, ""I think he is a war criminal.""

The Kremlin has denied the various allegations and called Biden's remark about Putin ""unworthy of a statesman of such high rank.""

What is a war crime?

According to the International Criminal Court, which investigates and tries individuals for genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and the crime of aggression, war crimes include the murder, torture or enslaving of civilians or prisoners of war; the taking of hostages; raping and looting; the wanton destruction of civilian property; and drafting children under 15 into the military.

Acts committed as part of a systematic attack, including murder, deportation and rape, are also classified as crimes against humanity, which don't have to take place during wartime to be prosecuted.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson levied charges of war crimes against Putin's regime on March 2 in regard to the use of munitions, and the American embassy in Ukraine spoke of war crimes as well, over Russia's taking of the Zaporizhzhia power plant.

In early March, Biden was hesitant to use the term. ""We are following it very closely,"" Biden told reporters on March 2. ""It's too early to say that.""

By March 6, though, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told CNN's Jake Tapper that ""we've seen very credible reports of deliberate attacks on civilians, which would constitute a war crime."" At a March 16 press conference, Biden personally referred to Putin as a ""war criminal"" in talking to reporters at the White House.

What Russian actions are being called war crimes?

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy first accused Russian fighter jets on Feb. 28 of ""brutally"" firing on residential areas in Kharkiv, the country's second-largest city. Dozens of missile attacks, he said, were ""clearly a war crime.""

On March 4, the US embassy in Kyiv described Russia's seizure of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Enerhodar as a war crime that ""takes [Putin's] reign of terror one step further.""

The same day, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Russia's alleged use of cluster bombs, which deliver a deadly rain of smaller ""bomblets,"" also constituted a war crime.

Marina Lystseva/Getty Images

Cluster bombs detonate thousands of feet in the air and release dozens or even hundreds of submunitions over a wide swath. A single cluster bomb attack can ""saturate an area up to the size of several football fields,"" according to the Cluster Munition Coalition, which campaigns against their use.

Cluster bombs were banned by the 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions, though neither Russia nor Ukraine signed that treaty. (The US hasn't either.) Their indiscriminate detonations often maim and kill civilians, and many submunitions don't explode on impact. According to the International Red Cross, they can have a dud rate of up to 40%.

Ukraine's ambassador to the US, Oksana Markarova, has also alleged that Russia has deployed vacuum bombs, which create a devastating fireball that can obliterate anyone or anything in its proximity.

Though vacuum bombs aren't banned by treaty, weapons that indiscriminately attack combatants and civilians alike are prohibited by the Geneva Conventions, which define the rights of noncombatants and wartime prisoners.

Could Putin be charged with war crimes?

The ICC doesn't try entire countries, but rather the officials most responsible for violating laws. Putin could be indicted, even though neither Ukraine nor Russia is a party to the Rome Statute, because Ukraine granted jurisdiction to the ICC in 2013.

Chief ICC prosecutor Karim Khan has opened an investigation into the situation in Ukraine at the request of 39 member states. A review is also underway at the State Department to review possible war crimes in Ukraine, Psaki said.

ALEXEY NIKOLSKY/AFP/Getty Images

UK Justice Secretary Dominic Raab is in The Hague this week to help make sure that ""when that prosecution comes, the court will have what it needs,"" Health Secretary Sajid Javid said.

Top military leaders and Kremlin officials could also be charged, as could Russian oligarchs, who, the White House alleges, enabled ""Putin's war of choice.""

But whether anyone would actually stand trial is another matter: The ICC doesn't hold trials in absentia, so Putin would have to surrender himself to authorities, which would almost certainly require a regime change in Russia.

If an arrest warrant was issued while he was still head of state, it would severely restrict his ability to travel outside Russia, because all 123 member states of the ICC would be obligated to turn him over if he stepped foot in their country.

Bill Wiley of the Commission for International Justice and Accountability told The Guardian that building a war crimes case ""is extremely difficult.""

""International humanitarian law makes tremendous allowance -- more than people realize -- for incidental, or what the media calls collateral damage,"" Wiley said.

Prosecution of war crimes requires numerous steps, Marti Flacks, director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies' Human Rights Initiative, told Euronews, including the collection of evidence and interviews with witnesses.

""Trying to do this in the context of an ongoing active war makes it difficult"" to perform those duties, Flacks added.

A verdict may not be reached for a decade or longer: An investigation into alleged war crimes in Darfur started in 2005 and is still ongoing.

How has Moscow responded to war crimes allegations?

The Kremlin has ""categorically denied"" the accusations, insisting that Russian forces have targeted only Ukrainian military facilities and blaming Ukraine extremists for putting civilians in jeopardy.

Russia's Foreign Ministry said Biden calling Putin a war criminal was ""unacceptable and unforgivable rhetoric"" that put Russian-American relations ""on the verge of rupture.""

On Monday, the ministry said it presented US Ambassador John Sullivan a formal letter of protest about Biden's ""unacceptable statements"" and warned that ""hostile actions taken against Russia would receive a firm and decisive response.""

Who prosecutes war crimes?

Established by the Rome Statute of 1998, the International Criminal Court is an independent entity based in The Hague and empowered to prosecute individuals for four primary offenses: war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide, and the crime of aggression.

Normally, the ICC's 18 judges can hear a case only if the perpetrator or the country where the alleged offenses took place is party to the Rome Statute. But member states can refer a case, as can the UN Security Council. Some 123 countries are under the ICC's jurisdiction, including Australia, Canada, half of Africa, most of Europe and all of South America.

Another 31 countries signed the Rome Statute but never ratified it, including the US, Israel, Russia and Ukraine, which has on occasion accepted the ICC's jurisdiction.

Russia pulled out of the court in 2016, days after the ICC said in a report that the country's actions in Crimea amounted to ""an on-going state of occupation.""

China, Indonesia and India are among the 41 countries that haven't signed the Rome Statute.

The ICC's first conviction, in 2012, was against Congo militia leader Thomas Lubanga for conscripting children into his army. In addition to the Ukraine crisis, the ICC is currently investigating possible war crimes in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic, Kenya, Sudan and Uganda.

Why isn't the US a member of the ICC?

In 2000, then-President Bill Clinton signed the Rome Statute that created the court, but the treaty was never ratified by the US Senate.

Two years later, then-President George W. Bush withdrew the US from the treaty, with press secretary Ari Fleischer calling the court fundamentally flawed because ""it can subject American civilians and military to arbitrary standards of justice.""

Over the years, US officials have also alleged that the ICC lacks certain aspects of due process, including the right to a speedy trial, reasonable bail, jury trials and the prohibition against hearsay testimony.

Bush's successor, President Barack Obama, restored relations with the court, but only as an observer state.

How were war crimes tried before the ICC?

Previously, the UN's International Criminal Tribunal was responsible for investigating war crimes. It charged Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic in 1999, and between 1994 and 2016 it prosecuted top government officials charged with responsibility for the Rwandan genocide.

The Nuremberg trials, held immediately after World War II, marked the first prosecutions for crimes against humanity and genocide. Two dozen top Nazi leaders were tried by the Allies. Half were found guilty, including Hermann Goring, who founded the Gestapo, and Rudolf Hess, who drafted laws depriving German Jews of their civil liberties.",https://www.cnet.com/news/politics/pentagon-says-clear-evidence-russia-is-committing-war-crimes-could-putin-be-prosecuted/
