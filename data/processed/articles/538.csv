Foreign volunteers who join Ukrainian forces in the fight against Russia will be granted citizenship by the Ukrainian government if they want, a Ukrainian government official said.

Supporters who travel to Ukraine and enlist into the volunteer force will receive a military card from the state’s Border Guard service and, in the future, the volunteers will be among a group of foreign nationals who are qualified to seek citizenship, First Deputy Interior Minister Yevhen Yenin said, Ukrinform reported.

Last month, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced he was forming an ""international brigade"" of volunteers to join him in the fight against Russia.

The announcement came in tandem with vocal frustrations about the international community and their apparent lack of help.

Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba clarified that the fighting force will ""defend Ukraine and world order as part of the International Legion of Territorial Defense of Ukraine.""

Since the Feb. 27 announcement, over 20,000 volunteers from 52 countries have signed up to fight in Ukraine, Kuleba said Sunday, Time reported.

The fighters have joined from European countries, including Poland, Denmark, and Latvia, whose governments have enabled their citizens to more easily join the fighting.

The Ukrainian government has been appealing to foreign citizens to help fight the Russian invasion. Despite the immense personal risk and uncertain legal grounds, some are responding to the call.

On Tuesday, Ukraine temporarily lifted visa requirements for foreign volunteers who wish to enter the country and fight against Putin's Russia. This came after President Volodymyr Zelenskyy created the International Legion of Territorial Defense and called on volunteers to “join the defence of Ukraine, Europe, and the world.”

Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on Sunday said that anyone interested in participating in their war against Russia should contact Ukraine’s diplomatic missions in their respective countries. “Together we defeated Hitler, and we will defeat Putin, too,” Kuleba had said.

Since 2014, when Russia-backed separatists seized parts of the Donbas region, foreign citizens have been fighting in Ukraine. While Western governments have extended support for those who wish to join Zelensky's side, Ukrainian embassies are openly involved in the recruitment of fighters.

Russia-Ukraine war

Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) on Tuesday said that since Russia's begun military operations, over 12,000 Russian forces have been killed. About 1036 armoured vehicles of different types, 48 aircraft, 80 helicopters, 303 tanks, 120 artillery pieces, and 56 MLRs were hit during the combat, according to the MFA data.

On Tuesday, following Russia announcing ceasefire from 10 am (Moscow time) to provide humanitarian corridors in the cities of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, and Mariupol, the war-hit country Ukraine began the evacuation of civilians including foreign students from Sumy to Poltava.

Earlier on Monday, the third round of talks between Ukraine and Russia was held in Belarus which was focused on opening humanitarian corridors from Ukrainian cities under fire. As a negotiator from Kyiv spoke of ""positive results"", Russia disagreed on the outcome and said their expectations were ""not fulfilled"".

It sure isn’t the most desirable of all places to hold citizenship.

Some of its recent woes could be overlooked, though, if what you got in return was a European passport.

But, unlike a passport from Ireland, Poland, or Italy, all of which are European Union countries, Ukraine probably won’t be part of the EU for another good decade.

So, what does Ukraine have going for itself that could entice people who have heritage in this Eastern European country to apply for its citizenship?

For starters, it’s passport ranks 41st in the world – not too shabby. You’d be able to travel to 129 countries visa-free, which puts Ukraine on par with some of the Caribbean countries that offer citizenship by investment (CBI).

However, the CBI programs cost a considerable amount of money – think six digits – whereas you’re able to get a Ukrainian passport by descent for a low government fee.

And while it’s not the fastest bureaucratic process in the world, citizenship by descent can be that perfect catalyst that you may need to finally embrace the Nomad Capitalist lifestyle.

Do you have Ukrainian roots and want to take this citizenship thing further?

We’ve recently launched our all-inclusive citizenship by descent service. Taking care of proving your eligibility and going through the entire application process for you is what we do best.

What Is Citizenship by Descent?

If you never thought about getting a second passport before, thinking about citizenship might feel weird.

It’s one’s birthright, usually, and most people don’t give it a second thought.

However, if you’re someone who wants more out of life, considering what citizenship lets you accomplish is essential.

Every citizenship has its pros and cons, from visa-free travel to taxation. Needless to say, some are more valuable than others.

You can obtain it by birth, marriage, naturalization, or investment, among other means.

One of those is ancestry.

Citizenship by descent is when one is eligible to apply and receive the citizenship of his or her ancestors.

It’s mostly the European countries that went through a tumultuous 20th century that offer the descendants of its past citizens a chance to ‘come back to the homeland.’

For example, Lithuania is one of those countries, whose people were prosecuted, jailed, exiled, or had to flee the country due to their ethnicity, religion, and political beliefs.

Their descendants, thus, have a chance to regain Lithuanian citizenship.

Ukraine is another such country, welcoming its long-gone citizens back into the fold.

Ukrainian Citizenship by Ancestry

Citizenship in Ukraine is governed by jus sanguinis, or right of blood. What this means is that the location of one’s birth doesn’t matter, but parental citizenship does.

So, if your mother or father is Ukrainian, you have the right to Ukrainian citizenship by birth.

And when it comes to citizenship by descent, the same principle applies. A Ukrainian ancestor will have passed down the citizenship via the bloodline to you.

However, to apply for Ukrainian citizenship because you have roots in the country, you’ll first have to prove your eligibility.

Eligibility

Even though the countries that offer citizenship by descent will make it seem like they want everyone to come over and reclaim their citizenship, the reality is a little different.

Because the process usually doesn’t cost that much, the government employees aren’t going to bend over backward to grant you citizenship.

Thus, you must build a bulletproof case for yourself; the burden of proof of your claim to Ukrainian citizenship falls solely on your shoulders (or the shoulders of the professionals you’ve hired to help you).

To prove your eligibility, you must have at least one person tying you to Ukraine:



• A Ukrainian parent who was born or permanently resided in the territory of Ukraine before August 24, 1991.

• A Ukrainian grandparent who was born or permanently resided in the territory of Ukraine before August 24, 1991.

• A sibling (or half-sibling) who was born or permanently resided in the territory of Ukraine before August 24, 1991.

• A child who was born or permanently resided in the territory of Ukraine before August 24, 1991.

Seems pretty straightforward, right?

It normally is, if the records of your ancestors were made after 1917. Before then, paper records simply weren’t kept.

In the period between 1917-1945, the paperwork will normally be available at the location where your relative was born and/or a resident in. So, you or your hired help will need to physically travel to that location and dig around in the local archives, or the church archives. This will, obviously, extend the entire application process.

If, however, your relative in question was born in 1945 or thereafter, you’re in luck. Records were being kept much better after that date and were all centralized as much as was possible.

Have a relative born in 1945 or later? Then you’ll need to access the main register of civil acts or have a look at the national archives.

Application Process

After you’ve had a chance to establish your eligibility, you’ll need to lodge an application. This can be done in Ukraine itself or in your nearest Ukrainian embassy or consulate.

When compared to some of the other citizenship by descent processes, Ukraine deals with its cases relatively quickly. Usually, you’ll be able to get your passport in under a year.

You will have to submit the following documents in order to apply:

A filled out application requesting Ukrainian citizenship based on your ancestry. 8 colored photos. Your passport. Documents (birth certificates, marriage certificates, death certificates, and others) confirming the fact of birth or the permanent residence of your parent, grandparent, sibling, or child in Ukraine. Proof of familial ties to the relative in question. police record from your current country of residence. A request for changing your citizenship. A request to register the place of your residence in Ukraine.

Needless to say, all of the documents which aren’t in Ukrainian will have to be apostilled, translated, and properly notarized to be accepted.

Fast-forward to the day you’re handed down a positive decision on your Ukrainain citizenship – congratulations!

You are now legally considered a citizen of Ukraine.

But, to obtain a Ukranian travel document – its passport – you will need to renounce your current citizenship(s), as Ukraine does not allow dual citizenship.

The country’s officials give you two years to do so.

You’ll need to not only renounce your citizenship but also to obtain proof that you’ve done so. Only then will you be handed your Ukrainian passport.

The Pros and Cons of Ukrainian Citizenship

You’ve got a Ukrainian relative who makes you eligible to apply for a Ukrainian passport, but should you do it?

Whenever we talk about passports, there are two factors that we consider.

First, we think about what the pros of this additional passport would bring the person. The Ukrainian passport has some obvious ones:

• It provides visa-free movement in the European Union. All you’ve got to do is fill out a visa-waiver application online before you travel.

• It has a favorable tax environment. You won’t be taxed to death as an individual and as a company if you live and work in Ukraine.

• Ukraine is an affordable place to live. You can live like royalty for a fraction of the cost.

• Its passport is a decent travel document. Ranked 41st in the world, you’ll be able to visit many countries visa-free.

Second, we also think about how easy it would be to get out of this citizenship.

After all, you’d want to be able to renounce this citizenship if the conditions were to change. For example, Ukraine could raise its taxes considerably or start taxing your worldwide income without exceptions.

Luckily, Ukraine makes it pretty easy to renounce its citizenship voluntarily. You’ll need to visit a diplomatic mission in any country in the world with a Ukrainian witness present to do so.

You’ll also automatically lose your Ukrainian citizenship if you obtain another citizenship or join the military or governmental service of another nation.

As you can already tell, dual citizenship isn’t possible in Ukraine and that’s the biggest con of going for Ukraine’s citizenship by descent.

However, there are many different ways to circumvent the law legally and there are hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians who also hold another citizenship.

That said, you’ll only be considered a Ukrainian citizen in its territory if you have its passport, which means you won’t be able to receive any diplomatic help from the embassy of your other citizenship.

Is Ukrainian Citizenship by Descent Worth Your While?

Let us be frank – Ukrainian citizenship isn’t nearly as great as some of the other citizenships that are offered by way of descent.

It’s lacking two essential things: the dual citizenship aspect and the European Union connection.

Neither of these is likely to change anytime soon.

As for dual citizenship, the chances of things changing for the better are low to none. The main legislative body of Ukraine called the Rada even proposed to criminalize dual citizenship, though no legal moves have been made yet.

Similarly, the president of the European Union, Jean-Claude Juncker has said that he doesn’t expect Ukraine to be able to join the Union for another 20-30 years.

All of this makes Ukrainian citizenship by descent quite a complicated matter.

If you feel strongly that want to go back to your roots and hold the citizenship of the country of your relatives (and renouncing all other citizenships), you may do so relatively easily.

Ukraine does have some incredible opportunities in terms of investment, sometimes rivaling those of Africa and Asia.

And life in Ukraine is of a pretty high standard, and affordable too.

Getting your citizenship by descent in Ukraine won’t cost much and will only take a year, if you’re interested.

Not Allowed

The acquisition of nationality in Ukraine is based on both ius sanguinis and/or ius soli principles depending on the specific situation and respective backgrounds of the case.

Ukrainian citizenship can be acquired by one of the following procedures: Restoration; Naturalisation; Adoption; Affiliation (very similar to the acquisition of the Ukrainian citizenship by birth, when one of the parents of a child is a foreigner or stateless person and the other parent is Ukrainian); Establishment of guardianship over a person (child or an incapable person) by Ukrainian citizen; or by other grounds foreseen by the international treaties of Ukraine.

The Constitution of Ukraine states that only sole citizenship is permitted in Ukraine. However, Ukrainian citizenship is not automatically lost in the case of acquiring foreign citizenship. The termination process for a Ukrainian citizenship is complex, and there is an absence of a mechanism for the state authorities to become aware of the acquisition of another foreign citizenship by the Ukrainian citizens, as well as an absence of criminal or administrative responsibility for obtaining second citizenship. All of this leads to the numerous cases of dual citizenship.

Under Ukrainian legislation, if a citizen of Ukraine acquires the citizenship of another state, such a person is still only recognized as a citizen of Ukraine in legal relations.

Dual citizenship also legally exists due to the ratification by Ukraine of the European Convention on Nationality, according to which the participants of the treaty are required to recognize multiple citizenships in certain cases. For example, children born to parents from different countries are allowed to keep two citizenships.

However, it should be stressed that while there is no direct and clearly expressed ban of dual citizenship for the Ukrainian citizens, foreigners are demanded to renounce their original citizenship if they desire to obtain citizenship of Ukraine by naturalisation. Such foreigners undertaking to withdraw their original citizenship, can do this during a 2-year period and until such a withdrawal is made, they would not receive passports as citizens of Ukraine, but instead, temporary identity cards as citizens of Ukraine.",https://www.dualcitizenshipreport.org/dual-citizenship/ukraine/

Since the inception of the war, several Ukrainian politicians, beauty queens, civilians, and even foreign volunteers have taken up guns to defend the country against a full-scale Russian invasion. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began on February 24. Since then, Zelenskyy has repeatedly demanded the UN, NATO and the EU to give arms and ammunition to his country.

World governments have acknowledged this by delivering financial and military aid to Ukraine. They have also put sanctions on Russian business people and members of President Vladimir Putin‘s regime, including Putin himself. In a television address on Sunday, Dmytro Kuleba said: ‘The whole world today is on Ukraine’s side not only in words but in deeds.’

Then, the statement continued, ‘If you want actively participate in fighting for European freedom and democracy. If you have combat experience or want to gain it standing with brave Ukrainian defenders. THIS IS TIME TO ACT!’

National Security Council Senior Director Juan Gonzalez and Venezuela Affairs Unit Chief James Story met embattled Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and his wife on Saturday — the first since diplomatic relations between the two countries broke down in 2019.

Coverage of the meeting has, so far, focused on the possibility the White House might lift some of the sanctions it has imposed in recent years on the Venezuelan oil industry in order to replace imports from Russia, which US President Joe Biden banned earlier today.

Context: Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world — and historically, much of its crude oil has been exported to US refineries.

Venezuelan oil: Maduro confirmed Venezuela’s intention to increase its crude oil output on Monday, a move that comes as Russia’s oil exports are plummeting due to sanctions over its invasion in Ukraine.

“We are ready to regain production. One, two, or three million barrels, everything! Everything in the name of peace!” he said.

American deal might be easier said than done: Oil production in the country is at an almost all-time low after years of mismanagement and lack of maintenance of oil facilities.

It would take years, and billions of dollars of investments, to recover oil exports from Venezuela to what they used to be, suggests expert Francisco Monaldi, director of the Latin American Energy Program at the Baker Institute in Houston. So if the White House needs a short-term solution to lower the price of gasoline, it cannot come from Venezuela.

US citizens released: However, the US officials’ Venezuelan deployment did bring some immediate results. Venezuela released at least two US citizens late Tuesday, with speculation it was done as a ""sign of goodwill"" from Maduro (and as part of potential sanctions relief) that has yet to happen.

This undated file photo posted on Twitter on June 18, 2020 by Venezuela's Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza, shows CITGO oil executives, from left to right, Jose Angel Pereira, Gustavo Cardenas, Jorge Toledo, Jose Luis Zambrano, Tomeu Vadell and Alirio Jose Zambrano, standing outside the Bolivarian National Intelligence Service, in Caracas, Venezuela. (Jorge Arreaza/Venezuela's Foreign Ministry via AP/FILE)

Gustavo Cárdenas is a US citizen detained in Caracas since 2017 and one of six detained oil executives from US refinery CITGO. Later, Jorge Alberto Fernandez, a Cuban-US dual citizen detained in Venezuela since February 2021, was released from prison. He is not one of the so-called ""CITGO 6.""

The Caracas trip signals the intention that the White House might be ready to change its relationship to Venezuela in the long term. That’s because Caracas has grown much closer to Moscow under Maduro’s rule.

But it is a high stakes bet: Maduro has walked away from negotiations before — and if it doesn’t work out, Biden will likely pay a political price.",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-08-22/index.html
