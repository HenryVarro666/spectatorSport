0,7df25b10-78e6-4124-8064-547335503961,[],2022-03-28 00:00:00,"March 28 (Reuters) - The Kremlin said that peace talks between Russia and Ukraine may get under way in Turkey on Tuesday and it was important that they would take place face-to-face, after what it described as a lack of major progress in negotiations so far.

Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan agreed in a telephone call on Sunday for Istanbul to host the talks, which Ankara hopes will lead to a ceasefire in Ukraine.

Turkey said the talks could begin as early as Monday, but Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that was unlikely as the negotiators would only be arriving in Turkey on Monday.

""While we cannot and will not speak about progress at the talks, the fact that they continuing to take place in person is important, of course,"" Peskov told reporters on a conference call.

""We are adhering to a policy of not disclosing any information about the talks, which we think could only hurt the negotiation process.""

Peskov added that no major progress had been made in the talks themselves, or on the idea of a potential meeting between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

""Unfortunately we cannot see any substantial achievements or breakthroughs (in the talks) so far,"" he said.

In separate comments, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said a meeting between the two leaders would be counterproductive if it were held now. He said they should meet once the sides achieve progress.

""A meeting between Putin and Zelenskiy is needed as soon as we will be close to resolving all key issues,"" Lavrov said in an interview with Serbian media.

Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a special operation to degrade its southern neighbour's military capabilities and root out people it called dangerous nationalists.

Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in an effort to force it to withdraw its forces.

Zelenskiy said in a video address early on Wednesday: “Ukrainians have already learned during these 34 days of invasion and over the past eight years of the war in Donbas that only a concrete result can be trusted.”

Russia’s deputy defence minister Alexander Fomin said after talks in Istanbul on Tuesday that Moscow wanted to “increase mutual trust, create the right conditions for future negotiations and reach the final aim of signing a peace deal with Ukraine”, and that the Kremlin would “radically reduce military activity in the direction of Kyiv and Chernihiv”.

Ukraine’s president said that while there had been “positive” signals from the latest talks, “they do not drown out the explosions of Russian shells”. “The enemy is still in our territory,” he said. “The shelling of our cities continues. Mariupol is blocked. Missile and airstrikes do not stop. This is the reality. These are the facts.”

Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces said in its latest intelligence report on Tuesday night that Russian troops continued to withdraw from the territory of Kyiv and Chernihiv but the movement is merely “a rotation of individual units” and aims to “mislead the military leadership” of Ukraine.

The scepticism echoes that of experts and western diplomats and leaders, who expressed doubts that the move was more than a ploy to dress up setbacks on the ground.

An unconvinced Joe Biden said: “We’ll see. I don’t read anything into it until I see what their actions are.”

While Moscow presented its move as a goodwill gesture, it came as Russia’s advance appeared to have stalled on several fronts, with the Kremlin’s forces thwarted by stiff Ukrainian resistance, heavy losses and logistical and tactical failings.

Having failed to seize the Ukrainian capital and force an early capitulation, Moscow said last week it was shifting its focus to expanding the territory held by pro-Russia separatists in the eastern Donbas region. The defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said hours before the talks the “main goal” was now the “liberation” of Donbas.

The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said he had not seen anything indicating that talks were progressing in a “constructive way” and suggested Russian indications of a pullback could be an attempt by Moscow to “deceive people and deflect attention”.

Speaking on a visit to Morocco, Blinken said that there was “what Russia says, and what Russia does, and we’re focused on the latter. What Russia is doing is the continued brutalisation of Ukraine.”

A spokesperson for Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, said the UK had seen signs of “some reduction” in Russian bombardment around Kyiv, but added: “We will judge Putin and his regime by his actions, not by his words … We don’t want to see anything less than a complete withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukrainian territory.”

The UK’s Ministry of Defence (MoD) said in its latest updated that “it is almost certain that the Russian offensive has failed in its objective to encircle Kyiv”. The UK defence attaché Mick Smeath in a statement: “Russian statements regarding a reduction in activity around Kyiv, and reporting indicating the withdrawal of some Russian units from these areas, may indicate Russia’s acceptance that it has now lost the initiative in the region.” He added: “It is highly likely that Russia will seek to divert combat power from the north to their offensive in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in the east.”

Western officials were “very wary” about the promises, saying the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, could be temporising. “Certainly in terms of the negotiations, nothing that we have seen so far has demonstrated to us that Putin and his colleagues are particularly serious,” one said. “It’s more of a tactical exercise in playing for time.”

John Kirby, press secretary at the Pentagon, warned against “fooling ourselves” over the Kremlin’s claims. “Has there been some movement by some Russian units away from Kyiv in the last day or so? Yeah, we think so, small numbers,” he said. “But we believe that this is a repositioning, not a real withdrawal, and that we all should be prepared to watch for a major offensive against other areas of Ukraine.”

Ukraine presented Russian negotiators in Istanbul with a framework for peace under which it would remain neutral with its security guaranteed by third-party countries including the US, the UK, France, Turkey, China and Poland, in an arrangement similar to Nato’s article 5, which commits members to defend one another.

It also said it would be willing to agree to a 15-year consultation period on the status of Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, with both countries agreeing not to use their militaries to resolve the issue in the meantime, and called for Russia to drop its objection to Ukrainian membership of the EU.

The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, said “both sides are getting closer at every stage”, adding that the Istanbul talks could lead in the first instance to a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers.

However, analysts warned that the demands were unlikely to be readily accepted by the Kremlin. “I would be very careful about getting too optimistic. We have only heard the Ukrainian proposals. We need to wait for Russia’s responses,” said Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Centre.

Gabuev said Kyiv’s proposals “would look like a loss to Putin, who in his mind already settled the Crimean question a long time ago”. Russia’s military pullback “could just be a temporary strategic move”, he added.

The senior Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak described Kyiv’s proposal on guaranteed neutrality as “an effective tool for protecting our territory and sovereignty”, with “the leading armies of the world becoming guarantors and assuming specific legal obligations” to intervene in the event of aggression.

The proposal on Crimea was also “revolutionary”, Podolyak said, not only because it meant “the return of the topic of Crimea to the negotiating agenda” but because it would “allow us to preserve the current legal interpretations of Crimea, since Crimea is, of course, a part of Ukraine for us”.

Even as the peace negotiators began their work, however, Zelenskiy, said in a speech to the Danish parliament that at least seven people had been killed and 22 injured in a Russian strike on a regional government building in the southern port of Mykolaiv. “People are still going through the rubble,” he said.

Zelenskiy also called the Russian bombardment and siege of the port city of Mariupol, where local officials have said at least 5,000 people have died, a “crime against humanity … happening in front of the eyes of the whole planet, in real time”.

Russia’s foreign ministry said in a Telegram post on Tuesday night that Putin had told Emmanuel Macron in a phone call that “Ukrainian nationalist militants” in Mariupol must lay down their weapons in order to resolve the humanitarian crisis there.

MOSCOW, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Russian and Ukrainian delegations will likely meet in Turkey on Tuesday, the Kremlin said Monday.

""The very fact that it was decided to continue in-person negotiations is important,"" local media reported, citing Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov.

""Today, the delegation is leaving for Turkey... we expect that theoretically, talks could continue tomorrow,"" he said, adding that the negotiations would unlikely resume today.

Peskov noted that while face-to-face negotiations are more focused, and both sides can cover more issues, there are still no clear signs of a breakthrough.

Meanwhile, David Arakhamia, a member of the Ukrainian delegation, told Interfax-Ukraine news agency on Monday that the next round of peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia will start on Tuesday in Turkey.

The start of the negotiations has been postponed due to logistics issues, he added.

On Sunday, Arakhamia wrote on Facebook that the talks will take place in Turkey on March 28-30.

The Ukrainian and Russian delegations have held three rounds of negotiations in person in Belarus since Feb. 28, and the fourth one started on March 14 in the format of a video conference. ■",http://www.news.cn/english/20220328/00c3f602cd2f49fa857072992319a735/c.html

5:30 am Tuesday: Ukrainian and Russian delegations prepare for talks

Ukraine said its top objective at the first face-to-face talks with Russia in over two weeks, due to take place in Turkey on Tuesday, is to secure a ceasefire, although both it and the United States were skeptical of a major breakthrough.

Ahead of the talks, to be held in Istanbul, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country is prepared to declare its neutrality, as Moscow has demanded, and is open to compromise on the fate of the Donbas, the contested region in the country’s east.

1:10 am Tuesday: Russian tactics in Ukraine 'repeat' of Syria war, says Amnesty

Amnesty International on Tuesday slammed ""war crimes"" in Ukraine, as the civilian toll continues to rise after Russia's invasion, likening the situation to the Syrian war.

""What is happening in Ukraine is a repetition of what we have seen in Syria,"" Agnes Callamard, secretary general of the global rights watchdog, told AFP.

She was speaking in Johannesburg at the launch of the rights group's annual report on the state of human rights in the world.

""We are beyond indiscriminate attacks. We are in the midst of deliberate attacks on civilian infrastructure,"" she said, accusing Russia of turning humanitarian corridors into ""death traps"".

""We see the same thing here, just as Russia did in Syria"".

12:45 am Tuesday: Ukraine's Zelensky says tougher Russian sanctions needed quickly

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday urged Western nations to toughen sanctions quickly against Russia, including an oil embargo, to stop Moscow having a free hand to escalate its measures against his country.

In his nightly video address to Ukrainians, a clearly irritated Zelensky said the West had miscalculated last year in delaying sanctions and the invasion had followed.

""A full-scale war has begun. Now there are many hints and warnings that supposedly tougher sanctions, such as an embargo on Russian oil supplies to Europe, will be put in place if Russia uses chemical weapons,"" Zelensky said, occasionally banging his hands on a table.

""There are simply no words ... We, people who are alive, have to wait. Doesn't everything the Russia military has done to date warrant an oil embargo? Don't phosphorous bombs warrant it? A shelled chemical production facility or a shelled nuclear power plant doesn't warrant it?""

12:30 am Tuesday: Kremlin spokesman: Russia would use nuclear weapons only in case of 'threat to existence of state'

Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov told PBS in an interview on Monday that Russia would resort to nuclear weapons only in the case of a ""threat to the existence"" of his country – and not as a result of the current conflict with Ukraine.

""But any outcome of the operation (in Ukraine), of course is not a reason for usage of a nuclear weapon,"" Peskov said. ""We have a security concept that very clearly states that only when there is a threat for existence of the state, in our country, we can use and we will actually use nuclear weapons to eliminate the threat for the existence of our country.""

11:10 pm Monday: British intelligence says Russia's Wagner Group deployed to eastern Ukraine

British military intelligence said on Monday the Russian private military company, the Wagner Group, has been deployed to eastern Ukraine.

“They are expected to deploy more than 1,000 mercenaries, including senior leaders of the organisation, to undertake combat operations,” Britain’s Ministry of Defence said.

9:27 pm: Biden says 'moral outrage' behind Putin comment, not policy change

US President Joe Biden said Monday his remark in Warsaw that Russian President Vladimir Putin should be removed from power reflected his own moral outrage, not an administration policy shift.

""I wasn’t then nor am I now articulating a policy change. I was expressing moral outrage that I felt and I make no apologies,"" he said, noting that he had just visited with families displaced by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Biden added that he was ""not walking anything back"" by clarifying the remark. Asked whether the remark would spur a negative response from Putin, Biden said, ""I don’t care what he thinks. ... He’s going to do what he’s going to do.""

7:37 pm: Ukraine says it has 'proof' banned weapons used in Odesa, Kherson

Ukraine has proof Russian forces have used banned cluster bombs in two southern regions of the country, Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova said Monday.

Cluster bombs spread dozens of tiny explosive charges across an area, some of which may not immediately explode and in effect become anti-personnel mines that pose a threat to civilians long after a conflict ends.

Asked by journalists about the use of such munitions by Russians in their bombardments of the Ukrainian capital since the invasion began over a month ago, Venediktova said she didn't have concrete proof but that investigations were under way.

""But ... we have proof of the utilisation of cluster bombs in the Odesa region and in the Kherson area,"" she said. Pressure groups like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have said they have collected proof of use of cluster bombs in areas where civilians were present in Ukraine.

6:00 pm: Ukrainian forces retake control of town of Irpin, officials say

Irpin Mayor Oleksandr Markushyn said on Monday that Ukrainian forces had retaken full control of the town, one of the hotspots of battles with Russian troops near the capital Kyiv.

""We have good news today – Irpin has been liberated,"" Markushyn said in a video post on Telegram. ""We understand that there will be more attacks on our town and we will defend it courageously.""

In televised remarks late on Monday, Interior Minister Denys Monastyrsky confirmed that Ukrainian forces had ""liberated"" the Kyiv suburb of Irpin.

""In fact, this is now happening in parallel: the armed forces are advancing, the police are advancing, and immediately a sweep is going on completely through the streets ... Therefore, the city has now been liberated, but it is still dangerous to be there, "" Monastyrsky said.

4:32 pm: Ukraine puts € 515 billion price tag on Russian war damage

The Ukrainian government estimated on Monday the economic losses from the Russian invasion, which has been underway for just over one month, at nearly $565 billion (€515 billion).

Ukraine’s economy minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, said on Facebook that the estimate includes immediate damage plus expected losses in trade and economic activity.

""It should be noted that every day the numbers change and unfortunately they are increasing,"" said Svyrydenko, who is also a deputy prime minister.

Damage to public and private property -- with Russian forces resorting to fierce bombardments that have levelled some cities as their invasion has stalled -- was the biggest element.

Svyrydenko estimatedgross domestic product in 2022 would be down by $112 billion (€102 billion), which would be a drop of more than 55 percent of Ukraine's economic activity last year.

3:59 pm: Russia to limit entry for 'unfriendly' states, says Lavrov

Russia said on Monday it was preparing to restrict entry into Russia for nationals of ""unfriendly"" countries, which include Britain, all EU states and the United States.

""A draft presidential decree is being developed on retaliatory visa measures in response to the 'unfriendly' actions of a number of foreign states,"" Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in televised remarks.

""This act will introduce a number of restrictions on entry into Russia,"" he added without elaborating.

After the West piled unprecedented sanctions on Moscow following Russian President Vladimir Putin's decision to send troops into Ukraine, Russia expanded the list of what it calls ""unfriendly"" countries.

They now include the United States, Australia, Canada, Britain, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, all EU member states and several others.

2:09 pm: Top Russian independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta suspends publication

Russia's top independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta, whose chief editor was last year awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, said Monday it was suspending publication until the end of Moscow's military action in Ukraine.

Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Monday and echoed calls for an immediate ceasefire made by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which Cambodia currently chairs.

Hun Sen invoked Cambodia's own history of occupation by Vietnam and cast doubt on Russia's ability to capture the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.

""I still stand in solidarity with Ukrainian people against the invasion,"" he said on the sidelines of a hospital inauguration event.

10:01 am: Ukraine won’t open evacuation corridors due to possible Russian ‘provocations’

Ukraine has no plans to open humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians from besieged cities on Monday because of intelligence reports warning of possible Russian ""provocations"" along the routes, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said.

Vadym Boichenko, the mayor of Mariupol, said about 160,000 civilians were trapped in the port city without power. Twenty-six buses were waiting to evacuate civilians but Russian forces had not agreed to give them safe passage, he said.

""The Russian Federation is playing with us,"" Boichenko said.

9:23 am: Turkey among countries that could become ‘guarantors’ of Ukraine’s security, Kyiv says

Turkey is among countries that could offer Kyiv security guarantees as part of any deal with Russia to end the war in Ukraine, a senior Ukrainian official said on Monday.

6:30 am: Talks in Turkey, ‘catastrophic’ situation in Mariupol: Here’s what you need to know

Russian and Ukrainian negotiators will resume face-to-face peace talks as soon as Monday, probing whether a near-stalemate in fighting has forced Moscow to temper its demands.

President Volodymyr Zelensky hailed the new negotiations, saying he hoped they would bring peace “without delay”, and lamented a month-long Russian invasion that has already killed thousands and devastated numerous Ukrainian cities.

The new talks are set to start in Turkey on either Monday or Tuesday, with Zelensky desperate to halt the bombardment of cities like Mariupol, where officials said the situation is “catastrophic”.

About 170,000 civilians remain trapped in Mariupol without adequate food, water or medicine, as the southern port city is being turned “into dust” by Russian shelling, according to Ukraine’s foreign ministry.

France, Greece and Turkey are hoping to launch a “humanitarian operation” to evacuate civilians within days, according to French President Emmanuel Macron, who has sought an OK from his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.

Several previous rounds of peace talks have failed to halt the fighting or overcome fundamental disagreements about Kyiv’s alignment with the West and Russia’s occupation of Ukrainian territory.

But with Russia’s much-larger military humbled by fierce Ukrainian resistance and forced to abandon efforts to capture Kyiv, there is renewed hope for talks.

“Our goal is obvious—peace and the restoration of normal life in our native state as soon as possible,” Zelensky said in a late-night video message that also set out his negotiating red lines.

“Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are beyond doubt. Effective security guarantees for our state are mandatory,” he said.

Zelensky has indicated he is “carefully” considering a Russian demand of Ukrainian “neutrality”.

“This point of the negotiations is understandable to me and it is being discussed, it is being carefully studied,” Zelensky said during an interview with several independent Russian news organisations on Sunday.

U.N. head pursuing humanitarian cease-fire in Ukraine U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said Monday he has asked an official to explore a humanitarian cease-fire in Ukraine. Guterres said he asked Martin Griffiths, under-secretary-general at the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, to start immediately and that ""he already made some contacts."" ""I think this is the moment in which I believe it makes sense for the U.N. to assume the initiative,"" Guterres told reporters. There have been agreements for humanitarian corridors in Ukraine, but relief efforts for some areas, including the besieged city of Mariupol, have been disrupted by shelling. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a video address Monday that ""the Russian army did not let us organize a single humanitarian corridor today, did not provide cease-fire."" Russia attacked and invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 in an assault that has been condemned by the U.S., European countries and other nations. Guterres also called for ""military de-escalation and rhetoric de-escalation"" after he was asked about President Joe Biden's remark in Poland that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""cannot remain in power."" Biden said he was expressing his moral outrage, not signaling a policy change. Share this -







Zelenskyy calls for tougher sanctions against Russia, oil embargo Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called Monday for tougher sanctions against Russia. He criticized what he said were hints surrounding conditions for Europe to impose an embargo on Russian oil. ""Right now there are a lot of hints and warnings that strengthening of sanctions, for example an embargo on Russian oil to Europe, will happen only if Russia uses chemical weapons,"" Zelenskyy said in a video address. ""I am simply speechless. Just think about what it all came to, waiting for chemical weapons."" President Joe Biden announced a ban on Russian oil imports on March 8, but most of Europe has not. Europe is more reliant on Russian oil than the U.S. The United Kingdom said it will phase out Russian oil imports by the end of the year. Germany, Europe's largest economy, has said introducing such an embargo would trigger recession and mass unemployment, Reuters reported. Zelenskyy said Russia has used phosphorus bombs in Ukraine and fired at nuclear power plants. Share this -







U.N. records more than 100 children killed in Russia invasion The United Nations' human rights office has recorded more than 100 deaths of children in Ukraine since Russia invaded last month.

Ukrainian officials have given higher numbers of civilians killed. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday that 143 have died since Russia invaded on Feb. 24. The U.N. human rights office has a process to corroborate reports of civilian casualties, and it says fighting has delayed reports from some areas and that other reports are still being corroborated.

Missile attack hits oil depot in western Ukraine LVIV, Ukraine — A missile attack hit an oil depot in western Ukraine late Monday, Rivne’s regional governor said, marking the second attack on oil facilities in the region and the latest in a series of such attacks in recent days. Western Ukraine has not seen ground combat, but missiles have struck oil depots and a military plant in Lviv, a major city close to Poland where hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have gone to escape fighting elsewhere. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy suggested in an interview with Russian journalists released Sunday that the attacks on oil depots are intended to disrupt the planting season in Ukraine, which is a major grain producer.

Zelenskyy calls for further sanctions, increased support Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reiterated his refrain Monday that countries must ramp up their sanctions against Russia and military assistance to Ukraine. The escalation of sanctions, he said, is influenced by whether Russia uses chemical weapons in the conflict, but Ukrainians have endured enough. He criticized hesitation based on the political implications of opposing Russia, saying countries that aren't supporting Ukraine have become complicit in the war. ""No one has the right to use the lives of Ukrainians to save any income in Russia,"" Zelenskyy said. ""Ukrainians should not die just because some cannot find the courage to hand over the necessary weapons to Ukraine."" Share this -

Russia adding more troops around Kyiv, Ukraine defense ministry says In an afternoon update, Ukraine's Defense Ministry warned that Russia is increasing the number of troops around the besieged capital, Kyiv, despite ""heavy losses."" The ministry also said Russia is still pushing toward the borders of Donetsk and Luhansk, which have been partly controlled by Moscow-backed separatists, and that Russia is recruiting citizen-volunteers, including ""people with a criminal record,"" to keep ""order"" in those territories. The ministry claimed Russia is operating its ""defense-industrial complex"" around the clock to produce missiles, indicating Russia is experiencing ""a significant reduction in the arsenal of missile weapons."" It praised international sanctions for hindering the trade of high-tech products needed to manufacture missiles. Share this -







Another major Ukrainian internet provider says it was hacked Ukraine's internet connectivity dipped significantly Monday, as one of its major internet providers said it suffered a cyberattack. One of Ukraine's largest phone and internet service providers, Ukrtelecom, saw internet activity drop to less than 20 percent of its usual rate, according to NetBlocks and Ioda, organizations that monitor such traffic. In a comment on its Facebook page, Ukrtelecom wrote that the outage was due to a cyberattack. Internet providers appear to have been the biggest civilian targets for cyberattacks in Ukraine since Russia began its invasion in late February. Another service provider, Triolan, also went down after a cyberattack, and a major satellite internet service company, Viasat, had its European and Ukrainian services severed after hackers targeted it around the start of the invasion.

Latin American students in Russia speak out Vanesa Rincón said she has barely slept since Feb. 24, when the thunderous sound from the bombs tore her from her sleep. She said she experiences terror daily in Belgorod, a Russian city bordering Ukraine, where she studies international law. “One wants to get away from the war and the bombs,” said Rincón, who is from Colombia. “We're so anguished that I never want to hear that noise again. I want to return to Bogotá as soon as I can.” Rincón said that during the first week of the conflict, she was on night duty with her fellow students in case something happened. Belgorod is about 25 miles from the war zone, so Rincón is counting the days to be able to leave. “It’s not normal, it’s not pretty, and you’re scared all the time. It doesn’t matter who’s good or bad. All you want is to run away,” she said. Read the full article. Share this -

Kharkiv nuclear plant shelled, severely damaged, agency says Ukraine's State Nuclear Regulation Inspectorate, the country's nuclear watchdog, said the neutron source nuclear facility in Kharkiv was severely damaged when it was shelled again Saturday. The installation, part of Kharkiv's Institute of Physics and Technology, performs experimental research on radioisotopes for medical and industrial needs.

Many cultural landmarks in Ukraine destroyed Ukraine is home to seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and since Russia launched its invasion, at least 39 landmarks across the country have been damaged, looted or reduced to ruins, according to the Transatlantic Dialogue Center, a Ukrainian political nonprofit based in Kyiv. Mariupol’s city council confirmed via Telegram last week that the Russian military destroyed the city’s Arkhip Kuindzhi Art Museum, housing over 2,000 exhibits and an extensive collection of works by prominent Ukrainian artists. The fate of the artwork remains unclear. Targeting historic monuments and cultural heritage sites is a war crime under international law, according to the Hague Convention of 1954. But that all seems to be part of Russia’s plan, some cultural authorities say. “They just want to erase from the map Ukraine — our heritage, our history, our identity and Ukraine as an independent state,” said Iryna Podolyak, Ukraine’s former vice minister of culture, according to whom Russia’s military seems to be targeting cultural heritage sites in addition to houses, hospitals and schools.

Russian stocks slide as trading resumes for all companies Russian shares slumped as its stock market resumed trading of all companies Monday after a monthlong halt following the invasion of Ukraine. The benchmark MOEX index slid 2.2% after the Moscow Exchange reopened for all of its several hundred listed companies, but with restrictions still in place to limit volatility. State-owned energy giant Gazprom fell 3.7%, while airline Aeroflot was up 3%. The last full trading session in Moscow was on Feb. 25, a day after the index tumbled by a third after President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine. Prices whipsawed last week when the exchange tentatively reopened for two days of limited trading, with investors allowed to trade only 33 of the MOEX index's 50 companies. Some restrictions remained in place Monday to prevent another big selloff, including the daily session shortened to four hours and a ban on short-selling, which essentially involves betting on stock prices to go down. Foreigners also are unable to sell shares until Friday — a restriction Russia put in place to counter Western sanctions against its financial system and the ruble, which has been sharply devalued.

Russian gas flows to Europe remain stable Russian gas deliveries to Europe on three main pipeline routes were stable on Monday morning, despite threats from Moscow that they would retaliate for Western sanctions imposed after the invasion of Ukraine. Russia's Gazprom said on Sunday it had continued to supply gas to Europe via Ukraine in line with requests from European customers. Gazprom, the world's biggest natural gas company, supplies 40 percent of Europe's gas. Facing its gravest economic crisis since the years following the break-up of the Soviet Union, Russia on Friday warned that billing in roubles for billions of dollars of natural gas exports to Europe could be just days away, its toughest response yet to crippling sanctions imposed by the West. Russian President Vladimir Putin said the West had declared economic war by freezing Russian assets, and so Russia saw no point in receiving dollars or euros for Russian exports anymore.

Russian forces have made no progress in past 24 hours, U.K. says Britain’s defense ministry said Monday morning that Russian forces had made no significant progress over the last 24 hours amid continuing supply issues and aggressive resistance from Ukrainian fighters.

In a previous post, the ministry had said Russia was maintaining a blockade of Ukraine’s Black Sea coast, ""effectively isolating Ukraine from international maritime trade."" It said Russian naval forces were also ""continuing to conduct sporadic missile strikes against targets throughout Ukraine."" Share this -

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

In peace talks:

• While there are some signs of optimism from peace talks held in Istanbul, Ukrainian and US officials have warned that Russia still poses a military threat to Kyiv and other parts of Ukraine

• Experts have expressed varying opinions about whether the talks can succeed, with some noting that they don't address the underlying causes of the conflict

• Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that while initial signs from the talks were ""positive"", they do not ""drown out"" the explosions of Russian shells

• European and US officials have warned that only Russia's actions, not words, can be judged and advised against Ukraine dropping its guard

There are no plans for a face-to-face meeting between Putin and Zelensky after talks in Istanbul, he went on to add. It has been crucial that the negotiations between the leaders of the two warring sides were held face-to-face despite scant progress toward reaching a ceasefire agreement. Russian President Vladimir Putin also held a telephonic conversation with Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday and the two had agreed for Istanbul to host the talks. Ankara hopes that the bilateral dialogue will lead to a ceasefire in Ukraine. The next round of Russia-Ukraine negotiations to begin Tuesday at 10:00 am in Istanbul, said a Kyiv delegate, as per RT.

The inconclusive peace talk was supposed to continue this week in Turkey which is mediating the situation to put an end to the raging conflict. The representatives from both Moscow and Ukraine were set to hold their 6th round of talks either on Monday or Tuesday. Volodymyr Zelenskyy has had earlier appealed to Russia’s President Putin to have direct negotiations and discuss Ukraine's ""neutral status”. ""Today, in the next round of video talks, a decision was made to hold the next live round by two delegations in Turkey on March 28-30,"" David Arakhamia, a Ukraine negotiator and politician had informed in a Facebook update last week. Both Russia and Ukraine have been unable to make a breakthrough since the first top-level talks kicked off on March 10 in Antalya.

No ceasefire decision reached, no significant progress: Kremlin

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov had said after the last round that no ceasefire decision was reached between Russia and that the discussions made no significant progress. He accused Kyiv of stalling truce talks by putting forth unacceptable proposals. Turkey's presidential spokesman said that Kyiv needed more support to defend itself while countries cannot 'burn bridges' with Russia. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu meanwhile had said that the crucial meeting between NATO leaders must be focused on ways of securing a cease-fire in Russia's invasion of Ukraine and not just on sanctions and deterrence. “Everyone's first aim should be a cease-fire,” Cavusoglu told Turkish journalists. Turkey has been brokering efforts as a mediator and facilitator to strike an agreement to halt hostilities on both sides. Foreign ministers of Russia and Ukraine had also met in Turkey on the sidelines of a diplomacy forum last month.
