The Ukrainian military tweeted a video appearing to show the aftermath of the Russians’ occupation of the nuclear site.

“Video proof Russian command did order its soldiers to dig fortifications near the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the radioactive Red Forest in March 2022,” Ukraine’s military said.

“Complete neglect of human life, even of one’s own subordinates, is what a killer-state looks like.”

The new footage appears to have been originally posted by Yuriy Butusov, a Ukrainian journalist and editor of the Ukrainian news website Censor.net, which was founded in 2004.

Ukrainian nuclear authorities had been warning for weeks that the Russians who occupied the site for more than a month had been digging in the radioactive soil of the red forest, one of the most radioactive places on earth, in Chernobyl’s exclusion zone.

The drone video has raised questions over whether the Russians’ actions may have exposed them to significant doses of radiation. Photographs circulated last week showed Russian soldiers from Chernobyl attending a radiation medicine centre in Belarus.

However, experts have said that the chance of the Russians experiencing radiation sickness is extremely low.

Professor Mike Wood, who specialises in radiation and radioecology at the University of Salford, and who has worked extensively in the Chernobyl exclusion zone, said that comments about soldiers suffering from acute radiation sickness after digging trenches were “simply not credible”.

He told i : “Radiation sickness is not something that is going to be a real concern for anybody who has just been in and around the Chernobyl exclusion zone for four weeks.

“The highest dose rates, as external dose rates, are around about a third of a millisievert per hour – 0.3 mSv/h, and that’s in the highest point.

“Some people suggest that they’ve found a bit more than that … but again that is not anything like what you would need to be able to cause these reports of acute radiation sickness. You would need something many orders of magnitude higher.

“When I work in the zone, I monitor my radiation exposure very carefully to make sure I stay within a sensible level of exposure, but at no point even in the most contaminated parts of the red forest do I have significant concerns about the radiation impact on my health.”

Professor Wood said the drone footage appeared to show the western end of the red forest, which he suggested might be beyond the “core” area of the forest.

While he could not be certain of the precise area the footage showed, he said “it’s certainly not in the area where you find the highest dose rates in the red forest.

“Even those dose rates – I work in that area for a week, even two weeks at a time, and I don’t get extremely ill as a result of doing that,” he said.

During the 1986 disaster, ‘hot particles’, or fragments of radioactive fuel were released from the fourth reactor, generally settling within what is now the exclusion zone and along the pathway of the radiation plume.

If the Russians were digging in the red forest they would have been digging in soil that contained these particles. If the particles did end up becoming embedded in their lungs, it could potentially result in a localised dose of radiation.

However, according to Professor Wood: “It’s not the case that there are going to be huge numbers of those particles they will be inhaling as a result of digging in the soil.”

Furthermore, not only would this dose be localised, any effects would not be felt until many many years later.

“The particles in the red forest area are very stable particles, chemically speaking, so it’s not like they dissolve easily inside the body and start to incorporate into all the different body tissues,” he added.

“I’ve dug in the soil, I’ve collected soil samples, and worked there immediately after fire events – what we do when working in Chernobyl is we wear overalls, wellington boots, walking boots, and gloves if handling soil, so any radioactive particles we do encounter stay in the outer surface and don’t end up accidentally embedded in our fingernails and then accidentally going into our mouths.

“But if you look at the work we’ve done on wildfires and the smoke being generated from fires even in the red forest, inhalation doses even for firefighters working right at the front are, relatively speaking, low, and unlikely to be causing any significant health concerns.”","https://inews.co.uk/news/chernobyl-drone-video-reveals-abandoned-russian-trenches-in-exclusion-zone-ukrainian-armed-forces-claim-1562125#:~:text=Nuclear%20experts%20say%20claims%20of,exclusion%20zone%20are%20extremely%20unlikely&text=Drone%20footage%20released%20by%20Ukraine,highly%20radioactive%20'red%20forest'."

Detectable amounts occur naturally in soil, rocks, water, air, and vegetation but large dosages can have dramatic and life changing effects. There are different kinds of radiation but it is ionising radiation that can cause damage to living tissue at high levels making it vital to control our exposure to it.

Radiation exposure depends on three factors, the:

strength of the radiation source

distance you are from it

duration of the exposure

Exposure to high levels of ionising radiation can result in mutation, radiation sickness, cancer, and death but when used in medical applications it can be used to prolong life. Ionizing radiation is invisible and not directly detectable by human senses, unless at very high doses, so instruments such as Geiger counters are necessary to detect its presence.



Measurement

One way to measure radiation is to measure the dose of radiation received, i.e. the effect it has on human tissue, which is measured in sieverts, abbreviated as Sv.

As 1 sievert represents a very large dose the following smaller units are commonly used;

Millisieverts, one thousandth of a sievert and abbreviated as mSv (1000mSv = 1Sv)

Or

Microsieverts, one millionth of a sievert and abbreviated as uSv (1,000,000uSv = 1Sv)

Dosimeters generally measure in microsieverts.

An older unit for dose is the rem (Roentgen Equivalent in Man), or the smaller millirem (abbreviated “mrem”) still often used in the United States. One sievert is equal to 100rem.

Roentgen’s are another measure, 1 Roentgen (R) equals 0.877 rem or 0.00877 Sieverts.

Geiger counters

Geiger counters are used to detect ionizing radiation. The primary component of the Geiger counter is a tube filled with a gas that conducts electricity when struck by radiation. This allows the gas to complete an electrical circuit. This typically includes moving a needle and making an audible sound. Geiger counters can measure radiation in a variety of units, depending on the application.

Radiation exposure

It can be hard to predict the impact of radiation on humans but around half of all those exposed to 5 sieverts will die from it. Almost all who receive a dose of 10 sieverts will die within weeks.

A typical dose for those workers who died within one month of the disasters was 6 sieverts.

During the Chernobyl disaster four hundred times more radioactive material was released than at the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.

The global average exposure of humans to ionizing radiation is about 2.4 – 3mSv (0.0024-0.003Sv) per year, 80% of which comes from nature. The remaining 20% results from exposure to human-made radiation sources, for example medical imaging (X-rays, CT scans etc).

In Europe, average natural background exposure by country ranges from under 2mSv annually in the United Kingdom to more than 7mSv annually in Finland.

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requires that its licensees limit human-made radiation exposure for individual members of the public to 1mSv per year, and limit occupational radiation exposure to adults working with radioactive material to 50mSv per year (3-25 uSv/hr).

Levels of radiation at Chernobyl

Immediately after the explosion

The radiation levels in the worst-hit areas of the reactor building, including the control room, have been estimated at 300Sv/hr, (300,000mSv/hr) providing a fatal dose in just over a minute.

The reactor staff struggled to establish the levels of radiation following the explosion as one dosimeter capable of measuring up to 9Sv per second 1,000 R/s was buried in the wreckage, and another one failed when it was turned on. All the remaining dosimeters had limits of 0.001 R/s (0.3 µA/kg) 30mSv/hr and read “off scale”. The reactor staff could therefore only ascertain that the radiation levels were somewhere above 30mSv/h while in reality the true levels were far higher.

Because of the inaccurate low readings, the reactor crew chief Alexander Akimov assumed that the reactor was intact. The evidence of pieces of graphite and reactor fuel lying around the building where ignored, and the readings of another dosimeter brought in at 04:30am were dismissed under the assumption that the new dosimeter must have been defective. Akimov stayed with his crew in the reactor building until morning, sending members of his crew to try to pump water into the reactor. None of them wore any protective gear. Most, including Akimov, died from radiation exposure within three weeks.

22 years after the explosion radiation levels inside the reactor hall were approximately 34 Sv/hr – a lethal dose in 10-20 minutes.

Fire fighters

Shortly after the explosion firefighters arrived to tackle the fire. First on the scene was the Chernobyl Power Station firefighter brigade under the command of Lieutenant Volodymyr Pravik, who died on 9 May 1986 of acute radiation sickness. They were not told how dangerously radioactive the smoke and the debris were, and may not even have known that the accident was anything more than a regular fire:

“We didn’t know it was the reactor. No one had told us.”

Grigorii Khmel, the driver of one of the fire engines, later described what happened:

“We arrived there at 10 or 15 minutes to two in the morning…. We saw graphite scattered about. Misha asked: “Is that graphite?” I kicked it away. But one of the fighters on the other truck picked it up. “It’s hot,” he said. The pieces of graphite were of different sizes, some big, some small, enough to pick them up…” “We didn’t know much about radiation. Even those who worked there had no idea. There was no water left in the trucks. Misha filled a cistern and we aimed the water at the top. Then those boys who died went up to the roof – Vashchik, Kolya and others, and Volodya Pravik…. They went up the ladder … and I never saw them again.”

However, Anatoli Zakharov, a fireman stationed in Chernobyl since 1980, offers a different description:

I remember joking to the others, “There must be an incredible amount of radiation here. We’ll be lucky if we’re all still alive in the morning.”

Twenty years after the disaster, he said the firefighters from the Fire Station No. 2 were aware of the risks.

Of course we knew! If we’d followed regulations, we would never have gone near the reactor. But it was a moral obligation – our duty. We were like kamikaze

Levels of radiation in Pripyat and Chernobyl now

The levels of radiation as measured in 2009 (Radiation levels can, and do, fluctuate depending on a number of factors.)

Risk

Generally the levels of radiation in Pripyat and the surrounding area, although far higher than the norm, are safe for the time you will be exposed to them (just don’t go licking stuff).

Those who work within the zone typically work 3 weeks on, 3 weeks off. The “off” period must be spent outside of the zone.

Radiation levels can change daily, dependent upon a number of factors including wind speeds. Just because you measured a level yesterday doesn’t mean it’ll be the same today as pockets of radiation move around. Large variations in levels can also occur within only a few metres of each other.

Weather cleansed tarmac, or hard standing, is preferable to standing on vegetation. Pay specific attention to moss, wherever it may grow, as it is great at absorbing radiation and therefore likely to emit far higher levels than the surface it is growing on. This sounds simple in theory but I found it easy to forget when confronted with the sights of Pripyat.

It depends on the nature of your visit but for longer, less chaperoned, trips it may be worth borrowing or buying a Geiger counter. I didn’t have one but many of those I went with did. All gave slightly different readings but functioned as a good guide. Clearly it’s pointless having one if you don’t know what the readings actually mean, accurate or not, partly why I didn’t take one on my first visit.

Dust is a potentially nasty. Ingesting radioactive particles is not something you want to make a habit of. I choose not to wear a mask. The majority of people I saw also didn’t but obviously make your own decision, it’s your health.

Rooms open to the elements, the majority now are, tend to have lower levels of radiation than those still enclosed by doors and windows. The basement of the hospital contains the clothing of those who first tackled the explosion. Located in an enclosed environment even after 25 years the clothing is highly radioactive (way in excess of 386 uSv/h) and a terrifying reminder of what those first on the scene faced. If you do venture down there I recommend you don’t hang around and wear at least a correctly rated mask that covers both nose and mouth. A hazmat suit you can bin afterwards may also be wise. I didn’t have a mask and therefore chose not to go down there, a decision I don’t regret.

High levels or radiation (336 uSv/h) can also be found towards the rear of the claw used in the clean up. Although decontaminated they clearly missed a bit.

Most of Pripyat was decontaminated in the weeks following the explosion however the graveyard is one exception (14-22 uSv/h), it being hard to remove topsoil and keep graves intact, and therefore we spent only 15 minutes on site.

I ate and drank in Pripyat but generally only within the minibus and I was conscious not to touch the food directly with my hands. There seemed to be an unwritten rule that all accompanying officials must light a cigarette upon exiting a vehicle in the Zone.

The clothing I wore, including footwear, I either binned or double washed on my return home. It’s easy to become blasé out there but if you’re unpacking footwear caked in zone mud at home it soon focuses the mind. The clothing I took home I wrapped and sealed in several bin bags.

The spread of radiation

Following the explosion approximately 100,000 km² of land was significantly contaminated with fallout, the worst hit regions being in Belarus, Ukraine and Russia. Lower levels of contamination were detected over all of Europe.

The initial evidence that a major release of radioactive material was affecting other countries came from Sweden, where on the morning of 28 April workers at the Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant approximately 1,100 km (680 mi) from the Chernobyl were found to have radioactive particles on their clothes.

The rise in radiation levels had already been measured in Finland, but a civil service strike delayed the response and publication.

It was Sweden’s search for the source of radioactivity, once they had ruled out a leak at the Swedish plant itself, that at noon on 28 April led to the first hint of a serious nuclear problem in the western Soviet Union. The evacuation of Pripyat having already taken place by this point.

Radioactive fallout from the Chernobyl accident was scattered depending on the weather conditions. Much was deposited on mountainous regions such as the Alps and the Welsh and the Scottish Highlands, through rainfall. Sweden and Norway also received heavy levels of fallout.

Rain was purposely seeded over 10,000 km2 of the Belorussian SSR by the Soviet air force to remove radioactive particles from clouds heading toward highly populated areas. Heavy, black-coloured, rain fell on the city of Gomel just over the Belarus border.

Reports from Soviet and Western scientists indicate that Belarus received about 60% of the contamination that fell on the former Soviet Union. However, the 2006 TORCH report stated that half of the volatile particles had landed outside Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia. Studies carried out in surrounding countries indicate that over one million people could have been affected by radiation.

The release of radiation

The nature of the radiation released was dependent on the physical and chemical properties of the radioactive elements in the core. Particularly dangerous were the highly radioactive fission products, those with high nuclear decay rates that accumulate in the food chain, such as the isotopes of iodine, caesium and strontium. Iodine-131 and caesium-137 are responsible for most of the radiation exposure received by people.

The release of radioisotopes from the nuclear fuel was partly dependent on their boiling points, and the majority of the radioactivity present in the core was actually retained in the reactor.

All of the noble gases, including krypton and xenon, contained within the reactor were released immediately into the atmosphere by the first steam explosion.

50 to 60% of all core radio-iodine in the reactor was released, as a mixture of vapor, solid particles, and organic iodine compounds with a half-life of 8 days.

20 to 40% of all core caesium-137 was released in aerosol form. Caesium-137, along with isotopes of strontium, are the two primary elements preventing the Chernobyl exclusion zone from being re-inhabited. Cs-137 has a half-life of 30 years.

An estimated 1150 PBq of Tellurium-132, half-life 78 hours, and 5200 PBq of Xenon-133, half-life 5 days, was released.

An early estimate for total nuclear fuel material released to the environment was an emission of 6 t of fragmented fuel.

Cesium-137

Cesium-137 is a radioactive isotope of caesium which is formed by the nuclear fission of uranium-235 and other fissionable isotopes in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. It is among the most problematic of the short-to-medium-lifetime fission products because it easily moves and spreads in nature due to the high water solubility of caesium’s most common chemical compounds, which are salts.

Cesium-137 has a half-life of approximately 30 years. As of 2005, caesium-137 is the main source of radiation in the Exclusion Zone around the nuclear power plant. Together with caesium-134, iodine-131, and strontium-90, caesium-137 was among the isotopes distributed by the reactor explosion that posed the greatest risk to health. It is Cesium-137 that has led some reindeer and sheep in Scandinavia to exceed the Norwegian safety limit 26 years after the disaster.

In April 2011, elevated levels of caesium-137 were also being found in the environment after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disasters in Japan. Caesium-137 in the environment is human-made. Unlike most other radioisotopes, caesium-137 is not produced from the same element’s nonradioactive isotopes but as a byproduct of the nuclear fission of much heavier elements, meaning that until the building of the first artificial nuclear reactor, the Chicago Pile-1, in late 1942, it had not occurred on Earth for billions of years.

Health of plant workers and local people

In the aftermath of the accident, 237 people suffered from acute radiation sickness (ARS), of whom according to World Health Organization’s 2006 report, 28 died within the first three months. Most of the victims were the firemen and rescue workers first on the scene.

No further ARS-related deaths were identified in the general population affected by the disaster. Of the 72,000 Russian Emergency Workers being studied, 216 non-cancer deaths are attributed to the disaster, between 1991 and 1998. Of all the 66,000 Belarusian emergency workers, by the mid-1990s only 150 (roughly 0.2%) were reported by their government as having died. In contrast, 5,722 casualties were reported among Ukrainian clean-up workers up to the year 1995, by the National Committee for Radiation Protection of the Ukrainian Population.

The latency period for solid cancers caused by excess radiation exposure can be 10 or more years; so at the time of the WHO report being undertaken, the rates of solid cancer deaths were no greater than the general population.

Acute radiation syndrome

Acute radiation syndrome (ARS), also known as radiation poisoning, radiation sickness or radiation toxicity, is a number of health effects which occur within 24 hours of exposure to high amounts of ionising radiation.

The radiation causes cellular degradation due to destruction of cell walls and other key molecular structures within the body and it is this destruction that causes the symptoms. The symptoms can begin within one or two hours and may last for several months. The term refers to acute medical problems rather than ones that develop after a prolonged period.

The onset and type of symptoms depends on the radiation exposure. Relatively smaller doses result in gastrointestinal effects such as nausea and vomiting and symptoms related to falling blood counts such as infection and bleeding. Relatively larger doses can result in neurological effects and rapid death. Treatment of acute radiation syndrome is generally supportive with blood transfusions and antibiotics, with some more exotic treatments such as bone marrow transfusions being required in extreme cases.

Similar symptoms may appear months to years after exposure as chronic radiation syndrome when the dose rate is too low to cause the acute form. Radiation exposure can also increase the probability of developing some other diseases, mainly different types of cancers. These diseases are sometimes referred to as radiation sickness, but they are never included in the term acute radiation syndrome",http://www.chernobylgallery.com/chernobyl-disaster/radiation-levels/

Note: If you intend to follow in the footsteps of these Nomads, think carefully before you go and understand that our travel insurance plans do not cover exposure to radiation, and doubly so if you deliberately do so by entering a known contamination exclusion zone. Read your plan/policy wording carefully so you understand this. If you are unsure please contact customer support to clarify.

Despite the chilling events which occurred at Chernobyl and Pripyat in 1986, many travelers visit the area each year. Here are our tips on how to see this radioactive region safely.

The catastrophe was caused by an explosive meltdown during an extreme power spike. More than 350,000 people evacuated from severely contaminated areas of Ukraine, Belarus and Russia.

Today, Chernobyl and its surrounds are a ghost town, with only a few thousands of souls brave enough to continue to live in the affected areas, which still suffer from extensive levels of radiation.

But it's this very spookiness that has drawn some travelers to Ukraine to witness its breathtaking desolation, but now that people want to go back to Chernobyl to see what has been left behind, and considering the dangers posed by the fallout, is it really worth the risk?



The State Agency for Managing the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone has issued safety instructions and advice for people visiting the zone.

Is it safe to visit Chernobyl?

To enter the 18.6mi (30km) exclusion zone, you will need a day pass which is only available from certain established tour operators and you must apply at least 10 days in advance.

Basically, to go into the exclusion zone without either a) a tour operator or b) a qualified nuclear fallout expert with your own safety and moinitoring equipment, is plain crazy. The environment in relation to radiation levels in certain areas is extremely dynamic, and without proper measurement, you could be exposing yourself to harmful levels.

Certain areas, including the ""machine cemetery"" of Rossokha village, are restricted. Obviously, areas marked as radioactive or forbidden entry zones are exactly that. You should stay well away from them unless you wish to end up another Chernobyl statistic. There are checkpoints within the zone where you will need to show your passport and permit.

The amount of radioation you are being exposed to that may affect your health (roughly the dose) is measured in sieverts. A lethal dose of radiation is in the vicinity of three to five sieverts in an hour. During a Chernobyl tour the levels of exposure can range from 130 to 2,610 microsieverts per hour – that's 0.00261 of one whole sievert (i.e. at least 1000 times less than the potentially lethal level). This exposure is similar to the radiation we would be exposed to on a long-haul flight.

If you are not on a tour, where there is professional monitoring equipment, it's impossible to gauge how much radiation you are being exposed to. Exposure to higher levels of radiation puts you at higher risk of particles remaining on your clothes. Sustained exposure to radiation is the greatest cause of contamination.

Be mindful that many of the abandoned buildings are littered with broken glass and debris, and the floor surfaces can be highly unstable. Make sure you wear protective clothing, and closed-in shoes. Keep bare skin to a minimum. To prevent carrying particles of contaminated material with you for a long poeriod (and thereby increasing your exposure to unacceptable levels of radiation) wear disposable coveralls or dispose of your clothing after you leave the site. Make sure you thoroughly clean your shoes.

Listen to our podcast about travel to Chernobyl

The Ukrainian Government has permitted entry into the surrounding areas of Chernobyl, but with strict conditions. However in July 2019, the Ukrainian President said he would move to make the entire zone an official tourist site. We discuss the merits of that move in this episode of The World Nomads Podcast as well as talk to a photographer who has visited 21 times to document the regrowth of the natural habitat and how it has invaded the derelict built environment. You can see some of his photos in the episode show notes.

Radioactivity in the nature surrounding Chernobyl

Decades on since the disaster, nature has reclaimed the radioactive site. No, you won't see three-headed wolves but, due to the absence of people living in the area, many wild animals have returned and vegetation is flourishing. Pripyat resembles a zombie-esque, post-apocalyptic landscape with trees, vines and other plants growing over buildings and other infrastructure, including the well-known amusement park.

Populations of animals such as deer, moose, wild boar, brown bears, lynx, and many bird species have all increased in the past 20 years. The number of wolves has increased due to lack of competition from hunters, and the zone has become a sanctuary for endangered species such as the European Bison and Przewalski's Horse.

Across the border in Belarus, the most contaminated areas are within the Polesie State Radiation Ecological Reserve which was established for environmental and radiobiological research purposes, aside from delineating the area of the fallout from Chernobyl (70% of the fallout hit this part of Belarus). It is also one of the biggest nature reserves in Europe, but is off limits to the public due to the level of contamination.

The video, widely shared on social media Wednesday, showed what appeared to be a large area of dirt that has been disturbed by tire tracks and dug up by Russian forces that occupied the region for over a month. In the video, which appears to be filmed by a drone hovering over Chernobyl's toxic Red Forest, the nuclear plant can be seen in the distance, and a sizable area of forest appears to be charred.

HUNDREDS OF RUSSIAN TROOPS EVACUATE CHERNOBYL WITH 'ACUTE RADIATION SICKNESS'

The soil in the zone is polluted with several kinds of radioactive isotopes that are known to be toxic and carcinogenic if inhaled. The radioactive particles are remnants of the 1986 nuclear plant disaster.

In March, hundreds of Russian soldiers were evacuated from the Chernobyl nuclear facility and taken to a medical facility in Belarus after suffering symptoms of ""acute radiation sickness,"" according to a report.

Russian soldiers reportedly engaged in several types of reckless behavior around the facility, such as driving through the Red Forest without protective gear, an action one Chernobyl plant worker called ""suicidal,"" and shelling near the facility, which sparked a wildfire that sent radioactive smoke into the air, according to Ukrainian officials.

The footage, which has been geolocated and widely shared on social media, shows mounds of disturbed earth and fortifications dug on the outskirts of the Red Forest, just a few miles west of the Chernobyl plant.

After the drone camera zooms out from the abandoned Russian positions and pans out, the ominous steel confinement dome that encapsulates the destroyed reactor can be seen in the distance.

The Red Forest sits firmly inside the inner exclusion zone around Chernobyl, and was the area most heavily affected when the No. 4 reactor exploded in 1986, causing the world's worst nuclear accident.

Last week, Ukraine's state nuclear energy company Energoatom reported that several Russian troops had been evacuated from the forest to Belarus for acute radiation syndrome (ARS) treatment - though this is yet to be verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

The last contingent of Russian troops retreated from their positions around Chernobyl on Friday last week, handing control of the territory around the power plant back to Ukraine for the first time since the start of the invasion on February 24.

The footage shows earth fortifications, trenches, and pits filled with water, as well as deep tracks in the soil churned up by Russian armoured vehicles. It also appears some of the earth has been scorched around the Russian encampment

The Red Forest sits firmly inside the inner exclusion zone around Chernobyl, and was the area most heavily affected when the No. 4 reactor exploded in 1986, causing the world's worst nuclear accident. The reactor is now encapsulated in concrete and a thick steel shell to prevent further radioactive leaks

This map of the exclusion zone around Chernobyl shows just how close the Russian trenches were dug to the site of the 1986 disaster, a stone's throw away from Pripyat - the abandoned town where the plant's workers lived with their families prior to the explosion

Though reports that Russian troops were evacuated from the Red Forest to Belarus to receive treatment for ARS are yet to be confirmed by the UN's nuclear watchdog, there is speculation that soldiers who built the fortifications could well have been exposed to high levels of radiation.

Huge swathes of land in and around the Red Forest were heavily polluted by radioactive smoke and dust in the aftermath of the 1986 disaster, and many of the trees and wildlife in the forest died.

The site got its name when dozens of square miles of trees that did not die in the aftermath of the explosion turned red after absorbing incredible doses of radiation.

In the years following the accident, the land was razed and covered with fresh soil and sand before new trees were planted, but the radioactive particulates still remain trapped underneath the forest's top soil.

The region has become a natural wildlife reserve in recent years as all manner of flora and fauna have flourished unperturbed by humans, and the powerplant still maintains a number of employees tasked with maintenance and safety work - though they were rotated regularly prior to the Russian invasion.

But experts believe that Russian troops who returned to the exclusion zone to dig trenches and fortifications may have sustained major doses of radiation as they became exposed to the irradiated dust and soil which had remained sealed underground for decades.

What is Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS)? ARS, known commonly as radiation sickness, is an illness that can happen when a person is exposed to high levels of radiation, typically over a short time period. The initial symptoms of ARS include nausea, vomiting, headache, and diarrhea. But the way in which radiation affects our bodies is not fully understood. Symptoms can start within minutes to days after the exposure, can last for minutes up to several days, and may come and go. After the initial symptoms, a person usually looks and feels healthy for a period of time, but will likely suffer further symptoms at varying degrees of severity, depending on the dose. These symptoms include loss of appetite, fatigue, fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and possibly even seizures and coma. This seriously ill stage may last from a few hours up to several months. Absorbing high doses of radiation can also dramatically increase the likelihood of developing cancers and other chronic illnesses years down the line. Besides the two workers who were killed instantly in the initial explosion at Chernobyl in 1986, a total of 134 plant staff and emergency workers experienced ARS in the days following the accident, of which 28 died.

Physicist Edwin Lyman, Director of Nuclear Power Safety with the U.S.-based Union of Concerned Scientists, said it 'seems unlikely' a large number of Russian troops would have developed severe radiation illness.

However, he confirmed that contaminated material was buried and covered with new topsoil during the cleanup of Chernobyl, and that soldiers who were tasked with digging the trenches would have been exposed to 'hot spots' of radiation.

Lyman's comments came following a statement by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, who said last week that Ukraine would work with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to establish what Russian troops did while in control of the site, before warning their activities would've exposed them to dangerous levels of radiation.

'Russia behaved irresponsibly in Chernobyl on all accounts, from not allowing personnel of the station to perform their functions to digging trenches in the contaminated areas,' Kuleba said on Friday.

He said the Russian government must 'answer to the mothers, the sister, the wives of those soldiers - why did they force them to put their lives at risk.'

Meanwhile, Yaroslav Yemelianenko, an employee at the Ukrainian state agency overseeing the exclusion zone, claimed 'several batches' of Russians had been evacuated from the Red Forest for treatment.

'With minimal intelligence in command or soldiers, these consequences could have been avoided,' he said, adding that radiation protection is 'mandatory because radiation is physics – it works without regard to status or shoulder straps.'

Other power plant workers told Reuters that the Russian soldiers' disregard for safety procedures and lack of anti-radiation gear when they seized the Chernobyl site was 'suicidal'.

A total of 28 staff members and emergency workers died from ARS in the days following the Chernobyl explosion in 1986, as well as two workers who were killed instantly in the blast.

But studies conducted in the years following the disaster discovered a considerable increase in incidences of thyroid cancer among the population who lived near the plant.

According to a United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) report, there had been almost 20,000 cases of thyroid cancer reported in children and adolescents who were exposed at the time of the accident between 1991-2015.

Increased awareness of the risk of cancer from radiation exposure and improved detection methods are two of the factors associated with the startling figure, but at least 5,000 incidences of cancer were directly attributable to children drinking fresh milk containing radioactive iodine from cows who had eaten contaminated grass in the first few weeks following the accident.

Rafael Grossi, the head of the IAEA, said last week he would be leading a mission to the Chernobyl as soon as possible to ascertain the damage caused by Russian troops and to ensure the plant safety protocols for storing nuclear waste (pictured) have not been disrupted

Some Russian troops stationed at Chernobyl were reportedly to Belarus for treatment for 'acute radiation syndrome', an employee at the Ukrainian state agency overseeing the exclusion zone claimed (pictured, Russian tanks seize the site in February)

The Red Forest is considered so highly contaminated that even the nuclear plant workers are not typically allowed to go there.

Valery Seida, acting general director of the Chernobyl plant, said: 'Nobody goes there... for God's sake. There is no one there.'

Rafael Grossi, the head of the IAEA, said last week he would be leading a mission to the Chernobyl as soon as possible to ascertain the damage caused by Russian troops and to ensure the plant safety protocols for storing nuclear waste have not been disrupted.

'I will head an assistance and support mission to the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant as soon as possible. It will be the first in a series of such nuclear safety and security missions to Ukraine,' Grossi said.

A video shared by the Ukrainian military purports to show proof that Russian troops dug trenches in the Red Forest, the most contaminated area of Chernobyl's exclusion zone.

The drone footage was not dated. Per CNN, it was filmed by the Ukrainian military and released by state-owned energy operator Energoatom on Telegram.

It depicts land that looks dug up, in a continuous shot that pans to an image of the sarcophagus covering the site of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident in the distance.

The video was shared by the Ukrainian military on Twitter on Wednesday.

It came with the text: ""Video proof. Russian command did order its soldiers to dig fortifications near the Chornobyl nuclear power plant in the radioactive Red Forest in March, 2022."" Chornobyl is an alternate spelling.

The tweet can be seen below:

A road can be seen in the video which appears to correspond with a location on maps of the region, which would put the recording site about 3.5 km (2 miles) from the power plant.

The approximate location of the video was estimated based on visual landmarks. Google maps/Insider.

The Russian troops left the site last week, five weeks after invading the Chernobyl exclusion zone on February 24.

Energoatom, Ukraine's state power company, said that Russian troops dug trenches while they were there and subsequently suffered signs of radiation sickness.

The International Atomic Energy Agency, an organization affiliated with the United Nations that offers advice on radioactive safety, has said that it is investigating the claims.

According to unnamed Ukrainian workers who were at the Chernobyl site while Russia occupied it, troops drove armored vehicles through the Red Forest without any protective gear and exposed themselves to radioactive dust.

One worker said some troops seemed unaware of the 1986 disaster that made Chernobyl synonymous with nuclear disaster.",https://www.businessinsider.com/ukraine-claims-video-proves-russian-troops-dug-trenches-near-chernobyl-2022-4
