The Russian losses cannot be confirmed and the level of Ukraine’s resistance has been difficult to gauge thus far, according to experts.

In Jackson, Biden delivers on a campaign promise to make the historic appointment and to further diversify a court that was made up entirely of white men for almost two centuries. He has chosen an attorney who would be the high court’s first former public defender, though she also possesses the elite legal background of other justices.

Jackson would be the current court’s second Black justice — Justice Clarence Thomas, a conservative, is the other — and just the third in history.

The news was confirmed by a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss it before the president’s official announcement later today.

She would also be only the sixth woman to serve on the court, and her confirmation would mean that for the first time four women would sit together on the nine-member court.

The current court includes three women, one of whom is the court’s first Latina, Justice Sonia Sotomayor.

Jackson would join the liberal minority of a conservative-dominated court that is weighing cutbacks to abortion rights and will be considering ending affirmative action in college admissions and restricting voting rights efforts to increase minority representation.

Biden is filling the seat that will be vacated by Justice Stephen Breyer, 83, who is retiring at the end of the term this summer.

Jackson, 51, once worked as one of Breyer’s law clerks early in her legal career. She attended Harvard as an undergraduate and for law school, and served on the US Sentencing Commission, the agency that develops federal sentencing policy, before becoming a federal judge in 2013.

Her nomination is subject to confirmation by the Senate, where Democrats hold the majority by a razor-thin 50-50 margin with Vice President Kamala Harris as the tie-breaker. Party leaders have promised swift but deliberate consideration of the president’s nominee.

The next justice will replace one of the more liberal justices, so she would not tip the balance of the court, which now leans 6-3 in favor of conservatives.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-february-25-2022/

Print media across the globe reacted to Russian President Vladimir Putin attack on Ukraine early Thursday morning, documenting the Ukrainian's struggle to seek refuge and flee the embattled country, and the growing condemnation by world leaders of Putin's 'war of choice.'

France's Le Figaro reported Ukraine was bracing for the Russian invasion, issuing an emergency mobilization of its military and deploying its troops to Kyiv.

The renowned publication called the invasion 'the war in Europe,' and featured an editorial about the 'the return of tragedy,' on the front page.

The British newspaper The Guardian was direct. 'Putin invades,' its front page read, accompanied by a picture of a bandaged and bloodied woman who is quickly becoming the face of the war after an airstrike damaged an apartment complex in Chuhuiv.

The independent also featured the woman, with a close-up shot of her bloodied face, her head bandaged. 'The bloodshed begins' read the cover.

Spain's El Pais wrote 'Putin launches a massive attack against Ukraine,' and displayed the haunting picture of a man on his knees, staring vacantly at the cadaver in front of him after a bombardment in Kharkiv.

'Russians close in on Ukrainian capital,' The Wall Street Journal reported. The American newspaper went for a picture of the Brovary military base in the outskirts of Kyiv, burning after being hit by airstrikes.

The New York Times wrote on its front page: 'Russia's push into outskirts of capital as deaths rise and thousands flee West.' It dedicated the entirety of its cover to the increasingly alarming conflict.

'Fighting Rages in Ukraine as Russia invades,' The Jerusalem Post reported Friday, featuring a shot of airstrikes in Kyiv at dawn.

The Toronto Star chose the wording 'Russia moves into strike,' adding a picture of an Ukrainian soldiers bracing for the battle.

Ukraine's capital was under bombardment in the early hours of Friday, with the skies ablaze as Vladimir Putin's tanks moved to within 20 miles of Kyiv.

Bridges leading to Kyiv and to Kharkiv, in the east, were destroyed by Ukrainian forces to try and slow the Russian advance.

Ukraine's deputy defense ministry said that one missile was shot out of the sky by their anti-missile defense systems.

Another missile struck a residential building in the city, the government said.

A Russian jet was shot down by a surface-to-air missile in a separate incident, the Ukrainian government said.

Ukrainian Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashenko shared footage on social media of a blaze in what he said was the Darnitsky district of Kyiv, in the southeast of the city on the left bank of the Dnipro river.

It was unclear whether the Darnitsky fire was caused by the downed Ukrainian jet, or the Russian missiles.

Air raid sirens were heard on Friday morning in Kyiv and in the city of Lviv to the far west - where the city was left without power.

Hours earlier, President Volodymyr Zelensky raged at Western cowards who failed to come to his aid, saying his country is being 'left alone' to face Russian troops.

Officials warn that Kyiv will be seized this weekend.

In a video address to his nation after midnight, the president called his fallen compatriots 'heroes' after 137 were killed on the first day of fighting, and insisted he will stay until the bitter end.

He said: 'They're killing people and turning peaceful cities into military targets. It's foul and will never be forgiven.

'We have been left alone to defend our state. Who is ready to fight alongside us? I don't see anyone.

'Who is ready to give Ukraine a guarantee of NATO membership? Everyone is afraid.'

He added that the enemy has already entered Kyiv and urged residents to be vigilant and observe curfew rules, acknowledging he was 'target number one'.

On social media, images of bridges blown up by Ukrainian troops were shared. This image was captioned: 'Departure to the capital via the Novoirpen route is not available The Armed Forces blew up a bridge in Romanivka to prevent the occupiers' tanks from entering Kyiv'

The Ukrainian capital is expected to be surrounded by Russian forces this weekend and the country's resistance effectively crippled, US security officials fear.

Troops are already closing in on the seat of Ukrainian power after taking control of the strategic Chernobyl nuclear power plant today, and will seize it within 96 hours, bringing a 'new Iron Curtain' down on Europe, Zelensky warned.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Vladimir Putin plans to encircle Ukrainian forces in Kyiv and force them to either surrender or be destroyed, and the leadership of Ukraine could then fall in a week.

A former senior US intelligence officer told Newsweek: 'After the air and artillery end and the ground war really starts, I think Kyiv falls in just a few days.

'The military may last slightly longer but this isn't going to last long.'

A source close to the Ukrainian government said they agreed that Kyiv will be surrounded within 96 hours but believed the government will stay strong and not collapse.

In a bid to thwart the imminent capture of the city, Emmanuel Macron spoke to Vladimir Putin on Thursday night, who gave the French leader an 'exhaustive' explanation of his justification for war.

The Kremlin said the call took place at Macron's initiative, and he and Putin agreed to stay in contact.

Zelensky has also signed a decree on the general mobilisation of the population within 90 days, but men aged 18-60 are banned from leaving the country.

It comes after Russian forces seized control of Chernobyl nuclear power plant after a 'fierce' battle, with the condition of nuclear storage facilities 'unknown', sparking fears of a radiation leak that could cause fallout in Europe.

Video revealed Russian tanks and armoured vehicles standing in front of the destroyed reactor, which sits just 60 miles north of the capital Kyiv.

An official said Russian shelling hit a radioactive waste repository and an increase in radiation levels was reported, although this has not yet been corroborated.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said it is following the situation in Ukraine 'with grave concern' and appealed for maximum restraint to avoid any action that may put Ukraine's nuclear facilities at risk.

Ukrainian presidential advisor Myhailo Podolyak said: 'After the absolutely senseless attack of the Russians in this direction, it is impossible to say that the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is safe.'

Meanwhile Turkey reported that one of its ships had been hit by a 'bomb' off the coast of Odessa, where fighting is also going on. Turkey is a member of NATO, underlining fears that the war in Ukraine could quickly suck in other states and spark an all-out conflict in Europe.
