""What's at stake (is) not just what we're doing here in Ukraine to help the Ukrainian people and keep the massacre from continuing, but beyond that what's at stake is what are your kids and grandkids going to look like in terms of their freedom?"" Biden told US service members from the 82nd Airborne Division, who have been deployed along NATO's eastern edge as a visible deterrent to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

""What you're engaged in is much more than whether or not we can alleviate the suffering of Ukraine,"" he went on. ""We're in a new phase, your generation. We're at an inflection point.""

It was a sweeping view of the war underway in Ukraine, which has jolted the west into unprecedented cooperation while sending millions fleeing their homes, mostly into Poland. Biden was able to witness both of those factors at close range during his visit to Rzeszow, which has acted as a staging area for Western military assistance to Ukraine while also serving as a waypoint for people fleeing the violence.

As Biden was arriving, anti-aircraft missiles could be seen on the grounds of the airport. Later, he met with aid workers to hear their accounts of helping alleviate the humanitarian crisis, which he said was put in motion by a leader, Putin, whom he again described as a war criminal.

Speaking during a roundtable focused on the refugee issue, Biden said he would have preferred to see the crisis from an even closer perspective but was prevented by security concerns.

""They will not let me, understandably, I guess, cross the border and take a look at what's going on in Ukraine,"" he said. The White House has said it did not explore a visit to Ukraine.

Biden told the US troops, assembled inside a stadium, that their mission was more than simply sending a message to Russia. Instead, he said they were acting as a signal to all the world's autocrats.

""The question is, who is going to prevail? Is democracy going to prevail and the values we share? Or are autocracies going to prevail? That's really what's at stake,"" Biden said. ""What you're doing is consequential, really consequential.""

Echoing the expansive foreign policy frame he's used previously, but with a Russian twist, he said the assembled US service members were ""in the midst of a fight between democracies and oligarchs.""

Biden is in Europe this week on a hastily arranged bid to reinforce Western cooperation and reassure countries the United States will help protect their security. Before he arrived in Poland, he announced a new initiative with the European Union meant to deprive Putin of energy profits that Biden said are used being to fuel Russia's war in Ukraine.

Speaking in Brussels alongside European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Biden said Russia was using its supply of oil and gas to ""coerce and manipulate its neighbors."" He said the United States would help Europe reduce its dependence on Russian oil and gas and would ensure the continent had enough supplies for the next two winters.

Meeting troops who are in Poland on a reassurance and deterrence mission

Biden arrived midday Friday in Poland, where the regional security issues and the humanitarian catastrophe that he'd discussed during a series of summits a day earlier were put into sharper focus.

""I just wanted to come by and say thanks. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you,"" Biden said as he walked into a cafeteria where US troops had gathered, adding: ""it's not hyperbole to suggest, you are the finest fighting force in the world ... in the history of the world.""

Noting the pizza the soldiers were eating for lunch looked appetizing, Biden took a slice for himself and sat down to chat.

The President has made clear that US troops won't travel into Ukraine to directly fight Russian forces, suggesting such a step would lead to World War III. But he has ordered new rotational deployments along NATO's eastern edge to demonstrate American commitment to protecting the alliance.

He was greeted in Poland by President Andrzej Duda, who has called for a more permanent NATO defense posture in the country along with an international peacekeeping force in Ukraine. US officials have not warmed to the peacekeeping proposition, suggesting it could violate Biden's red line of keeping US troops out of the conflict.

Speaking to US service members, Biden hailed the Ukrainian people, whom he said were demonstrating admirable resolve.

""The Ukrainian people have a lot of backbone, a lot of guts. I'm sure you're observing it. And I don't mean just a military,"" he said.

He went on to make an apparent slip by suggesting the gathered US troops would see the Ukrainians in action themselves.

""The average citizen, look at how they're stepping up. And you're going to see when you're there, I don't know if you've been there, you're going to see women, young people, standing in the middle of the damn tank, saying, 'I'm not leaving. I'm holding my ground,'"" he said.

Biden and his administration have been adamant that US service members will not be deployed to Ukraine and all US armed forces who had been in the country had been removed ahead of the Russian invasion. A White House spokesperson later said, ""The President has been clear we are not sending US troops to Ukraine and there is no change in that position.""

Later, while receiving a briefing on the humanitarian response to the crisis in Ukraine, Biden said the images coming from the country are ""something out of a science fiction movie.""

""Those little babies. Little children. You're looking at mothers -- you don't have to understand the language they speak -- you see in their eyes pain and I mean literally pain watching their children. I don't think there's anything worse for a parent than see their children suffering,"" Biden said.

More than 3.5 million refugees have now fled Ukraine, according to data from the United Nations refugee agency released on Tuesday. A vast majority of those refugees have fled to Ukraine's western neighbors across Europe.

Poland, which borders Ukraine to the west, has registered more than 2 million Ukrainian refugees crossing into the country. However, the number of refugees staying in Poland is lower, with many continuing on in their journey to other countries.

Earlier this month during Vice President Kamala Harris' trip to Poland , Duda personally asked the vice president to speed up and simplify the procedures allowing Ukrainians with family in the US to come to the country. He also warned Harris that his country's resources were being badly strained by the influx of refugees, even as Poland welcomes them with open arms.

The White House says that since February 24, the US has provided more than $123 million to assist countries neighboring Ukraine and the European Union to address the refugee influx, including $48 million in Poland.

And Biden announced this week the US would admit up to 100,000 people fleeing violence in Ukraine through a variety of migration channels.

New steps to wean Europe from dependence on natural gas

As Biden was departing Brussels earlier, he sought to smooth over one of the biggest cracks in Western unity in punishing Russia: Europe's dependence on Russian energy imports, which have continued to provide billions of dollars to Putin, even as Biden seeks to shut him off from the global economy.

Biden and von der Leyen announced a joint task force meant to help wean Europe from its dependence on Russian oil and gas. The panel, chaired by representatives from the White House and the European Commission, will be aimed toward finding alternative supplies of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and reducing overall demand for natural gas moving forward.

""It's going to take some time to adjust gas supply chains and infrastructure that (were) built for the last decade so we're going to have to make sure the families in Europe can get through this winter and the next while we're building an infrastructure for a diversified, resilient and clean energy future,"" Biden said.

Europe's dependence on Russian gas and oil has proved a major sticking point in western efforts to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. While the US banned Russian energy imports, Europe found it far more difficult to cut off its supplies.

""I know that eliminating Russian gas will have costs for Europe, but it's not only the right thing to do from a moral standpoint, it's going to put us on a much stronger strategic footing,"" he said.

The US will work toward supplying Europe with at least 15 billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas in 2022, in partnership with other nations, the White House said. The group will also work toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions through reducing methane emissions and using clean energy to power operations.

Senior administration officials said the 15 billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas come from multiple sources, including the United States and nations in Asia. But officials did not have an exact breakdown on where the gas was coming from. The announcement Friday was the culmination of a US effort over the past months to identify alternate sources of energy for Europe, particularly in Asia. Officials said those efforts would continue through this year to hit the target.

One official said weaning Europe from Russian energy amounted to ""replacing an unreliable supplier of LNG with a much more reliable supplier in the US.""

""This crisis also presents an opportunity. It's a catalyst,"" Biden said. ""A catalyst that will drive the investments we need to double down on our clean energy goals and accelerate progress towards our net zeroes emissions future.""

A focus on chemical weapons

The White House on Friday also sought to clarify another comment Biden made during Thursday's news conference -- when he said he would respond ""in kind"" if Russia used chemical weapons in Ukraine.

En route to Poland aboard Air Force One, US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the US response to a potential chemical weapons attack by Russia would be done in coordination with allies. Sullivan would not say what the response would entail, but said that Russia would pay a ""severe price"" and emphasized that ""the United States has no intention of using chemical weapons, period -- under any circumstances.""

The Poland trip also comes two weeks after the US rejected Poland's proposals to facilitate the transfer its MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine.

The US rejected Poland's proposals over fears that the US and NATO could be perceived as taking an escalatory step, further fomenting conflict between the alliance and Russia -- which adamantly opposes Ukraine's ambitions to join the NATO alliance.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly requested more aircraft for the invasion, making another appeal to NATO leaders on Thursday.

During a virtual address Thursday, Zelensky asked NATO members for ""1% of all your planes,"" later adding, ""You have thousands of fighter jets, but we have not been given one yet.""

Despite Zelensky's plea, a senior US official told CNN later on Thursday that the US position on the fighter jet issue has not changed.

Just under 100 kilometres from Ukraine, US President Joe Biden saluted Poland for welcoming more than 2 million refugees who have fled Russia's invasion. Then he met with humanitarian experts on the ground about what will be needed to mitigate the growing suffering.

Biden said he had hoped to get even closer to the border but was prevented because of security concerns.

Still, he said he wanted to visit Poland to underscore that the assistance it is providing is of “enormous consequence"" as Europe experiences the biggest refugee crisis since World War II.

“It’s not stopping,"" Biden said of the devastation in Ukraine. ""It’s like something out of a science fiction movie.”

Biden also visited with some of the thousands of US troops who have been sent near Poland’s border to assist with the humanitarian emergency and to bolster the US military presence on the eastern flank of Nato. More than 3.5 million Ukrainians have fled the country since the February 24 invasion, including about 2.2 million to Poland, according to the United Nations.

Within a few days, the number of refugees displaced from Ukraine since last month will exceed the number of Syrians routed from their homes over years of conflict after a 2011 uprising turned into a full-scale war, said Samantha Power, the US Agency for International Development administrator.

The American military commitment in Poland was apparent as soon as Air Force One touched down, rolling past Patriot missile batteries.

More hardware, including heavy trucks and other equipment painted with dark green and brown camouflage, was present at the airport. A nearby convention centre serves as a base for the US Army's 82nd Airborne Division.

Polish President Andrzej Duda joined Biden for a briefing with humanitarian experts.

Duda, through an interpreter, thanked Biden for his support. He said the Poles see the Ukrainians they are receiving as their “guests.”

Evan Vucci/AP US President Joe Biden and Polish President Andrzej Duda participate in a roundtable on the humanitarian response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

“This is the name we want to apply to them,"" Duda said. “We do not want to call them refugees. They are our guests, our brothers, our neighbours from Ukraine, who today are in a very difficult situation.”

Biden's first stop was with 82nd Airborne troops, at a barber shop and dining facility where he invited himself to sit down and share some pizza. The Americans are serving alongside Polish troops.

With the troops, he shared an anecdote about visiting his late son, Beau Biden, while he was deployed in Baghdad and going by his mother’s maiden name so as not to draw attention to himself. The president jokingly razzed one service member about his standard-issue short haircut and seriously praised the troops, too.

Evan Vucci/AP Patriot missiles are seen at the Rzeszow-Jasionka Airport.

“You are the finest fighting force in the world and that's not hyperbole,” Biden said.

He later addressed a group of soldiers in more formal remarks, telling them the nation “owes you big.” He also borrowed the words of the late Secretary of State Madeline Albright to underscore their place in a fragile moment for the US and its European allies.

""The secretary of state used to have an expression. She said, ‘We are the essential nation,’"" Biden told the troops. “I don't want to sound philosophical here, but you are in midst of a fight between democracy and an oligarch.""

Biden will be in Warsaw on Sunday (NZT) for further talks with Duda and others. The Polish leader had planned to welcome him at the airport on Friday, but his plane was delayed by a technical problem.

White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Biden was looking to hear directly from the American troops and humanitarian experts about the situation on the ground and “what further steps need to be taken to make sure that we’re investing” US dollars in the right place.

Biden, who spent Friday lobbying US allies to stay united against Russia, speculated that what he sees in Poland “will reinforce my commitment to have the United States make sure we are a major piece of dealing with the relocation of all those folks, as well as humanitarian assistance needed both inside Ukraine and outside Ukraine.”

Speaking in Brussels after meetings with other world leaders, Biden said he had visited many war zones and refugee camps during his political career and “it's devastating” to see young children without parents or men and women with blank looks on their faces wondering, “My God, where am I? What's going to happen to me?”

He said Poland, Romania and Germany shouldn't be left on their own to deal with the largest refugee crisis in Europe since World War II.

“This is an international responsibility,” Biden said shortly after he announced $1 billion in additional assistance to help Ukrainian refugees. He also announced that the United States would take in up to 100,000 of those refugees.

Russian troops are trying to encircle Ukrainian forces fighting in the separatist regions in the eastern part of the country, British intelligence chiefs said, as Russia continues its attacks on Ukraine.

Vladimir Putin's forces are advancing southward from the area around the city of Kharkiv and north from the port city of Mariupol to the Donbas region in an attempt to surround Ukrainian troops, the Ministry of Defence said in an intelligence briefing today.

But in a further blow to Putin's barbaric invasion, Ukrainian forces repulsed seven attacks in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk and destroyed several tanks and armoured vehicles, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said on Sunday.

Ukraine's military chiefs said on Sunday that Russia is continuing with its 'full-scale armed aggression', with rocket attacks being launched on Ukrainian cities overnight.

Russian missiles struck Ukrainian fuel and food storage depots in the city of Lviv, sparking huge fires and wounding at least five people.

A security guard at the site, Yaroslav Prokopiv, said he saw three rockets strike and destroy two oil tanks. 'The third strike threw me to the ground,' he said.

The attack on the facilities means the government will have to disperse the stocks of both in the near future, Ukrainian Interior Ministry adviser Vadym Denysenko said today.

Denysenko also said Russia was bringing forces to the Ukrainian border on rotation, and could make new attempts to advance in its invasion of Ukraine.

Western intelligence officials say Russian forces now rely on indiscriminate bombardments rather than risking large-scale ground operations, a tactic that could limit Russian military casualties but would harm more civilians.

Whilst Russian troops appear to be advancing on the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, battlefields in northern Ukraine remain 'largely static,' with Ukrainian counterattacks hampering Russian efforts to reorganise their forces, the UK's MoD said.

It comes as President Joe Biden last night called for Putin to be removed from power, setting off alarm bells among US foreign policy experts, who fear that it could escalate tensions.

'For God's sake this man cannot remain in power,' Biden said in a shocking apparent call for regime change in Moscow at the end of a impassioned speech from Poland on Saturday.

'For god's sake this man cannot remain in power,' he said of Putin, describing the Russian president as having a 'craving for absolute power and control.'

The unscripted remark, which the White House scrambled to walk back as the Kremlin expressed fury, came at the end of an otherwise resolute and fiery speech in Poland rallying the free world to unite in opposition to autocracy and support of Ukraine.

Meanwhile, in the encircled southern port of Mariupol, Mayor Vadym Boichenko said the situation remained critical, with street fighting in the centre.

Russia said last week it had evacuated several hundred thousand people from the war zone, but Ukraine says thousands of its residents, including from Mariupol, have been illegally deported.

Ukraine and Russia have since agreed on two 'humanitarian corridors' to evacuate civilians from frontline areas on Sunday, including allowing people to leave by private car from the southern city of Mariupol, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said.

But there are fears over whether Russia will adhere to allowing Ukrainian citizens to leave via the humanitarian corridors, after previous Russian attacks have killed civilians fleeing via those routes.

Meanwhile Russian forces on Saturday seized Slavutych, a town where workers at the defunct Chernobyl nuclear plant live, and the mayor said three people were killed, Interfax Ukraine news agency reported.

Ukrainian staff have continued to work at Chernobyl after the site of the world's worst nuclear accident was seized by Russian forces.

Ukraine's nuclear watchdog said that a nuclear research facility in Kharkiv again has come under shelling by Russia and the fighting makes it impossible to assess the damage.

The State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate said that the neutron source experimental facility in the Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology came under fire Saturday.

Ukrainian authorities have previously reported that Russian shelling damaged buildings at the Kharkiv facility, but there has been no release of radiation. The newly built neutron source facility is intended for the research and production of radioisotopes for medical and industrial needs.

The International Atomic Energy Agency has said that the nuclear material in the facility is always subcritical and the inventory of radioactive material is very low, reducing the risks of radiation release.

Kharkiv has been besieged by Russian forces since the start of the invasion and has come under repeated shelling of its residential buildings and critical infrastructure.

Meanwhile, Biden was criticised for calling for Putin to be removed from power. Richard Haass, the Council on Foreign Relations president, tweeted his concerns that Biden had 'just expanded US war aims, calling for regime change.'

'However desirable it may be, it is not within our power to accomplish-plus runs risk it will increase Putin's inclination to see this as a fight to the finish, raising odds he will reject compromise, escalate, or both,' wrote Haass.

'Our interests are to end the war on terms Ukraine can accept & to discourage Russian escalation. Today's call for regime change is inconsistent with these ends,' he added.

Haass went on to tell Politico that a senior Biden official, possibly even Secretary of State Antony Blinken, needs to reach out to their Russian counterpart immediately and explain that Biden's comment doesn't reflect US policy.

'The fact that it was so off-script in some ways makes it worse,' because it could be read as Biden's genuine belief as opposed to his scripted words, Haas said.

Biden's remark could also diminish Putin's interest in compromise and increase his temptation to escalate in Ukraine, 'because if he believes he has everything to lose then he'll believe he has nothing to lose,' Haass said.

Before Biden could even board Air Force One to begin the flight back to Washington, his aides were rushing to claim that he hadn't been calling for an immediate change in government in Moscow.

'The President's point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region. He was not discussing Putin's power in Russia, or regime change,' a White House official said.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov quickly denounced Biden, saying 'it´s not up to the president of the U.S. and not up to the Americans to decide who will remain in power in Russia.'

Biden's alarming off-the-cuff remark comes just 24 hours after the White House rushed to clarify other awkward remarks from the president suggesting that US troops would deploy, and had already deployed, to Ukraine.

In a speech to US paratroopers in Poland on Friday, Biden said: 'You're going to see when you're there – some of you have been there – you're going to see women, young people, standing in the middle, in front of a damn tank, saying, 'I'm not leaving'.'

Biden's mention of 'when you're there' seem to suggest that the troops would be deployed across the border to Ukraine, but the administration insisted there has been no change in his stance that the US will not enter the conflict.

The White House was forced to clarify on Friday that American troops would not be going into Ukraine after President Biden appeared to make a slip in his speech to paratroopers in Poland

'The president has been clear we are not sending U.S. troops to Ukraine and there is no change in that position,' a White House spokesperson clarified to Fox News on Friday.

Biden has persistently said that troops would not be sent into Ukraine under any circumstances during Putin's invasion, fearing it would turn into World War Three and end up becoming a lengthy combat mission like in Afghanistan.

In his fiery speech on Saturday, Biden drew a stark line between democracy and oppression, repeatedly going after Putin and accusing the Russian president of dishonesty.

Speaking outdoors in the cobbled courtyard of the Royal Castle in Warsaw, which was lit with the colors of Poland and Ukraine, Biden accused Putin of 'using brute force and disinformation' to rule.

'It's nothing less than a direct challenges to the rules-based system of international order,' Biden said.

President Joe Biden accused Vladimir Putin of duplicity in the run up to Russia's invasion of Ukraine

Biden also took a cue from Arnold Schwarzenegger - who released a video message to Russians that went viral - and spoke directly to the Russian people.

'I'm telling you the truth. This war is not worthy of you the Russian people,' he said. 'Putin can and must end this war. The American people will stand with you and the brave citizens of Ukraine that want peace.'

And he warned Putin's aggression could bring 'decades of war' to Europe.

'It's nothing less than a direct challenge for the order established since the World War II and it threatens to return to decades of war that ravage Europe before the international rule-based order was put in place. We cannot go back to that,' Biden said.

Biden also moved to calm worried Eastern European nations. He made it clear the NATO alliance would hold together and he warned Russia not to think about expanding his invasion outside of Ukraine.

Poland and the old Eastern bloc nations - like Lativa and Estonia - are worried Putin's ambitions might lead to their borders. But Biden made it clear NATO would protect its member nations and honor Article Five, which states if one is striked, all respond.

'Don't even think about moving on one single inch of NATO territory. We have sacred obligations,' Biden said.

Biden mentioned his own conversations with Putin before Russia's invasion late last month.

He said Putin 'repeatedly he asserted he had no interest in war - guaranteed he would not move.'

'There is simply no justification or provocation for Russia's choice of war.

But Putin and Russia met each of the proposals with disinterest. 'Russia was bent on violence from the start,' he said.

After days of diplomacy and quiet meetings with powerbrokers in Warsaw and Brussels, the White House lined up a speech where Biden could speak in broad strokes about what was at stake, as the U.S. and allies rush to arm Ukraine.

Biden said the war has been 'a strategic failure for Russia already' – alluding to its battlefield losses.

'He, Putin thought Ukrainians would roll over and not fight. Not much of a student of history. Instead, Russian forces have met their match,' he said, in a speech with references to Pope John Paul II, the siege of Stalingrad, and Lech Walesa.

Despite Putin's aims, 'The west is not stronger and more united than it has ever been,' Biden said, pointing to the international response,' Biden said.

'The democracies of the world are revitalized,' said Biden.

In contrast, he said Russia was suffering a 'remarkable brain drain,' with more than 200,000 leaving the country in a month.

'We must commit now to be in this fight for the long haul,' he said, speaking in a country that has been pushing to arm Ukraine while housing more than 2 million refugees.

Punctuating his words, he told a cheering crowd never to be discouraged. 'Be not afraid,' he said.

Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia,' he vowed. 'For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power,' he said, on a day when Russia lobbed new missiles at Lviv in western Ukraine.

Biden began and ended his remarks with a quote from the first Polish pope, Pope John Paul II, telling people: 'Be not afraid.'

Biden has personally attacked Putin before, calling him a war criminal and said he doesn't have a soul.

Earlier Saturday, he called Putin a 'butcher' after holding emotional conversations with Ukrainian refugees – including a pair who fled the horror of the siege at Mariupol.

'He's a butcher,' Biden said when asked what he thought of Putin after what he has done to the people he was meeting.

On March 19, video captured Biden tripping up the stairs as he boarded Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews.

In the clip, Biden stumbles as he walks up the airstairs. He grabs the hand railing to catch his balance, but then loses his footing two additional times.

During the third stumble, he falls to his knees. However, after brushing off his leg, he reaches the top of the plane and gives a salute before disappearing inside.

White House Deputy Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre later told reporters that Biden was '100 percent fine' and preparing for his trip in Atlanta.

'It's pretty windy outside. It's very windy. I almost fell coming up the steps myself,' she said.

Just one day earlier, during a press conference on March 18 (pictured), he referred to Vice President Kamala Harris as 'President Harris'

Just one day earlier, Biden accidentally referred to Vice President Kamala Harris as 'President Harris.'

The gaffe occurred during a press conference on March 18, during which he lauded his administration for being close to meeting their goal of 100 million COVID-19 vaccine doses in his first 100 days in office.

'Now when President Harris and I took a virtual tour of a vaccination center in Arizona not long ago, one of the nurses on that, on that tour injecting people, giving vaccinations, said that each shot was like administering a dose of hope,' Biden said.

Harris was standing behind Biden as the president carried on with his speech, but did not correct himself.

Later that day, when the White House released the transcript of his speech, Harris's proper title was inserted with brackets.

On March 9, while making a speech, Biden seemed to forget the name of Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin (above)

In a speech on March 9, Biden seemed to fumble with his words and forget the name of his Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin.

'I want to thank Sec - the former general - I keep calling him 'General,'' Biden said.

'My - the guy who runs that outfit over there. I want to make sure we thank the Secretary for all he's done to try to implement what we've just talked about, and for recommending these two women for promotion.' The slip-occurred despite the fact that just a few minutes earlier, he had mentioned Austin's name in the speech without an issue.

On Election Day, in November, Biden introduced a crowd to his granddaughter, but referred to her as his son

During an Election Day speech in Philadelphia, Biden stumbled over his words and confused his granddaughter with his late son, Beau Biden.

Biden told the crowd: 'I want to introduce you to two of my granddaughters...this is my son, Beau Biden who a lot of you helped elect to the Senate in Delaware.'

The commander-in-chief had meant to introduce the crowed to Natalie, Beau's daughter, but hadn't just mixed up the name but the person - he also put his arm around Finnegan Biden, Hunter's daughter.

He finally corrected himself as he draped his arm around Natalie's shoulder and said: 'This is Natalie, this is Beau's daughter.'

Beau Biden passed away in 2015 after a months-long battle with glioblastoma, one of the deadliest types of brain cancer.

TOLD STATE SENATOR IN WHEELCHAIR TO STAND UP

In 2008, Biden told then-Missouri state senator Chuck Graham to stand up for the crowd at a rally, before realizing he was in a wheelchair

Not all of Biden's gaffes occurred in the 2020s or even the 2010s. In fact, some happened in the early aughts.

In September 2008, after Biden had been named former President Barack Obama's running mate, he attended a campaign rally in Missouri.

It was there that he called on then-Missouri state senator Chuck Graham, who passed away last year. to stand up for the crowd.

'I'm told Chuck Graham, state senator, is here. Stand up Chuck, let 'em see you,' Biden said.

It was at that moment he realized Graham was in a wheelchair due to muscular dystrophy.

'Oh, God love you. What am I talking about. I'll tell you what, you're making everybody else stand up, though, pal.'

He called on the United Nations and world powers to come to his aid, as he has in a series of other addresses given around the world since the start of the war on February 24. He compared Russia’s destruction of the port city of Mariupol to the Syrian and Russian destruction wrought on the city of Aleppo in the Syrian war.

“They are destroying our ports,” Zelensky said. “The absence of exports from Ukraine will deal a blow to countries worldwide.”

The loss of Ukrainian wheat already has worried Mideast nations like Egypt, which relies on those exports.

He adds: “The future of Europe rests with your efforts.” He called on countries to increase their exports of energy — something particularly important as Qatar is a world leader in the export of natural gas.

He criticizes Russia for what he described as threatening the world with its nuclear weapons.

“Russia is deliberating bragging they can destroy with nuclear weapons, not only a certain country but the entire planet,” Zelensky says.

He also notes Muslims in Ukraine would have to fight during the upcoming holy fasting month of Ramadan.

“We have to ensure this sacred month of Ramadan is not overshadowed by the misery of people in Ukraine,” he says.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-march-26-2022/
