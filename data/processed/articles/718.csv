PRAGUE, March 20 (Reuters) - The Patriot air defence system has started arriving in Slovakia from NATO partner countries and the deployment will continue in the coming days, Slovakia's defence minister said on Sunday.

The system will be operated by German and Dutch troops and will initially be deployed at the Sliac airport in central Slovakia to help reinforce the defence of NATO's eastern flank.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has prompted the alliance to bolster its defences.

The Patriot system will be part of a new NATO battlegroup in Slovakia, which neighbours Ukraine.

""I am happy to confirm that the first units in charge of deploying the Patriot air defence system are gradually arriving to Slovakia,"" Defence Minister Jaroslav Nad said on Facebook.

Nad said the Patriot system will be a complement and not a replacement of the Soviet-era S-300 system that Slovakia operates.

""Temporarily, the system will be deployed at the Sliac air force base, further deployment areas are being consulted ... so that the security umbrella covers the largest possible part of Slovak territory,"" Nad said.

The minister said last week that Slovakia is willing to give the S-300 to Ukraine if and when it gets a proper replacement.

He reiterated on Sunday that Slovakia was looking for its own replacement of S-300 due to its age, capabilities and dependence on Russia.

Russia has warned against any shipments of advanced air defences to Ukraine and has warned it may target Western arms supplies.

NATO member Slovakia said this week it was willing to provide its Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft system to Ukraine but only on the condition that it received a substitute to avoid an Alliance security gap.

US President Joe Biden promised to help Ukraine get air defence systems with a longer range than the shoulder-borne Stinger missiles already on the ground, but to do so without entering into direct conflict with Russia.

The old S-300 system would be an ideal weapon since the Ukrainian army is already familiar with the hardware.

""I can confirm that the first units to deploy the anti-aircraft Patriot system are gradually arriving,"" Nad said on Facebook, adding the delivery would continue over the next few days.

On Friday, the Netherlands said it would deploy a Patriot battery to the Sliac military base in central Slovakia, and Germany confirmed it would send two more batteries to the country.

Nad reiterated that in the current circumstances, the Russian system had no future in the Slovakian armed forces after the invasion of Ukraine.

Bratislava would instead seek to replace the system with another that would be more compatible with Slovakia's allies and offer better defence, he said.

Nad added the Patriot system would be temporarily based at Sliac, noting that there would be further consideration about where to deploy the hardware that ""covers the largest possible territory in Slovakia"".",https://www.firstpost.com/world/us-delivers-patriot-air-defence-system-to-slovakia-10474111.html

Nato-member Slovakia has started receiving components of Patriot missile defence systems from partner countries, reported Reuters.

The deployment is part of Nato’s efforts to strengthen its defences in the eastern part of the alliance, amid the ongoing Ukraine crisis.

In a tweet, Slovakian Defence Minister Jaroslav Nad confirmed the arrival of the Patriot system.

He tweeted: “Thankful to Germany and Netherlands – First elements of Patriot air defence are arriving to Slovakia. Welcome!”

The move comes weeks after The Netherlands and Germany began preparations to transfer the air defence system to Slovakia.

The deployment is now expected to continue in the upcoming days.

It was reported earlier that the Netherlands will send one Patriot missile defence system while Germany will send two units.

The Patriot air defence system is capable of intercepting tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and advanced aircraft. The PAC-1 version has a range of approximately 70km.

The Patriot system will not replace Slovakia’s existing S-300 missile defence system but will instead compliment it, according to Minister Nad.

He was quoted by Reuters as saying: “Temporarily, the system will be deployed at the Sliac air force base, further deployment areas are being consulted […] so that the security umbrella covers the largest possible part of Slovak territory.”

The missile defence system will be operated by German and Dutch personnel.

Ukraine continues to receive military and humanitarian assistance from the world.

New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced that the government agreed to provide an additional NZD5m ($3.45m) of non-lethal military assistance to Ukraine. The fund will be used to procure fuel, military rations, communications, and military first aid kits.

Last week, US President Biden signed an order approving the transfer of an additional $800m worth of military equipment to Ukraine. The consignment will include anti-aircraft systems, uncrewed aerial systems, grenade launchers, rifles, and munition, among others.",https://www.army-technology.com/news/slovakia-receives-patriot-system/
