The head of the Kharkiv Regional Military Administration Oleg Sinegubov spoke about this on the air of Ukrainian TV channels.

– The armed forces destroyed the enemy base, which was located near the city of Dergachi. They (enemy troops – Ed.) completely retreated to the Russian Federation through the corresponding border. This is a very significant success, because from there there were shelling in the Alekseevka district of the city of Kharkov, – Sinegubov emphasized.

On his Facebook page, he specified that at night the ground units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, together with units of the National Guard and territorial defense, launched a counteroffensive in the direction of Dergachi on the positions of artillery and multiple launch rocket systems of the enemy. From there, the invaders systematically shelled the outskirts of Kharkov.

“After unsuccessful resistance, the enemy resorted to escape, while abandoning military equipment in the form of heavy weapons. Part of the enemy personnel resorted to flight into the forests in the direction of Belgorod. We ask the local population to be prudent and, if possible, contribute to the search,” Sinegubov said.

He clarified that Kharkiv is completely under the defense of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Putin's troops do not carry out active offensive operations, but they continue to carry out rocket and bomb strikes on housing infrastructure on the outskirts of the city.

Over the past day, Russian troops carried out more than 50 shellings from artillery and multiple launch rocket systems in the areas of Alekseevka, Northern and Southern Saltovka, Belgorodskoye Highway, Pyatikhatki, Dergachi.

The hot spot in the Kharkiv region is Izyum. On the eve of March 8, at about 21.25, an enemy fighter air raid from Russian Belgorod took place on this city. At the same time, thanks to the actions of the Air Defense Units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the invaders' aircraft retreated and took the opposite course. There are no losses among the personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

In the Izyum region, hostilities are now continuing, the enemy is establishing pontoon-bridge crossings across the Seversky Donets and Bereka rivers.

In addition, that night there was a battle between the military of the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine and Russian sabotage and reconnaissance groups in the village of Andreevka, Balakleysky district.

The invaders attacked the checkpoint of the State Border Guard Service. During the battle, the DRG was defeated.

– As a result of the battle, the enemy DRG was completely defeated, the personnel of the sabotage group began to run away. At the same time, they threw their wounded comrade in the middle of the field. Our Ukrainian border guards took him prisoner,” Sinegubov informed.

It should be noted that since the beginning of the full-scale invasion of the Russian troops into the territory of Ukraine, the total combat losses of the enemy are approximately more than 12,000 personnel.

More than 300 tanks, more than 1,000 armored fighting vehicles, 120 artillery systems and many other equipment were also destroyed.",https://newsreadonline.com/the-armed-forces-of-ukraine-carried-out-a-successful-counter-offensive-on-the-positions-of-the-russian-troops-from-which-the-enemy-shelled-kharkiv/

According to the General Staff, the occupiers are considering the issue of organizing an effective supply of fuel for their own troops through the use of a stationary network of gas stations and oil storage facilities.

“The enemy plans to create a network of field pipelines on the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine, with the possibility of connecting them to the central oil pipeline and pumping fuel from the territory of the Republic of Belarus,” the report says.

Mr Kuleba, who heads Kyiv’s regional administration, said civilians were due to leave Bucha, Irpin, Hostomel and other towns targeted by Russian bombardment. “I really hope everything will be fine and we’ll look after our people.”

Police said convoys of buses and other vehicles were on their way and they asked residents to follow their instructions.

The mayor of Russian-controlled Enerhodar in the south said civilians had begun boarding buses to leave, but in the north-east officials said another key corridor from Izyum, southeast of Kharkiv, had to be halted because of Russian bombardment.

A woman called Valentina with relatives in the northern city of Chernihiv told the BBC that Ukrainian soldiers had prevented a column of civilians leaving by car on Tuesday.

She spoke to her relatives early on Wednesday: “They were turned back by Ukrainians and were told there were battles on the road. Today they tried again. Yesterday somebody came in the other direction along the road, so it wasn’t closed.” She also said the people in Chernihiv, hiding in cellars from daily Russian missile attacks, had not been told about the evacuation corridors.

Ukraine managed to carry out its first mass evacuation on Tuesday, bussing an estimated 5,000 civilians from Sumy to Poltava, in the centre. The convoy took almost 12 hours to reach the city, forced to drive a long way round areas of active fighting.

BBC correspondent Sarah Rainsford watched the arrivals leave crowded buses and rush for a waiting train. The convoy took almost 12 hours to reach the city, forced to drive a long way round areas of active fighting.

Many on the first convoy out of Sumy were medical students from India. One woman described two “miserable” weeks living mostly underground with dwindling supplies of water and food. “We were starving,” Manisa said.

Another Indian student said the situation, under Russian fire, had been getting worse and more frightening each day.

Ukrainian authorities have previously accused Moscow of shelling a refugee corridor out of the southern city of Mariupol, which is surrounded by Russian forces. Ukraine has previously rejected offers of evacuation routes going to Russia or its ally Belarus.

In some cases Russia has been accused of shelling the exit routes. Ukraine’s military says its troops have repelled Russian advances north of Kyiv and in Kharkiv, which has been heavily shelled.

Ukraine’s armed forces command says its Kyiv troop grouping is “repulsing the enemy’s offensive”, inflicting damage and firmly holding their positions. Russia’s military has not commented on the Kyiv offensive.

In Ukraine’s second city Kharkiv, governor Oleh Synyehubov accused Russia of attacking residential areas on the outskirts with missiles and air strikes.

He also reported Russian air and ground attacks in the Izyum area. He said Russian troops were assembling pontoon bridges across the Seversky Donets and Bereka rivers.",https://www.adomonline.com/ukraine-civilians-flee-towns-near-kyiv-after-more-russian-shelling/
