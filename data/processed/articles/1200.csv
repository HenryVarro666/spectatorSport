Zelenskyy urges Ukrainians to fight

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged Ukrainians to drive Russian troops out of the country.

""We have to go outside! We have to fight! Whenever there is an opportunity,"" Zelensky said in a video message.

Zelensky added that ordinary, unarmed people had opposed Russian units in a number of cities. He said it was important to prevent the establishment of more pro-Russian so-called ""people's republics"" on Ukrainian territory similar to the two currently self-declared in eastern Ukraine.

Addressing the people of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, Zelenskyy said that if Russians ""have not erased you memory through propaganda, if your eyes are not closed in fear - fight, for your rights, you freedom, for Ukraine.""

MSF: Situation in Mariupol 'catastrophic'

A senior official from Doctors Without Borders (MSF) warned on Saturday that the situation in the southeastern Ukrainian port city of Mariupol is ""catastrophic"" and it is vital that civilians be evacuated from the city.

Mariupol is in the Donetsk region of Ukraine and for years lay immediately west of the line of contact between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists.

The city has been under siege by Russian forces. A Saturday cease-fire that could have established a humanitarian corridor failed to materialize.

""It is imperative that this humanitarian corridor, which could have been created today but which has not really been put in place following non-respect of the ceasefire, is put in place very quickly to allow the civilian population, women and children, to get out of this city,"" MSF Ukraine coordinator Laurent Ligozat told the AFP news agency.

Ukraine Foreign Minister: 10,000 Russian troops killed, hundreds of vehicles destroyed

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Saturday that more than 10,000 Russian troops have been killed in Ukraine.

The same assertion had previously been made by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

""Russians keep bearing devastating losses on the ground, and I cannot understand how mothers, wives and daughters of these Russian soldiers bear this pain, seeing how President Putin sends more and more of their beloved ones to Ukraine,"" Kuleba said.

The Russian military claimed a substantially lower death toll of 498 on Wednesday.

Kuleba also said in a video message released by the Ukrainian government that Russia had lost dozens of aircraft and hundreds of armored vehicles.

Shell vows to spend profits from Russian oil on aid for Ukraine

Shell said it would use profits from Russian oil it bought to ""alleviate the terrible consequences that this war is having on the people of Ukraine.""

The company vowed to work with aid and humanitarian agencies to determine where the money should go.

At the same time, Shell admitted it continued to buy some products from Russia to supply the needs of its refineries and chemical plants.

""Cargoes from alternative sources would not have arrived in time to avoid disruptions to market supply,"" Shell said in a statement.

Ukraine's foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba lashed out at the energy giant for continuing to do business with Russia.

""One question to Shell: doesn't Russian oil smell (like) Ukrainian blood for you?'' Kuleba said on Twitter. ""I call on all conscious people around the globe to demand multinational companies to cut all business ties with Russia.""

Shell said it will ""choose alternatives to Russian oil, wherever possible, but this cannot happen overnight.""

These purchases are necessary, ""to keep Europe moving and in business,"" Shell said.

Zelenskyy asks US lawmakers to 'close the skies or give us planes'

Over Zoom, Zelenskyy made a ""desperate plea"" to nearly 300 US congressional lawmakers to help his country get more planes.

Zelenskyy told senators he needed planes and drones more than other security tools.

His message was simple: ""close the skies or give us planes,"" Senator Ben Sasse said.

Senator Lindsey Graham underscored that NATO countries had such warplanes. ""So let's get them the planes and drones they need,"" Graham said in a video posted on Twitter.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said, ""Congress was working on a $10 billion (€9.14 billion) aid package.

""We will get that assistance of over $10 billion in economic, humanitarian and security assistance to the Ukrainian people quickly,"" Schumer asserted.

Russia, Ukraine to hold third round of talks on Monday

Representatives from Ukraine and Russia will meet on Monday for a third round of talks, Ukrainian negotiator David Arakhamia said on Facebook.

Ukraine said on Saturday that the first two rounds of talks had not produced results but would keep pursuing negotiations.

On Thursday, the sides agreed to open humanitarian corridors to allow civilians out of some combat zones. The planned civilian evacuations from Mariupol and Volnovakha, however, failed as both sides accused each other of ceasefire violations.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy requests for NATO's assistance were not helping talks.

He said Moscow was ready for a third round.

Russia says cease-fire in Mariupol, Volnovakha ends

Russia said it is resuming its attacks on the cities of Mariupol and Volnovakha after a temporary cease-fire.

Moscow accused Ukraine of breaking the cease-fire deal for the two cities.

Russia announced the cease-fire earlier in the day, with Ukraine claiming that Russian shelling has not stopped.

Ukrainian authorities said thousands of civilians remained trapped in the two southern cities.

Authorities in Mariupol asked people to return to their homes

""For security reasons, the evacuation is therefore postponed,"" they said on Telegram, adding that negotiations continued with Russia on how to ""ensure a safe humanitarian corridor.""

Russia's accused Ukrainian ""nationalists"" of preventing civilians from leaving.

Britain said the proposed ceasefire was probably an attempt to deflect international condemnation while giving itself a chance to reset its forces for a renewed offensive.

""By accusing Ukraine of breaking the agreement, Russia is likely seeking to shift responsibility for current and future civilian casualties in the city,"" the British defense ministry wrote on Twitter.

Red Cross offers to help civilians fleeing from Mariupol and Volnovakha

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) says it was trying to ensure the safe passages of civilians from Ukraine's southern cities of Mariupol and Volnovakha.

Ukrainian officials accused Russia of breaching a ceasefire to allow civilians to flee from the cities.

Russian President Vladimir Putin blamed Ukraine forces of sabotaging the effort. He claimed the actions of Ukraine's leadership called into question the future of the country's statehood.

""If this happens, it will be entirely on their conscience,'' he said.

""Regardless of whether humanitarian corridors are implemented in the coming days, parties must continue to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure under international humanitarian law bot for those who choose to leave and those who remain,"" the ICRC said.

The organization offered to help facilitate the safe passage of people.

""Any initiative from the parties that gives civilians a respite from the violence and allows them to voluntarily leave for safer areas is welcome,"" it said.

Italy's TV RAI suspends reporting in Russia

A number of international news websites, including DW, the BBC and Meduza, are no longer accessible in Russia. On Friday, Russian media regulator Roskomnadzor said access to the websites had been ""limited.""

US top diplomat Blinken meets refugees in Poland

During a diplomatic trip to Poland, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited a refugee center and met people fleeing the war in Ukraine.

Some 3,000 people are currently staying in a former shopping mall in Korczowa, close to the Ukrainian border.

A 48-year-old woman from the Ukrainian town of Kropyvnytskyi said she reached Poland by a bus with her four adopted children and was hoping to reach her brother in Germany. Her home town is 800 kilometers (about 500 miles) from the refugee center. The woman's husband stayed behind.

""There they bombed planes at the airport,"" she was quoted as saying by the AP news agency. ""Of course we were afraid.""

The people housed in Korczowa are but a fraction of over 750,000 refugees who have reached Poland, with hundreds of thousands more fleeing to other countries.

Germany to build a LNG terminal to reduce reliance on Russia

The German government is funding a terminal to import liquefied natural gas (LNG), officials said on Saturday, as the war in Ukraine has the EU's largest economy reconsider its energy dependence on Moscow.

Currently, Germany has no LNG terminals and imports around 55% of its gas via pipelines from Russia.

The LNG terminal will be located in Brunsbüttel in northwest Germany, where the river Elbe flows into the North Sea. The authorities hope to eventually repurpose it for import of hydrogen, a sustainable energy source.

Economy and Climate Minister Robert Habeck restated Germany's position that gas would serve to bridge the gap to sustainable energy.

""And it is also necessary to reduce the dependency on imports from Russia, this is urgent at least since Russia's attack on Ukraine,"" he said in a statement.

Turkey's Erdogan will urge Putin to stop the Ukraine war 'immediately'

Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan is set to speak with Russia's Vladimir Putin on Sunday, and will call on the Russian president to ""end this war immediately.""

Putin: Russia will see no-fly zone over Ukraine as joining conflict

Russia's President Vladimir Putin warned against Kyiv's plea for NATO to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine. NATO has already rejected the idea on Friday.

""Any movement in this direction [toward establishing a no-fly zone] we will see as taking part in the armed conflict by the country from whose territory originate threats for our troops,"" Putin said on Saturday.

""This same second we will perceive them as parties to the military conflict"" regardless of organizations they may be members of, according to the Kremlin chief.

Putin also claimed that Russian forces have almost finished their task of destroying Ukraine's military infrastructure.

The military leadership was targeting ""arms depots, munitions depots, airforce, air defense systems,"" he was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency. ""That work is practically completed.""

He praised the course of military action as ""absolutely right,"" saying that simply reinforcing pro-Russian separatists on the previously existing frontlines would have been counterproductive.

The comments come as many Western observers deem the Russian offensive to be delayed or stalled due to heavy resistance and logistical failures.

But Putin said he had no doubt that the Russian military would fulfill all of its goals.

""This is clear from the entire process of the operation,"" he said. ""It is following the plan, the chart.""

The Russian president rejected allegations that he was going to impose martial law, saying it wasn't necessary at the moment. He described Western sanctions as a ""declaration of war.""

German public broadcasters stop reporting from Russia

German public broadcasters ARD and ZDF have joined other non-Russian media outlets including BBC News and Bloomberg News in suspending reporting from Russia.

Russia's Aeroflot halting international flights

Russia's flagship carrier Aeroflot has said it will stop all flights to other countries from March 8, with the exception of those to Belarus.

A statement on the company's website cited new ""circumstances that impede the operation of flights.""

The move comes amid massive Western sanctions over Moscow's invasion of neighboring Ukraine.

Earlier, Russia's aviation agency, Rosaviatsiya, advised all Russian airlines with foreign-leased planes to halt all flights abroad.

It said there was a high risk of such planes being impounded amid Western sanctions that ban leasing of planes to Russia.

Mariupol evacuation delayed amid alleged cease-fire violations

The Mariupol city council has halted the evacuation of its citizens through a humanitarian corridor, alleging that Russian troops are violating a cease-fire meant to allow civilians to leave the city within a five-hour window.

""Due to the fact that the Russian side does not adhere to the cease-fire and has continued shelling both of Mariupol itself and its environs and for security reasons, the evacuation of the civilian population has been postponed,"" city officials said in a statement on social media.

Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said in a televised broadcast that Russia was not observing the cease-fire.

DW correspondent Fanny Facsar, who is in the southwestern Ukrainian city of Chernivtsi, said that there had been some skepticism anyway about whether cease-fires would actually eventuate despite promises made at a second round of talks between the two sides on March 3.

Mariupol deputy mayor, Serhiy Orlov, also earlier told British broadcaster BBC: ""The Russians are continuing to bomb us and use artillery. It is crazy...There is no cease-fire in Mariupol and there is no cease-fire all along the route. Our civilians are ready to escape but they cannot escape under shelling.""

According to the Ukrainski Novini news agency, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier appealed to those who were capable of defending the city to stay on and ""continue the fight.""

""If everyone leaves, then whose city will it be?"" he said.

Mazepin was racing for Haas alongside Mick Schumacher, the 22-year-old son of racing legend Michael Schumacher. The Russian national has been with the team for one season but failed to register any points during the championship.

It was not immediately clear who will replace Mazepin less than two weeks before the season officially opens in Bahrain.

Konashev also confirmed that the Russian forces declared a localized cease-fire was in effect in Mariupol and Volnovakha, with the humanitarian corridors and evacuation routes agreed with the Ukrainian side.

According to the spokesman, Russian forces are ""conducting advancement on a wide front"" in Ukraine.

Ukraine says over 60,000 men returned from abroad to fight

Ukraine's defense minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said on Saturday that more than 60,000 Ukrainian men had returned from abroad to help defend their country against the Russian invasion.

He said their return enabled the formation of 12 more combat brigades.

Poland’s Border Guard said last Sunday that some 22,000 people had crossed into Ukraine since the preceding Thursday, when Russia invaded the country.

Elon Musk says Starlink won't block Russian news sources

Space X chief Elon Musk has said that his Starlink satellite internet provider will not block Russian news sources.

Musk claimed in a tweet that some countries, which did not include Ukraine, have told Starlink to block Russian news sources.

""We will not do so unless at gunpoint,"" Musk said. ""Sorry to be a free speech absolutist.""

The tech mogul had on Thursday warned that Starlink internet service could be targeted by a Russian attack.

Musk had also recently sent Starlink antennas to Ukraine to help civilians stay online amid the invasion.

Musk's statement comes as Russia blocked Facebook and passed a law that gave Moscow stronger powers to clamp down on independent journalism.

Journalists have also said that they were instructed by Russian authorities to only publish information based on official sources, which describe the war as a ""special military operation"" and claim it is intended to ""liberate"" Russian-speaking communities in Ukraine.

Singapore sanctions Russia

Singapore has announced sanctions against Moscow in the strongest stand on the Russian invasion of Ukraine by a Southeast Asian nation so far.

The sanctions include a ban on dealing with four Russian banks and an export ban on electronics, computers and military items as a response to what Singapore said was Russia’s ""dangerous precedent"" in Ukraine.

It is rare for the international shipping hub to impose sanctions of its own. However, Singapore said it would not allow the export of items that could inflict harm on or subjugate Ukrainians or help Moscow launch cyber attacks.

""We cannot accept the Russian government's violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of another sovereign state,"" Singapore's Foreign Ministry said on Saturday. ""For a small state like Singapore, this is not a theoretical principle, but a dangerous precedent. This is why Singapore has strongly condemned Russia's unprovoked attack.""

UN Security Council to meet on humanitarian crisis

The United Nations Security Council will convene an emergency meeting on the humanitarian crisis triggered in Ukraine by the Russian invasion, diplomats said on Friday.

Following the public session scheduled for Monday, the 15 members of the Security Council will meet behind closed doors to mull over a possible draft resolution, news agency AFP reported, citing a diplomat.

The closed-door meeting has reportedly been proposed by Mexico and France.

The two countries have been pressing for a draft that urges an end to hostilities in Ukraine and calls for a flow of humanitarian aid and protection of civilians.

Russia, as a permanent member with the power to veto any Security Council resolution, is extremely unlikely to allow any resolution against it to pass.

Over 1.2 million people have fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion began.

Attacks on Kyiv and Mariupol

Several Ukrainian cities have come under renewed assault as the war enters into its second week.

The southeastern port city of Mariupol has been encircled and shelled. Mariupol is located on the Azov Sea coast, immediately west of the previous line of contact between Ukrainian and pro-Russian forces.

According to Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko, the city had no water, heat or electricity and was running out of food after five days under attack. Ukrainian presidential advisor Oleksiy Arestovych said Mariupol was ""partially under siege.""

Meanwhile, Kyiv came under renewed assault and explosions could be heard from the city center. A Russian armored column had been stalled outside the city for days.

Arestovych said battles involving airstrikes and artillery continued northwest of Kyiv.

He added that the northeastern cities of Kharkiv and Okhtyrka came under heavy fire.

Summary of events in Ukraine-Russia crisis on Friday

Russia came under heavy criticism on Friday over shelling the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, Europe's largest nuclear power plant. Russian troops took control of the power plant after fighting early Friday morning.

Russian President Vladimir Putin signed legislation imposing harsh jail terms for publishing ""fake news"" about Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The move led several news organizations to reevaluate their operations in Moscow. Other international news agencies, including DW, have been blocked inside Russia along with the social media networks Facebook and Twitter. The move has serious implications for Russians' ability to access independent sources of information.

Putin’s latest rhetorical escalation of tensions came hours after an effort to evacuate civilians from the besieged city of Mariupol was suspended when Ukraine said Russian forces violated a temporary cease-fire with an ongoing barrage of shelling.

The apparent collapse of the first agreement to create humanitarian corridors in the country underscored the perilous existence of civilians facing a Russian assault that has brought death and destruction to its democratic neighbor.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy continued his efforts Saturday to bolster support for his embattled country and for added pressure on Russia.

On a video conference call with about 300 members of Congress on Saturday morning, Zelenskyy doubled down on the need to establish a no-fly zone over Ukrainian airspace, multiple sources on the call told NBC News.

He also requested that Visa and Mastercard suspend operations in Russia, according to three people on the call, which both financial services corporations did Saturday.

President Joe Biden and Zelenskyy spoke for about 30 minutes Saturday evening, and Biden said the decision by Visa and Mastercard was welcomed, according to a readout of the call provided by the White House.

Zelenskyy said in a tweet that the two presidents had discussed issues of security, financial support for Ukraine and the continuation of sanctions.

Ukrainian officials have leaned on the messaging app Telegram to spread information

Also on Saturday Israel’s prime minister met with Putin in Moscow. Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett’s office confirmed the meeting at the Kremlin, which came just days after Bennett spoke over the phone with both Russia and Ukrainian leaders.

Zelenskyy in his latest national address via his Telegram channel told Ukrainians “in all our cities where the enemy has entered, feel it, go on the offensive!”

“When you do not have weapons, and you are answered with shots — you do not run,” Zelenskyy said Saturday afternoon. “Occupation — is temporary and artificial. Ukrainians do not retreat and do not give up!”

No-fly zone

Since Putin launched the invasion nine days ago, he has seen his military struggle against staunch Ukrainian resistance and his country subject to global condemnation, isolation and crippling economic sanctions.

On Saturday, Putin described those sanctions as “methods of fighting against Russia.”

These sanctions that you can see here are the equivalent of war, but thankfully it has not come to an actual war,” he said during a visit to a training center for Russian airline Aeroflot.

Any country that moved to create a no-fly zone above Ukraine would be viewed as “participants of this conflict,” he added.

The United States and its Western allies have also said that the creation of no-fly zone would be likely to put them on course for a direct military confrontation with Russia and risk a wider war.

However, Zelenskyy has lashed out at NATO for rejecting a no-fly zone, arguing the decision was giving Russia a “green light” to continue shelling his country.

Zelenskyy also called for the need for a no-fly zone on his call with Congress on Saturday morning, and appealed for fighter jets and other military aid.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., one of the lawmakers on the call, told Zelenskyy that Congress will get the “$10 billion in economic, humanitarian, and security assistance to the Ukrainian people quickly,” according to two people with knowledge of the call.

A White House spokesperson said Saturday that the Biden administration was in talks with Poland about a deal that would involve Poland donating its old Russian-made MiG fighters to Ukraine, and replacing them with the purchase of U.S.-made F-16 jets.

Also Saturday, the U.S. government allowed an approved Russian government airliner into Dulles, Virginia on Saturday in an effort to “facilitate the departure of Russian UN Mission personnel who were expelled for abuse of their privileges of residence,” according to a State Department spokeswoman in Brussels.

This comes days after the U.S. Mission to the United Nations said it was expelling a dozen Russian diplomats for conducting espionage. Since then, the U.S. banned Russian planes from U.S. airspace.

“This special exception was done in accordance with federal regulations to ensure Russian mission personnel and their families departed by the date we had instructed,” she said.

On Saturday, the U.S. Department of State urged Americans to not travel to Russia. The agency is also advising U.S. citizens living or traveling in Russia to “depart immediately,” pointing out that “limited commercial flight options are still available.”

“Do not travel to Russia due to the unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces in Ukraine, the potential for harassment against U.S. citizens by Russian government security officials, the Embassy’s limited ability to assist U.S. citizens in Russia, Covid-19 and related entry restrictions, terrorism, limited flights into and out of Russia, and the arbitrary enforcement of local law,” the U.S. Department of State said in a statement.

The warning comes amid reports Saturday afternoon that WNBA player Brittney Griner was arrested in Russia after the Russian Federal Customs Service said it discovered cartridges containing hashish oil in her luggage at the Sheremetyevo airport near Moscow.

USA Basketball and her team, Phoenix Mercury, said they are monitoring the situation and are working to get the American athlete home.

Visa, Mastercard halt operations

Adding to the financial measures taken against Russia, Visa and Mastercard announced Saturday that they would be suspending operations in that country.

The suspension, which is effective immediately, means Visa cards issued in Russia would no longer work outside the country, and cards issued outside of Russia won’t work within the Russian Federation, Visa said.

“We are compelled to act following Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, and the unacceptable events that we have witnessed,” Visa Chairman and CEO Al Kelly said in a statement. “We regret the impact this will have on our valued colleagues, and on the clients, partners, merchants and cardholders we serve in Russia. This war and the ongoing threat to peace and stability demand we respond in line with our values.”

Mastercard said in a statement it has no other choice but to suspend its network in the country in order to comply with global regulators and sanctions that aim to squeeze targeted financial institutions.

“We don’t take this decision lightly,” it said, citing its 25 years of operating in Russia, where nearly 200 of its colleagues work. “When it is appropriate, and if it is permissible under the law, we will use their passion and creativity to work to restore operations.”

Mastercard accounts issued by Russian banks will no longer work, the company said, and those from outside the country won’t be approved at retailers and ATMs inside Russia.

Earlier this week, Visa and Mastercard blocked some Russian financial institutions from their networks but not all.

On Tuesday American Express, which says its presence in Russia is “small,” said in a statement that it has halted relationships with banks targeted by U.S. and European Union sanctions.

On Feb. 26, the U.S. and its allies announced they were moving to cut Russia off from the SWIFT global financial network that facilitates rapid transactions between institutions around the world.

Evacuation efforts suspended

Putin’s comments came after an effort to evacuate civilians from the besieged city of Mariupol was suspended Saturday after Ukraine said Russian forces violated a temporary cease-fire announced hours earlier.

Russia and Ukraine both said they had agreed to a temporary cease-fire early Saturday in the key port city, Mariupol, and smaller nearby city Volnovakha to allow the creation of humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians.

But shortly after the evacuations were set to begin, Mariupol’s city council said that Russian forces continued shelling the city and surrounding areas.

“We ask all Mariupol residents to disperse and follow to the places of shelter,” it said in a post on Telegram, adding that negotiations were ongoing to ensure a safe route out of the city, which has been encircled and bombarded for days.

Russia has consistently denied targeting civilians. Without offering evidence, the country’s defense ministry said no one had made use of the corridors and accused Ukrainian “nationalists” of preventing civilians from leaving, the RIA state news agency reported.

The announcement of a limited cease-fire had appeared to represent the first breakthrough in allowing civilians to escape a Russian assault that has brought death and destruction to the country.

The move came after a second round of talks between the two countries earlier this week produced an agreement on the creation of humanitarian corridors, though no progress was made on a broader halt to Moscow’s attack on its democratic neighbor.

Since he launched the invasion nine days ago, Putin has seen his military struggle against staunch resistance on the ground and moved increasingly to bombarding cities and towns from the air.

The conflict has fueled a growing humanitarian crisis and left Moscow facing global condemnation.

Russia's attacks on Mariupol, a large southeastern city on the Azov Sea, have hit critical infrastructure and left it without water, heat or electricity.

The strategic port city has remained in Ukrainian hands, but its council has accused Russia of creating a “humanitarian catastrophe” and hindering the supply of food.

Mariupol’s city council said evacuations would take place in stages over several days, with the first window between 4 a.m. ET and 9 a.m. ET. Saturday. It said the corridor would extend to the city of Zaporizhzhia, about 140 miles away.

The corridor would allow the restoration of critical infrastructure to begin and make it possible to deliver medicine and other supplies, the council said, adding that civilians would be able to leave using designated bus routes and their own cars. Drivers should “fill the vehicles as much as possible,” it said.

However just before 6 a.m. ET the city council posted an urgent update telling residents the evacuation was postponed and they should seek shelter, with Russian shelling seemingly ongoing.

Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereschuk, also accused Russian forces of “shelling Volnovakha with heavy weapons” in a video posted to Telegram. She added that there was ongoing fighting on the route between Mariupol and Zaporizhzhia.

“I hereby state that Russia has violated this agreement, failed to fulfill its duty,” she said.

Russian gains in the south

Russian forces have made key gains in the south in recent days, seizing control of the city of Kherson, further along the coast, and Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe’s largest, after an attack that sparked a fire and brief fears of nuclear meltdown.

Ukraine’s nuclear regulator has maintained communications with staff at the plant in southeastern Ukraine, the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement Saturday.

Two of the six reactors at the plant are operating, technical safety systems remain intact and radiation levels are normal, the agency said.

But Russia's progress has come with an intensifying aerial assault on civilian areas across Ukraine, driving a rapid exodus that has seen more than 1 million people flee the country while others have been left to shelter in their basements or local metro stations.

In an update early Saturday, Britain’s ministry of defense said that the overall rate of Russian air and artillery strikes appeared to have fallen in the past 24 hours, however.

It added that Russian forces were “probably advancing on the southern port city of Mykolaiv,” and it was possible some would continue on to Odessa, a crucial port. If captured it could largely shut the country off from international shipping.

Russia’s campaign in northern Ukraine has struggled to make similar progress, but the ministry of defense update said that in addition to Mariupol it was “highly likely” that Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, as well as Sumy and Chernihiv, were encircled by Russian forces. There were also reports of street fighting in Sumy, it said.

Fierce defense in those cities has helped thwart a Russian advance on Kyiv, the capital.

Putin’s initial aim seemed to be the overthrow of Zelenskyy’s Western-leaning government in order to install a regime friendlier to the Kremlin and restore Moscow's influence over its neighbors three decades after the fall of the Soviet Union.

But dogged Ukrainian resistance has slowed the advance of Russian troops, fueling fears that Moscow could resort to more brutal violence and escalate what is already one of the most intense military conflicts on the continent since World War II.

Growing casualties and refugees

Since Russia invaded on Feb. 24, there have been 1,058 civilian casualties, including at least 351 civilian deaths and 19 children, the United Nations human rights office said Saturday, although it noted that it believes the ""real figures are considerably higher.""

Fearing Russian attacks, tens of thousands of people have packed train stations in Kyiv and elsewhere to head west to cities like Lviv, which has become a hub for diplomatic efforts and news media.

Aid agencies have warned of a humanitarian disaster across the country as food, water and medical supplies run short. The number of refugees could rise to 1.5 million by the end of the weekend from a current 1.3 million, the head of the United Nations refugee agency said Saturday.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukraine-russia-war-updates-temporary-cease-fire-mariupol-russia-says-rcna18831

In a statement, the city council asked residents to return to shelters in the city and await further information on evacuation.

In a televised broadcast, Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said Russia was not observing an agreed ceasefire in some areas, preventing a joint plan to allow civilians to evacuate.

Meanwhile, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, accused the Nato alliance of bending to Russian pressure and said it was not the force that Ukrainians had previously imagined. Speaking on Ukrainian television, he said he was open to talks with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, but only if they were “meaningful”.

The Russian defence ministry said its units had opened humanitarian corridors near Mariupol and Volnovakha, a smaller city 40 miles (65km) to the north, on Saturday morning. Evacuations from Mariupol had been due to begin at 11am local time (0900 GMT).

01:13 Footage shows devastated town of Volnovakha, Ukraine – video

Located on the Sea of Azov, the city of 450,000 people has become the scene of growing misery amid days of shelling that has knocked out power and most phone service and raised the prospect of food and water shortages for hundreds of thousands of people in freezing weather. The city represents a potential strategic advantage for Moscow’s invasion, connecting it to the Russian forces coming from annexed Crimea, as well as to the troops in the Donbas.

In Volnovakha, the attack is still so intense that dead bodies lie uncollected, those hiding in shelters are running out of food, and about 90% of the city has been damaged by bombing, local MP Dmytro Lubinets said.

Before the postponement, the Ukrainian government said the plan was to evacuate about 200,000 people from Mariupol and 15,000 from Volnovakha, and that the Red Cross would act as the ceasefire’s guarantor. An adviser to Ukraine’s interior ministry said there would be agreements on humanitarian corridors for other cities.

Turkey said the humanitarian ceasefires declared by Russia should be countrywide and lasting. The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, said evacuation and aid shipment corridors must be opened across the country and that it was working to evacuate its citizens in Ukraine by bus and train.

The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, was due to speak to Vladimir Putin by phone on Sunday. A spokesperson said Turkey was ready to help resolve the crisis.

Putin said on Saturday that western sanctions on Russia were akin to a declaration of war and warned that any attempt to impose a no-fly zone in Ukraine would lead to catastrophic consequences for the world.

Putin reiterated that his aims were to defend Russian-speaking communities through the “demilitarisation and de-nazification” of the country so that Russia’s former Soviet neighbour becomes neutral and no longer threatens Russia.

Ukraine and western countries have dismissed this as a baseless pretext for the invasion he launched on 24 February and imposed a sweeping range of sanctions aimed at isolating Moscow.

“These sanctions that are being imposed are akin to a declaration of war, but thank God it has not come to that,” Putin said, speaking to a group of flight attendants at an Aeroflot training centre near Moscow.

Mariupol and Volnovakha are just two of many cities across Ukraine left reeling by a devastating campaign of shelling and artillery from Russian forces. The Russian defence ministry said on Saturday a broad offensive would continue elsewhere in Ukraine.

Ukraine said Russian forces were trying to encircle the capital, Kyiv, and Kharkiv, the country’s second biggest city, while attempting to set up a land bridge to Crimea.

Authorities in Sumy, about 190 miles east of Kyiv, reportedly urged residents to stay inside shelters, warning there could be fighting in the city’s streets.

Russian forces have taken control of a psychiatric hospital in the town of Borodyanka in Ukraine’s Kyiv region, with 670 people inside, the regional governor Oleksiy Kuleba told local media on Saturday.

“Today we do not understand how to evacuate these people, how to help them,” Kuleba said. “They are running out of water and medicines,” he said. “These are people with certain special needs, they need constant help … Many of them have been bedridden for years.”

The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, made a “desperate plea” for eastern Europe to provide Russian-made aircraft to Ukraine during a call with US senators on Saturday, said the chamber’s majority leader, Chuck Schumer. “These planes are very much needed. And I will do all I can to help the administration to facilitate their transfer,” Schumer said in a statement.

On Friday night Zelenskiy had lashed out at Nato for ruling out a no-fly zone, saying it gave a “green light for further bombing of Ukrainian cities and villages”.

“All the people who die from this day forward will also die because of you, because of your weakness, because of your lack of unity,” the Ukrainian president said in an emotional address, in which he praised the bravery of the Ukrainian resistance.

Nato said on Friday that a no-fly zone could provoke full-fledged war in Europe with nuclear-armed Russia, causing far greater loss of life.

As people flee the crisis, a humanitarian disaster is unfolding, with more than 1.3 million people seeking refuge in western Ukraine and neighbouring countries. The UN security council will hold an emergency meeting Monday on the humanitarian crisis triggered by the invasion, diplomats said on Friday.

While laying siege to Mariupol for days, Russian forces also cut its electricity, food, water, heating and transportation in the depths of winter, prompting comparisons to the Nazi blockade of Leningrad in World War II.

""For now, we are looking for solutions to humanitarian problems and all possible ways to get Mariupol out of the blockade,"" said mayor Vadim Boychenko. He called for a ceasefire and a humanitarian corridor for food and medicine.

Since President Vladimir Putin's army invaded on February 24, Russia has pummelled Ukrainian cities, killed hundreds of civilians and assaulted Europe's largest atomic power plant.

The invasion has drawn condemnation and severe sanctions from Western nations balancing punishment of the Kremlin with fears of a hazardous escalation.

Moscow has seized two key cities in its 10-day-long invasion, Berdiansk and Kherson on Ukraine's southern Black Sea coast.

But capturing Mariupol, a city of about 450,000 people on the Azov Sea, would represent a bigger prize for Russian forces as it would deal a severe blow to Ukraine's maritime access and connect troops coming from annexed Crimea and the Donbas.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said late Friday that Moscow was waiting for a third round of talks with Ukraine in Belarus, and one of Kyiv's negotiators said it hoped to hold them this weekend.

""The third leg could take place tomorrow or the day after, we are in constant contact,"" Ukrainian presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak said Friday.

As Russia bombed cities across the country, the Ukrainian military said on Facebook that Moscow's main focus was to encircle Kyiv.

In a hospital in the Ukrainian capital, wounded soldiers told AFP of their grim battle against the Russian advance, and vowed to return to the frontline.

""We were on reconnaissance and came across an enemy column that had made a breakthrough,"" said Motyka, 29, who was hit by shrapnel on his right side.

""We fought them and killed their soldiers on foot, but they showered us with mortar fire.""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was set to appeal to Washington for more assistance Saturday. He will address the US Senate as some lawmakers urged President Joe Biden to take tougher measures, including banning Russia's oil imports.

No no-fly zone

Zelensky had earlier criticised NATO for ruling out a no-fly zone, saying the Western military alliance had essentially given ""the green light for further bombing of Ukrainian cities and villages"".

In the northern city Chernihiv, 47 people died Thursday when Russian forces bombed residential areas, including schools and a high-rise apartment block, according to local officials.

""We are faced together with what is President Putin's war of choice, unprovoked, unjustified, and a war that is having horrific, horrific consequences,"" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in Brussels.

""We're committed to doing everything we can to make it stop.""

Putin on Friday told his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko that ""the tasks set for the (Ukraine) operations are going according to plan and will be fulfilled in their entirety"".

With fears growing of nuclear conflict, the US and Russian armed forces have set up a new direct phone line to reduce the risks of ""miscalculation,"" the Pentagon said Friday.

Russian forces attacked and seized the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant on Friday, pushing Kyiv to accuse Moscow of ""nuclear terror"".

Ukrainian monitors say there has been no spike in radiation after a fire in a training facility.

Moscow denied it had shelled the plant.

Media exodus

Peskov called on Russians ""to unite around our president"" after thousands braved mass arrests at anti-war demonstrations this week.

In an apparent response to the unrest, Russian authorities have imposed a news blackout and several media outlets have halted operations.

Multiple media websites, including the BBC, were partially inaccessible in Russia.

Twitter was restricted and Facebook blocked.

The BBC and Bloomberg said they were suspending work in Russia after lawmakers in Moscow approved legislation to impose fines and jail terms of up to 15 years for anyone publishing ""fake news"" about the army.

""This legislation appears to criminalise the process of independent journalism,"" BBC Director-General Tim Davie said in a statement.

CNN said it would halt broadcasting in Russia, while independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta said it would remove Ukraine content in the wake of the new law.

'Whole world against you'

Putin has been unmoved as Russia has become an economic, sporting and cultural pariah.

But UN prosecutors at The Hague are investigating a possible war crime in the eastern city of Kharkiv, where authorities say residential areas were indiscriminately shelled.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba demanded a special tribunal, alleging there were ""numerous cases of, unfortunately, when Russian soldiers rape women in the Ukrainian cities"".

In Geneva, the UN Human Rights Council voted to create a top-level investigation into violations committed in the invasion.

""The message to Putin has been clear: you're isolated on a global level and the whole world is against you,"" Ukrainian ambassador Yevheniia Filipenko said after the vote.

The UN Security Council will hold an emergency meeting Monday on the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine and discuss a possible draft resolution, diplomats told AFP Friday.

The UN says more than 1.2 million refugees have flooded into neighbouring countries.

The global body's food agency has warned the conflict will create a food crisis in Ukraine and worsen global food insecurity, with Moscow and Kyiv providing around 29 percent of the global wheat trade.

4,ed8d7e2e-6374-4172-818d-676d2b801eac,[],,"A strategic Ukrainian city put off a planned evacuation of residents Saturday, blaming Russia for breaking a temporary ceasefire as Russian President Vladimir Putin warned the West of a wider war if a no-fly zone is set up.

“Any movement in this direction will be considered by us as participation in an armed conflict by that country,” Putin said.

With his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky criticizing NATO for ruling out a no-fly zone for fear of sparking nuclear conflict, Putin spoke of “colossal and catastrophic consequences not only for Europe but also the whole world,” if such a zone was set up.

For Zelensky, on day 10 of the invasion, under an escalating bombardment that has flattened more and more infrastructure and sent nearly 1.4 million civilians fleeing for their lives, the Western military alliance’s “no” to a no-fly zone had essentially given “the green light for further bombing of Ukrainian cities and villages.”

Under siege, Mariupol proudly resisted Moscow-backed rebels during a 2014 conflict, but the Azov seaport has for days been without electricity, food, and water in the dead of winter and people began gathering for the evacuation.

However, city officials called for a delay in the evacuation, saying: “The Russian side does not adhere to the ceasefire and has continued shelling both Mariupol itself and its environment, and for security reasons, the evacuation of the civilian population has been postponed.”

Negotiations were underway “to establish a ceasefire and ensure a safe humanitarian corridor,” Mariupol authorities added.

An evacuation had been seen as a prelude to a final assault that, if successful, would see the Russian army push north from occupied Crimea and link up with their forces from the east and take control of Ukraine’s coast on the Azov sea.

After Russia’s defense ministry declared the ceasefire — to open a humanitarian corridor out of the war’s fiercest battles — officials said the city’s 450,000-strong population could begin to leave by bus and private cars.

“This is not an easy decision, but… Mariupol is not its streets or houses. Mariupol is its population, it is you and me,” said mayor Vadim Boychenko.

Scenes of devastation

The siege came as more Russian forces inched closer to the capital Kyiv amid fierce fighting, particularly in the western suburbs and the northern town of Chernihiv.

Dozens of civilians have been killed in shelling, missile attacks, and air raids, and those remaining live among the town’s ruins and in craters.

“There were corpses all over the ground,” Sergei told AFP, as air raid sirens wailed once more. “They were lining up here for the pharmacy that’s just there, and they’re all dead.”

AFP reporters saw scenes of devastation — despite Moscow’s insistence it is not targeting civilian areas.

Fears are rising in Kyiv that the capital will suffer the same fate once Russian missile artillery is deployed within range.

Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov alleged Russia had changed tactics after encountering tough resistance.

Ukraine, he said, had defeated plans to quickly storm major cities and overthrow Zelensky’s government, forcing Moscow to resort to “cowardly” attacks on civilians.

Zelensky remains defiant, announcing Saturday that Ukrainian forces were counter-attacking around Kharkiv, the country’s second-largest city, which has seen Russian incursions and fierce bombardments, as well as other parts of the country.

Video published by Ukraine’s Defense Ministry showed a Russian military helicopter being shot down, with British investigative website Bellingcat saying the incident occurred north of Kyiv, in the town of Kozarovychi.

It is not immediately clear when the video was taken.

The low-flying helicopter is seen being hit by a missile, before crashing moments later.

Zelensky said Ukrainian forces were holding key cities in the central and southeastern part of the country Saturday, while the Russians were trying to block and keep encircled Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, Chernihiv, and Sumy.

“We’re inflicting losses on the occupants they could not see in their worst nightmare,” he said.

He alleged that 10,000 Russian troops were killed in the 10 days of the war, a claim that could not be independently verified. The Russian military doesn’t offer regular updates on their casualties. Only once, on Wednesday, did they reveal a death toll, numbering nearly 500.

“This is horrible,” Zelensky said. “Guys 18, 20 years old… soldiers who weren’t even explained what they were going to fight for.”

Since Putin’s army invaded on February 24, Russia has pummeled Ukrainian cities, with officials reporting hundreds of civilians killed. Europe’s largest atomic power plant has even come under attack sparking fears of a catastrophic nuclear accident.

But Moscow has so far only seized two key cities in its 10-day-long invasion — Berdiansk and Kherson on Ukraine’s southern Black Sea coast.

Capturing Mariupol represents a bigger prize for Russian forces, as it would deal a severe blow to Ukraine’s maritime access and connect with troops coming from annexed Crimea and the Donbas.

However, it seems Russia is not in complete control of Kherson, with videos on social media showing thousands of Ukrainians protesting in the city Saturday morning, several days after its capture.

One video posted online showed a protester jumping on top of a Russian military vehicle while waving a Ukrainian flag.

CNN said it would halt broadcasting in Russia, while independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta said it would remove Ukraine content.

The Kremlin on Saturday defended the new law, saying it was “necessary as the country was facing “an unprecedented information war.”

Global hunger

Putin has been unmoved as Russia has become isolated in economic, sporting, and cultural fields.

Spanish clothing giant and Zara fast-fashion chain owner Inditex on Saturday joined the list of major companies suspending operations in Russia.

Flagship airline Aeroflot said it was suspending all its international flights from March 8, citing “circumstances that impede the operation of flights.”

At the Winter Paralympics in Beijing, Ukrainian athletes overcame all the hurdles to hit the top of the medal table with a haul of seven on day one.

In the men’s vision-impaired biathlon race, Vitalii Lukianenko took gold and said: “I want to dedicate this medal to the guys who protect our cities.”

Casualties

Russia said Wednesday that 498 Russian troops had been killed in Ukraine, its first announced death toll.

Ukraine and Western sources claim that the real toll is far higher. Ukraine says around 10,000 Russian soldiers have been killed.

The UN said Wednesday it had recorded nearly 230 civilian deaths in Ukraine, including 15 children, warning the true toll was likely far higher.

""By accusing Ukraine of breaking the agreement, Russia is likely seeking to shift responsibility for current and future civilian casualties in the city,"" the Ministry of Defence said in an intelligence update.

Russia said earlier it had opened humanitarian corridors near the besieged cities of Mariupol and Volnovakha. Russia's defence ministry accused Ukrainian ""nationalists"" of preventing civilians from leaving, RIA news agency reported. But Mariupol's city council said Russia was not observing the ceasefire.

Earlier on Saturday, Vladimir Putin warned the West that he would regard any no-fly zone over Ukraine as an act of war against Russia, hinting at the potential for a nuclear strike.

Talking on Russian TV to employees of Russian airline Aeroflot, Putin said that if countries wanted to impose no-fly zones, they should do so over their own territory and not over Ukraine.

""Any movement in this direction will be considered by us as participation in an armed conflict by that country,"" he said, adding that imposing a no-fly zone would have ""colossal and catastrophic consequences not only for Europe but also the whole world"".

""From 1200 (1000 GMT) the evacuation of the civilian population begins,"" city officials announced in a statement, which said a ceasefire was agreed with Russian-led forces surrounding the city.

An earlier attempt on Saturday to allow civilians to leave by buses and private cars along the road northwest towards Zaporizhzhia failed when both sides accused the other of shelling.

According to aid agency Doctors Without Borders (MSF) the humanitarian situation in Mariupol, a key target for the Russian invasion forces, is ""catastrophic"" with no power or water in civilian homes.

""It is imperative that this humanitarian corridor ... is put in place very quickly,"" MSF's emergency coordinator in Ukraine, Laurent Ligozat, told AFP.

Ukrainian authorities accuse the Russians of shelling even when civilians were gathering to form an escape convoy, but Moscow's defense ministry accuses the city's defenders of exploiting a ""human shield.""

Separately, on Sunday, the head of Kyiv-controlled Luhansk regional administration, said a train would be organized to evacuate women, children and the elderly from Lysychansk.

Lysychansk is near the frontline between Ukrainian forces and Moscow-backed separatists, who are fighting to link up with the Russian forces and control the entire southeast.

""You need to reach Lysychansk station on your own. Women with children are boarding first, then women under 40, women, the elderly,"" Sergiy Gaiday wrote on Telegram.

If Russian forces succeed in capturing Mariupol which held out against rebel forces in the previous 2014 conflict, they will control Ukraine's entire Azov Sea coast.

This would give them a landbridge from Russia to Russian-annexed Crimea and an important supply route and port if they decide to push north in a bid to take all of eastern Ukraine.",https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/03/06/ukraine-city-mariupol-tries-again-to-evacuate-civilians-a76787
