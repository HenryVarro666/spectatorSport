One is above ground, an area containing row after row of broken buildings and charred cars on roads cratered by bombs, solitary figures hurrying along, and frightened faces peering out of windows amid the sound of explosions.

There is another Saltivka, though, comprising hundreds of people who used to live there and are now transplanted underground, huddled together in metro stations, anxious about whether the homes they left behind have survived the daily barrage of missile strikes and artillery rounds.

Saltivka is the most heavily bombed district of one of the most extensively bombed cities in the war so far, Kharkiv.

Ukraine’s second city has yet to experience the withdrawal of Russian forces, as has happened around the capital, Kyiv. Here the onslaught has continued as the Kremlin attempts to block off the Donbas, which lies to the east of the city.

Ukrainian troops have made hard-fought gains in the villages and towns around Kharkiv, but Vladimir Putin’s forces remain within close enough range to carry out salvos of lethal strikes, often indiscriminately, into residential areas, taking a rising toll of lives.

Residents in some parts of Saltivka are among the most economically deprived in Kharkiv, often either unemployed or without regular work. Many of them do not have the identification documents necessary to receive government emergency support, let alone passports to get out of the country to escape the war.

Oleksandr Pavluyk has been going through abandoned homes on a run-down estate to try to find left-behind food for his elderly mother and himself. He shows what he has managed to find after an hour and a half of foraging – two loaves of stale, crumbling bread, two onions, four potatoes, three mouldy apples, and a can of salmon.

“Most people who live here did not have a lot anyway, so I wasn’t expecting much,” he tells The Independent. “We haven’t had electricity for days, so food in the fridges has rotted. But the salmon is good, my mother would like that, it would be a luxury. It would be nice to give her something good at a time like this. I’ve stayed out here because of her – she does not want to leave – but life is hard for her, for us.”

Mr Pavluyk says he tried to persuade his 73-year-old mother, Yulia, that they should go somewhere safer, stressing that it was far too dangerous to stay on, but failed to change her mind.

There are sounds of blasts as the 42-year-old building worker, who had not worked for five months even before the war started, describes their desperate predicament.

“Maybe they are trying to hit a [Ukrainian] army post which was there. That moved a while ago, but they still keep bombing this area. We have also had these buildings hit directly, and these are just people’s homes”, he says, pointing at blasted walls, balconies sheared off and shattered windows.

“This happens a lot, I don’t know why. Most people have gone away. There aren’t many left to kill here.”

Kharkiv is only 25 miles from Russia, and this stretch of Saltivka is one of the points closest to the border. “It is not far for them to bomb,” says Denis Zhuravlov, standing outside another apartment block. “We have not seen any real reduction of the attacks since these peace talks started. They stop for a few hours and then start again.”

Mr Zhuravlov wants to talk about the “new types” of bombs being used by the Russians.

“They burst in the air, and then float down and burst again at low level,” he says, pointing towards pieces of orange cloth hanging from branches. “They have been using all kinds of weapons here. People are frightened to be out; that is why they went from here. Our neighbours went to stay at the train stations, a lot of people have from here.”

The move to seek shelter at the metro stations began on the first day of the invasion, 24 February. Hostilities began in Kharkiv with sustained missile attacks. Oksana Kovaleva’s apartment block was hit within 45 minutes of the first attack. She grabbed her four-year-old daughter Iryna and her son, Yuri, threw on a coat, and rushed out of the building.

Another family was fleeing by car and stopped to take Ms Kovaleva and her children to one of the nearest metro stations, where the vehicle was abandoned and they all rushed underground.

“Soon there were more and more people coming in. Everyone was terrified – the explosions were so loud that we could even hear them underground,” she says. “I was not thinking about our apartment at the time. We were just very grateful that we were alive, my kids were all right. It was relief more than anything else.”

Ms Kovaleva’s husband, Anton, had joined a volunteer battalion of the Ukrainian forces, which had deployed to the front line east of the city. “I knew he’d be very worried about us; I tried calling him many times that night. I got through to his brother the next day, and he passed on the message that we were safe,” she recalls.

After three days, Ms Kovaleva and her neighbour went back to their respective homes to collect essential items and their pets: a dog and two cats. They returned to the Heroiv Pratsi metro station, where they have been living ever since, sleeping in tents on the platform and seldom venturing out.

Over time, a degree of structure has been established in the subterranean community. A medical clinic has been set up, food is provided by welfare groups and religious organisations, and there are online lessons for children. There is even a makeshift nail parlour. The tracks, with trains no longer running, are used to walk from station to station by those seeking places to stay.

Danger, however, is never far away. A supermarket near Heroiv Pratsi was struck by a missile recently, injuring eight people and killing three others who were queueing for food, one of them a woman who had been sheltering in the station.

Anastasia Kharkova, an activist staying at the station, describes the attempts to introduce a semblance of normality to the community, which exists in such proximity to the violence above ground.

“It was decided early on that this war could go on for a very long time, and all efforts must be made to make life work down here. A lot of people volunteered – people came out of retirement to help. The authorities did the best they could, I think,” she says. “There has also been a lot of help from the churches and people of different faiths; we are all very grateful for that.”

A group from a Hare Krishna temple comes with soup, bread and sweets to provide lunch. Yesterday it was the turn of a Baptist church. “We are all working together, doing what we can,” says one of the Hare Krishna followers. “We don’t discuss religion; we are just helping each other out,” he adds, as his companions chant with cymbals and drums.

Lubov Mimilova, a social worker, has been setting up playgroups for families in the stations. There are drawings by children on the walls, games and parties organised. “What is happening is obviously having a deep impact on these boys and girls,” she says. “Letting them express their feelings is important, but it is also very important to let them hold on to their childhood as much as possible under the circumstances.”

There is a queue at platform 2 for Viktoria Gondarova, a beautician offering nail polishing. “Everyone wants to help. This is what I do in my working life, and so I thought, why not offer this service? This will be something which will remind women of their life before the war, cheer them up a bit,” she says. “Everyone needs cheering up at a time like this.”

There are mental as well as physical issues to deal with for Elena Doro, a doctor at one of the city’s hospitals, who has set up a part-time surgery in what used to be the ticket office.

“We have had the usual illness at this station – coughs and colds, a few accidents with people falling, especially when they have been trying to get to the shelter in a rush because of the bombing,” she says. “There have also been two cases of Covid; it became pretty obvious that they had it when they arrived, and they were sent for treatment.

“But there are also psychological issues, of course, as one would expect from people being in this situation. One thing we have noticed is that some people have become afraid of open spaces, not being near others in an enclosed area. This is something which will need to be addressed when things get better.”

There are those on the platforms of Heroiv Pratsi who are convinced that things will start to get better.

“We are turning back the enemy: Kharkiv hasn’t been captured. Vladimir Putin has failed to conquer our country,” Nicolai Shevchenko says. “Staying down here has been distressing for us, but we have survived and we’ll be strong when we get out.

“Ukraine has suffered a lot of losses, a lot of pain, but our country is united. We will be stronger after what has happened, we have no doubt about that.”

The UK's Defense Ministry said this in the latest intelligence update on Twitter, Ukrinform reports.

The ministry said that due to the incident, Russian troops attacking Kharkiv might face a shortage of resources.

""Supplies to Russian forces encircling Kharkiv (60 km from Belgorod) may be particularly affected,"" the intelligence said.

Explosions were reported at an ammunition depot in Belgorod late on March 30. Russia said that ""human factor"" was behind the cause of the incident.

Commenting on the explosions at warehouses in Russia, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said the Russians continue to store and use obsolete ammunition.

Early on April 1, the head of the Belgorod region of Russia, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said that a large fire broke out at a fuel depot in Belgorod.

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

More than a month after the UK's Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme was launched, thousands of sponsors are still waiting to welcome Ukrainian nationals, amid reports of red tape and bureaucracy in the process.

Lynette Protheroe, from Derbyshire, was matched with sisters Yana and Inna and their three children on 20 March but weeks after submitting an application, she says she still has no way to track its progress.

""The system is shambolic and it is failing these people,"" Ms Protheroe told Sky News.

""You can order some balloons from China and you can track it and you know where it's coming from, you know where it is.

""You can generally tell when it will be delivered. You cannot track these visa applications. There's no way the family can track them. You just have to wait.""

6,560d79d1-8789-468f-9f8c-b2f972e1acde,"['Abc News', 'The Associated Press', 'April']",,"A fiery explosion at a Russian fuel depot brought accusations from Moscow that Ukraine had attacked the facility, but the secretary of Ukraine’s national security council denied any involvement

A fiery explosion rocked a Russian fuel depot near the border around dawn Friday, and Moscow said Ukraine had attacked the facility, but Kyiv denied any involvement. There was no independent confirmation of details about the incident.

Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said two Ukrainian Mi-24 helicopters had entered Russian airspace “at an extremely low altitude” and attacked the civilian oil storage facility on the outskirts of the city of Belgorod.

He said the facility was supplying petroleum ""to civilian transport only. The oil base has nothing to do with Russian armed forces.”

Regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said two workers at the depot were injured, he said. But Russian media cited a statement from state oil company Rosneft that denied anyone was hurt.

More than 300 firefighters battled the blaze, using a helicopter and a special firefighting train, the Belgorod mayor's office said. Gladkov said he met with residents who were moved from their homes to a nearby sports facility. He also posted photos of craters and metal fragments in a rural area where he said explosions had damaged a power line and broken a window.

It would not be the first attack reported inside Russia since the war began Feb. 24, although there has been nothing as dramatic.

Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s national security council, denied Ukraine was responsible.

“For some reason, they say that we did it, but in fact this does not correspond with reality,” he said on Ukrainian television.

Earlier, presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovich said: “We are carrying out defensive operations on our territory. Russian authorities bear responsibility for everything that happens at Russian territory.”

Russian authorities “must figure out what’s going on in Belgorod,"" he said. ""Maybe someone smoked in the wrong place. Maybe there was something else. Maybe Russian troops are sabotaging orders and don’t want to enter Ukrainian territory by available means.”

Any airborne attack inside Russia would likely require skillful flying to avoid its air defenses.

The explosion drew a muted response from the Kremlin, with spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying it was not helpful for talks with Ukraine.

On Russian social media, some users expressed surprise that Ukraine was still capable of mounting such an attack or getting past Russian air defenses. Russia’s daily video briefings from the Defense Ministry often stress the number of Ukrainian planes and helicopters shot down or destroyed.

Belgorod is about 25 kilometers (16 miles) from the border and is roughly opposite Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city that which has been under Russian bombardment since the early stages of the war.

Earlier incidents in the Belgorod region had caused alarm locally but had little wider resonance in the context of the war, which Russia portrays as a “special military operation” with little effect on the lives of ordinary citizens.

On the first day of the war, three people were reported injured from shelling in Belgorod, although there was no independent confirmation. A statement from Russia's state Investigative Committee said two adults and one child were injured, and an attempted murder probe was launched.

Another criminal investigation by the committee was opened March 1 after a report that two Ukrainian missiles from an Uragan launcher had landed in a rural area. That report also was not independently confirmed.

Gladkov said last week that a shell fired from Ukraine had exploded in a village in the Belgorod region in an incident in which the Russian Orthodox Church said had killed a military chaplain. A similar incident was reported to have damaged houses. There was no independent confirmation of those reports.

Other explosions March 29 were due to what Gladkov said he had heard was a fire at a munitions store in the border village of Krasny Oktyabr, citing “unverified information.” Ukraine was not blamed for the incident and Gladkov said he was awaiting official comment from the Defense Ministry, although none followed and the cause of the fire remained unclear.

""The fire at the oil depot occurred as a result of an airstrike coming from two helicopters of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which entered the territory of the Russian Federation flying at a low altitude,"" Belgorod regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov wrote on Telegram. ""There are no victims,"" though two workers were injured.

Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for the explosions; Bohdan Senyk, the head of the public affairs department of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, told CNN there was ""no information"" about the incident. ""It would be the first time that Ukrainian aircraft have flown into Russian airspace to hit a target, bringing the war home to Russia,"" and giving ""a huge boost to the morale of Ukraine's military,"" BBC defense correspondent Jonathan Beale writes from Odessa.

""Ukrainian helicopter pilots have plenty of experience of flying low and fast to avoid being detected by military radar and air defense systems. They've been doing exactly that in the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine for years,"" Beale adds. ""But if these unconfirmed reports are correct — flying at night, well into Russian territory, to launch an attack on an enemy fuel depot would have required extraordinary bravery — as well as finely honed flying skills.""

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the strikes on the fuel depot can't ""be perceived as creating conditions comfortable for the continuation of negotiations,"" and everything is being done to reorganize the fuel supply chain. Russia has hit several Ukrainian fuel depots throughout the country, claiming the purpose is to cut off supply to Ukraine's military.

""The Belgorod area was used as a staging ground for Russian forces shortly before the invasion, and Kharkiv has since been relentlessly shelled and hit with missiles,"" CNN reports. There were several explosions reported at an ammunition depot near Belgorod late Tuesday night, and Gladkov said Wednesday that a preliminary investigation pointed to a fire sparking those blasts.",https://theweek.com/russo-ukrainian-war/1012050/russia-accuses-ukraine-of-daring-airstrikes-on-fuel-depot-in-belgorod
