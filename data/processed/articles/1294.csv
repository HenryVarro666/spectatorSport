The last known time that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with Russian Minister of Defense Sergey Shoygu was on February 18, and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley last spoke to the Chief of Russian General Staff Gen. Valery Gerasimov on February 11, CNN previously reported.

""Over the past month, Secretary Austin and Chairman Milley have sought, and continue to seek, calls with their Russian counterparts. Minister Shoigu and General Gerasimov have so far declined to engage. We continue to believe that engagement between US and Russian defense leaders is critically important at this time,"" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said in a statement.

The US military has maintained a deconfliction phone line with Russia's military, which the Pentagon says has been tested daily but has not been used for any substantive reasons. The reason for the deconfliction line is to try to avoid any miscalculations that could escalate Russia's war with Ukraine that's on the doorstep of NATO territory.

The Washington Post first reported on Austin and Milley's attempts to contact their Russian counterparts.

Multiple attempts by Washington's top military leaders to speak with their Russian counterparts have been rejected by Moscow, raising fears that a battlefield miscalculation could plunge Ukraine and the world further into crisis.

Ever since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have tried to reach Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Gen. Valery Gerasimov by phone.

But the Russians are not picking up, according to Pentagon spokesman John Kirby.

It leaves the world's two biggest nuclear powers in the dark about what the other is doing at a critical moment.

'We think that communication with the Russians is important particularly now - in fact now more than ever,' Kirby told Fox News, 'to communicate with our Russian counterparts and make sure that we can convey our continued concerns about the manner in which they are prosecuting this unprovoked war.

'We have tried on numerous occasions to connect Secretary Austin with his counterpart. Chairman Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has also tried to connect with his counterpart.

'We've made multiple attempts here but they have not answered up.

'They have declined to take the calls.'

The attempted calls - first reported by the Washington Post - come as Russia conducts operations near Ukraine's borders with Poland and Romania, while N.A.T.O. planes police airspace over the Baltic Sea and ferry in weapons.

The Pentagon on Thursday said its attempts to set up calls between Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin (l) and Chairman of the Join Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley (r) and their Russian counterparts had gone unanswered

Attempts to set up phone calls with Russian Chief of the General Staff and First Deputy Defence Minister Valery Gerasimov (l) and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu have been ignored

Ukrainian forces are counter-attacking to the west of Kyiv where Russian troops at Irpin and Bucha are in danger of getting surrounded, possibly forcing a mass-surrender, while attacks are also going on to the east of the city

Kirby said Moscow and Washington continue to maintain a deconfliction channel, and can communicate via each other's embassies.

But without contacts between high-ranking officials the potential for miscommunication or misunderstandings is high.

'We still have military to military communications with the Russians but at the senior level, where we think it's important right now, it is not happening because the Russians don't seem to be interested,' said Kirby.

Details emerged on day 29 of the conflict, as President Joe Biden met with N.A.T.O. leaders in Brussels and unveiled a fresh raft of sanctions designed to further isolate Vladimir Putin and his supporters.

Russia has become increasingly reliant on artillery and missile strikes while its ground advance has been stalled by fierce Ukrainian resistance.

Kirby said Ukraine's troops had not just stopped Russian troops from advancing, but in the past 24 hours had begun forcing them back.

Ukrainians are becoming more effective on the battlefield.

The Ukrainian navy has destroyed an Alligator-class Russian landing ship and damaged two others which were unloading reinforcements and supplies at the captured port of Berdyansk, in the south of Ukraine

They are starting in places ... moving just from defensive postures to offensive postures.

They have pushed the Russians ... kept them out of Kyiv.

We now have indications they have pushed Russian forces further to the east so the Russian forces that had advanced between 20 to 30 kilometres [12 to 19 miles] to the east of Kyiv, Ukrainians in the last 24 hours or so pushed them back to about 40 to 50 kilometres [25 to 21 miles] away.

'In the north of Kyiv we're seeing the Russians take a defensive posture.

'They are no longer trying to advance they are going back to defense.

Makariv and Moschun, two cities to the west of the capital, have 'probably' been re-taken by Kyiv's troops - the British Ministry of Defence said overnight - meaning there is now a 'realistic possibility that Ukrainian forces are able to encircle Russian units at Bucha and Irpin'.

'Russia is likely now looking to mobilise its reservist and conscript manpower, as well as private military companies and foreign mercenaries, to replace these considerable losses,' it said.

NATO now estimates that Putin has lost up to 40,000 men during his invasion - killed, wounded and captured - representing more than a quarter of the total force he arrayed before giving the order to attack.

Observers and experts have been warning that losses that severe risk making parts of his army combat ineffective, meaning they will struggle to operate on the battlefield and will be vulnerable to Ukrainian counter-attack.

Russian offensives have been stalled on almost all fronts for days now, with the Pentagon saying earlier this week that Ukraine's generals - who have been skilled in defence - are now switching to offence, and are 'able and willing to take back territory' captured by Russia.

Ukraine's armed forces reported 250 aircraft flights in the last 24 hours, a marked increase from the day before.

At an emergency NATO summit in Brussels, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky pleaded with the Western allies via video for planes, tanks, rockets, air defense systems and other weapons, saying his country is ""defending our common values.""

Speaking to Fox News’s “America’s Newsroom” on Thursday, Kirby said that the U.S. has tried on “multiple occasions” to connect Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley with their counterparts.

“We made multiple — multiple — attempts here, but they have not answered up. They have declined to take these calls,” he continued.

Kirby’s comments come after The Washington Post first reported that Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Gen. Valery Gerasimov have declined to engage with Austin and Milley.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken has also not communicated with his Russian counterpart, the Post reported.

Moscow’s war against Ukraine is entering its second month, and the Biden administration has imposed crippling sanctions on Russia’s economy while continuing to provide Ukraine with humanitarian and security assistance.

Despite these difficulties, Kirby said that Washington still has ways of communicating with Moscow. He noted that the U.S. could communicate through the U.S. Embassy in Russia and through the U.S. defense attaché to Russia.

The Pentagon also established a de-confliction line with the Russian Ministry of Defense on March 1 in an effort to prevent miscalculations or escalations in the invasion.

“So there are vehicles, we still have military-to-military communications with the Russians,” Kirby said. “But at the senior levels, where we think it’s really important particularly right now, that’s not happening.

Western officials say 7 Russian generals killed in Ukraine

Western officials said they are aware of seven Russian generals who have been killed in Ukraine since the war began last month and are aware of another general who was dismissed.

Lt. Gen. Yakov Rezanstev, commander of Russia's 49th Combined Arms Army in the southern military district, was killed most recently.

Army Commander General Vlaislav Yershov was allegedly fired this week by the Kremlin. He was reportedly sacked because of the heavy casualties and strategic failures the Russian army is suffering.

General Magomed Tushaev of the Chechen Special Forces was also reportedly killed in Ukraine.

Ukraine says Russian missiles hit its air force headquarters

Ukraine's air force said the headquarters in Vinnytsia in the western part of the country was hit by numerous Russian cruise missiles Friday afternoon.

Six missiles were blocked by the country's air defense systems, it added.

The attack caused ""considerable damage"" to the infrastructure, Ukraine's air force wrote on Twitter, adding that an investigation was ongoing.

Zelenskyy asks for peace talks again

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reiterated his call for peace talks with Russia to end the war. But he stressed that Ukraine would not give up territory.

In his nightly video address to the Ukrainan people, Zelenskyy may have been responding to Russian Colonel General Sergei Rudskoi, the deputy chief of the Russian general staff. Rudskoi said Russian forces would focus on ""the main goal, the liberation of Donbas.""

Russia has said its invasion of Ukraine has entered a new phase, one signal it may be scaling back its ambitions due to a series of setbacks and defeats at the hands of the Ukrainian army and Ukrainians fighting against the Russian invasion.

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and Interior Minister Nancy Faeser welcomed the first Ukrainian refugees airlifted from Moldova to Germany. More than 130 Ukrainians arrived after first receiving protection in Moldova.

Baerbock noted that the stories of suffering caused by Russia's decision to invade Ukraine extend beyond Ukraine's borders.

""We are in a situation where as of today, already 4 million people have fled from Ukraine and we need to assume that this is going to go up to 8 to 10 million. And none of the border countries can shoulder this alone,"" Baerbock said.

Putin signs 'fake' news law, introducing 15-year jail terms

Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a bill Friday introducing jail terms of up to 15 years for publishing ""fake"" news about Russia's ""special military operation,"" which is what the government calls its invasion and subsequent war on Ukraine.

The bill was adopted by Russia's parliament earlier this week. It lays out prison sentences and fines for those who ""knowingly publish false information"" about Russian government activities abroad.

Should the publication result in ""serious consequences,"" that could be punishable with up to 15 years in jail. For publishing ""false information"" about the Russian army, one can also receive a 15-year jail sentence.

Pentagon says Ukraine fighting to retake Kherson

The Pentagon said the Ukrainian military has launched a counteroffensive to retake the city of Kherson, located at the mouth of the Dnieper River.

""We would argue Kherson is actually contested territory again,"" a senior US defense official briefed reporters.

The official added, ""We can't corroborate exactly who is in control of Kherson but the point is, it doesn't appear to be as solidly in Russian control as it was before.""

If Ukraine's forces can manage to retake the strategic city, it could cut off Russian troops around Mykolaiv, which ""would make it very, very difficult for them to make any kind of ground movement on Odessa,"" the Pentagon official noted.

The Pentagon also said it had observed Russia trying to recruit fighters from the Russian-backed separatist enclaves of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in northern Georgia.

France plans Mariupol evacuation

French President Emmanuel Macron is planning to discuss the siege of Mariupol with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the next two to three days.

He wants to set an initiative to evacuate people who wish to leave.

Macron is coordinating with Greece and Turkey for the planned evacuation effort, and will then take the proposal to Putin.

He told reporters that he had spoken with the mayor of Mariupol, much of which has been reduced to ruins.

Civilians have been running out of food, power and heat as they shelter from ongoing, and seemingly indiscriminate Russian shelling.

Scholz says ending Russian energy dependence will be faster process than expected

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz expects energy dependence on Russia to come to an end sooner than many people are anticipating.

Biden travels close to Ukraine border

US President Joe Biden has traveled to the Polish city of Rzeszow, about 65 kilometers (40 miles) from the Ukrainian border.

He addressed US troops who are stationed there as part of a NATO mission to protect its eastern flank. NATO yesterday agreed to bolster its defenses in the wake of the invasion.

Biden honored the bravery of the Ukrainian people.

""The Ukrainian people have a lot of backbone. They have a lot of guts. And I'm sure you are observing it. And I don't just mean the military ... but also the average citizen,"" he told US soldiers. ""Look at how they are stepping up ... Women, young people, standing in front of a damn tank saying 'I'm not leaving.'""

Biden was due to meet with Polish President Andrzej Duda and visit Poland’s humanitarian operation for the millions of refugees it has taken in. However, Duda’s airplane was forced to make an emergency landing, delaying plans.

Biden stressed that he had wanted to visit Poland to underscore that its efforts to take in refugees are of ""enormous consequence.""

He will travel to Warsaw later today. Biden spent all of Thursday in an extraordinary series of summits in Brussels addressing the invasion.

UN: Several Ukrainian officials, reporters, activists held by Russian troops

Dozens of Ukrainian officials, journalists and activists have been detained or kidnapped by Russian forces, the United Nations has warned.

The UN human rights office (OHCHR) in Kyiv said it had documented the arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance of 22 Ukrainian officials. It said 13 were later released.

The UN body's representative in Ukraine Matilda Bogner said some of the cases resembled ""hostage-taking.""

She said 15 journalists and civil society activists are among those taken, along with the mayor of Ukraine's southern city of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov.

Fedorov was held for several days by occupying Russian forces before being freed.

Seven journalists have been killed since the invasion began on February 24, the OHCHR said.

Ukraine: Cease-fire talks with Russia still 'difficult'

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba says peace talks with Russia remain difficult, denying reports that four out of six key issues were close to being resolved.

""There is no consensus with Russia on the four points,"" he said in a post on Facebook, adding that the Ukrainian delegation has ""taken a strong position and does not relinquish its demands. We insist, first of all, on a cease-fire, security guarantees and territorial integrity of Ukraine.""

Russian negotiator Vladimir Medinsky earlier said that the two countries were coming closer to an understanding on secondary questions, but that there has been limited progress on the key matters.

""Negotiations have been going on all week, from Monday to Friday, in video conference format, and will continue tomorrow,"" Russian news agency Interfax quoted Medinsky as saying. ""On secondary issues, positions are converging. However on the main political issues, we are in fact treading water.""

He said that he believed Ukraine was deliberately stalling the talks.

Russia says it is seeking a comprehensive deal on a range of issues, and if that is not achieved then an agreement is unlikely.

Earlier Friday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said progress had been made in negotiations and called on his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to make an “honorable exit” from Ukraine.

Ankara sees itself as a mediator in the conflict and Erdogan has mooted the idea of talks between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Prague renames Russian embassy address to 'Ukrainian heroes' street'

The Czech capital of Prague has said it will rename the street where the Russian embassy sits to ""Ukrainian heroes' street."" A nearby bridge will also be named after Ukrainian soldier Vitaly Skakun, who is said to have delayed the Russian advance by blowing up a bridge in southern Ukraine, losing his own life in the process.

This is not the first time the city has used names to criticize Russian policy. Two years ago, Prague also renamed a square on the other side of the embassy grounds after murdered Russian opposition politician Boris Nemtsov.

At the same time, the Czech government said that so far it had handed out 226,000 resident permits to Ukrainian refugees, though it estimates that a total of 300,000 are in the country. However, some observers working for Czech aid organizations said that the country needed clear procedures for housing refugees and better distribution throughout the country or it would not be able to handle the influx.

Eyewitness accounts from inside Mariupol

The besieged city of Mariupol in southeastern Ukraine had over 400,000 inhabitants before the war. Many are still there and making do with little food and water. Those who can are leaving, but even this is dangerous.

DW spoke to three eyewitnesses to the destruction of Mariupol.

Russia claims main objectives of first stage completed

The Russian Defense Ministry claims it has achieved the primary objectives of the first phase of its invasion of Ukraine.

It says its forces in Ukraine will now focus on the ""liberation"" of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, both breakaway provinces in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas.

The ministry claims it has ""liberated"" 93% of the territory in Luhansk and 54% of the Donetsk region.

In comments carried by Russian news agency Interfax, the ministry claimed it had been considering two options for its ""special operation"" in Ukraine. The first option focused solely on the “liberation” of those provinces, and the other focused on whole territory of Ukraine.

""In general, the main tasks of the first stage of the operation have been accomplished. The combat potential of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has been significantly reduced, which allows us, once again, to concentrate our main efforts on achieving the main goal — the liberation of Donbass,"" Sergey Rudskoy, head of the Main Operational Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces was quoted as saying.

The ministry says that its military operation will continue until Russian forces have completed the (unspecified) tasks that had been set.

The ministry claimed just 1,351 Russian soldiers had died in the invasion and 3,825 had been injured. That compares to a NATO estimate of up to 40,000 total Russian casualties, including up to 15,000 dead.

Russia also claimed that 14,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed, and 16,000 injured.

It claimed that the Ukrainian air force, its air defense forces and navy has been completely destroyed.

Putin says Russian greats falling victim to West's 'cancel culture'

Russian President Vladimir Putin has said the West is trying to erase Russian culture, including the works of great composers such as Pyotr Tchaikovsky, Dmitry Shostakovich and Sergei Rachmaninov.

Speaking at a meeting of winners of presidential literature and art awards for works for children and young people, Putin accused the West of ""discrimination of everything connected with Russia with the full connivance and sometimes encouragement of the ruling elites.""

He said that ""Tchaikovsky, Shostakovich and Rachmaninov are being erased from concert posters, and Russian writers and their books are being banned,"" adding that such art censorship had last been carried out by the Nazis in Germany.

Russian domestic culture prevented such acts from being carried out in Russia, he said.

Putin did not cite any concrete instances to back his claims that Russian culture was being ""canceled"" abroad.

India, China urge 'immediate cease-fire' in Ukraine

The foreign ministers of India and China have called for a return to diplomacy in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

The two ministers met in the Indian capital on Friday for what was the first high level meeting in nearly two years after relations deteriorated following deadly border clashes in June 2020.

India and China are both allied with Moscow and have rejected Western calls for condemnation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Erdogan: Putin needs to be an 'architect of peace'

Turkey's president has called on his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to ""make an honorable exit"" from Ukraine.

""We need to tell Putin 'now, you should be the architect of a step for peace,'"" Recep Tayyip Erdogan said to reporters on his return flight from the NATO summit in Brussels.

Erdogan recently invited Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for talks on Turkish soil.

He said while a compromise is possible, the two sides are at odds over territorial issues.

Erdogan also said he was hesitant to cut Turkey's dependence on Russian energy unlike other countries, saying he couldn't ""leave my citizens out in the cold.""

Last major Russia-EU transport link to close

The Finnish rail company VR says it will shut down its 400-kilometer (249-mile) St. Petersburg-Helsinki route at the weekend.

The so-called Allegro line has been one of the last main ways of getting from Russia to the EU since both closed their airspace to each other amid Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.

VR said its trains had continued to run over the last few weeks at the request of authorities to allow any Finns in Russia who wished to do so to get home.

Trains from Russia to Helsinki have been full of Russians since the invasion of Ukraine began on February 24, leading to airspace closures both by the EU and Moscow.

Kremlin says military to advise Putin on combating NATO buildup

The Russian military will present proposals to President Vladimir Putin on how best to counter NATO's announced strengthening of its eastern flank, according to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as cited by Reuters.

In his weekly conference call with reporters, Peskov also said the expulsion of Russia from the Group of Twenty (G20) major economies that has been proposed by the US and allies would not have serious repercussions for the country.

""The G20 format is important, but in the current circumstances, when most of the participants are in a state of economic war with us, nothing terrible will happen,"" Peskov said, adding that US efforts to isolate Moscow had been only partially effective and would anyway fail.

He said some countries were taking a ""more sober"" approach to Moscow, allowing it to build new policy directions.

After Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Moscow of using phosphorus bombs during the conflict, Peskov insisted that Russia had ""never"" violated international law.

He also declined to say whether Russia would rebuild Ukrainian towns and cities such as Mariupol, which has been devastated by Russian bombardment.

Ukrainian officials have said around 300 people might have died after last week's Russian strike on a theater in the port city of Mariupol being used as a shelter by many hundreds of people.

""From eyewitnesses, information is emerging that about 300 people died in the Drama Theatre of Mariupol following strikes by a Russian aircraft,"" Mariupol city hall wrote on Telegram.

It described the attack as ""cynical"" and claimed that Russia knew civilians were taking refuge in the building.

New attempt to evacuate Mariupol: Ukrainian deputy PM

Ukraine hopes that some civilians currently trapped in the southern port city of Mariupol will be able to leave in private cars on Friday, according to Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk.

Several attempts to create humanitarian corridors out of the city, which has been under constant attack from surrounding Russian forces, have failed. Civilians in the city are reportedly suffering for food, power and water shortages.

Vereshchuk said buses would be waiting in the nearby city of Berdiansk to take those who succeeded in leaving Mariupol to the city of Zaporizhzhia.

""We will do everything in our power so that buses filled with Mariupol residents reach Zaporizhzhia today,"" she said.

Germany plans to halve Russian oil imports by summer

German Economy Minister Robert Habeck says Germany will be able to greatly reduce its dependence of Russian coal, gas and oil in the coming weeks.

He said Russian oil would drop to 25% from 35% of oil imports and those of Russian coal would fall by a current 50% of Germany's total to 25%.

He also said that Germany expects to become independent of Russian gas by mid-2024.

To this end, he said the government had secured the use of three ""floating'' terminals capable of regasifying liquefied natural gas (LNG) brought in by ship and is involved in building permanent LNG terminals for long-term imports.

US to supply additional LNG to Europe

The United States and the European Union have announced a plan to reduce the bloc's reliance on Russian fossil fuels.

Under the deal, the US will increase its liquified natural gas (LNG) exports to Europe by 15 billion cubic meters this year, the White House said.

Global food prices could keep rising: Ukraine's agriculture minister

Ukraine's new agriculture minister has said global food prices would continue to rise if the situation in Ukraine following Russia's invasion did not change.

Mykola Solskyi, who was appointed on Thursday after the sudden resignation of his predecessor, said Ukraine's grain stocks for export amount to $7.5 billion (€6.8 billion). He did not say what the volume of grains for export was.

Ukraine is one of the world's biggest grain exporters.

The former agriculture minister, Roman Leshchenko, stepped down on Thursday, citing health reasons. Two days previously, he said he expected Ukraine's spring crop area might be halved this year to only 7 million hectares (17.3 million acres).

Russian forces pushed back up to 35 km east from Kyiv: UK intelligence

According to British intelligence, Ukrainian forces have succeeded in recapturing towns and defensive positions from invading Russian forces up to 35 kilometers (22 miles) east of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv.

A report from the British Defense Ministry on Friday said Ukrainian troops were also likely to continue pushing back Russian forces on the northwestern axis from Kyiv toward the Hostomel Airfield, some 26 kilometers from the capital. It was captured by Russian forces on February 25 at the start of Moscow's invasion.

Russian forces in the south of Ukraine were still seeking to circumvent the city of Mykolaiv as they try to move in on Odesa, with fierce Ukrainian resistance and supply issues impeding their progress, according to the report.

Almost half of people in Germany want Ukraine in the EU: Survey

The number of people in Germany who are in favor of Ukraine joining the EU has risen by 16% since 2018, a YouGov survey has shown.

Forty-six percent of those asked would now like to see Ukraine in the bloc.

The survey also showed a clear reduction in the number of people opposed to the country's EU membership, with just 30% against compared with 47% in 2018.

Other countries are showing similar trends, with 42% of people in France in favor of Ukraine's EU accession (2018: 22%), 60% in Spain and 45% in Italy. The percentage of those who are undecided remains fairly high in all the countries included in the survey at 24-29%.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urged that his country be quickly accepted into the bloc amid Russia's invasion and has signed a formal application. But several EU countries, including Germany, have spoken out against fast-tracking Ukraine's bid for membership.

Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia's security council and former president, said that it is ""foolish"" to believe that Western sanctions could have an effect on the Kremlin.

Sanctions on Russian businesses will not cause popular discontent with the authorities, he told the RIA news agency, adding that they will instead lead citizens to support the government.

""It seems to me that those who make these decisions [to impose sanctions] don't understand our mentality; they don't understand the Russian worldview,"" Medvedev said.

""This isn't pressure on big business and entrepreneurs, but pressure on absolutely everyone [in Russia],"" he underlined, adding that this will lead to the ""consolidation of Russian society.""

The Kremlin has described Western sanctions as an ""economic war"" against Russia.

Medvedev served as Russia's president from 2008 to 2012 and as prime minister from 2012 to 2020.

""We are getting closer to victory.""

Russia will emerge weaker from Ukraine conflict — Pentagon official

US Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl said that Russia will be weakened as a result of its invasion of Ukraine.

""I think with a high degree of certainty that Russia will emerge from Ukraine weaker than it went into the conflict,"" Kahl said.

""Militarily weaker, economically weaker, politically and geopolitically weaker, and more isolated,"" he added.

Kahl said that Russia is likely to increase its use of unguided bombs and artillery in Ukraine as it runs out of precision-guided munitions.

Biden to visit town in Poland near Ukraine border

The White House said that US President Joe Biden will visit a city in Poland near the Ukrainian border on Friday.

The city in question is Rzeszow in Poland's southeast, which lies some 80 kilometers (50 miles) west of the country's border with Ukraine. Until now the White House had not disclosed specifics of the president's Poland trip.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken also visited Rzeszow on March 5 as he traveled to Poland to show support for NATO's eastern flank countries.

EU leaders call for Ukraine recovery fund

EU leaders have called for a solidarity fund to be set up for Ukraine's economic recovery, according to a joint statement.

The statement from the 27 EU member states was published late on Thursday following two days of talks.

The fund is to support Ukraine to recover from the ""destruction and enormous losses"" inflicted on the country by Russia during the war.

The statement also called for an international donor conference to support Ukraine after ""the Russian onslaught has ceased.""

Furthermore, EU leaders pledged to support the Ukrainian government ""for its immediate needs.""

Summary of events in Ukraine-Russia crisis on Thursday

During a press conference in Brussels on Thursday, US President Joe Biden asserted that NATO is more united than ever amid Russia's ongoing invasion. He announced over $2 billion (€1.8 billion) military aid for Ukraine and $1 billion in assistance for Ukrainians impacted by the war.

Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on Facebook that a total of 3,343 people were evacuated from Ukrainian cities via humanitarian corridors on Thursday.

The Canadian government said it would increase oil exports by roughly 5% as countries forgo Russian energy due to the attack on Ukraine.

Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya called on Belarusian troops to not get involved in Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Ukrainian lawmakers voted overwhelmingly in support of a measure to punish citizens who help Russian forces. Ukrainian collaborators could face up to 12 years in prison under the new law.

Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said that the battlefront is ""practically frozen."" He said Russian forces are ""practically at a standstill"" and claimed Russian troops lack the resources to advance their offensive.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reportedly told reporters in Brussels that Russia and Ukraine are in agreement on technical issues during peace talks, but said the two countries are divided on territorial issues such as the Crimean Peninsula.

Russia's top military officials have repeatedly been declining calls from their US counterparts since the country launched its invasion of Ukraine a month ago, The Washington Post reported.

Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby told the Post in a statement on Wednesday that US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have tried multiple times to reach out to their respective Russian counterparts Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Gen. Valery Gerasimov.

However, the Russian leaders ""have so far declined to engage"" in the phone calls, said Kirby, per the Post.

Earlier this month, Russia and the US set up a direct communication channel to avoid any accidental conflict or misunderstanding between Russian forces and US military assets near Ukraine.

Despite this arrangement, the refusal of Russia's military leaders to respond to their US counterparts' calls suggests that Washington and Moscow's relationship could be deteriorating.

On Monday, the Kremlin said President Joe Biden had put relations between the two countries ""on the verge of rupture"" when he called Russian President Vladimir Putin a ""war criminal.""

""There is a high risk of escalation without the firebreak of direct contact between the most senior officials,"" James Stavridis, NATO's former supreme allied commander, told The Post.

""Very young people are flying in jets, operating warships, and conducting combat operations in the Ukrainian war. They are not seasoned diplomats, and their actions in the heat of operations can be misunderstood,"" he said.

""We must avoid a scenario of NATO and Russia sleepwalking into war because senior leaders can't pick up a phone and explain to each other what is happening,"" Stavridis added.

The war in Ukraine reached its one-month mark on Thursday, with Ukrainian forces continuing to repel Russia's attempts to advance into its major cities — contrary to Putin's reported belief that the entire campaign would be swift.

Amid this delay, the Kremlin has intensified its bombardment of major population centers. On March 13, Russian missiles struck a military base in Lviv located just 15 miles from where US troops have been stationed in Poland.

Since the start of the war, around 40,000 Russian troops are estimated to have been injured, captured, or killed, according to a NATO official who spoke anonymously to the media on Wednesday.",https://www.businessinsider.com/russia-military-leaders-reject-us-phone-calls-since-war-started-2022-3

For just a few seconds on Thursday, Sergei Shoigu was back on Russians’ television screens, sitting in the corner box of a teleconference with Vladimir Putin.

The Russian defence minister, arguably the man most responsible for the floundering war effort in Ukraine, had not been seen in public for 12 days. Nor had the chief of the general staff of Russia’s armed forces, Valery Gerasimov.

Rumours were beginning to circulate that they may have been punished over the bungled invasion, which has failed to capture key Ukrainian cities such as Kharkiv or Kyiv and plunged Russia into economic isolation.

Russians had already watched Putin browbeat and humiliate the head of the country’s foreign intelligence service, Sergei Naryshkin, during a televised meeting over the fate of the Russian-controlled territories in eastern Ukraine.

Journalists have since filed reports on an investigation in the FSB directorate responsible for foreign intelligence, including on Ukraine, and on the arrest of a senior official from Russia’s national guard.

It is unclear if any of those events are related to Russia’s war in Ukraine, an effort that is going according to plan, a Russian foreign ministry official said on Thursday. For many Russians, however, it is apparent that the war is not going to plan, and the expectation among Kremlin watchers is that men such as Shoigu could shoulder the blame.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/mar/24/russia-ukraine-war-latest-news-zelenskiy-expects-meaningful-steps-at-nato-eu-and-g7-summits-live

As Russia ramps up its air campaign on Ukraine, U.S. and Ukrainian leaders met in Warsaw to find ways to fight back Russian aggression.

Ukraine’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba tweeted a photo on March 26 of U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III meeting with himself and other Ukrainian leaders. “This special 2+2 format allows us to seek practical decisions in both political and defense spheres in order to fortify Ukraine’s ability to fight back Russian aggression,” he said.

The meeting comes after President Joe Biden called a NATO leaders summit, followed by meetings with European and G-7 counterparts, to unite allies and partners in the ongoing sanctions against Russian leaders.

The Pentagon said March 25 that Russia had dug into defensive positions around Kyiv, instead focusing its land and air effort on “liberating” the Donbas region. But Ukraine may have taken back Kherson from Russia and the Ukrainian Navy blew up a re-supply ship at the port of Berdyansk on the Sea of Azov.

Ukraine’s recent moves could drive a wedge in Russia’s effort to lockdown the eastern region of the country, home to a large minority of Russian speakers. Russia has surrounded the port city of Mariupol for days, a missing link that would connect occupied Donbas with Crimea. For weeks, Defense Department officials have pointed to a perceived effort by Russia to lock down the south and pin down Ukrainian forces in the Joint Forces Operation area, where they have operated since Russia invaded in 2014.

“The Donbas is really where they’re … focused right now, on the ground and in the air,” a senior defense official told reporters March 25.

“They have tried to make up for the fact that they haven’t been able to move well on the ground by the increasing use of airstrikes, and missile strikes, and artillery strikes on population centers,” the official added. “They don’t appear to want to pursue Kyiv as aggressively, or frankly, at all.”

Moscow has fired more than 1,250 missiles into Ukraine, and despite reporting about high fail rates for its air-launched cruise missiles and a depleting missile inventory, DOD assesses that Russia still has over half its fire power.

Russia claimed March 25 that its first wartime objective has been achieved.

“The combat potential of the armed forces of Ukraine has been considerably reduced, which makes it possible to focus our core efforts on achieving the main goal—the liberation of Donbass,” Sergei Rudskoi, head of the Russian General Staff’s Main Operational Directorate, said in a statement.

The Defense Department rated Russia’s combat power as 85 to 90 percent of its pre-positioned strength. Recent DOD assessments of Ukraine’s combat power were estimated at 90 percent, based on constant replenishment from Western partners.

The defense official said parts of the $800 million defense package signed by President Joe Biden March 16 have started arriving in Ukraine, with additional shipments of anti-tank Javelins and anti-aircraft Stingers arriving in Europe in the coming days.

“Another flight arrived in the region today,” the defense official said in response to a question from Air Force Magazine.

Long-range air defense systems promised by Biden in a public address following Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s speech to Congress have yet to arrive. Likewise, after the U.S. rejected an offer by Poland March 8 to help transfer MiG-29s, the official clarified that “the United States is not putting a veto on people giving the Ukrainians aircraft.”

Even without the SAMS and aircraft it says it needs, Ukraine is still holding off the Russian advance.

Ukraine appears to be making headway in the south of the country, where Russian forces moving north from Crimea made their strongest advance and took the city of Kherson early in the month-long war.

“Kherson is actually contested territory again,” the official said.

Losing Kherson would split Russian forces and hinder an attack on Odesa. Russia also suffered a blow in another city it controls in the south, the port city of Berdyansk, where a Russian warship that had been resupplying troops was blown up pier side by the Ukrainian Navy.

DOD asserted that the Russian aim in the east could be motivated by an effort to consolidate gains, unless they are undone.

“They are putting their priorities and their effort in the east of Ukraine. And that’s where still, there remains a lot of heavy fighting,” the official said. “We think they are trying to … secure some sort of more substantial gains there as a potential negotiating tactic at the table.”",https://www.airforcemag.com/us-ukrainian-leaders-meet-in-warsaw-as-russia-ramps-up-air-attacks-on-ukraine/

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby acknowledged that the Defense Department has not “had a successful attempt to talk to Defense Minister [Sergei] Shoigu and Gen. [Valery] Gerasimov” during a CNN interview on Thursday. The Washington Post was the first to report the failed efforts, and Kirby told the outlet that the Russian leaders “have so far declined to engage.”

The United States has tried to reach out “on several occasions in the last week or 10 days,” he added in the television interview. “We just haven’t been able to reach either of them.”

UKRAINIAN AMBASSADOR TO US ACCUSES RUSSIA OF 'GENOCIDE' DURING INVASION

The Biden administration has repeatedly stressed the importance of avoiding a possible escalation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine through its own actions and support for Ukraine. It has repeatedly declined to provide Ukraine with fighter jets and to implement and enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine, arguing that both could be viewed by Russia as escalatory, even though Ukrainian leaders have asked for both.

The Pentagon also postponed a missile test and created a deconfliction line between the U.S. and Russian military officials in efforts to avoid miscommunication.

The U.S. checks the line “once or twice a day … just to make sure when we pick it up, the Russians are answering, so far they are,” Kirby added.

Additionally, Secretary of State Antony Blinken has not attempted to reach out to his counterpart, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, since the start of the conflict, the Washington Post reported, citing U.S. officials. Blinken on Wednesday declared that the U.S. had seen evidence to support the claim that Russian forces have committed war crimes during their monthlong siege in Ukraine.
