The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

CNN —

Russia said it would “drastically reduce” its military assault on the Ukrainian cities of Kyiv and Chernihiv after talks took place between representatives of the two nations on Tuesday that appeared to show signs of progress towards an off ramp to the conflict.

The Russian defense ministry has decided to “radically, at times, reduce military activity” in the direction of Kyiv and Chernihiv, deputy defense minister Alexander Fomin said, state media RIA reported. The ministry’s Telegram channel also said that Moscow would “drastically reduce military activity” in the cities.

The announcement comes after Ukrainian and Western intelligence assessments suggested in recent days that Russia’s advance on Kyiv was stalling.

Talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations in Istanbul, Turkey on Tuesday covered an array of important issues, including the future of the eastern Donbas region, the fate of Crimea, a broad alliance of security guarantors and a potential meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Fomin told reporters that the ongoing discussions regarding the “neutrality and non-nuclear status of Ukraine” had contributed to the decision. More details on the steps to reduce hostilities will follow after the Russian delegation returns from Istanbul, Fomin said in remarks carried by Russian state news agency TASS.

Despite the announcement, intense fighting continued around the suburbs of Kyiv on Tuesday afternoon, especially in the northwest and northeast of the city.

Ukraine echoed the announcement regarding the reduction in military action, saying some Russian troops were pulling back from Kyiv and Chernihiv.

“The Russian enemy did not meet the goal of its offensive operation,” the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said in an official Facebook update Tuesday, adding that “certain units” of Russia’s military were withdrawing from battlefronts in the cities.

However it warned of a “high risk” of Russian troops attacking military and civilian infrastructure. The Russian military, it claimed, was struggling to reinforce and rotate in new soldiers, due to the “refusal of personnel to participate in the so-called special operation,” and are “not able to staff even one battalion-tactical group.”

Brig. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence Agency, said Russia’s operations around Kyiv had failed and it was now impossible for the Russian army to overthrow the Ukrainian government. Putin’s war is now focused on the south and the east of the country, he said.

“There is reason to believe that he is considering a ‘Korean’ scenario for Ukraine,” said Budanov. “That is, [Russian forces] will try to impose a dividing line between the unoccupied and occupied regions of our country. In fact, it is an attempt to create North and South Korea in Ukraine.”

Still, enough progress was made during Tuesday’s talks between the Russian and Ukrainian delegations to allow Putin and Zelensky to meet, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said.

Speaking in Istanbul after the talks between the two sides ended, Podolyak said there was now a “likelihood” that the two presidents may meet. “We have documents prepared now which allow the presidents to meet on a bilateral basis,” he said.

Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti, citing the Russian delegation, also reported the possibility of a meeting between Putin and Zelensky. The head of the Russian delegation, presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky, called the negotiations “constructive,” RIA reported.

Podolyak also said that talks between the two parties will “continue online 24/7,” adding that Ukraine needs “clear legal wording.”

He referred to talks about the status of Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014.

“It was agreed in bilateral format to take a pause for 15 years and conduct bilateral talks on the status of these territories (Crimea and Sevastopol),” he said.

Ukraine and the West have refused to recognize the Russian annexation of the Crimean peninsula, and the pause could be a formula for taking the issue off the table for now.

Podolyak added that they had separately discussed that “no military hostilities” take place over those 15 years.

The issue of security guarantees was also discussed. Another member of the Ukrainian team, Davyd Arakhamia said, “We insist that this be an international treaty, signing all the guarantors of security, which will be ratified.” This would be comparable to NATO’s Article 5, which enshrines the principle of collective defense, he said.

Podolyak also said that both sides are still “discussing a humanitarian ceasefire,” stressing there are “many places where humanitarian corridors are needed.”

Over 3.9 million refugees have fled Ukraine since the start of the war, according to UNHCR.

Chernihiv, which lies about halfway between Kyiv and the Russian border, has endured intense shelling in recent weeks. Videos geolocated by CNN show heavy damage in civilian areas.

On Saturday, Chernihiv Mayor Vladyslav Atroshenko announced the city was surrounded by Russian forces, leaving no safe pathways in or out.

He told CNN on Tuesday that between 300 and 400 people, mostly civilians, had been killed in the last three weeks.

“We don’t have the exact figure because we can only count those who died in a hospital, but if people die from an explosion, we cannot always identify them,” Atroshenko said.

Shifting strategies

The United States also believes Russia is executing a major strategy shift and withdrawing some forces from the area around Kyiv, two senior US officials told CNN on Tuesday.

The Russian forces are now pulling back in some areas of the north to focus on gains in the south and east, the US believes. The US has already observed these movements underway, including Russian Battalion Tactical Groups (BTGs) leaving the surrounding areas around Kyiv, according to the US intelligence.

In the US view, this is not a short-term adjustment to regroup, but a longer-term move as Russia comes to grips with failure to advance in the north.

The US assesses Russia will cover their retreat with air and artillery bombardment of the capital, one of the officials said. US officials caution that Russia could always reverse again if the battle conditions allow.

Russia’s suggestion of a reduction in its military action was met with cynicism in the West.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he had not seen signs the talks between the two sides were “moving forward in an effective way.”

“There is what Russia says, and there is what Russia does. We’re focused on the latter,” Blinken said.

The UK agreed with those sentiments, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman saying on Tuesday that Britain will judge Russia by its actions rather than words and that they do not want to see anything less than a “complete withdrawal” of Russian forces from Ukrainian territory.

Meanwhile, Turkey’s Foreign Minister Mevlüt Cavusoglu said “consensus and common understanding” was reached between the opposing delegations on some issues, hailing progress made in particular on the “top priority of achieving a ceasefire as soon as possible to pave the way for a permanent political solution.”

The “trickier” issues are now to be discussed at higher levels, with a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian Foreign Ministers to “make final adjustments to the common approach,” he said.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/29/europe/russia-reduce-assault-kyiv-plan-intl/index.html

The United Nations says more than four million people have fled Ukraine amid Russia’s offensive.

Ukrainian officials say Russian attacks have not eased in Chernihiv despite a promise by Moscow to scale back its offensive and there are reports of heavy shelling along the front line in the eastern Donetsk region.

President Joe Biden says the US will provide “additional capabilities” to the Ukrainian military.

The Kremlin plays down hopes of progress following talks between delegations from Moscow and Kyiv in Istanbul on Tuesday, saying the discussions produced no “breakthrough”.

Kadyrov, who has Chechen forces fighting in Ukraine as part of Russia’s military operation, said Medinsky had used “incorrect wording”. If you think that [Putin] will quit what he started just the way it is presented to us today, this is not true,” Kadyrov said in comments on Telegram.

Putin advisers ‘too afraid to tell him the truth’ on Ukraine: US official

Russian President Vladimir Putin is being misled by advisers, a US official has told Reuters, citing declassified intelligence.

“We believe that Putin is being misinformed by his advisers about how badly the Russian military is performing and how the Russian economy is being crippled by sanctions, because his senior advisers are too afraid to tell him the truth,” the official said.

“Putin didn’t even know his military was using and losing conscripts in Ukraine, showing a clear breakdown in the flow of accurate information to the Russian president,” the official said.

In the strongest signal yet that Russia could be preparing a tougher response to sanctions, parliament speaker Vyacheslav Volodin addressed Western countries on Telegram saying: “If you want gas, find roubles.”

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov later commented on Volodin’s words, saying “This is an idea that should definitely be worked on.”

Reuters cited two Russian sources saying that Moscow plans to keep a contract price for gas exports to “unfriendly” countries unchanged, but the payment should be done in the rouble equivalent on a pre-agreed settlement day, as one of the options to switch the currency.

World facing the highest number of violent conflicts since WWII: UN Chief

The United Nations chief has said two billion people – one-quarter of humanity – are living in conflict areas today, as the world experiences the highest number of violent conflicts since the end of World War II in 1945.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres cited conflicts from Yemen, Syria, Myanmar and Sudan to Haiti, Africa’s Sahel and now the war in Ukraine, which he described as “a catastrophe shaking the foundations of the international order, spilling across borders and causing skyrocketing food, fuel and fertiliser prices that spell disaster for developing countries”.

He told the UN Peacebuilding Commission that last year 84 million people were forced to leave their homes because of conflict, violence and human rights violations. “And this year, we estimate that at least 274 million will need humanitarian assistance,” he said.

UK not aiming to remove Putin from power: Johnson

The United Kingdom is not aiming to overturn Russia’s government and remove President Vladimir Putin from power, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said.

“I understand the frustrations that people feel about Putin and to desire a change of government in itself is not an ignoble thing … that’s the objective of a lot of democratic politics,” Johnson told lawmakers at a committee hearing.

“But let’s be absolutely clear, it’s not the objective of the UK government, and it’s very, very important that everybody gets this. We are simply setting out to help to protect the people of Ukraine, and to protect them against absolutely barbaric and unreasonable violence.”

UN examining forced evacuation claims

The United Nations’ human rights chief has said her office is looking into allegations that some residents of Mariupol, in southeastern Ukraine, have been forcibly evacuated to areas controlled by Russian forces or to Russia itself.

Speaking to the UN’s Human Rights Council, Michelle Bachelet decried a life of “sheer terror” for people in the besieged port city since Moscow launched its offensive.

Ukraine has charged that Russian forces were forcibly taking people from Mariupol and other areas to Russia. Moscow has denied the claims, saying about 500,000 Ukrainians left for Russia voluntarily.

Bachelet added her office was also reviewing “credible allegations” that Russian forces have used cluster munitions 24 times and allegations that Ukrainian forces have done so too.

Austria activates alert system to ensure gas supply

Austria has announced that it is following Germany in activating the first level of its emergency plan to ensure gas supply over fears that Russia could cut off exports of the energy source if Western countries refuse to make payments to Moscow in roubles.

Chancellor Karl Nehammer’s office said in a statement that the move involved the “strengthening of existing monitoring systems” which had been in place for weeks.

It added that measures such as gas rationing would only come into play if the third phase of the emergency plan were activated, which required an “immediate crisis”.

UN nuclear watchdog chief visits power plant in southern Ukraine

The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has visited a nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine on his first trip to the country since Russia launched its invasion.

Director General Rafael Grossi said he was meeting with Ukrainian government officials and staff at the southern Ukraine nuclear power plant as part of the UN nuclear watchdog’s effort to provide the country with “technical assistance” to ensure the safety and security of its nuclear facilities.

He said in a series of tweets that the agency’s presence on the ground in Ukraine “will help prevent the danger of a nuclear accident that could have severe public health and environmental consequences” both within the country’s borders and beyond.

Ukraine has 15 nuclear reactors at four active power plants, and is also home to the defunct Chernobyl facility, the site of a major nuclear disaster in 1986. Russian forces have taken control of Chernobyl and the Zaporizhzhia power plant, the largest in Europe.

Russia ‘unable to cancel sowing season in Ukraine’ despite attacks: Analyst

Nikolay Mitrokhin, a Russia expert and researcher at Germany’s Bremen University, says Russian forces have not been able to “cancel the sowing season in Ukraine” despite alleged attacks on the country’s agricultural infrastructure.

“Even if they burn down all large fuel storages – the farmers mostly bought the fuel in the fall and have it in tanks by their side,” Mitrokhin told Al Jazeera.

But he added that there is an issue with the export of the remaining wheat from last year’s harvest because the Black and Azov seas are being blockaded by the Russian navy – a situation that is contributing to the panic on the global food market.

A Ukrainian minister had earlier accused Moscow of “purposefully” trying to destroy Ukraine’s agriculture infrastructure in order to disrupt the country’s sowing campaign and create a global food crisis.

He added that Ukraine and Norway, Europe’s second-largest gas supplier after Russia, had started talks over the supply of five billion cubic metres of gas for next winter.

“You can make a decisive contribution to the energy security of Europe by providing the necessary resources both to the countries of the European Union and to Ukraine,” Zelenskyy said.

Russia’s FSB says it detained 60 supporters of Ukrainian ‘neo-Nazi’ group: Reports

Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) has detained 60 supporters of what it described as a Ukrainian “neo-Nazi” group and seized weapons in 23 regions across Russia, Russian media reported.

The FSB has previously identified the group as the MKU. State television in December said the abbreviation stood for the words “Maniacs. Cult of Murder”. The FSB said it had been set up by a Ukrainian under the patronage of Ukraine’s intelligence services.

Moscow has said “de-Nazification” is one of its aims in Ukraine, alleging that anti-Russian “Nazis” are influential in Kyiv, without providing any evidence for its claims.

Russia’s foreign minister has hailed China as part of a new, “just” world order ahead of talks with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, in the eastern city of Huangshan.

“We, together with you, and with our sympathisers will move towards a multipolar, just, democratic world order,” Sergey Lavrov said, in a video released by the Russian foreign ministry before the pair held their discussions.

Russia attempting to create a global food crisis: Ukraine

Russia is “purposefully” trying to destroy Ukraine’s agriculture infrastructure in order to disrupt the country’s sowing campaign and create a global food crisis, Ukraine’s UNIAN news agency has quoted a government minister as saying.

“Russia doesn’t want us to sow the agriculture lands we have in the areas we control,” Oleh Nemchinov, minister of the cabinet of ministers, was quoted as saying.

“It’s no secret to anyone that the strikes on oil depots that Russia has carried out over the past few days are, in fact, strikes on the sowing field,” he added.

Nemchinov went on to accuse Moscow of wanting to manufacture a “humanitarian catastrophe” in North Africa and the Middle East, as well as the other parts of the world to which Ukraine exports grain, in order to create a “point of geopolitical confrontation”.

Istanbul talks produced no ‘breakthrough’: Kremlin

The Kremlin has said there was no “breakthrough” during the latest round of talks between delegations from Moscow and Kyiv on Tuesday.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters it was a “positive factor” that Ukraine submitted its written proposals during the discussions in Istanbul, but added that “we can’t say there has been something promising or any breakthroughs”.

“There is a lot of work to be done,” he said.

On Tuesday, Ukraine set out a detailed framework for a peace deal under which the country would remain neutral but its security would be guaranteed by a group of third countries. It said it would also be willing to hold talks over a 15-year period on the future of the Crimean peninsula, which was annexed by Russia in 2014.

Russia, meanwhile, said it intended to scale back its military activity near the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and the northern city of Chernihiv.

Asked about the Ukrainian offer of talks over the status of Crimea, Peskov said there was nothing to discuss on the issue because Crimea is part of Russia under the country’s constitution.

UN names experts to probe on possible war crimes in Ukraine

The UN has named three human rights experts to conduct an investigation into possible war crimes and other violations committed in Ukraine.

The independent panel, to be led by Erik Mose of Norway, has a mandate to “investigate all alleged violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law and related crimes in the context of the aggression against Ukraine by the Russian Federation”, a statement said.

Mose is a former judge on Norway’s supreme court and on the European Court of Human Rights, and previously president of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.

He will be joined on the panel by Jasminka Dzumhur, the human rights ombudsperson of Bosnia Herzegovina, and Pablo de Greiff of Colombia, who has served as the UN’s top expert on the promotion of truth, justice and reparations.

The UN Human Rights Council agreed on March 4 to establish the commission of inquiry, for one year, at the request of Ukraine and allies including the EU, UK and United States.

Ukrainian officials believe Russian forces not retreating, but ‘regrouping’: AJE correspondent

Al Jazeera’s Zein Basravi, reporting from the city of Lviv in western Ukraine, says the prevailing wisdom among Ukraine’s leaders is that Russia is “not making a retreat of any kind”, but its forces are instead “regrouping”.

“They continue to say that you cannot trust what Russia says, but that you have to see what they do and watch their actions on the ground,” Basravi said.

“And what we have seen is more attacks in the west of the country overnight – fuel depots were hit, and the Russian ministry of defence has said that is to hinder the resupply of Ukrainian forces fighting in the Donbas region,” he added.

“We have definitely seen an observable uptick in the number of missile strikes happening on this side of the country and we have also seen fighting continue in areas around Kyiv as well as Chernihiv.”

Ukrainian official says fighting continued overnight near Irpin

Ukrainian forces continued to battle Russian troops overnight near Irpin, close to Kyiv, despite Moscow’s claim that it would scale back its attacks in the region, an interior ministry official has said.

Vadym Denysenko, an interior ministry adviser, said in televised remarks that Moscow had pulled some troops and equipment out of Ukraine to neighbouring Belarus.

“But it looks more like rotation and the licking of wounds than the actual cessation of military action,” he said.

“So, it is [too] early to say that Russians are decreasing the intensity of military action in the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions,” Denysenko added.

Ukrainian forces recaptured Irpin from Russian troops earlier this week.

“Ultimately, they need to be tested by their actions and they need to withdraw from Ukraine, not just reposition,” he said, adding: “But I think we take a very sceptical view about anything coming out of Moscow.”

Lavrov will attend a series of meetings hosted by China to discuss ways to help Afghanistan. Diplomats from the US and the Taliban-led country’s neighbours are also expected to attend.

But Russia’s bloody assault on Ukraine is likely to loom large over proceedings.

Beijing has said Foreign Minister Wang Yi will collectively meet with representatives at the meeting, but it is not clear whether he will meet one-on-one with Lavrov.

Russia and Ukraine have traded accusations about the naval mines that have been set adrift in the Black Sea.

Russian Colonel General Mikhail Mizintsev reaffirmed on Tuesday that “the threat of Ukrainian mines drifting along the coastline of Black Sea states remains”.

The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry responded in a statement, accusing Russia of using Ukrainian mines it seized after the 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula and setting them adrift to “discredit Ukraine before international partners”.

“Fifty percent of the grain that we buy comes from Ukraine,” Beasley told the UN Security Council. “We feed 125 million people, before Ukraine ever happened. And so, you can only assume the devastation that this is going to have on our operations alone.”

3,31672163-47b6-4c4d-914e-40341f79404e,[],2022-03-30 00:00:00,"The meeting in Istanbul has so far been the most effective round of Ukraine-Russia negotiations. Also, following the Istanbul round, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced the partial withdrawal of troops from the Kyiv and Chernihiv areas (yet not confirmed).

The Russians also prepared a gift for Zelensky personally: they announced Putin's readiness to meet him if a peace treaty is agreed upon.

Also, at March 29 meeting in Istanbul, Ukraine lodged a peace proposal that Russia is considering now. The document proposed by Ukraine is a concept, a set of ideas. It should become a basis for a multilateral treaty, providing Ukraine with security guarantees if agreed.

Representatives of Ukraine stressed that the document they proposed is a set of ""red lines"" which Kyiv won't concede.

This article explains in detail the security guarantees mechanisms proposed by Ukraine.

Kyiv's offer

Ukraine's proposals have not been officially published. European Pravda learned comparing several sources, including official statements by Ukrainian and Russian negotiators, the MFA of Ukraine and some fragments of the document leaked to journalists. All sources show a similar Ukraine vision of a peace deal. Key elements of it are outlined below.

(1) The peace treaty applies after the Russian army withdraws from the territory of Ukraine, except Crimea and the occupied Donbas area.

(2) Ukraine expects a group of world powers to offer security guarantees. Kyiv proposed the following guarantors' list: Russia, China, the U.S., Great Britain, France, Turkey, Germany, Canada, Italy, Poland, and Israel. However, not all of them have so far agreed to that. Details of this role are even less clear. Ukraine insists that the guarantors should pledge protection equal to Art. 5 of the NATO Washington Treaty, but it's rather unreal.

(3) These guarantees do not apply to the occupied Crimea and the occupied Donbas area. This would allow guarantor states not to be involved in the war on the first day after the ratification of the treaty.

(4) Instead, Ukraine limits its sovereignty in Security and Defence. Kyiv pledges non-accession to NATO or other military alliances and to change the Constitution for this purpose (now Ukraine). Ukraine appears ready to take much stronger obligations than just non-alignment. In particular, Kyiv proposes a ban on any foreign military contingent in Ukraine. Ukraine can conduct any joint military exercises on its soil and sea only with the consent of the guarantor states (including Russia).

(5) In exchange for giving up NATO, the EU Member States present among the guarantors (including Germany and France) guarantee Ukraine's assistance in joining the European Union.

(6) Ukraine and Russia are starting negotiations on the status of Crimea, which will last for 15 years. At the same time, the negotiators emphasize that the issues of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol will be considered separately (probably assuming a different agreement with Russia on them). Instead, Ukraine promises not to return Crimea by military means, but there is no such promise for Donbas.

(7) All this will work only if such an agreement is approved by referendum, ratified by Verkhovna Rada and the guarantor states. The process will begin only after the withdrawal of troops, as referred to in paragraph 1, but may fail at each stage of ratification.

Explaining the proposal

First of all, let's be honest that a full and unconditional surrender of Russia, with the victory parade on Red Square is no way realistic, no matter how much do we want it. The Armed Forces of Ukraine will not be able to occupy a huge nuclear state.

Second option is to sign either a peace agreement or a major ceasefire agreement without the complete defeat of any party.

There is also a third option - a major ceasefire without any agreement. This can happen, for instance, when the attacker has got a military defeat and is exhausted to launch a new campaign, the defending state does not dare to cross the border, and they aren't ready to agree on anything. But given the anti-Ukrainian mood in Russia, this option seems rather a pause in hostilities.

The current government has prioritized agreeing on a ""permanent"" peace agreement that could give a longer respite. But the key is to make sure that peace conditions are acceptable to Ukrainian society. Otherwise, there will be those (especially the military) who will consider the agreement a capitulation.

Returning to the Istanbul proposals, it seems that red lines are largely not crossed at the moment. Some positions, such as the negotiations on Crimea, are generally revolutionary - so far, Russia has refused to negotiate over the peninsula.

This is not a final peace deal. Even if everything that Kyiv says (security guarantees, fast movement to the EU, etc.) is secured, that is not enough to satisfy Ukraine. It's crucial to agree with the West on maintaining sanctions against Russia and on reparations to Ukraine at the expense of frozen Russian assets. In this case, the deal has a good chance of being supported by broad Ukrainian society, i.e., getting approval at a referendum.

Abandoning NATO membership under such conditions is unlikely to be an obstacle, especially considering the information campaign to discredit the Alliance, which has been launched by the Ukrainian authorities since the beginning of March, as soon as talks with Russia began.

Even many pro-NATO activists seem ready for that if alternative security guarantees can save thousands of lives now and guarantee Ukraine's security if Kyiv is offered to compensate for the NATO ban with Germany and France's promises of the EU membership.

After all, moving toward NATO is not a goal in itself but a tool.

The problem is that Ukraine can't achieve these goals in practice.

First, the Kremlin is unlikely to agree to some points of the peace treaty at this stage of the war. ""Negotiations on Crimea"" is one of them.

Secondly, some points of the document are the responsibility of the Western states, and they are not ready for that strong security guarantees expected by Kyiv. Contrary to Ukraine's expectation that the deal will be similar to NATO Article 5, it will rather look like Budapest Memorandum.

This is the key. It means that giving up NATO voluntarily (at a time when this perspective has become a reality) poses a security challenge for us, and Ukraine must reap the benefits that outweigh the risks. It could be ""quick accession to the EU"", but this provision in the treaty will remain largely declarative. Even Germany has no right to make such a promise to Ukraine.

And third. Even if Zelensky and Putin agree on this treaty, there is still a need to convince Ukrainians, who are not happy with the idea of concessions to the aggressor. And then - ratification in the parliaments of Ukraine and the guarantor states. This makes the procedure too complicated and reduces the chances that the treaty will ever work.

Below, we explain this in detail.

Effect on Ukraine's combat capability

Zelensky's administration representatives acknowledge that the goal of the peace treaty is to reduce the number of victims, prevent ""new Mariupols"". That means stabilizing the front line as soon as possible, ceasing further killing of Ukrainians by the Russian army, and then agreeing on conditions by which Russia will agree to liberate our land.

Thousands of lives and the economy's collapse are at stake, say those backing the peace treaty, as no one knows how long the war will last.

Opponents have their counter-arguments. One of them is that Ukraine not only needs to regain its lands and rebuild destroyed cities: not ness important is to be ready for the new invasion or to have deterrence that would make this new invasion impossible. Given the nationwide hatred of Ukraine in Russia, they will not miss the opportunity to attack it again if they see Ukraine's weakness.

That is why Ukraine needs truly efficient security guarantees and/or a strong army.

Instead, current Kyiv's proposal creates the illusion of guarantees and damages defence capabilities.

We emphasize that this does not make the peace treaty unacceptable in advance. Much depends on the details. But we must be aware of the problems and not turn a blind eye to them during negotiations.

Let's start with the issue of combat capability.

Ukrainian is that strong and able to fight for more than a month because of its courage and desire to defend its own land (this was in place in 2014, too, but the difference is huge). It's not only because the Armed Forces are now much better armed. Ukrainian army has combat experience, but Russians have it too; they fight extensively in different places of the world, not only in Donbas.

However, on the battlefield, it turned out that the Russians were losing in military skill, command, strategy, ability to provide logistics, and so on compared to the Ukrainian army. This is no surprise given the reform of Ukrainian military held within the last eight years in cooperation with NATO allies. Aslo Allied officers were involved in extensive military training in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of Ukrainian militaries went through the training at the Yavoriv training ground alone (which became, in fact, a joint training facility of Ukraine and NATO).

Now, if the Ukrainian peace deal is agreed upon, this will be stopped. The proposal, to which Kyiv has agreed, envisages a ban on the deployment of foreign contingents in Ukraine.

Raising the experience of our military in joint exercises with NATO is also blocked. Any joint exercises in Ukraine are only allowed with the consent of the Russia, i.e. practically never.

And, finally, about weapons. Some Western countries are reluctant to sell modern state-of-art equipment to countries with which they do not have sufficient political and military contacts. For example, NLAW RPGs are exported from Britain to only seven countries (Ukraine is one of them). The U.S. sells the latest F-35 fighters in only 14 states; even Turkey has got a refusal because of Turkey's military-technical cooperation with Russia.

This process is not fast because the Alliance still has an understanding of what the Armed Forces of Ukraine are. But if we, in addition to non-alignment, approve a strict separation from NATO (which is not the case, for example, in Finland and Sweden), problems will arise in time.

Finally, one of Russia's demands is ""demilitarization"". If, in addition to the problems described above, Kremlin demands that Ukraine gets rid of some weapons (such as offensive weaponry), this would turn the peace agreement into a surrender treaty. In this case, Ukraine becomes defenceless against the next (in this case, almost inevitable) attack of the Russian Federation.

That is why Ukrainian negotiators must stand in the way of preventing this from happening.

And we should not expect that the guarantors will fight for us.

Fanciful guarantees

In recent weeks, supporters of Ukraine's renunciation of NATO membership have promoted the idea of replacing accession to the Alliance with another military alliance that we will create ourselves.

For example, in the format Ukraine - Britain - Poland.

This idea raised doubts from the beginning, but now it has been destroyed.

The proposals brought by the Ukrainian delegation to Istanbul include a provision that ""Ukraine shall not join any military alliance."" Instead, all hopes for collective defence rely on the security guarantees that partner countries give us unilaterally - they ""guarantee"" our security in case of the military attack on Ukraine, while we aren't obliged to do anything in return (which in itself reduces their value to some of the guarantor states). These guarantees must be part of the peace treaty, signed by these guarantor states, Ukraine and Russia.

Let's look closely at what can be expected from the guarantors if Ukraine is attacked by Russia again, with such a treaty in force.

The concept note discussed in Istanbul states that in the event of an attack on Ukraine, the guarantors take ""individual or joint action as necessary"", including direct combat action in Ukraine. However, this is just a proposal from Ukraine. According to the EuroPravda, official Kyiv was aware from the very beginning that this was hardly possible to achieve.

Now we already see the response of the same guarantors to Ukraine's requests to close the sky. NATO members oppose this because they do not want to engage in war against nuclear power, Russia, defending a country that is not part of their military-political bloc. There is no reason to believe that their position will change in the agreement on unilateral voluntary guarantees.

This is confirmed by the official response of the U.K.to Kyiv: there will be no NATO-like guarantees. If Ukraine wants strong guarantees of common defence, it must become a member of the Alliance, finance the organization, bear political responsibility, contribute to joint exercises and joint defence. In the end, it should meet the democratic criteria!

If Ukraine voluntarily refuses to join NATO, it is its choice, and it should bear the consequences.

Worth noting that the United States (one more possible guarantor) has experience providing security guarantees to non-NATO nations. The Philippines, South Korea, Japan, etc. have bilateral security agreements with the U.S. These agreements include identical safeguards:

""Each Party recognizes that an armed attack against either Party would be dangerous to its own peace and safety and declares that it would act to meet the common danger in accordance with its constitutional provisions.""

That is - no promises.

In practice, this means that the security guarantees promoted by the authorities under the peace treaty with Russia, we can count on the supply of weapons, but not the participation of the military. Almost certainly, it means no closing the sky if the attacker is Russia (because this requires the participation of the military of guarantor states too).

It will be impossible to provide aircrafts, even if there is political readiness to do so. The reason is NATO countries are increasingly abandoning Soviet military jets in favour of the newest NATO-made. And it is almost unrealistic to train Ukrainian pilots to use new equipment, to have flight lessons with them, etc. during the period of hostilities.

That means Ukraine, if it decides to abandon NATO, can remain virtually ""preserved"" on old equipment.

All this is a reality that must be acknowledged.

Again: it cannot be ruled out that other positions of the peace treaty will be attractive enough to prevail against security risks. For example, if there is an agreement on our quick accession to the EU, the desire of EU members to stand up for us will increase sharply. But there is no such promise on their side.

In Ukraine, some people worry whether it is OK that Russia, the aggressor state, will receive a guarantor status. The answer is: yes, it may be acceptable.

In the event of an attack, the guarantors take individual decisions on security guarantees for Ukraine. Therefore, Russia's actions or its unwillingness to ""consult"" should not stop other club members from helping Ukraine (such as weapons supplies).

It also doesn't matter whether Russia (or another state) that attacked Ukraine recognizes the war or hides behind a ""special operation"" again.

Also, signing such a treaty does not lift Russia's status as an aggressor. Ukraine does not lose the right to sue Russia in international courts.

No peace treaty justifies crimes, prevents the establishment of a tribunal for Putin.

There are two reasons why Russia is on the list of guarantors. First, Moscow demanded a halt to the joint exercises of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and NATO in Ukraine, so it was dealt with by proposing a consent procedure by the guarantors. Secondly, Kyiv believes that all permanent members of the UN Security Council should be guarantors. That is why China is also on Ukraine's wish list (by the way, China is not happy about it).

However, in author's opinion, such pursuit of China has little meaning in terms of guarantees. No treaty will force members of the UN Security Council to vote one way or another or refuse to veto a specific proposal. Using a treaty of this magnitude simply to involve China in contact and communication with Kyiv seems a very controversial decision.

Crimea and Donbas

Ukraine's proposal on Crimea deserves particular attention. If Russia agreed, this would mean a real breakthrough. So far, Kremlin refused to talk about Crimea as a matter of principle. However, it is almost certain that Moscow will reject this point.

If so, the question arises: what will Kyiv do then?

Ukraine has publicly marked it as a ""red line"". Will Ukraine agree that Russia destroys this line, or Kyiv will close the negotiations? Both options seem to be losing to Ukraine.

The proposal also includes Ukraine's pledge not to return Crimea by use of force.

This seems reasonable. By this point, Zelensky tried to ""sell"" to Russia a principle that every Ukrainian President would adhere to anyway. Whether we like it or not, Crimea, unlike Donbas, can only be returned through diplomacy. Obviously, this won't be possible while Putin remains in charge, and perhaps it will only happen after the collapse of Russia.

The situation with Donbas is more complicated.

We propose to remove ORDLO (Ukrailian acronym, means ""certain areas of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts"") occupied by Russia for the last more than 7 years, from the scope of security guarantees. But the document handed over to the Russians mentions that Russia and Ukraine may see the ORDLO's borders differently. How to find a common denominator here is unclear.

But the main problem is that Kyiv wants Russia to withdraw troops out to the border as of February 23, 2022.

Russia will definitely not agree to this now.

The only way to make this option work is if Zelensky agrees to fulfil Russian demands that will make a deal acceptable. For example - the loss of the entire Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Or through recognition of the ""legality"" of the occupation and annexation of Crimea. Or by letting Russia control the North Crimean channel.

Fulfilment of any of these conditions puts the peace agreement in the category of a ""surrender treaty"", and Volodymyr Zelensky is aware of this. That's why he is outspoken about the inadmissibility of surrendering the territory.

All-in-all, it seems that the only option when Russia would largely agree to the deal is if the Ukrainian army drives the occupiers to the border. But if that happens - whether Ukraine should make these concessions, sacrifice NATO, etc.? The question is rhetorical. Of course, not. In this case, such a treaty will be perceived as a surrender of interests, and it is unlikely to be supported in a referendum.

Russia's payback time

It is necessary to focus more on the referendum.

Holding a referendum is part of Ukrainian proposals. But the vote can take place in a de-occupied area. The referendum also requires a permanent ceasefire, a stable contact line, etc., so the martial law and a state of emergency can be lifted.

This in itself creates a contradiction. It turns out that such a peace treaty can be implemented and voted for only after de-occupation; however, after de-occupation, such a treaty ""will not fly""!

Therefore, the only option to reach a peace treaty is to substantially rewrite the proposal received from Kyiv, and both parties will definitely try to do it.

But two blocks will hardly appear in this treaty. These are sanctions and reparations.

Sanctions cannot be decided by the Russian Federation and fall outside the scope of this treaty. Meanwhile, this topic is crucial, and it needs to be agreed upon with the EU and the US.

Ukraine has to ensure that the West will maintain the most painful sanctions against Russia. Al least until the Russian Federation leaves Donbas, Kremlin starts meaningful negotiations on its withdrawal from Crimea and agrees to reimburse at least part of Ukraine's losses.

Instead, if sanctions are lifted now, it will encourage Russia to launch a new attack. Also, it will block the issue of reparations, i.e. the aggressor's compensation to Ukraine for the destroyed infrastructure.

Unfortunately, it is unrealistic to include reparations in the peace treaty with the Russian Federation. Moscow will not go for it. But we have a trump card.

Currently, over $500 billion of Russian money, including the reserves of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, has been blocked and arrested by sanctions. It is logical to spend this money on the reconstruction of Ukraine. And, of course, this will be done without the consent of the Russian Federation. Therefore, the fact that the draft treaty with Russia does not include reparations is not a betrayal.

And finally. Whatever Kyiv and Moscow agree on, the last word on peace terms is for the Ukrainian army and society. Neither the first nor the second will accept a treaty similar to surrender. Negotiators understand this, too.

Therefore, Ukrainian society must not remain silent if serious problems arise, but at the same time abstain from ""creating betrayal"" without reason.

British intelligence director: Putin's 'Plan B' is more attacks on civilians The head of British intelligence agency GCHQ says it appears Russian President Vladimir Putin ""has massively misjudged the situation"" in Ukraine, but that his backup plan is more attacks on civilian areas. ""We’re now seeing Putin trying to follow through on his plan. But it is failing. And his Plan B has been more barbarity against civilians and cities,"" GCHQ Director Jeremy Fleming said Thursday. Fleming also said in a speech in Australia that ""it increasingly looks like Putin has massively misjudged the situation"" — both the impact of punishing sanctions and the ability of his military. ""We’ve seen Russian soldiers — short of weapons and morale — refusing to carry out orders, sabotaging their own equipment and even accidentally shooting down their own aircraft,"" Fleming said, according to a copy of the speech posted online by GCHQ. The U.S. has assessed that Russian forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine, citing indiscriminate attacks and attacks on civilian areas. Share this -







Biden meets with parents of Trevor Reed, ex-Marine 'wrongfully detained' in Russia President Joe Biden met Wednesday with the parents of Trevor Reed, a former Marine who the White House said is being wrongfully detained in Russia on assault charges. In a statement, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden “reiterated his commitment” to continue pushing for the release of Reed and other Americans who she said are being wrongfully held in the country. “We are grateful for their partnership and feedback. We will continue to work to ensure we are communicating and sharing information in a way useful to these families,” Psaki said. Joey and Paula Reed, of Granbury, Texas, who said their son is innocent of the 2019 charges, publicly pushed the administration to help bring their son home. They met with the president Wednesday after they traveled to Washington this week and initially lobbied him from afar, NBC Dallas-Fort Worth reported. They stood on the route of Biden’s motorcade hoping it would stop — it didn’t — and they stood near the White House holding a sign bearing their son’s name. The couple eventually met with Biden and other officials in the Oval Office for more than a half-hour, the station reported. “He was very gracious,” Paula Reed told the station. “He gave us more time than we thought he would give us, but we said we would keep the conversation private.” Another former Marine, Paul Whalen, was also sentenced to 16 years in a Russian prison in 2020 after he was convicted of spying. His family has said he is innocent and that he was in the country for a wedding. Share this -







Biden said to be weighing plan to release 1 million barrels of oil for 6 months The Biden administration is weighing a plan to release about 1 million barrels of oil a day from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for about six months, totaling as many as 180 million barrels, a source familiar with the matter told NBC News. An announcement could come as soon as Thursday. President Joe Biden is expected to deliver remarks about the administration's ""actions to reduce the impact of Putin's price hike on energy prices and lower gas prices at the pump for American families."" Oil prices surged by 3 percent Wednesday, to $113 per barrel, as investors worried about new Western sanctions against Moscow and as Russian forces continued to bomb the outskirts of Ukraine's capital, Kyiv. Russia promised Tuesday to scale down operations around Kyiv in what the West dismissed as a ploy to regroup by invaders suffering heavy losses. ""After being fooled once, many traders that sold contracts in response to the peace talks are unlikely to make the same mistake the next time a Russia-Ukraine meeting is followed by optimistic comments,"" said Jim Ritterbusch, the president of Ritterbusch and Associates, an oil trading and advisory firm in Galena, Illinois.

Britain announces new legal powers prohibiting U.K. maintenance on planes, ships belonging to Russian oligarchs LONDON — Britain’s government has announced new legal powers prohibiting U.K. maintenance on planes and ships belonging to Russian oligarchs. The Foreign Office said Wednesday the new sanctions have been used immediately against billionaire oil tycoon Eugene Shvidler and Oleg Tinkov, founder of Tinkoff bank. Shvidler, who’s already sanctioned over his business links to Roman Abramovich, has had two private jets seized. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the new law adds to Britain’s powers to “deprive oligarchs’ access to their luxury toys.” British authorities on Tuesday seized a Russian-owned superyacht valued at $38 million. They did not identify the owner of the vessel, only saying the billionaire was connected to President Vladimir Putin. The government also said that finance, trade and shipping sanctions imposed on Crimea have been expanded to the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Share this -

Former Ukrainian president condemns Putin's activity in Ukraine, calls for further sanctions Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko condemned Russian President Vladimir Putin's activity in Ukraine on MSNBC on Wednesday and called for the U.S. to impose further sanctions, likening the Russian invasions in Crimea and Donbas to having the same credibility as invading Alaska. ""Russia has absolutely the same zero reason to demand Crimea or Donbas as Alaska. If we allow Putin to speak ultimatum language, the war never ended and Putin never stop,"" Poroshenko said. Poroshenko said he can hear artillery fire from his location on the northern border of Kyiv, even as peace talks between Russia and Ukraine continue and Putin claims de-escalation. ""I'm the president who had a negotiation with Putin for five years. He never keep his words,"" Poroshenko said, adding, ""The territorial integrity of Ukraine cannot be the part of any compromise."" Poroshenko called for the U.S. to restart a lend-lease program for Ukraine and to begin a ""second wave"" of sanctions and embargoes to encourage Russia to stop the attacks. ""With this situation, I'm absolutely confident that Putin cannot keep going, and Russian troops will be withdrawn from Ukrainian territory,"" he added. Share this -







Russia is using land mines, Human Rights Watch says Russian forces fighting in Ukraine have used banned antipersonnel mines that ""can indiscriminately kill and maim people,” a report from Human Rights Watch said Wednesday. The recently developed POM-3 land mines, banned under international treaties, are “equipped with a seismic sensor to detect an approaching person and eject an explosive charge into the air,” the report said. It added that they were discovered in Kharkiv by Ukrainian ordnance disposal technicians on Monday. Russia is “known to possess these newly deployed land mines, which can indiscriminately kill and maim people” within a range of about 53 feet, the report said. “Ukraine does not possess this type of land mine or its delivery system,” it added. “Countries around the world should forcefully condemn Russia’s use of banned antipersonnel land mines in Ukraine,” Steve Goose, director of Human Rights Watch's arms division, said in a statement. “These weapons do not differentiate between combatants and civilians and leave a deadly legacy for years to come.” Share this -

U.S. official: Putin and Russian Defense Ministry have 'persistent tension' A U.S. official provided NBC News with declassified intelligence claiming that there is ""persistent tension"" between Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian of Defense, or MOD, allegedly because Putin's senior advisers are ""too afraid to tell him the truth"" about Russia's battlefield failures. “We believe that Putin is being misinformed by his advisers about how badly the Russian military is performing and how the Russian economy is being crippled by sanctions because his senior advisors are too afraid to tell him the truth,"" the official said. The official did not provide evidence for the claims, citing a need to protect sources and methods. The official said Putin was unaware that the Russian military had used and lost conscripted soldiers in Ukraine, saying the lack of information showed ""a clear breakdown in the flow of accurate information to the Russian president."" “We have information that Putin felt misled by the Russian military. There is now persistent tension between Putin and the MOD, stemming from Putin’s mistrust in MOD leadership,"" the official added. The Biden administration shared the declassified information after weeks of accusations from U.S. officials that Putin had been isolated, although no evidence had been provided. Putin had a tense exchange on camera last month in which he told his chief of foreign intelligence service to ""speak plainly!"" and emphasized this month in televised remarks that Russia would not use conscripted soldiers in Ukraine. ""I emphasize that conscript soldiers are not participating in hostilities and will not participate in them. And there will be no additional call-up of reservists,"" Putin said. Share this -

Ukraine negotiator says peace talks focused on security guarantees Russian and Ukrainian negotiators at peace talks in Istanbul discussed security guarantees for Kyiv that would be legally secured by third-party countries, Ukrainian negotiator and presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said Wednesday. “It seems important to me that if we sign an agreement on security guarantees, Ukraine will have not only its own powerful army, but also an additional security circuit at the expense of allied countries that will stand side by side with us,” he said in comments to reporters. He did not specify which countries would give the guarantee. Russian forces would need to withdraw to their positions held Feb. 23, before the invasion, and only then would Ukraine put it up in a referendum, he said. Russia is no longer giving Ukraine ultimatums in the talks, he said, pointing to its stalled military campaign. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov however, suggested Wednesday that there were no significant advances at the talks. “We cannot yet state anything promising and any breakthroughs,” he said during his daily media briefing. “There is still a very extensive work to be done.” Share this -







Kremlin says it 'cannot yet state' any breakthroughs in peace talks The Kremlin has said it ""cannot yet state"" whether ""anything promising and any breakthroughs"" have come from peace talks with Ukrainian counterparts in Istanbul this week. In a daily briefing Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was ""positive"" that the Ukrainian side had ""begun to formulate and put on paper what they propose."" ""As for the rest,"" he said, ""we cannot yet state anything promising and any breakthroughs."" He said there was still ""very extensive work to be done."" Meanwhile, Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said Wednesday that Kyiv had improved its negotiating position with Moscow from where it stood even before the start of the war. “Serious success has been achieved,” he said in a post on Facebook early Wednesday. “We improved our position in all respects,” he added, pointing to Russia's military difficulties in Ukraine as the reason for the success.

Russia accused of firing at Red Cross building in Mariupol Ukrainian ombudswoman Lyudmyla Denisova accused Russian forces of taking aim at a building ""of the International Committee of the Red Cross"" in the besieged port city of Mariupol Wednesday. ""Enemy aircraft and artillery fired on a building marked with a red cross on a white background,"" Denisova said in a Telegram post. She said there was no information on any potential victims. NBC News was unable to verify the claim. In a statement, ICRC spokesperson Caitlin Kelly said the ICRC could confirm that an image purported to portray the damage of the strike did depict the ICRC warehouse in Mariupol. However, Kelly said that because the ICRC did not have a team on the ground, it could not provide any other information, including information on potential casualties or damage. The ICRC spokesperson said ""all aid supplies"" in the warehouse had already been distributed. Share this -







At least 2 million children have been forced to flee Ukraine, UNICEF says At least 2 million children have now been forced to flee Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion in late February, UNICEF has said. “The situation inside Ukraine is spiraling,” UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said in a statement Wednesday. “As the number of children fleeing their homes continues to climb, we must remember that every single one of them needs protection, education, safety and support.” According to UNICEF and the United Nations refugee agency, children make up half of all refugees from the war in Ukraine, with the UNHCR saying Wednesday more than 4 million people have now fled the country since the war began. More than 1.1 million children have so far arrived in Poland, with hundreds of thousands of others making their way to Romania, Moldova, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, among other nations, according to UNICEF. The agency reiterated its warning ""of the heightened risk of trafficking and exploitation"" in the midst of the crisis. It said it was working with governments, as well as with other agencies and other groups to introduce additional measures to keep children safe, including strengthened child protection screenings at border crossings.

Putin 'being misinformed' by advisers who are afraid to tell him the truth, U.S. official says Russian President Vladimir Putin is ""being misinformed"" by advisers about ""how badly the Russian military is performing,"" a U.S. official has told NBC News. “Putin didn’t even know his military was using and losing conscripts in Ukraine, showing a clear breakdown in the flow of accurate information to the Russian president,” the official said. “We believe that Putin is being misinformed by his advisers about how badly the Russian military is performing and how the Russian economy is being crippled by sanctions, because his senior advisers are too afraid to tell him the truth.” The move by the administration to share this information comes after weeks of accusations by U.S. officials that Putin was increasingly isolated — even from his own top advisers, though no evidence has been provided. Last month, Putin had a tense exchange, on camera, with the head of Russia’s spy service during a security meeting about the disputed areas in eastern Ukraine. Putin repeatedly interrupted Sergei Naryshkin, chief of the foreign intelligence service, and told him to “Speak plainly!” Earlier this month, in a televised message to mark International Women’s Day, Putin claimed Russia will not use any conscript soldiers in Ukraine: ""I emphasize that conscript soldiers are not participating in hostilities and will not participate in them.

Russian forces target homes, infrastructure on outskirts of Kyiv, officials say Russian forces have struck more than 30 residential buildings and pieces of infrastructure in the Kyiv region over the past 24 hours, the Kyiv Regional State Administration said on Telegram. The strikes came despite statements by Moscow that it would scale down military operations around Kyiv and in the northern city of Chernihiv. The shelling took place mainly in towns northwest and west of the capital, including in Hostomel, Bucha and Makariv, according to the region’s post. ""The night passed relatively calmly, to the sounds of sirens and the sound of gunfire from battles around the city, but there was no shelling in the city itself,"" Kyiv Deputy Mayor Mykola Povoroznyk said on Ukrainian TV, according to Reuters. Earlier, Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said on TV that Russia is transferring its forces from Kyiv and the north of Ukraine to the east and near the besieged southern port city of Mariupol.

Nearly half of Ukraine’s population worried about finding enough to eat, U.N. agency says According to the World Food Program, 45 percent of Ukraine’s population is worried about finding enough food to eat, with 1 in 5 reducing the size and number of their own meals to ensure their children can eat. “We’re talking about a catastrophe on top of a catastrophe,” WFP Executive Director David Beasley told the U.N. on Tuesday. “It’s not just decimating Ukraine and the region. It will have a global impact beyond anything we’ve seen since World War II,” he said. The WFP is providing cash assistance, freshly baked bread, ready-to-eat food across the country, it said in a statement Wednesday. The conflict in Ukraine is driving food prices high across the globe which “further limit access to food for millions of people,” it said. “In a country which used to grow food for 400 million people around the world, one person in five now reports having to reduce the size and number of their meals while adults skip meals so their children can eat,” it said. The WFP said it required $590 million to assist millions of people affected by the crisis. Share this -

Russia redeploying troops from Kyiv to east and south, presidential adviser says Russia is transferring its forces from Kyiv and the north of Ukraine to the east and near the besieged southern port city of Mariupol, Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said.

Russia's deputy defense minister said Tuesday that Moscow would scale back its military presence near Kyiv and Chernihiv. “There is very heavy fighting there now,” Arestovych said on Ukrainian TV of the eastern regions, adding that there was also fighting in Mariupol, “where the city is half captured and there are heavy street fights happening.” For weeks, Russian forces have surrounded Mariupol, causing widespread destruction in residential areas and leaving residents in a grave humanitarian situation.

March 30

The Ukraine Invasion Update is a semi-weekly synthetic product covering key political and rhetorical events related to renewed Russian aggression against Ukraine. This update covers events from March 25-29. All of the ISW Russia’s team’s coverage of the war in Ukraine – including daily military assessments and maps, past Conflict Updates, and several supplemental assessments – are available on our Ukraine Crisis Coverage landing page.

Key Takeaways March 25-29

The Kremlin is falsely presenting its partial withdrawal of Russian forces from Kyiv and Chernihiv as a major Russian concession in service of peace talks with Ukraine. In reality, Russian forces are withdrawing to recuperate after suffering severe losses in their failed operations to seize those cities.

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko continues to withstand Russian pressure to enter the war in Ukraine on Russia’s behalf.

The Kremlin is intensifying its internal censorship and crackdown on entities in Russia that do not cover the war in the Kremlin’s preferred terms.

The Kremlin denied reports of increased conscription on March 26 but is likely beginning a broader mobilization that will coincide with Russia’s annual spring conscription on April 1. These new conscription drives are unlikely to generate effective Russian combat power for many months, at the earliest.

The Kremlin maintained its defamatory narratives about claimed US involvement in Ukrainian biolaboratories and Russian nuclear capabilities to discredit and intimidate the West.

The Kremlin continued to downplay the effects of Western sanctions on the Russian economy and threatened the West with counter-sanctions leveraging Russian energy exports.

Key Events March 25-29

Negotiations:

Russian and Ukrainian negotiators met in Istanbul, Turkey, on March 29 as part of ongoing peace talks. The Kremlin is falsely framing the withdrawal of its forces that failed to capture Kyiv as a Russian concession. Kremlin rhetoric following the meeting was more open to further discussion and Ukrainian demands than throughout the first month of the invasion, but the Kremlin likely retains its maximalist objectives in Ukraine, and peace talks are unlikely to progress in the near future.

The Kremlin's claimed withdrawal of forces around Kyiv, which it seeks to portray as a “huge step” towards peace, is a cover for an ongoing redeployment of Russian forces after their failure to take Kyiv. Russian Deputy Defense Minister Colonel-General Alexander Fomin claimed on March 29 that Russia will “drastically reduce military activity in the Kyiv and Chernihiv directions” and provide details on Russia’s claimed withdrawal later this week.[1] Chief Russian negotiator Vladimir Medinsky falsely framed this claimed withdrawal as a “huge step” toward peace that requires “counter-movement” from Ukraine.[2] The Kremlin is attempting to falsely portray the failure of its campaign to encircle Kyiv, which ISW assessed had failed as of March 19, as an olive branch requiring a Ukrainian concession.[3] Russian forces continue to fight to hold their front-line trace near the city, and Russian forces have been withdrawing into Belarus for rest and refit for several days – prior to the Russian announcement on March 29.[4] Russia’s redeployment of forces to other fronts and continued shelling around Kyiv are not concessions and should not be treated as such by Ukraine and its partners.

Kyiv remained firm that Ukraine must receive separate security guarantees if it abandons its NATO aspirations. Ukrainian officials called for the establishment of a security guarantee system for Ukraine (involving Russia, China, the United States, Germany, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and France) if Ukraine drops its NATO aspirations.[5] None of those countries have publicly committed to such a system and are unlikely to do so; Kyiv will therefore likely refuse Russian demands to commit to not joining NATO.

Ukraine's delegation offered possible limited concessions on territorial control but stated all Russian forces must withdraw prior to any territorial negotiations. Ukraine’s delegation presented an agreement stating Ukraine would not join NATO, would adopt a neutral status, and would not host foreign forces if Russia provided security guarantees and withdrew all its forces from Ukraine. Ukraine also offered a fifteen-year negotiation period on the future of the Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula.[6] Zelensky emphasized in a March 27 interview with Russian media that Russia should return its forces to the positions they held before the February 24 invasion prior to any dialogue on control over the Donbas.[7] Zelensky left open the possibility of conceding parts of eastern Ukraine, emphasizing that “Ukrainian land is important, yes, but ultimately, it's just a territory,” but also said that Ukraine would not compromise Ukrainian territory without “iron-clad” security guarantees.[8] Ukrainian Presidential Advisor Mykhailo Podolyak said on March 29 that Ukraine will sign an international agreement on security guarantees only after holding a national referendum on the issue.

The Kremlin said Ukraine’s proposal was “clearly formulated” after previously falsely claiming Kyiv refused to provide a firm position and stated the Kremlin will consider Kyiv’s proposal before responding. Medinsky stated on March 29 that Russia proposed to “expedite” plans to schedule a meeting between Zelensky and Putin to occur prior to the conclusion of negations.[9] Medinsky stated Russia’s delegation will pass Ukraine’s “clearly formulated position” to President Putin, after which Moscow will give a response, but did not specify a timeline for further meetings.

Russian Domestic Opposition and Censorship:

Kremlin crackdowns on coverage of the war are increasingly prompting self-censorship among Russia’s few remaining independent outlets. The Russian Investigative Committee announced it is investigating more than 10 criminal cases of “fakes about the Russian army” as of March 25.[10] Russian authorities continue to arrest individuals Russian President Vladimir Putin deemed “scum and traitors” for sharing what the Kremlin claims is false information about the war.[11] Russian state censorship is increasingly prompting self-censorship by Russian media outlets. Russian media censor Roskomnadzor demanded on March 27 that Russian media refuse to publish interviews with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.[12] Leading independent Russian news outlet Novaya Gazeta announced on March 28 that it is suspending operations until after the war following warnings from Roskomnadzor.[13]

Ukrainian reporting successfully forced the Kremlin to respond to rumors about the absence of Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu from Kremlin broadcasts and reports. Shoigu reappeared in a Kremlin-published video on March 26 following a two-week absence.[14] Ukrainian Internal Affairs Minister Adviser Anton Gerashcenko claimed on March 26 that Shoigu’s condition has deteriorated following a heart attack at an unspecified date and that the March 26 video was previously recorded on March 11, though ISW cannot independently verify this claim.[15] Chief of the Russian General Staff Valery Gerasimov has also not appeared in public for several weeks.

Kremlin Narratives:

The Kremlin denied reports of increased conscription on March 26 but is likely beginning a broader mobilization.[16] Russia’s Defense Ministry denied claims on March 26 that it is calling Russian reservists to military enlistment offices and instead claimed that Ukrainian intelligence is issuing fake calls imitating Russian officials.[17] Ukraine’s Main Intelligence Directorate (GUR) stated on March 28 that Russia will begin conscription through the BARS-2021 (Combat Army Reserve of the Country) program on April 1, 2022, alongside the normal semi-annual conscription cycle on April 1 to “conceal mass mobilization measures.”[18] Such a recruitment drive would be unlikely to provide Russian forces around Ukraine with sufficient combat power to restart major offensive operations in the near term. Russia’s pool of available well-trained replacements remains low, and new conscripts will require months to reach even a minimum standard of readiness.

The Kremlin continues to advance information operations seeking to discredit the US government’s cooperation with Ukraine, claiming it is conducting an “investigation” into what it claims are US-funded biolaboratories in Ukraine that could be used to conduct chemical attacks. Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov stated on March 25 that Russia will continue to investigate what it claims are US-funded biolaboratories in Ukraine.[19] The Russian State Duma’s Deputy Chair of CIS Affairs Viktor Vodolatsky announced on March 26 that Russia planned to present the results of its investigation into alleged US-funded biolaboratories in Ukraine to the United Nations.[20] Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev stated on March 29 that the United States must explain its financing of alleged Ukrainian biolaboratories.[21] Patrushev also falsely accused the United States of developing bioweapons that can selectively target specific populations on March 29.[22]

Peskov claimed that US reports of Russia's use of banned munitions are attempts to divert attention from US-funded biolaboratories in Ukraine.[23] The Donetsk People’s Republic denied claims on March 26 that Russian forces used white phosphorous munitions in Ukraine.[24] Izvestiya correspondent Lenoid Kitrar claimed on March 26 to have visited the Chernobyl laboratory for the study of radioactive waste and alleged that Ukrainian workers confiscated important documents before abandoning the facility.[25]

Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev outlined the conditions under which Russia would use nuclear weapons on March 26 in an effort to intimidate the west.[26] Medvedev’s stated conditions were: the use of nuclear weapons against Russia or its allies; an attack on Russian critical infrastructure that paralyzes their nuclear response forces; or an act of aggression against Russia or its allies that threatens the existence of the state. The Kremlin is leaving the extent of what it considers an existential threat to Russia or its allies (notably including Belarus) intentionally ambiguous. Medvedev separately noted that the 2010 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, later extended by Russian President Vladimir Putin, is subject to a unique clause wherein “international treaties are only valid as long as the circumstances that gave rise to them exist,” and that those circumstances have disappeared, implying that Russia is no longer obligated to follow the treaty.[27]

Russian Reactions to Sanctions:

The Kremlin continues to claim it can weather the effect of Western sanctions and promised to implement counter-sanctions that will further isolate Russia. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated on March 28 that Russia will create a package of countermeasures in response to unfriendly US actions. Lavrov also stated that Russia will restrict entry into Russia from “unfriendly states.”[28] Russian Industry and Trade Minister Denis Maturov claimed on March 27 that Russia will rebuild all of its supply chains within 3-6 months, which is highly unlikely.[29] Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law providing income tax breaks from 2021 to 2023 on March 26 to mitigate the impacts of sanctions.[30] Russia also banned foreigners from withdrawing funds from the Russian financial system on March 25.[31] Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev stated on March 25 that the West’s “stupid sanctions” are strengthening domestic support for the Kremlin.[32] Lavrov stated on March 25 that most states will not join the West’s sanction “games” and accused the West of launching a “hybrid, total war” with sanctions.[33] The Kremlin remains focused on downplaying the effect of sanctions for a domestic audience but is unlikely to mitigate the damage to its economy.

Belarus:

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko continues to withstand Russian pressure to enter the war in Ukraine on Russia’s behalf. Lukashenko reiterated on March 25 that he does not have “plans to fight in Ukraine” and that Belarusian citizens “do not accept war at a genetic level.”[34] However, Belarus continues to logistically support Russia’s military operation. The Belarusian Ministry of Internal Affairs announced on March 26 that any Belarusian citizens who fight against Russia in Ukraine or who sabotage Belarusian infrastructure will face terrorism charges. The ministry additionally blamed Belarusian opposition leaders for coordinating a “criminal” foreign battalion - a reference to a pro-Ukrainian Belarusian volunteer unit that is operating in Ukraine.[35]

Russian Occupation:

The Kremlin is intensifying efforts to establish a formal military regime in occupied areas of Ukraine and is kidnapping Ukrainian citizens in a likely attempt to reduce Ukrainian resistance and use civilians as hostages in future negotiations. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry stated on March 29 that Russian forces have kidnapped nearly 30 Ukrainian officials, activists, and journalists and forcibly deported over 40,000 Ukrainian citizens to Belarus and Russia.[36] Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denied this report and improbably claimed Russia has no data on Russian arrests of Ukrainian officials.[37] Russian forces are additionally increasing steps to establish an occupation regime in Ukraine. The Kremlin's United Russia party opened an office on the outskirts of Mariupol on March 25 to disseminate party newspapers, propaganda, and cellphone SIM cards.[38] Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister for Crimea Georgy Muradov announced the formation of civil-military administrations in occupied southern Ukraine on March 26 and claimed Russian TV channels are broadcasting in Kherson and south of Zaporizhzhia.[39]

Drivers of Russian Threat Perceptions:

Kremlin officials claimed US President Joe Biden’s March 26 statement in Poland that Russian President Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power” demonstrates the US has no interest in diplomacy. The White House later clarified that “the president’s point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region” and was not calling for regime change in Russia.[40] Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated on March 26 that Biden’s comments about Putin “narrow the window of opportunity” for bilateral relations.[41] Russian media additionally mischaracterized Biden’s statements to claim the US will deploy US forces to Ukraine.[42]

The Kremlin is attempting to leverage its energy exports to Europe to prop up the ruble as Western restrictions on Russian energy exports erode this Russian economic lifeline. The United States and the European Commission (EC) announced a new task force on March 25 to supply Europe with 15 billion cubic meters of US liquified gas to wean European nations off of their reliance on Russian fuel.[43] EU Foreign Affairs and Security Policy High Representative Josep Borell stated on March 28 that the EU plans to abandon the Russian gas market within two years.[44] Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded that European importers pay for Russian energy in rubles on March 23, a direct attempt to restore the value of the ruble and mitigate the effect of international sanctions.[45] G7 energy ministers rejected Putin’s demands to pay for Russian gas with rubles on March 28, citing breaches in existing gas import contracts.[46] Separately, Ukraine is likely attempting to limit the willingness of states to import Russian energy. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called on Qatari energy producers to increase their exports to Europe to undercut Russia’s efforts to put pressure on European markets through an energy crisis on March 26.[47]

NATO and EU countries continue to provide lethal and non-lethal military aid to Ukraine and bordering NATO countries and increased defense measures to counter Russian aggression.

Sweden announced on March 25 that it will increase its defense spending by $300 million to provide support to Ukraine.[48]

Estonian president Alar Karis called for a permanent NATO presence on the eastern border on March 28.[49]

The US Department of Defense deployed six Navy electronic warfare aircraft and 240 troops to Spangdahlem Air Base, Germany to reinforce NATO’s eastern flank on March 28.[50]

US President Joe Biden’s new 2023 budget proposal includes $6.9 billion for the European Deterrence Initiative and for NATO to counter Russian aggression.[51]

Abkhazia's military reportedly moved to high-readiness status in response to NATO exercises in Georgia on March 27.[52]
