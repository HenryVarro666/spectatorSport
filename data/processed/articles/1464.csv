Mykolaiv (Ukraine) (AFP) – The soldier's face is caked in dust which leaves only his blue eyes just about visible. But he is alive in the ruined aftermath of a Russian military strike on a barracks at Mykolaiv which left dozens dead in the southern Ukrainian town.

A journalist at the scene heard sounds coming from within the debris and called rescuers, who shifted piles of rubble with their bare hands for an hour before managing to extricate the man.

Despite being in shock, he tried gamely to speak with the stretcher bearers as they carried him away.

Witnesses to the attack told AFP that six rockets hit the site, which originally had served as a young officers' academy, around six o'clock in the morning on Friday.

""An enormous explosion,"" says one resident, Nikolai. The blast reduced to rubble several buildings in the district.

""No less than 200 soldiers were sleeping in the barracks,"" says Maxim, 22, who had been stationed nearby and looks on aghast at the scale of the destruction.

""At least 50 bodies have been pulled out but we don't know how many remain under the debris,"" he says.

Another soldier, Yevgeny, says as many as 100 people could have been killed, in an attack with no official toll to date and details of which remain hazy.

Ukrainian authorities say only that Mykolaiv, which they describe as being a ""shield"" to the key strategic military port of Odessa, some 130 kilometres (85 miles) further west, is resisting Russian attacks and pushing back the invaders' assaults.

Kyiv authorities have been saying for several days that Russian forces have been pushed back towards Kherson, another southern town further to the east and under Russian control.

Regardless, Russian strikes which have been hitting civilian targets as well as military facilities for the past fortnight, continue to be relentless.

Mangled bodies

""We aren't allowed to say anything because the rescue operation isn't over and the families haven't all been informed,"" military spokeswoman Olga Malarchuk says, first in Ukrainian before switching to Russian.

Visibly moved, she continues: ""We are not yet able to announce a toll and I cannot tell you how many soldiers were present.""

Ukraine's presidency is not answering questions about the bombing.

""Yesterday orcs hit our sleeping soldiers with a rocket in a cowardly manner,"" Vitaly Kim, head of the regional administration, said in a video, using the Ukrainian nickname for Russian forces.

He added that he was awaiting official information from the armed forces.

Rescuers and firefighters have been relentlessly working at the razed site since Friday, accompanied by the throbbing sound of an excavator clearing the enormous heap of stones, concrete and twisted metal rods.

An arm covered in blood and a piece of human torso are laid on a tarpaulin by the rescuers.

Further on, three bodies, including one covered in a white sheet, have been moved away from the rubble.

The victims' military bags and bulletproof vests lay gathered together in the corner.

A few metres from the destroyed barrack, another, less damaged building still houses a dormitory and some offices.

All the windows have been blown out but a small painting of a religious icon as well as photos of soldiers are still hanging on the wall.

A grey stone statue, depicting a sailor leaning on a gun, ships in the background, remains standing amid the scene of desolation.

Probably destined to have been placed at the entrance of the bombed barracks, a poem is visible on it.

Its first words read: ""Fight! You'll win"".

As per a report by BBC, early 200 soldiers were sleeping in the barracks when three Russian missiles struck the base. As of now, the number of casualties has not been confirmed by the authorities, however, a report by the Associated Press totalled the number of dead to 40. Meanwhile, roughly 57 people are currently being treated for their injuries in local hospitals.

The Russia-Ukraine war has now entered its fourth week with Russian troops conducting attacks as west as the cultural capital of Ukraine-Lviv. According to reports, the military barrack, which was located on the northern edge of Mykolaiv, was totally obliterated, leaving rescuers searching the rubble for lives even on Saturday. Meanwhile, Vitaly Kim, head of the regional administration, said in a video on Saturday that ""Yesterday orcs hit our sleeping soldiers with a rocket in a cowardly manner.” Orc is a nickname given to Russians.

Nearly 900 civilians dead in the conflict

Thousands of soldiers have lost their lives in a battle which Russian President Vladimir Putin said aimed at 'de-nazifying Ukraine.' In their latest report, UN bodies confirmed more than 847 civilian deaths since the war began, though they concede the actual toll is likely much higher. Meanwhile, the UN says more than 3.3 million people have fled Ukraine as refugees, causing the largest migrant exodus in Europe since World War II.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian authorities, on Friday, said that they had temporarily lost access to the Sea of Azov as the battle for Kyiv’s sovereignty continued for the fourth week. Russian forces pushed deeper into Ukraine’s besieged and battered port city of Mariupol on Saturday as their invasion of the former Soviet state continued for the fourth week. Mariupol, which has been under siege for weeks now, continues to bear the brunt of Vladimir Putin’s aggression. Experts have opined that if Mariupol falls, it would mark a significant battleground victory for Russian troops. The city would allow Moscow to build a direct link between the annexed Crimean Peninsula and Eastern Ukrainian regions, controlled by Kremlin-backed separatists.

Ukraine’s military spokesman confirmed the hit on Saturday, but said the missile type was “yet to be determined.”

If confirmed, the Russian military’s use of a new generation of its missiles, called Kinzhal or Dagger, would mark an escalation in the conflict. Hypersonic missiles are capable of flying at five times the speed of sound, according to military analysts.

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine on Saturday appealed directly to Russians to support a diplomatic resolution to the war, and added a stark warning.

“I want everyone to hear me now, especially in Moscow,” Mr. Zelensky said in a video address hours after President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had spoken to tens of thousands of Russians in a rally at Moscow’s largest stadium. “It’s time to meet, time to talk. It is time to restore territorial integrity and justice for Ukraine. Otherwise, Russia’s losses will be so huge that several generations will not be enough to rebound.”

An early morning rocket attack a day earlier destroyed the base’s barracks where an unknown number of marines were sleeping. It killed more than 40 marines, according to a senior Ukrainian military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to reveal sensitive military information.

That number would make it one of the single deadliest attacks on Ukrainian forces since the start of the war three weeks ago. But there are indications that the death toll could be much higher.
