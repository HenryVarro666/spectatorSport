Security Council that wields enormous diplomatic influence at the United Nations. It came days after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky delivered a chilling account to the U.N. Security Council of what he characterized as war crimes in the town of Bucha, Ukraine, following the withdrawal of Russian forces there. Following his talk, the Ukrainian delegation broadcast a brief video before the council documenting grisly scenes of civilian killings in cities across Ukraine.

The 193-member assembly adopted a U.S.-sponsored resolution suspending Russia’s membership in the rights council for the commission of “gross and systematic violations of human rights.” The resolution was adopted by a vote of 93 to 24, with 58 abstentions.

The United Nations General Assembly voted Thursday to suspend Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council, the first time a country has been bounced from the U.N.’s premier rights body since 2011, when the government of former Libyan strongman, Muammar al-Qaddafi , was pushed out.

The measure constituted a stunning rebuke of Russia, a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council that wields enormous diplomatic influence at the United Nations. It came days after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky delivered a chilling account to the U.N. Security Council of what he characterized as war crimes in the town of Bucha, Ukraine, following the withdrawal of Russian forces there. Following his talk, the Ukrainian delegation broadcast a brief video before the council documenting grisly scenes of civilian killings in cities across Ukraine.

The vote fell short of the overwhelming majority of U.N. members who ruled in March—by a vote of 141 to 5, with 35 abstentions—to condemn Russia’s military aggression in Ukraine and demand the withdrawal of its troops. But it still represented a significant outcome, contributing to Russia’s growing diplomatic isolation and denying it an opportunity to defend its activities in Ukraine as a member of the rights council.

Following the vote, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield told journalist Andrea Mitchell on MSNBC that the vote was “historic” and “unprecedented” in that it was the first time a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council had been suspended from the rights council. “So many countries voted for the resolution, and we were successful in again isolating Russia, condemning Russia, and supporting the people of Ukraine,” Thomas-Greenfield said.

Still, the U.N. General Assembly’s vote underscored the continued ambivalence that many states—particularly in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia—have about rallying behind the United States and Europe in ratcheting up economic, political, and military pressure on Russia. The overwhelming majority of co-sponsors of the resolution came from Western powers, particularly Europeans, as well as close U.S. allies in Asia, including South Korea, Japan, and Singapore.

Mexico, which abstained on the vote, said shunning a U.N. member was counterproductive. “To exclude, to suspend, is not the solution,” Mexico’s U.N. ambassador, Juan Ramón de la Fuente, told the U.N. General Assembly. “Even in the midst of war, all channels should be maintained for dialogue with Russia.”

China’s U.N. envoy, Zhang Jun, expressed support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity but voted against the resolution, which was formally introduced by Ukraine. He warned the resolution would aggravate divisions among U.N. member states and “deprive” Russia of its legitimate seat on the rights council. It would simply “add fuel to the fire,” he said.

Although the United States secured the backing of Israel, which had previously declined to co-sponsor a U.S.-sponsored resolution in the days following the Russian invasion, its other allies in the Middle East—including Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates—abstained. The vast majority of African nations—including Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, and Sudan—abstained on the vote, and nearly 10—including Algeria, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Zimbabwe—voted to block the initiative.

South Africa and Senegal expressed concern that suspending Russia’s membership in the council was premature, given that a Commission of Inquiry established by the U.N. Human Rights Council had yet to conclude its investigation into alleged atrocities.

After the vote, a Russian representative, Gennady Kuzmin, dismissed the resolution as an “illegitimate and politically motivated step with the aim of demonstrably punishing a sovereign member state of the U.N. conducting an independent domestic and foreign policy.”

Before today’s session, Russia on Wednesday issued a veiled threat to some member states: Failure to vote against Moscow’s ousting would be interpreted as a show of support for a U.S.-led campaign to isolate Russia.

The warning—which was expressed in a letter to select members obtained by Foreign Policy—raised concern among U.N. delegates that Moscow, which wields enormous diplomatic influence at the United Nations, may retaliate against states that back the U.S.-led initiative. The Russian letter—sent to African, Asian, Latin American, and Caribbean nations—was directed at smaller, developing countries seeking to avoid being drawn into the big-power fight over Ukraine. Those nations are typically more likely to cast an abstention or decline to show up for a controversial vote that pits big powers against one another.

According to the Russian letter, the move to expel Russia from the rights council is “another step to punish our country for [conducting an] independent internal and foreign policy.” (Ukraine is a sovereign nation and is in no way part of Russia’s internal policy.) Moreover, the letter says, the move “will allow a small group of Western countries to unimpededly dictate their vision of human rights and to use human rights issues as an instrument of political pressure and punishment of ‘unfavorable’ states.”

It went on to state, “an equidistant voting position (abstention or non-participation) will serve the goal of the United States and be considered accordingly by the Russian Federation.” The letter did not specify what the consequence of an abstention or non-vote would have on relations with Moscow, but one senior ambassador who read the letter said it signaled Russia’s intention to retaliate diplomatically against countries that did not support Moscow.

Washington moved toward the vote after seeing the evidence of Russian atrocities in Bucha, Ukraine, including the deliberate massacre of civilians by Russian troops. “Russia’s participation on the Human Rights Council is a farce,” Thomas-Greenfield said during a visit to Romania. “And it is wrong, which is why we believe it is time the U.N. General Assembly vote to remove them.”

Under the terms of a March 2006 resolution, the U.N. General Assembly can suspend a member of the Human Rights Council that “commits gross and systematic violations of human rights.”

“I have heard Russia has been lobbying member states and warning them that even abstentions would be considered as hostile acts,” said Louis Charbonneau, the U.N. director at Human Rights Watch.

“Given the evidence of war crimes and serious human rights violations committed by Russian forces in Bucha and elsewhere in Ukraine, it is essential that the U.N. and International Criminal Court move swiftly with their investigations to gather and preserve evidence,” Charbonneau added. “Suspension of Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council, a body it’s clearly unfit to be a member of, is an important step to holding Russian authorities accountable for their actions.”

In New York, Russia’s U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, also protested a separate decision by his British counterpart, Barbara Woodward—who is serving this month as president of the U.N. Security Council—to invite Zelensky to brief the U.N. Security Council by videoconference. Nebenzia argued that U.N. Security Council (UNSC) rules established after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic require member state representatives address the council in person.

Nebenzia also characterized Woodward’s decision to allow the Ukrainian delegation to play the video of alleged Russian atrocities in the council as a “grave abuse” of her role as council president. “[S]uch practice undermines the foundation and spirit of the work of the UNSC. In-person participation, diplomacy and negotiations are the core principles of the UNSC and its chamber,” he wrote in a letter to Woodward on Tuesday.

Nebenzia warned that further similar steps by the United Kingdom could risk having “implications on our future work and on the mood in the Council in general.”",https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/04/07/united-nations-russia-human-rights-council/

Following reports of Russian atrocities in the city of Bucha in Ukraine, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, on Monday said the United States would press for a vote in the General Assembly to suspend Russia’s membership. “Russia’s participation on the Human Rights Council is a farce,” Thomas-Greenfield said on a visit to Romania. “And it is wrong, which is why we believe it is time the UN General Assembly vote to remove them.”

Under the terms of a March 2006 resolution, the U.N. General Assembly can suspend a member of the Human Rights Council that “commits gross and systematic violations of human rights.”

As of Wednesday morning, about 50 countries had agreed to co-sponsor the resolution. The preliminary list of co-sponsors was dominated by Western governments. More than half the co-sponsors were European, and there was only a single African country: Liberia.

“What we’re hearing is it looks pretty clear Russia will get suspended,” said Louis Charbonneau, the U.N. director at Human Rights Watch. “I have heard Russia has been lobbying member states and warning them that even abstentions would be considered as hostile acts.”

“Given the evidence of war crimes and serious human rights violations committed by Russian forces in Bucha and elsewhere in Ukraine, it is essential that the U.N. and International Criminal Court move swiftly with their investigations to gather and preserve evidence,” Charbonneau added. “Suspension of Russia from the U.N.

The move comes after Ukraine and its partners accused Russia of committing war crimes in Ukraine.

""We need to take action today to save the council from sinking,"" Ukraine's UN Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya said before the vote.

Of the 193 members in the assembly, 93 voted in favor and 24 voted against. Some 58 members abstained, giving the vote the two-thirds majority needed to pass.

In comparison to previous votes condemning Russia's invasion, a greater number of Russia-friendly countries such as China voted against the proposal rather than simply abstaining.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba thanked the members who voted in favor of removing Russia from the council in a message on Twitter. ""War criminals have no place in UN bodies aimed at protecting human rights,"" he wrote.

Russia had been serving a three-year term on the 47-member council — the body charged with protecting human rights.

Mass killings in Ukraine

Video and photographic material from Bucha, as well as other previously occupied towns near the capital Kyiv, show scores of dead civilians. Ukrainian authorities have said they found more than 300 bodies, of which 50 appeared to have been executed.

Russia has denied the accusations and said that the images were staged. Most Western countries have rejected this claim.

Ukraine had previously accused Russia of targeting civilians and residential buildings with its shelling and airstrikes. A strike that hit a children's hospital and maternity ward drew international condemnation.

Russia is only the second country to have its membership in the Human Rights Council revoked, following Libya in 2011. At the time, longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi was facing off against popular upheavals.

Veiled threats from Moscow

Russia issued a warning on Wednesday ahead of the session, saying that countries that vote in line with the US would face consequences.

A letter seen by Reuters also threatened countries that abstained or refused to participate in the vote, saying that this would serve Washington's aims.

The campaign to suspend Russia was launched by US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield.

The previous votes by the UN General Assembly saw many countries abstain. These included usually friendly countries such as China and India who have refused to criticize the invasion.

This led to two overwhelming votes to condemn Russia's actions in Ukraine.

3,b8db95a7-bd93-4b28-b86c-cde04d2c00db,[],,"Continuing its emergency special session today, the General Assembly took the extraordinary step of adopting a resolution that suspended the Russian Federation’s membership in the Human Rights Council, doing so in the wake of recently revealed images and testimonies of atrocities perpetrated against the civilian population of Ukraine.

The Assembly adopted the draft resolution by a recorded vote of 93 in favour to 24 against, with 58 abstentions, signaling the international community’s strong censure of Moscow’s aggressive actions towards a neighbouring State.

By the text, the Assembly expressed its grave concern at the ongoing human rights and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, noting that the violations were of such a degree that the Russian Federation must forfeit its membership in the intergovernmental body until such time as a review is considered appropriate.

Ukraine’s delegate, introducing the text, drew a clear, straight line from the brutalities being carried out in his country to the genocide perpetrated in Rwanda in 1994, the harbingers of which, he said, were “largely ignored” by the United Nations Secretariat. He underscored further parallels, including the fact that Rwanda was a non-permanent member of the Security Council at the time and used its seat as a pulpit for its “genocidal regime”. By the same token, the Russian Federation has instrumentalized its place on that organ “to spread lies almost daily”, he cautioned.

He went on to delineate the atrocities uncovered in the wake of Moscow’s withdrawal from Bucha and other Ukrainian cities and villages, describing a scene where “thousands of peaceful residents have been killed, tortured, raped and abducted and robbed by the Russian army”.

Warning delegates not to abstain on the vote, he quoted the words of writer and Holocaust survivor Eli Wiesel, who in 1999 cautioned that “Indifference elicits no response. Indifference is not a response. Indifference is not a beginning — it is an end. And indifference is always a friend of the enemy, for it benefits the aggressor, never his victim whose pain is magnified when he or she feels forgotten.” Noting that the resolution had been drafted by a cross-regional group of two dozen States and co-sponsored by more than 50, he said that voting “yes” would allow delegates to prove they were not the indifferent bystanders that Mr. Wiesel cautioned against.

Speaking after the adoption of the resolution and the suspension of its Human Rights Council membership rights, the Russian Federation’s representative said that his country had decided to suspend its membership of that body before the end of its term. It was taking this step, he said, because that Council has been hijacked by one group of States for its own purposes. He underscored that his country could not remain as part of a mechanism that enables States to blackmail others for their own purposes, especially as those same States had blatantly violated human rights for years.

Several representatives questioned the statement made by the Russian Federation’s delegate, with the United Kingdom’s representative noting it “sounds like someone being fired tendering their resignation”. Later, he observed that following on the heels of the suspension, the declaration of the Russian Federation of its withdrawal would trigger a byelection. This means that a Member State from the region will be able to take the seat and protect human rights, whereas, he said, quoting the words of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, “it was difficult to find a war crime that Russia did not commit in Bucha”.

Several representatives took to the floor to decry the resolution, with Iran’s representative rejecting it as “politically driven”. He stressed his country’s opposition to the use of the Organization’s human rights mechanisms in the service of the political gains of certain States. Not only that, but the resolution will further deepen the existing confrontation, he said.

In a similar vein, Syria’s delegate said that not only were human rights being politicized, but some States were applying double standards in the consideration of these liberties. They were choosing to shine a spotlight on some nations while ignoring violations carried out in others, depending on what best suited their political ambitions.

China’s representative also opposed the politicization of human rights as well as the application of pressure on certain States in the name of such rights. A hasty move in the Assembly had forced countries to choose sides, setting new precedents, he said. A move to deprive a State of its legitimate membership in the Human Rights Council should be founded on facts and not through a text whose drafting had not been conducted in an open fashion.

Cuba’s delegate, meanwhile, cautioned against activating the suspension of the membership clause in the Council, noting that it could be used to achieve political goals. “It is the Russian Federation today, but tomorrow it could be any of our countries, especially nations of the South, which do not support the interests of domination, and which firmly defend their independence,” he said. He pointed out the irony of the fact that the United States was opposed to the creation of the Council at its inception but has now gone on to activate one of its most contentious clauses.

Several delegates chose to highlight the urgent need for continued mediation and diplomacy, with South Africa’s representative stressing that “Wars end when dialogues begin, and wars endure when there is no dialogue”. All parties stand to gain from a negotiated outcome and to lose from violent conflict, he said, praising efforts by both Ukraine and the Russian Federation to hold talks without preconditions.

Cambodia’s representative cautioned that the removal of the Russian Federation as a Council member would only isolate it and further entrench the situation in Ukraine. Rather, there was a need to build an environment more conducive to dialogue. “At a fragile time for world peace, security and stability, the engagement among the Member States in all relevant United Nations bodies, including the Human Rights Council, is very important,” he said.

Mexico’s delegate stressed that the central focus in this regard should be to bring to justice those responsible for atrocities and not to suspend any one State from a subsidiary body of the General Assembly.

The creation of an Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine was welcomed by many delegates, including Senegal’s representative. The findings of that mechanism will provide a comprehensive view of the extent of alleged violations, he said, noting that only then can appropriate measures in response be considered. The resolution today anticipates an outcome that has not been confirmed, which is why his delegation abstained on the vote.

Echoing those sentiments, the United Arab Emirates’ delegate said that due process must be followed with regard to any violations of international humanitarian and human rights law. Her delegation abstained on the resolution as the bodies that comprise the international order were not supposed to be “a club for the like-minded”, but rather spaces where nations could talk freely with one another.

Offering a different view, Myanmar’s representative said it was clear that atrocities were being carried out against the citizens of Ukraine. He drew attention to the images coming out of Bucha that, he said, resonated decidedly with the people of Myanmar, who have gone through “massacre after massacre” at the hands of the illegal military junta.

Delegates also expressed their conviction that there was already evidence that the hand of Moscow could be seen in reports of atrocities, with Lithuania’s delegate, speaking on behalf of the Baltic States, pointing out that the United Nations itself — through its Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) — had reported on violations by the Russian Federation, which belied the need for further delay. The Office has documented instances of cluster munition use by the Russian Federation in populated areas on at least two dozen occasions, as well as the arbitrary detention and possible enforced disappearances of journalists and civil society actors, he said.

The United States’ representative said she had visited Republic of Moldova and Romania a few days ago and met with women and children who shared stories of the violence committed by the Russian armed forces. She also cited credible reports of landmines and booby traps left behind in the wake of the Russian Federation’s failure and subsequent withdrawal in some areas. She went on to note the release of images from Bucha of corpses in the street, some with their hands tied behind their backs in what appeared to be summary executions. Against this backdrop, she said the world was watching to see if the United Nations would meet this moment. Ensuring that human rights violators cannot occupy a leadership position in the human rights arena is a step in the right direction, she said.

Also speaking were the representatives of Kazakhstan, Venezuela, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Egypt, Brazil, Chile, Belarus, India, Timor-Leste, Qatar, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Indonesia, Panama, Thailand, Viet Nam, Uzbekistan, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei Darussalam, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Algeria, Peru, Saudi Arabia, Kiribati, Netherlands (also on behalf of Belgium and Luxembourg), France, Denmark (on behalf of the Nordic countries), Georgia, Poland, Czech Republic, Italy, Liechtenstein, Marshall Islands, Croatia, Spain, Slovakia, Germany, Slovenia, Canada, Japan, Australia, Portugal, New Zealand, Botswana, Romania, Austria, Ireland, Israel and Malta.

Also speaking were observers for the European Union and the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance.

Action on Draft Resolution

SERGIY KYSLYTSYA ( Ukraine ), introducing the draft resolution titled “Suspension of the rights of membership of the Russian Federation in the Human Rights Council” (document A/ES-11/L.4), said that one early morning of April 1993, United Nations delegates had coffee, kissed their loved ones and went to the Headquarters, to do business as usual. That same morning, United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali sent a Special Rapporteur to investigate extrajudicial arbitrary executions in Rwanda and reported that a more robust United Nations response was needed. The findings that abuses could be precursors to genocide were largely ignored by the overstretched Secretariat of the Organization.

In early April 1994, the Security Council received letters in which the Rwanda Patriotic Front reminded Member States that “when the institution of the United Nations was created after the Second World War, one of its objectives was to see to it that what happened to the Jews in Nazi Germany would never happen again.” In 1994, Rwanda was a non-permanent member of the Security Council, which allowed its “genocidal regime” to influence other members Council with its view of the situation, just as the Russian Federation’s presence on the Council today allows it “to spread lies almost daily”, he said.

In April 2006, in New York, on the docks by the Hudson River, a “state of the art ocean liner was launched”, he said, which was then “docked on the shores of Lake Geneva” and named the Human Rights Council. The adoption of the resolution establishing the Human Rights Council was the culmination of five months of consultations. The ocean liner is going towards icebergs, he said, and it might seem that it should have been named the Titanic instead of the Human Rights Council. “We need to take action today to save it from sinking,” he said, noting the situation in Bucha and dozens of other Ukrainian cities and villages, where “thousands of peaceful residents have been killed, tortured, raped and abducted and robbed by the Russian army”. This, he stressed, shows how far the Russian Federation has strayed from its initial aspirations in the human rights domain. This case is unique and today’s response is obvious, he said. The Russian Federation’s diplomatic note Wednesday stated that the collective effort to preserve the credibility of the Human Rights Council was considered as an approach to preserve “domination and total control in the world”. This is “the same perverted logic of the aggressor trying to present itself as a victim”, he said. If the Russian Federation is expelled from the Council, it is its own choice.

The draft resolution “L.4” is the result of the collective effort of a cross-regional group of two dozen States, with more than 50 Member States co-sponsoring it. He called upon all responsible Member States to support the draft. Addressing those who might opt to be bystanders on the vote and to abstain, he quoted Eli Wiesel’s words to President Bill Clinton in 1999: “Indifference elicits no response. Indifference is not a response. Indifference is not a beginning — it is an end. And indifference is always a friend of the enemy, for it benefits the aggressor, never his victim whose pain is magnified when he or she feels forgotten.” The genocide in Rwanda was largely a result of indifference, he said, noting that the United Nations did not respond to warnings in the Security Council and the General Assembly a year before the tragedy that is commemorated every year on 7 April.

Today, delegates will have the chance to prove that they are not indifferent bystanders, he said. “All you need to do is to press the ‘Yes’ button,” he said. “On the other hand, pressing ‘No’ means pulling a trigger and means a red dot on the screen. Red as the blood of the innocent lives lost. And this image of the red bloody dots on this screen will stay with you — and all of us — as long as memory does not fail us. Think about it. Thank you”.

The representative of the Russian Federation said the draft resolution under consideration has no relationship to the actual human rights situation on the ground, adding that it is an attempt by the United States to maintain its dominant position and an attempt at human rights colonialism in international relations. It is also an attempt to move those who wish to conduct an independent foreign policy to the periphery of international relations. There is a crack that has appeared in the human rights architecture that is decades in the making, he said, noting that the possible exclusion of the Russian Federation from the Human Rights Council could be a dangerous precedent. As practice has shown, Western approaches in dealing with acute human rights problems in certain countries have not really been successful, he said, stressing that not a single conflict was resolved, but only exacerbated, mainly due to the use by Western countries of sanctions and military intervention.

The Russian Federation throughout its membership in the Commission on Human Rights and the Human Rights Council has consistently defended the principle of cooperation based on mutual respect and equal status, he said. Its priority has always been to strengthen constructive dialogue involving all interested sides in defending and promoting human rights. He rejected the untruthful allegations against the Russian Federation based on “staged events and widely circulated fakes”, calling on all Member States to really consider their decision and vote against the attempt by Western countries and their allies to destroy the existing human rights architecture.

The representative of Kazakhstan called on all parties to cease hostilities, stating that the humanitarian situation in Ukraine is dire and that his country has already sent it three planes carrying over 50 tons of goods. He noted, however, that adoption of the draft resolution currently before the Assembly will not contribute to the settlement of conflict. The negotiation process must not be undermined, and all fora must be used to resolve it, including the Human Rights Council. Recalling that membership in the Council can be suspended following the confirmation of gross violations of human rights, he said this requires the collection of unbiased data. Today’s vote should be preceded by an investigation under relevant international mechanisms. For those reasons, he affirmed that his delegation will vote against the draft resolution.

The representative of Venezuela said the promotion and protection of human rights must be addressed in a constructive manner, with dialogue and cooperation, and human rights should not be used to attack sovereign States. He expressed his regret that divisions today have increased among members of the United Nations, cautioning: “That is the wrong path.” Such a track may create consequences that will take generations to overcome and will impact the living conditions of vulnerable groups around the country, where people are already suffering due to the increased cost of food and transportation. Also warning about the start of a new arms race, he said the international community faces the danger of a conflict between world Powers “that will destroy mankind as we know it today”. The draft resolution before the Assembly is an example of the politicization of human rights. “Without the Russian Federation, there is no possible peace agreement in Europe,” he said, underscoring that the draft will push the world towards a more acute phase of the conflict.

The representative of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea voiced concern that some countries continue to push confrontation and distrust, instead of prioritizing the easing of tensions and seeking a political and peaceful solution to the current crisis in Ukraine. He rejected any politically motivated initiative and lack of objectivity, impartiality and transparency, noting that reported atrocities against the civil population in Ukraine have not yet been officially verified or proven based on real fact or evidence. An independent investigation must be made, and substantive time and effort are required in that regard, he stressed, pointing out that some Member States are acting very recklessly for their political goals by submitting the draft resolution and adding that such political and unilateral action will not help solve the problem at all. Noting the efforts by the Russian Federation to address the humanitarian situation in and around Ukraine, he said the draft resolution is another example of political confrontation aimed at tarnishing one Member State on the United Nations stage.

The representative of Iran underlined the need for a peaceful settlement to the conflict under international law, including international humanitarian law. Affirming that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States must be respected, he expressed concern over the deterioration of the humanitarian situation in and around Ukraine. Calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities by all parties and unimpeded access for humanitarian aid, he said the international community must support continued direct negotiations between the Russian Federation and Ukraine. The text under consideration is politically driven, he said, and his delegation opposes the exploitation of United Nations human rights machinery for political ends. Stating that the exploitation of paragraph 8 of General Assembly resolution A/RES/60/251 deepens confrontation and attenuates constructive dialogue between countries, he said his delegation will vote no on the draft resolution before the Assembly.

The representative of Syria condemned the politicization of human rights by some countries and the targeting of the Russian Federation on the pretext of dealing with humanitarian issues in Ukraine. He stressed the need to reject such politicization and underscored the importance of objectivity and non-discrimination in human rights issues. The coordinated Western move to denounce the Russian Federation has no relation to human rights in Ukraine or anywhere else. It is an effort by Western countries to impose their control over the rest of the world. The resolution establishing the Human Rights Council stressed that all human rights are interlinked and that they should be treated in a just and equitable way. However, some States use double standards when dealing with human rights issues, focusing on the situation in certain countries in a manner that serves their own political purposes while ignoring grave violations perpetrated in the full sight of the world. What the Palestinian people have been exposed to at the hands of the Israeli occupation forces is the best proof of that, he said, noting that his delegation will vote against the resolution.

The representative of Cuba said that only a few days after concluding a regular session of the Human Rights Council, that body was not even given an opportunity to state its position. Since the start of the negotiating process to create the new Council that would replace the Human Rights Commission, his country has opposed the clause on suspension of membership given the serious risk that it could be used by specific countries which favour double standards, selectivity and the politicization of human rights issues. “It is the Russian Federation today, but tomorrow it could be any of our countries, especially nations of the south, which do not support the interests of domination and which firmly defend their independence,” he stressed. Moreover, he pointed out that the suspension of the United States’ membership in the Council has not happened nor will it despite that country’s flagrant violations of human rights, adding that the suspension clause will not be used against the State which imposed against Cuba for over 60 years a criminal economic and financial blockade — the longest and a systematic violation of the human rights of an entire people. “It is ironic that the country which opposed the establishment of the Human Rights Council and requested a vote against the resolution establishing it is the same one that has conveniently now activated it, as it did in 2011, one of the most controversial clauses of that forum,” he said. The draft resolution under consideration today will establish a dangerous additional precedent, especially for the South, he said, explaining his country’s vote against the text.

The representative of Senegal said war is a failure of humanity, at all times and in all places. He expressed support for peace in Ukraine, also because “our countries are collateral victims” of the crisis with serious consequences for economies and populations. He noted Senegal’s President, in his capacity as the current Chairman of the African Union, called for respect for international law and the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine — also the reason for his delegation’s support for Assembly resolution A/ES-11/L.2 on 24 March, and for Human Rights Council resolution A/HRC/49/1 of 4 March, on implementation of an international commission of inquiry into allegations of human rights violations in the country as a result of the war. Publication of its findings will give the international community a full view of the nature and extent of the alleged violations, and therefore the exact measure of the sanctions to be considered. However, today’s resolution decides on sanction measures without the Commission of Inquiry, thus anticipating the work expected of it, leading his delegation to abstain.

The representative of South Africa said that a cessation of hostilities must be the first step in the response to the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine. “Wars end when dialogues begin, and wars endure when there is no dialogue”, he said. He welcomed efforts by Ukraine and the Russian Federation to hold talks without preconditions and expressed his hope that both parties will use diplomacy to de-escalate the situation. All parties have much to gain from a negotiated outcome and much to lose from unnecessary and violent conflict. The General Assembly must encourage mediation and dialogue and adopt outcomes leading to that end. “The international community cannot be indifferent to the killing and suffering of civilians,” he said, calling for an immediate opening of humanitarian corridors. On 4 March 2022, the Human Rights Council supported the establishment of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine to investigate violations of international law and related crimes. The Commission has not yet commenced its work. In that regard, the tabling of the resolution today is premature and his delegation will abstain, he said.

The representative of Egypt said the draft resolution does not relate to the situation in Ukraine, the principle on the non-use of force in relations among nations. Expressing concern about the functions and mandates of United Nations bodies, he said the draft resolution undermines the Organization’s methods of work and threatens to undermine its credibility, leading to further negative repercussions on its ability to fulfil its role in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. Voicing concern about human rights violations and stressing the obligations of all States in that regard, he said serious human rights violations should be dealt with decisively and in accordance with United Nations’ rules and procedures. “The draft resolution is not being proposed at the right moment,” he said.

The representative of Brazil said the establishment of the Human Rights Council, in replacing the Commission on Human Rights, represented a hopeful step towards the strengthening and improvement of the global human rights system. During its relatively short existence, the Council has faced significant challenges, but it has sought to preserve the space for dialogue and negotiation, avoiding political selectivity and double standards. “Today, we may be taking a step into uncharted territory,” he said. Voicing deep concern about allegations of gross violations of international human rights and humanitarian law in Ukraine — including the recent reports from Bucha — he said Brazil voted in favour of the Human Rights Council’s establishment of a commission of inquiry mandated to establish the facts about what may amount to violations and abuses of human rights or violations of humanitarian law in Ukraine. Calling on the parties to cooperate with it, he said in today’s vote in the General Assembly, Brazil has decided to abstain. “We believe that the Commission of Inquiry should be allowed to complete the independent investigation requested by the Council, so that responsibilities can be ascertained,” he said, reiterating the need for independence, objectivity and impartiality.

The representative of China said the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States must be respected, along with their legitimate security concerns. Reports and images of civilian deaths in Bucha are disturbing and must be verified with accusations based on facts. Dialogue and negotiation are the only way out of the Ukraine crisis, he said, with the international community remaining rational and not setting up obstacles or resistance that add fuel to the fire. Indiscriminate sanctions without a bottom line have created complex new problems for the global post-pandemic recovery, with developing countries suffering while not being parties to the current conflict. Meanwhile, some other developed States provoke tensions in the Asia-Pacific region, which must be rejected. He voiced opposition to the politicization of human rights issues and to exerting pressure on other countries in their name. The draft resolution before the Assembly will deprive a State of its legitimate membership in the Human Rights Council — an issue that must be handled based on facts and truth. He stated the text was not drafted in an open manner, and a hasty move in the General Assembly forces countries to choose sides, setting new precedents. Therefore, his delegation will vote against the draft.

The representative of Mexico said that recent reports show the probable occurrence of serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian international law. His country has backed the Secretary-General’s call to conduct impartial investigations to ensure effective accountability. At the Human Rights Council, Mexico voted for the establishment of an independent commission to investigate all alleged human rights violations. Mexico is following the inquiry of the International Criminal Court and supports its Prosecutor’s work to establish the facts. Mexico is also following the case brought before the International Court of Justice and reiterates its call for the immediate cessation of hostilities. These processes are under way but have not yet classified the situation in legal terms, he said, noting that they must be supported until they reach their ultimate conclusions. Whether the Russian Federation is a member of the Human Rights Council or not is not a factor that exempts it from obligations under international law. The central point is to bring to justice those responsible, not to suspend a State from membership in a subsidiary body of the General Assembly. Mexico will abstain from supporting the draft resolution. “Even in the midst of the war, all channels should be maintained for dialogue with the authorities of the Russian Federation,” he said.

The representative of Chile pointed out that, while his country supports multilateralism, membership in the Human Rights Council involves certain requirements, including conduct consistent with the protection and promotion of human rights everywhere. The suspension of the Russian Federation from the Human Rights Council is a result of its unacceptable aggression and invasion against Ukraine, he said, explaining his country’s vote in favour of the resolution. He called on all parties to continue negotiations and urged an immediate and peaceful resolution to the conflict.

The representative of Belarus said his delegation is categorically against the draft under consideration by the Assembly, as it is motivated exclusively by political interests to demonize and exclude the Russian Federation. This move could have a long-term negative impact, even leading to the destruction of the United Nations as a whole and consolidating the destruction of upholding human rights under its auspices. It is important to focus not on short-term tasks influenced by emotions, but on long-term solutions. Stressing the draft proposed will not only not help resolve the situation in Ukraine, but increase risks for any negotiations, he called on Member State to reflect on the issue, and vote against it.

The General Assembly then adopted the draft resolution titled “Suspension of the rights of membership of the Russian Federation in the Human Rights Council” (document A/ES-11/L.4) by a recorded vote of 93 in favour to 24 against, with 58 abstentions.

By the text, the Assembly decided to suspend the rights of membership in the Human Rights Council of the Russian Federation and to review the matter, as appropriate. It also decided to temporarily adjourn the Assembly’s eleventh emergency special session and to authorize the Assembly President to resume its meetings upon request from Member States.

The representative of India said his delegation abstained in the vote for reasons of both substance and process. Since the start of the conflict in Ukraine, India has stood for peace, dialogue and diplomacy. Voicing deep concern about the worsening situation and reiterating his call for an end to all hostilities, he declared: “When innocent human lives are at stake, diplomacy must prevail as the only viable option.” He condemned recent civilian killings in Bucha, calling for an independent investigation, adding that it is in the global community’s collective interest to work constructively — both inside the United Nations and outside — towards an early resolution to the conflict. All decisions should be taken with full respect for due process, he stressed, adding that this principle also applies to international organizations such as the United Nations.

The representative of Timor-Leste noted that today’s vote shows the clear position of States on upholding human rights in all circumstances and in all cases. “The dark period of our own history has taught us enough on the high cost of being victims of war,” he said. Calling for an effective ceasefire, he urged continuing dialogue and negotiations to stop the war and avoid further potentially catastrophic escalation. Timor-Leste calls for more diplomatic initiatives to help find a peaceful solution for all, he added, while emphasizing that all parties must ensure the safety and protection of all civilians.

The representative of Qatar said her delegation abstained during the vote. Her country’s position is anchored in the observance of the principles of the inadmissibility of the use of force and the importance of settling international conflicts and ensuring the territorial integrity of States. She stressed the importance of upholding international humanitarian law and commended the tireless efforts of the United Nations and international humanitarian organizations to respond to humanitarian needs. She reiterated the Secretary-General’s call to revert to the path of negotiations and for an immediate ceasefire, as well as calling for all parties to the conflict to exercise self-restraint and to use diplomacy and dialogue.

The representative of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic , reiterating his call for a peaceful political and diplomatic solution to the conflict, urged the international community to refrain from any action that could escalate tensions. He echoed expressions of grave concern about the recent reports and accusations of human rights and international humanitarian law violations and abuses. “We are of the view that such serious allegations must not be taken lightly and must be backed up by solid evidence and verified by an independent investigation mechanism by the United Nations, specifically the Human Rights Council’s Independent International Commission of Inquiry,” he said. As such, his delegation voted against the draft resolution before the Assembly in view of the need for a credible, neutral, impartial and independent assessment mechanism, before any action is taken.

The representative of Indonesia shared the international community’s deep concerns regarding the devastating human rights and humanitarian situation in Ukraine. “We do not take lightly reports of gross and systematic violations and abuses of human rights, including recent report from Bucha,” he said, stressing that the Human Rights Council must remain seized of the matter and conduct a thorough and independent investigation. “In the meantime, we have to give the chance for the Commission to work in objective and transparent manners, and present its findings and reports,” he said, calling for due diligence and warning against prejudging that work. For those reasons, Indonesia abstained in the vote on the resolution, he said.

The representative of Panama said her county decided to vote in favour of the resolution, especially because Member States must abide by their commitments to human rights when elected to the Human Rights Council. In general, Panama does not support the separation of a Member State from membership in a multilateral forum, however its decision was taken given the flagrant, gross and systematic violations of human rights against civilians in Ukraine. Expressing hope that the Assembly’s action will be temporary, and that Member States will support the principles of respect for the highest human rights standards, she highlighted the need to guarantee universality in considering human rights issues, calling for dialogue and diplomacy to reach a peaceful settlement of the conflict.

The representative of Thailand said his delegation abstained on “L.4” because of the importance of transparent, impartial and inclusive processes. The decision to suspend any Member State from any body of the United Nations must not be taken lightly. Expressing condolences to the people of Ukraine and those who have lost loved ones, he further voiced concern over the escalation of the humanitarian crisis. Actions must be taken to address any atrocities committed, including in Bucha, and must be transparent and objective. Voicing support for the Independent Commission of Inquiry in concluding its investigation as soon as possible, in a transparent manner, he said: “Another life lost is another life too many.” Thailand continues to provide humanitarian support and affirms that political dialogue is the only way to end the dispute.

The representative of Viet Nam said he has followed with concern the situation in Ukraine and learned of recent reports of great loss of life among innocent civilians. He condemned all forms of attacks against civilians, in violation of international law. Recent information should be confirmed in a transparent manner with the parties concerned, he said, underscoring that the ongoing conflict — if not resolved peacefully — will continue to impact the entire world. The only way forward is to resume dialogue with a view to achieving long-term solutions. “There is no viable alternative,” he said. Deliberation and decisions taken by the General Assembly should be based on impartial information, in consultation with Member States. He expressed his hope that Member States will work together towards this end.

The representative of Cambodia said the isolation of a Member State through the suspension of its rights in a United Nations body will not help resolve the conflict in Ukraine, but will only trigger and intensify the situation. “At a fragile time for world peace, security and stability, the engagement among the Member States in all relevant United Nations bodies including the Human Rights Council is very important,” he stressed. Further underlining the need to create an environment conducive to diplomatic engagement, he said in view of all those concerns Cambodia voted to abstain on the draft resolution.

The representative of Uzbekistan said his country adheres to a balanced and neutral position on the current situation in Ukraine, expressing hope that the parties will find mutually acceptable ways to resolve the situation based on the principles and norms of international law. Explaining his country’s vote against the resolution, he said any decisions by the General Assembly to suspend a State’s right to membership in the Human Rights Council should be based on the outcome of a thorough investigation of the alleged human rights violations.

The representative of Malaysia , voicing deep concern over the worsening situation in Ukraine and reports of alleged human rights abuses and violations, agreed with other speakers that those who commit the latter must be held accountable. It is imperative that such atrocities be verified in an impartial and credible manner, he said, supporting the Secretary-General’s call to immediately commence an independent investigation. “Thus, Malaysia is of the view that a critical decision such as the suspension of a member of the Human Rights Council must not be made in haste and should not prejudge the outcome of such investigations,” he stressed, noting that Malaysia decided to abstain in the vote.

The representative of Singapore , noting that her delegation abstained in the vote, condemned the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine and its continuing attacks on Ukrainian cities, civilians and civilian infrastructure in the strongest possible terms. Reiterating Singapore’s support for the sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine, she recalled that her country supported and co-sponsored the recent draft resolutions titled “Aggression against Ukraine” and “Humanitarian consequences of the aggression against Ukraine”, as well as the Human Rights Council’s draft titled “Situation of human rights in Ukraine stemming from the Russian aggression”. Against that backdrop, she underlined the need to spare no effort to protect civilians in Ukraine and to remain engaged in meaningful negotiations leading to a peaceful settlement.

The representative of Brunei Darussalam , condemning violations of the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of any country, reiterated the importance of upholding the principles of the rules-based framework and respect for international law. Emphasizing that constructive dialogue and engagement are essential to a peaceful solution, she said the suspension of a Member State is counter-productive and may further aggravate an already dire situation. Reiterating the importance of diplomacy, she called upon all parties directly involved to de-escalate tensions and settle all differences by peaceful means.

The representative of Kuwait said his delegation abstained on “L.4”, voicing support for all human rights bodies and their protection from politicization, as well as for dialogue and objectivity on those matters. Voicing concern over the images and information over recent days, revealing the extent of violations of international law and international humanitarian law against unarmed civilians, he appealed to the Secretary-General for a transparent international inquiry to identify perpetrators of the crimes. Citing the importance of guaranteeing humanitarian assistance, he welcomed efforts by United Nations bodies to end the hostilities. Since the beginning of the war and of military operations in Ukraine, his delegation has expressed its support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States and opposed the use or threat of force.

The representative of Kyrgyzstan said that the international community should wait for the results of all investigations on violations of human rights in Ukraine, including the Independent International Commission of Inquiry. “It is especially alarming that fraternal people are involved in this conflict,” she said, noting the importance of ensuring the full protection of civilians, as well as medical and humanitarian personnel. The text of the resolution on the suspension of the Russian Federation from the Human Rights Council is “characterized as politically driven”, she said, noting her delegation is in favour of the carrying out of an independent investigation. Any conflict must be resolved by diplomatic means, including by the creation of new formats and mechanisms, she said.

The representative of Algeria said there is no doubt that the images of Bucha and other Ukrainian cities are shocking and strongly condemnable, and the alleged crimes they imply are of the utmost gravity. “However, it is imperative to allow the existing United Nations mechanisms to investigate the facts on the ground in an impartial manner so that justice is done for all the victims,” he said. Such processes must take place far from any interference or pre-judgment, as a sine qua non condition necessary to establish the facts on the ground. Calling for respect for the principles of universality, objectivity and non-selectivity on which the Human Rights Council is founded, he said any attempt to suspend a country from a United Nations body is not conducive to promoting the virtues of multilateralism.

The representative of Peru said suspension in the future of the rights to membership of a Member State in the Human Rights Council should be invoked in any situations similar to the present case, where acts of use of force, violation of the territorial integrity of another State, and violations of human rights concur. In that context, he said the resolution does not prejudge the actions undertaken or may be undertaken by the various mechanisms of the Human Rights Council, adding that those inquiries must take place with independence, neutrality, and a focus on the rights of victims, their protection and fight against impunity. Moreover, the investigation of the Independent International Commission, which the Human Rights Council has established with a mandate to investigate alleged violations of human rights and humanitarian law in Ukraine, should take place expediently, objectively and without discrimination, which is all the more urgent and imperative in investigating the massacre in Bucha.

The representative of Saudi Arabia said his delegation abstained on “L.4”, a measure that represents a serious precedent and adversely effects the function of multilateralism and international organizations. Condemning all violations of international humanitarian law in all forms wherever they occur, he called for the protection of civilians. However, the decision to suspend a Member State from the Human Rights Council is an escalatory step that aggravates an already tense situation, not only politicizing the work of the Council but marking a unilateral move that gives certain States more rights than others. Noting all States elected to the Council are entitled to exercise their full rights under A/RES/60/251, he said his delegation abstained because aggravating the situation will preclude a peaceful settlement for the region.

The representative of the United Arab Emirates said that civilians are bearing the brunt of the conflict in Ukraine. Determining the facts on the ground is important to bring justice to victims and, in the long term, to allow communities to reconcile and build sustainable peace. At the Human Rights Council, her delegation voted for the establishment of an independent commission to investigate all violations of international human rights and humanitarian law. The members of the Commission of Inquiry were appointed on 30 March and their investigations have only just begun. Due process demands that any investigative mechanisms be allowed to complete their work, she said, noting that her delegation abstained in the vote so that any decision made is based on due process. The organizations that make up the international system were not established to be “a club for the like-minded”, she stressed. Spaces to talk to each other in the international arena must be preserved, she said, noting “that idea is in the foundational DNA of this Organization”.

The representative of Kiribati , explaining his country’s vote in favour of the resolution, recalled the images of hundreds of thousands of innocent human beings killed in Ukraine over the past 42 days. Joining calls for a speedy end to the conflict through friendly and diplomatic dialogue between the parties, he said it is a wise and civilized practice of the Commonwealth of Nations to encourage its members to be loyal and faithful to its codes of conduct. The codes require all Commonwealth members to respect the rule of law, good governance, and the rights and freedoms of persons, and to deter violations through suspension of any defaulting member, while at the same time allowing time and space for a suspended member to reform its conduct. That practice has worked well for the Commonwealth for decades, he said, noting that it could also work well for the United Nations with respect to any Member State seen by an overwhelming majority to have seriously digressed from codes of conduct for the Organization’s membership.

Statements after Adoption

GENNADY V. KUZMIN ( Russian Federation ) said the resolution adopted is an illegitimate and politically motivated step to punish a Member State conducting an independent and domestic foreign policy. He noted his delegation made the decision to suspend its membership on the Human Rights Council, on 7 April, before the end of its term, as the Council is intended for developing a depoliticized intergovernmental dialogue on the human rights agenda. Unfortunately, that body is monopolized by one group of States for their short-term gain — States which have for years been directly involved in blatant violations of human rights or abetting the same. They will not sacrifice short-term political interests, he stated, with such actions violating the mandate of the Council and undermining trust in that body. The Russian Federation cannot remain a member of an international mechanism that enables the will of those States, which have resorted to open blackmail of sovereign States in pushing through their vote. He stressed that his delegation’s decision to suspend its membership before the end of its term does not mean it will stop contributing to constructive dialogue on human rights.

OLOF SKOOG, Head of the European Union , in its capacity as observer, emphasized that the scale and gravity of the Russian Federation’s violations of international law call for a strong, united international response. The European Union supports all measures to ensure accountability for violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in Ukraine by Russian armed forces, he said, stressing that the perpetrators of war crimes and other serious violations, as well as the responsible Government officials and military leaders, will be held accountable. Noting that the Russian Federation has violated the criteria for membership of the Human Right Council through its actions in Ukraine, he stressed the necessity if its suspension in order to uphold the Council’s integrity, the General Assembly’s authority and the credibility of the United Nations human rights system. The Assembly’s rare decision today will help to prevent and discourage more violations, he said, pointing out that it is the third time in a month that it has adopted a resolution on Ukraine by a clear majority, while the Security Council remains unable to act.

YOKA BRANDT ( Netherlands ), speaking also on behalf of Belgium and Luxembourg and associating herself with the European Union, condemned the unprovoked war of aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine. Expressing horror over the reports of atrocities committed by the Russian armed forces in currently and formerly occupied territories of Ukraine, she said the images and reports from places like Bucha, Staryi Bykiv, Mariupol and Hostomel show a complete disregard for human rights and dignity of civilians. Noting the personal testimonies of rape and sexual violence that are emerging, she stressed that those actions are unacceptable for any United Nations member, and especially for a member of the Human Rights Council. “Holding a seat in the Human Rights Council is not ‘a free ride’”, she said. “Members sign up to a heightened level of public scrutiny and commit to engage with the Council in a spirit of dialogue, cooperation and self-reflection, grounded in a desire to use their membership to strengthen the enjoyment of human rights at home and abroad… With its actions in Ukraine, the Russian Federation is failing [in] its responsibilities as a member of the Human Rights Council.”

Turning to the credibility of the United Nations, she pointed out that its integrity could indeed be at stake if Member States allow the Russian Federation to commit those atrocities without consequences. Moreover, all efforts must be made to ensure there are independent and effective investigations into what happened in Bucha and other places to ensure truth, justice and accountability, as well as reparations and remedy for victims and their families. Affirming support for the Human Rights Council’s creation of an independent international commission of inquiry, she said the International Criminal Court’s investigation of alleged crimes that may amount to war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide is complementary to the investigations undertaken by the Prosecutor-General of Ukraine. The perpetrators of those crimes are being watched and evidence is being compiled with a view to their prosecution, she said, stressing that the Russian Federation needs to immediately cease hostilities, withdraw its troops from Ukraine and fully respect international humanitarian and human rights law.

The representative of the United Kingdom , taking the floor on a point of order, said he wished to seek urgent clarification from the delegation of the Russian Federation as to what precisely it said in its statement. “This General Assembly voted just a few moments ago to suspend them from the Human Rights Council and that is now done,” he said. But it seemed it was suggesting that it was also withdrawing from the Human Rights Council, which has a different effect. “Now, setting aside the fact that that sounds like someone being fired tendering their resignation,” he said, asking the Russian Federation to be precise on this point: “Will they be sending a note verbale to Member States and to the relevant authorities indicating their full and formal withdrawal from the Human Rights Council for the remainder of their term?” He said that would have a different effect on the next actions that need to be taken and the status of the Russian Federation.

The representative of the Russian Federation said he would like to explain that the question that was just asked does not refer to a point of order but refers to the substantive part of his delegation’s statement. “I think we made a very clear statement,” he said.

The representative of France said that she did not have a point of order, but maybe the interpreters should clarify, as there might be divergence between French and English versions. She said she was also wondering “exactly what was the statement of the Russian Federation?”

RYTIS PAULAUSKAS ( Lithuania ), speaking on behalf of the Baltic States and associating himself with the European Union, welcomed today’s adoption and said the Assembly has thus preserved the moral integrity of the Human Rights Council. “There is no place for the aggressor State in the United Nations body whose mission is to promote and protect human rights around the world,” he said, citing gruesome reports verified by the Organization’s officials as well as civil society members and journalists on the ground. Meanwhile, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) documented the Russian Federation’s use of cluster munitions in populated areas at least 24 times and the use of arbitrary detention and possible enforced disappearance of 22 journalists and civil society members in Kyiv, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia. Voicing the Baltic States’ full solidarity with the Ukrainian people, he emphasized that “there will be no impunity” and international justice will be done.

MARTIN BILLE HERMANN ( Denmark ), speaking on behalf of the Nordic countries, said they voted in favour of today’s resolution to suspend the Russian Federation’s rights of membership in the Human Rights Council — “not an easy decision”. Voicing support for that organ’s purpose as an inclusive forum for dialogue, he said membership therein carries the responsibility to uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights. Stressing that the Russian Federation’s unprovoked, unjustified and unlawful attack on Ukraine constitutes a gross violation of international law and the United Nations Charter and has had a catastrophic impact on Ukraine, in particular on civilians, he welcomed the establishment by the Human Rights Council of a Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine as well as the International Criminal Court’s opening of an investigation into the situation. “In the meantime, the […] Human Rights Council should not, and will not, be tainted by the full-fledged membership of a State accused of some of the most horrific war crimes seen in Europe since the end of World War II,” he said.

KAHA IMNADZE ( Georgia ), associating himself with the European Union, said the scenes depicting the massacre and brutal atrocities against innocent civilians in Bucha are devastating, stressing that there must be no impunity for any violation of humanitarian law and human rights law. The international community must ensure that justice is served for the crimes committed through all available international legal mechanisms, he said, adding that membership in the Human Rights Council comes with the responsibility to promote and protect human rights to the highest standards. However, the international community continues to witness the Russian Federation’s full disregard for rules-based order and international human rights law and for the Council’s mandate. Thus, his delegation voted in favour of the resolution and calls on Member States to continue to stand up for the principles of the Charter and international law.

KRZYSZTOF MARIA SZCZERSKI ( Poland ) said a country that deliberately kills civilians on a massive scale cannot be an active Human Rights Council member. A country that has held international law in total disregard cannot participate in making new standards in this area. The suspension of the Russian Federation’s membership is an initiative that does not have many precedents, he pointed out. Yet, the situation in Ukraine is tragically unique: A permanent member of the Security Council and a Human Rights Council member initiates an unprovoked and unjustified invasion against its neighbouring country and brutally conducts a war, deliberately attacking the civilian population. The creators of the United Nations designed it to prevent future generations from the scourge of war. The further creation of the Human Rights Council was meant to contribute to this goal. It is imperative to safeguard the United Nations achievements for the next generations and to protect the Organization’s credibility. For these reasons, Poland has supported the resolution just adopted, he explained.

JAKUB KULHÁNEK ( Czech Republic ), associating himself with the European Union, said that a permanent member of the Security Council that wages an unprovoked and unjustified war against its neighbour, and deliberately commits war crimes, has no place on the Human Right Council. In addition to the human rights situation inside the Russian Federation, the resolution is first and foremost about the unprecedented and flagrant violation of the Charter, international law, international humanitarian law and United Nations resolutions, he emphasized. The suspension of the Russian Federation’s membership is a necessary and the only logical step to uphold the integrity of the Human Right Council, he said, adding that the Assembly’s rare decision today sends a strong signal to the victims of inhuman violence.

MAURIZIO MASSARI ( Italy ), associating himself with the European Union, pointed to the horrifying images of civilians lying dead in the streets or in improvised mass graves in Bucha, and the emerging and disturbing testimony about rape and sexual violence by Russian troops against women, children and older persons. Echoing the Secretary-General’s call for an independent investigation to guarantee effective accountability, he said the Russian Federation’s suspension from the Human Rights Council was necessary to uphold that body’s integrity, reaffirm the General Assembly’s authority, and send the clear message that gross and systematic violations of human rights cannot be tolerated anywhere in the world. Emphasizing the need for accountability on the part of individual perpetrators of violations and to avoid any form of impunity, Italy calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities, withdrawal of Russian military forces and a return to negotiations.

MYRIAM OEHRI ( Liechtenstein ) said the last two weeks have seen no let-up in the horrors unfolding in Ukraine. Expressing shock and outrage over the reports and images emerging from Bucha and other parts of the country, which are evidence of war crimes, she said the Russian Federation’s methods of warfare illustrate a systematic disregard for international humanitarian law — in particular the targeting of civilian populations — as it has carried out before in Syria. Accountability remains key. Voicing support for the efforts under way to gather and preserve evidence, welcoming the independent investigation by the International Criminal Court and looking forward to the swift operationalization of the Human Rights Council’s Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, she nevertheless said the continued violations being committed by the Russian Federation abundantly meet the criteria needed for suspension in the latter organ’s membership. As such, Liechtenstein voted in favour of, and co-sponsored, the draft resolution before the Assembly today.

JAMES PAUL ROSCOE ( United Kingdom ) said the actions of the Russian Federation in Ukraine far fall short of standards of membership in the Human Rights Council, with horrific images of civilians in Bucha deliberatively killed in regions from which that State’s forces have recently withdrawn. Quoting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, he said it was difficult to find a war crime that the Russian Federation did not commit in Bucha, with evidence of gross and systematic violations of human rights — the threshold for suspension from the Council. Today’s vote delivers another message to President Vladimir Putin that those who stand by him or speak in his name must stop killing innocent civilians and end this war now. Following suspension from the Council, the Russian Federation declared its withdrawal, which will trigger a byelection; he thus welcomed the opportunity for a Member State from that region who will protect human rights to ultimately take the seat. Today is a victory for human rights and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, he stated.

AMATLAIN ELIZABETH KABUA ( Marshall Islands ) recalled that on 4 March, his country, as a Human Rights Council member, joined 31 others to vote in favour of resolution HRC/49/L1, regarding the situation of human rights in Ukraine stemming from Russian aggression. All the events which have happened since that vote have only served to confirm the Council’s firm conclusion one month ago. Her country’s vote today on Assembly resolution ES-11/L.4 is consistent with its vote at the Human Rights Council. “It is not an action taken lightly,” she said. The United Nations should have learned lessons about the importance of timely reaction in crisis situations. Objective information, including from the United Nations system, provides the necessary specificity for a political assessment to suspend the Russian Federation’s membership in the Human Rights Council and to keep this outcome under appropriate review.

IVAN ŠIMONOVIĆ ( Croatia ), associating himself with the European Union, said a country such as the Russian Federation which so clearly violates the right to life through a brutal aggression against another State “cannot and should not sit on the Human Rights Council — not after we have seen pictures from Bucha, Irpin, Borodyanka, Mariupol and so many other places of massacres in Ukraine”. Regrettably, the Security Council’s rules of procedure do not allow for the suspension of Moscow’s permanent membership nor its veto right, though they are in the current situation both inappropriate and counter-productive for the protection of international peace and security, he said

AGUSTÍN SANTOS MARAVER ( Spain ), associating himself with the European Union, stressed that “one cannot be jury and party, be a full member of the Human Rights Council and an alleged violator of those same rights”. The same countries that abstained or voted against resolution 49/1 of the Human Rights Council, establishing the Commission of Inquiry into human rights violations in Ukraine, today in turn called for a vote or an abstention on the current resolution, he said, stating that the Commission had not been able to finalize its work. While investigative processes are taking place, respect for the Charter must be exercised as Member States have done, by suspending the aggressor from the Human Rights Council through a General Assembly decision. Expressing hope that the Russian Federation will heed the international clamour against its invasion, he called for an immediate ceasefire, negotiations towards peace, and the recovery of Ukraine’s territorial integrity, affirming his country’s solidarity with the people of Ukraine.

MICHAL MLYNÁR ( Slovakia ), aligning himself with the European Union, welcomed the adoption of “L.4”, stating the consequences of the unjustified and unprovoked aggression against Ukraine, in blatant violation of international law and the United Nations Charter, are unprecedented and outrageous. According to OHCHR, at least 1,480 civilians have been killed and 2,195 injured between 24 February and 4 April 2022. “The images from Bucha the world saw last weekend have reached the bottom of living hell, following the Russian decision to start this senseless war,” he said. Allegations of sexual violence perpetrated by Russian forces, including gang rape and rapes in front of children, do not deserve any further comment. “The face of Russia will be tarnished for a very long time”, he stressed. Such disgraceful behaviour is absolutely incompatible with membership in the Human Rights Council, and his delegation welcomes the swift nomination of highly qualified members to the Commission of Inquiry.

NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE ( France ) said the Russian Federation has bombed civilian populations and installations, schools and hospitals, with unbearable images of the atrocities committed in Bucha and other towns in northern Ukraine, possibly constituting war crimes. The Russian army continues to deny the humanity of thousands of Ukrainian men and women, and “it is time for this horror to end”, he said. After the international community denounced the aggression on 2 March, and adopted “L.2” on 24 March, the Russian Federation’s only response has been scorn, escalation of the war and violation of international humanitarian law — actions which cannot remain unpunished. By adopting “L.4” today, the Assembly sends a clear message that the Russian Federation’s actions “are contrary to all the values that we have defended since the establishment of the United Nations” and that it must be held to account. He welcomed the courageous decision by the international community to suspend the country, once again calling on it to heed reason and stop the war.

ANTJE LEENDERTSE ( Germany ) said the thresholds to exclude a Member State from the Human Rights Council are “gross and systematic human rights violations”. The Russian Federation has obviously committed — and continues to commit — such violations. And it is worth noting that it is not committing these violations on its soil, but on the territory of a sovereign and independent neighbouring country. Germany has already contributed €3.5 million to OHCHR’s Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, he said, encouraging delegates to read its latest report. Berlin just decided to double its contribution to OHCHR to €1 million in 2022. Welcoming the establishment of the Commission of Inquiry by the Human Rights Council, she said her country will provide another €1 million and second specialists in support of the International Criminal Court investigation.

BOŠTJAN MALOVRH ( Slovenia ), associating himself with the European Union, said a member of the Human Rights Council has an inherent duty to uphold the integrity of that subsidiary body and the authority of the General Assembly, as well as make every effort to prevent gross and systematic violations and ensure accountability for perpetrators. Noting images and reports of atrocities and war crimes committed by Russian armed forces in several Ukrainian towns, he called for an international independent investigation and expressed support for all measures to ensure that perpetrators — including Government officials and military leaders — are held accountable for any violations of international law and international humanitarian law. Welcoming the adoption of the resolution, he called on the Russian Federation to immediately cease its use of force against Ukraine.

ROBERT KEITH RAE ( Canada ) said the Russian Federation’s unprovoked and premeditated war against its neighbour displays contempt for its United Nations commitments, with the situation laying bare the Russian military’s most vicious disregard for human life — killing civilians, bombing hospitals and maternity wards. “None of these facts are in dispute,” he said. The Russian Federation has invaded Ukraine, which existed for many years under the rule of the Soviet empire, and this terrible example of the empire striking back can only be seen as an example of modern-day colonialism. The update on Wednesday by the Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine reported 3,776 civilian casualties and 1,563 killed — not simply numbers, but evidence of President Putin’s thirst for power. The international community has seen the horrific images from Bucha and Irpin, of women subjugated to sexual violence and civilians killed — which are possible war crimes, he said, stressing the Russian Federation has made it impossible to be indifferent or turn away. The international community has sent a strong message with today’s vote, he said. The Russian Federation’s withdrawal from the Council does not negate suspension, and evil must not prevail.

ISHIKANE KIMIHIRO ( Japan ), noting his delegation’s co-sponsorship of the resolution, said he is appalled by the recent revelation of atrocities against innocent civilians resulting from the Russian Federation’s unprovoked and unlawful aggression against Ukraine. “It is utterly inappropriate that a Member State that caused such a dire calamity remains on the Human Rights Council,” he said, emphasizing that the mass killing of innocent civilians is a grave breach of international humanitarian law. “It is deeply disappointing that we have to act in this way, but this is the inevitable consequence of Russia’s choice.”

MITCHELL FIFIELD ( Australia ) said the images emerging from Bucha make clear that the Russian Federation has committed egregious war crimes, including horrific acts such as executing and raping civilians. Australia voted in support of today’s resolution because being a voting member of the Human Rights Council is not consistent with invading a country and slaughtering its civilians. “These are two things we already know have happened — apart from Russia, no country is suggesting that there has not been an invasion, that there has not been slaughter,” he said, adding that the second fact is that the cause of such suffering is Moscow’s invasion. As such, the Russian Federation should be suspended in real time from the Human Rights Council until it withdraws its forces. While some have argued that the world should wait until the various investigative processes and inquiries have been undertaken — and they will be undertaken — “that’s not what suspending Russia from the Human Rights Council is about”. Instead, it is about making clear that membership in that organ is inconsistent with Moscow’s actions. “Russia needs to hear this message now and understand that its actions will have consequences,” he stressed.

EDUARDO MANUEL DA FONSECA FERNANDES RAMOS ( Portugal ), associating himself with the European Union, emphasized that the Russian Federation must immediately cease hostilities as well as violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law. Pointing to the images of civilians killed in Bucha, he reiterated the need for a full investigation of any serious violations of international law and for the perpetrators to be brought to justice. He reaffirmed his delegation’s support for the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine established by the Human Rights Council, emphasizing that its members must strictly adhere to and uphold the highest standards in promoting and protecting all human rights for all. Portugal welcomes the resolution adopted today in light of events in Bucha and other cities during the aggression against Ukraine, he said.

CAROLYN SCHWALGER ( New Zealand ) said Russia is violating international humanitarian law every day the conflict in Ukraine continues. Pointing to the horrific reports of killings and other atrocities in Bucha and elsewhere, she said the Russian Federation has flagrantly and deliberately chosen to disregard its responsibilities as a member of the Human Rights Council and no longer deserves a seat at that table. Emphasizing the need to ensure that country is held accountable for its actions, she noted that New Zealand, alongside 41 other countries, has already referred atrocities in Ukraine to the International Criminal Court and supports all relevant investigations.

COLLEN V. KELAPILE ( Botswana ), condemning attacks and all manner of violations of international humanitarian law, said his delegation is dismayed by the horrifying images of civilians killed in Bucha and joins the calls for an independent investigation that will result in full accountability on the part of those responsible. Welcoming the Human Rights Council’s active involvement in monitoring the human rights situation in Ukraine, he added that Botswana is confident there will be an objective appraisal of the human rights situation in that country and that the Human Rights Council will advise the General Assembly in a manner that will protect the integrity of the United Nations system.

ION JINGA ( Romani a) noted the profoundly troubling reports of atrocities being committed against men, women and children in Bucha and elsewhere in Ukraine. Such acts are not the actions of a rogue soldier or two, but rather part of a deeply troubling pattern, he said. The Russian authorities are responsible for atrocities that occurred while they had effective control of the areas concerned. The brutal aggression being carried out against Ukraine clearly demonstrates that the Russian Federation has violated its commitments as a member of the Human Rights Council. Therefore, it does not belong to this community, whose main aim is to protect human rights, he affirmed.

ALEXANDER MARSCHIK ( Austria ), associating himself with the European Union, said it is vital that the Assembly live up to its responsibilities. While noting the importance of continued dialogue between members of the international community, he declared: “At the same time, however, we are convinced that there is no other way than to take a firm stand and to take decisive action on situations that clearly constitute a blatant violation of international law and a violation of the Charter of the United Nations.” What has been witnessed since the first days of the Russian aggression in Ukraine far surmounts the threshold needed for suspension of the rights of membership in the Human Rights Council. Echoing other speakers’ calls for accountability and support for the Commission of Inquiry, he said Austria nevertheless voted in favour of today’s resolution as the international community must take action.

GERALDINE BYRNE NASON ( Ireland ), associating himself with the European Union, described the images emerging from Bucha and other towns in the Kyiv region as “truly horrifying”. The Russian Federation authorities are responsible for the atrocities being witnessed, committed while they had effective control of the area. “They are therefore subject to the international law of occupation,” she said, adding that the Russian aggression constitutes a flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter. As a member of the Human Rights Council, the Russian Federation is obligated to uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights, but its unlawful actions in Ukraine have clearly made a mockery of that responsibility and severely undermine the integrity of the organ itself. Stressing that it is therefore unacceptable for Moscow to continue to hold its seat, she welcomed the Assembly’s decision to suspend it its membership.

NOA FURMAN ( Israel ) said her delegation voted in favour of the resolution, but that should not be taken as tacit approval of the Human Rights Council, which has for too long lacked credibility and discriminated against one State — the only Jewish one. The Council is the clearest example of bias in the United Nations system, passing more resolutions targeting Israel than on Syria, Iran and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea combined. Israel is the only country with a standing agenda item — item 7 — ensuring that it is singled out in every meeting. In 2021, the United Nations Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and in Israel, did not even mention Hamas, she noted — an example of the Council’s absurdity. In 2006, Member States in the Assembly had hoped to replace the Council with something better, but they failed. Israel is assisting Ukraine, she said, expressing hope for the safety of all civilians and a peaceful resolution of the conflict.

KYAW MOE TUN ( Myanmar ) said the United Nations is in crisis. The very purposes of maintaining international peace and security, as well as the territorial integrity of Member States, have been violated. Over the last few weeks, there has been unbearable suffering in Ukraine. Thousands have been killed and millions displaced. Civilian infrastructure has been damaged and destroyed. All of this can only be stopped with the end of the war itself. He called for the immediate cessation of aggression and attacks against Ukraine, describing the most recent videos coming from Bucha and elsewhere as “horrific”. It is clear that atrocities are being committed against Ukrainian citizens. The appalling killings of civilians must be independently investigated, and perpetrators must be held accountable and brought to justice. The images of Bucha are particularly relatable to the people of Myanmar, who have been experiencing massacre after massacre and atrocities by the illegal military junta against its own people.

NICOLA TEGONI, observer for the Sovereign Order of Malta , said that last year, the Human Rights Council permitted 900 interventions from permanent observers, non-governmental organizations and civil societies in its deliberations — many of those contributions focusing on issues that have been highlighted by the situation in Ukraine, including human trafficking, the care and welfare of refugees, internally displaced civilian populations and the plight of migrants. He recalled that a record 82 million innocent civilians have, in recent years, been uprooted by crisis, while some 41 million people in 43 countries are on the brink of famine. He urged Member States, while deciding on weighty matters in the resolution, not to forget the raison d’être of the Assembly: ensuring a peaceful and secure world. “Let not our voices drown out the call for peace and security heard in the anguished tones and cries of ordinary people, homeless, injured and suffering, desperate to return to ordinary lives, within the secure sovereignty of their own borders,” he said.

Ms. SOUREK, observer for the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance , said the war of aggression waged by the Russian Federation against Ukraine will certainly not stop as a result of Moscow’s membership suspension in the Human Right Council. Its continued presence would ultimately deliver a fatal blow to the already weakened credibility of this body. He expressed support for today’s decision and for a thorough revision of the criteria for States to be represented there. Allowing the Russian Federation and other authoritarian Governments to use the Human Rights Council as a platform to whitewash their dismal performance on human rights is a betrayal of United Nations principles and of the memory of the victims in Bucha. “Many of these victims will have no other grave but our memory,” he stressed.",https://www.un.org/press/en/2022/ga12414.doc.htm
4,b8db95a7-bd93-4b28-b86c-cde04d2c00db,['Edith M. Lederer'],2022-04-07 01:18:17+00:00,"The U.N. General Assembly voted Thursday to suspend Russia from the world organization’s leading human rights body over allegations of horrific rights violations by Russian soldiers in Ukraine, which the United States and Ukraine have called tantamount to war crimes.

The vote was 93-24 with 58 abstentions, significantly lower than the vote on two resolutions the assembly adopted last month demanding an immediate cease-fire in Ukraine, withdrawal of all Russian troops and protection for civilians. Both of those resolutions were approved by at least 140 nations.

Russia is the second country to have its membership rights stripped at the Human Rights Council which was established in 2006. In 2011, the assembly suspended Libya when upheaval in the North African country brought down longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi.

U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield launched the campaign to suspend Russia from its seat on the 47-member Human Rights Council in the wake of videos and photos of streets in the town of Bucha strewn with corpses of what appeared to be civilians after Russian soldiers retreated. The deaths have sparked global revulsion and calls for tougher sanctions on Russia, which has vehemently denied its troops were responsible.

“We believe that the members of the Russian forces committed war crimes in Ukraine, and we believe that Russia needs to be held accountable,” Thomas-Greenfield said Monday. “Russia’s participation on the Human Rights Council is a farce.”

Ukraine’s U.N. ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya introduced the U.S.-initiated resolution and urged members to suspend Russia, saying it has committed “horrific human rights violations and abuses that would be equated to war crimes and crimes against humanity.”

“Russia’s actions are beyond the pale,” he said. “Russia is not only committing human rights violations, it is shaking the underpinnings of international peace and security.”

Russia’s deputy ambassador Gennady Kuzmin urged members to vote “no.”

“What we’re seeing today is an attempt by the United States to maintain its dominant position and total control,” he said. “We reject the untruthful allegations against us, based on staged events and widely circulated fakes.”

Approval requires a two-thirds majority of the assembly members to vote “yes” or “no,” with abstentions not counting in the calculation.

Kyslytsya responsed to Russia’s complaints about the proceeding saying: “We have heard, many times, the same perverted logic of the aggressor trying to present itself as the victim.”

And his message to those who would abstain: He quoted the late Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel: “Indifference is always the friend of the enemy, for it benefits the aggressor -- never his victim, whose pain is magnified when he or she feels forgotten.”

While the Human Rights Council is based in Geneva, its members are elected by the 193-nation General Assembly for three-year terms. The March 2006 resolution that established the rights council says the assembly may suspend membership rights of a country “that commits gross and systematic violations of human rights.”

The brief resolution expressed “grave concern at the ongoing human rights and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, particularly at the reports of violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law by the Russian Federation, including gross and systematic violations and abuses of human rights.”

World leaders have accused Russian president Vladimir Putin of war crimes after hearing of a massacre and mass graves in Bucha, Ukraine. A war crime is a serious violation of international law and is punishable in international courts. NBCLX storyteller Clark Fouraker talked with Stanford University international law professor Allen Weiner to understand how people accused of war crimes can be held accountable.

Russia called on an unspecified number of countries to vote “no,” saying an abstention or not voting would be considered an unfriendly act and would affect bilateral relations.

In its so-called “non-paper” obtained by The Associated Press, Russia said the attempt to expel it from the Human Rights Council is political and being supported by countries that want to preserve their dominant position and control over the world.

Those nations want to continue “the politics of neo-colonialism of human rights” in international relations, it said, saying that Russia's priority is to promote and defend human rights, including multilaterally in the Human Rights Council.

Russia’s ambassador in Geneva, Gennady Gatilov, called the U.S. action “unfounded and purely emotional bravado that looks good on camera — just how the U.S. likes it.”

“Washington exploits the Ukrainian crisis for its own benefit in an attempt either to exclude or suspend Russia from international organizations,” Gatilov said, in comments relayed by a Russian diplomatic mission spokesman.

Russia and the other four veto-wielding permanent members of the U.N. Security Council — Britain, China, France, and the United States — all currently have seats on the Human Rights Council, which the U.S. rejoined this year.

No permanent member of the Security Council has ever had its membership revoked from any U.N. body.

The U.N. General Assembly’s Thursday vote suspending Russia from the body’s Human Rights Council drew a newly clear delineation of the global order in ways that seemed to go far beyond allegations of Russian war crimes in Ukraine. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight On one side, 95 nations — just slightly more than half the U.N. membership, but enough to reach the necessary two-thirds of those casting a vote — supported the resolution backed by the United States and dozens of others. The total included members of NATO and the European Union, some small Pacific island nations and much of Latin America.

With their votes, U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said, “the international community took one collective step in the right direction.” Calling the vote an “important and historic moment” she said it “sent a strong message that the suffering of victims and survivors will not be ignored.”

But the total was a significant reduction from the 141 that voted in favor of last month’s nonbinding General Assembly measure condemning Russia’s “aggression” in Ukraine.

On the other side, the 24 countries that opposed Thursday’s action — compared to five last month — included China, Iran, Vietnam, Algeria, Ethiopia, much of Central Asia and Cuba, all of which had previously abstained.

“We firmly oppose the politicization of human rights issues” and “double standards,” China’s representative said. Introduced days after images circulated of dead civilians lying in the streets of the Kyiv suburb of Bucha following Russian troop withdrawals, the suspension resolution “was not drafted in an open and transparent manner,” he said, and “forces countries to choose sides.”

Most striking was Thursday’s 58 abstentions by those who declined to choose sides in a way that some said would undermine the U.N. system itself. They including all but a handful of African nations and the entire Persian Gulf. Many of the abstainers strongly condemned what was happening in Ukraine, and seemed to have little doubt about who was responsible.

But most expressed unease over adjudicating it, however credible and horrifying the allegations of torture and intentional killing of civilians, before the charges had been fully investigated by U.N. and other inquiries already initiated to do just that.

Singapore, which voted last month in favor of condemnation and whose prime minister visited with President Biden last week at the White House, said it was “gravely concerned and distressed” by recent reports and images from Bucha. But it explained its Thursday abstention as support for the “independent, international commission of inquiry” that the Human Rights Council has already established to investigate the alleged human rights abuses, and urged all countries to cooperate with it.

Some abstainers, many with their own human rights problems, argued that the suspension vote set a bad precedent, and would make an already bad situation worse. Saudi Arabia, which supported last month’s resolution, called the Russian suspension “an escalatory step” and “a form of politicization of the work of the council … that gives certain [countries] more rights than others.”

Russia’s deputy ambassador, Gennady Kuzmin, called the resolution “human rights colonialism,” and an “attempt by the United States to maintain its dominant position and total control in international relations” at the expense of smaller states.

“Today is not the time or the place for theatrics, or these kinds of extremely theatrical performances” with “no relationship to the actual situation on the ground” in Ukraine, Kuzmin said. He called on members to “really consider your decision and vote against the West’s attempt … to destroy the [U.N.'s] human rights architecture.”

That architecture, centered in the Human Rights Council, historically has been one of the most troubled edifices in the U.N. system, long accused of the kind of pressure to take sides that some charged underlay the suspension vote.

Established in 2006, it was a replacement for the Commission on Human Rights, one of the founding organs created by the U.N. charter after World War II. One of the commissions first tasks was appointing a drafting committee for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. But by the turn of the century, the commission had fallen into disrepute, accused of bias, with a membership that included numerous alleged rights abusers and procedures that often descended into finger-pointing and shouting matches.

The newly created council was intended to address those problems. Its 47 members are chosen by regional groups of nations, and approved by the General Assembly for terms of three years, with no member serving more than two consecutive terms. In meetings several times a year, it is designed to closely coordinate its work of monitoring and promoting adherence to human rights and humanitarian law with the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights.

The council’s founding resolution commits all members to “uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights.” It includes a paragraph outlining the suspension procedure for any member that “commits gross and systematic violations” of such rights, a provision utilized in 2011 to suspend Libya in the wake of Moammar Gaddafi’s violent crackdown on anti-Government protesters.

Libya’s suspension gave rise to persistent questions about the same problems that had plagued the commission — the presence of alleged abusers on the council in the first place.

Many smaller and less powerful countries believe the council gives them an outlet to stand against big powers such as the United States. For a series of U.S. administrations, that led to outrage over repeated votes against Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory, and a reluctance to criticize countries that the United States opposed.

In 2018, President Donald Trump, as part of his broader effort to separate the United States from international institutions, withdrew from the council in protest of its censure of Israel and failure to criticize countries out of U.S. favor.

The Biden administration rejoined the council last year, arguing, as had a number of its predecessors, that the United States could have more influence from within than outside the organization. The current membership, even without Russia, includes a number of U.S.-designated problem nations, including Eritrea, Cuba and China.

“It was Russia today, but tomorrow it could be any of our members,” Cuba’s representative said in opposing the suspension resolution. “Could this Assembly some day adopt a resolution suspending the membership of the United States in the Human Rights Council? We all know that has not happened, nor will it” despite U.S. invasions and sanctions over the years.

Brazil, which abstained, said the various inquiries should be allowed to complete their work. “Only then, would this General Assembly be in a position to better assess” Russia’s alleged crimes, the Brazilian delegate said. “We must at all cost avoid repeating the mistakes of the old commission.”

When the voting concluded, Russia asked again for the floor to say that it did not want to be a member of a council that “is in fact monopolized by one group of states who use it for their short-term aims,” and had already resigned. That brought challenges from Britain, whose delegate said it “sounds like someone who’s just been fired tendering their resignation.”

Seeing a silver lining, the British diplomat noted that while suspension would keep the seat open, withdrawal would trigger a new election by the Eastern Europe regional group, and the opportunity for a new member “who will genuinely promote human rights to take that seat.”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky addresses the United Nations (UN) Security Council via video link on April 5 in New York City. The United Nations General Assembly is expected to vote April 7 on whether to suspend Russia from the Human Rights Council.

By Richard Roth and Kate Sullivan, CNN

(CNN) -- The United Nations General Assembly voted Thursday to suspend Russia from the Human Rights Council.

The voting result was 93 in favor, 24 against and 58 abstentions.

A draft of the resolution says the General Assembly may ""suspend the rights of membership in the Human Rights Council of a member of the Council that commits gross and systematic violations of human rights.""

The draft resolution adds that the council has ""grave concern"" regarding reports of ""gross and systematic violations and abuses of human rights"" and ""violations of international humanitarian law"" committed by the Russian Federation during its invasion of Ukraine.

The General Assembly needed to vote in favor by two-thirds to remove Russia from the UN Human Rights Council. The measure suspends Russia's membership in the Council and would launch a review of the matter if the UN deems it appropriate.

The United States ambassador to the United Nations made a case for seeking the suspension of Russia from the Human Rights Council in front of the UN Security Council on Tuesday, something she and other UN member states have been pushing.

""Russia should not have a position of authority in a body whose purpose -- whose very purpose -- is to promote respect for human rights. Not only is it the height of hypocrisy -- it is dangerous,"" Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said.

""Every day, we see more and more how little Russia respects human rights,"" she said.

Ultimately she argued, ""Russia's participation on the Human Rights Council hurts the Council's credibility. It undermines the entire UN. And it is just plain wrong.""

The Ukrainian ambassador to the United Nations, Sergiy Kyslytsya, ahead of the vote on Thursday called on all United Nations member states to support the resolution suspending Russia from the council.

""Now the world has come to a crucial juncture. We witness that our liner is going through treacherous fog towards deadly icebergs. It might seem that we should have named it the Titanic instead of the Human Rights Council. ... We need to take an action today to save the council from sinking,"" Kyslytsya said.

The Ukrainian ambassador said Russia's actions in Ukraine ""would be equated to war crimes and crimes against humanity."" While he noted that a vote to suspend a country from the Human Rights Council is ""a rare and extraordinary action,"" he said ""Russia's actions are beyond the pale.""

In response, the deputy Russian ambassador to the United Nations, Gennady Kuzmin, called on member states to reject the resolution, saying it would set a ""a dangerous precedent.""

""Today is not the time nor the place for theatrics, or these kinds of extremely theatrical performances like the one presented by Ukraine. In fact the draft resolution we are considering today has no relationship to the actual human rights situation on the ground,"" Kuzmin said.

The Russian representative said the vote on suspending Russia from the Human Rights Council ""is an attempt by the United States to maintain its dominant position and total control to continue its attempt at human rights colonialism in international relations.""

The draft resolution expresses concern at the “gross and systematic violations and abuses” by Russia in its “aggression” against Ukraine.

Tomorrow the 11th #UNGA Emergency Special Session will take action on a draft resolution to suspend 🇷🇺#Russia‘s membership in the @UN_HRC. 🇨🇦 invites all delegations to join in voting YES ✅#accountability#RespectTheCharter pic.twitter.com/ovmXz5o0f9 — Canada Mission UN #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦 (@CanadaUN) April 7, 2022

Here is The Wire’s primer on how the voting on the resolution could play out and what will the considerations behind India’s voting position.

How can a country be removed from the UNHRC?

The 47 member states of the Council are elected for a three-year term by the UN General Assembly through a secret ballot. The UNHRC’s founding resolution, 60/251, empowers the General Assembly to suspend the membership of a country that “commits gross and systematic violations of human rights”.

According to OP8 (60/251), the UN General Assembly “[d]ecides that the membership in the Council shall be open to all States Members of the United Nations; when electing members of the Council, Member States shall take into account the contribution of candidates to the promotion and protection of human rights and their voluntary pledges and commitments made thereto; the General Assembly, by a two-thirds majority of the members present and voting, may suspend the rights of membership in the Council of a member of the Council that commits gross and systematic violations of human rights”.

What is the likely outcome of voting in UNGA?

To make a reasonable forecast, let’s cast an eye back on the two resolutions passed by the UNGA following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that began on February 24.

The first resolution on March 2 was approved by 141 member states. The second one on March 24, which focussed on the humanitarian aspect while condemning Russian acts, got 140 votes in favour. Both the resolutions had only five negative votes. The number of abstentions increased slightly from 35 to 38 between the two resolutions.

This means that it technically looks feasible for a resolution to sail through the UNGA that will suspend Russia from the Human Rights Council. However, the numbers belie the actual complexities.

A substantive part of the developing world, many of them part of the non-aligned movement (NAM) bloc, had supported the two resolutions that condemned Russia, but they will likely hesitate from taking a step that will punish Russia in concrete terms.

The International Crisis Group had also cautioned that the seeming international solidarity could crack open if the UK and EU officials don’t listen carefully to the rising anxieties of their Asian, Latin American and African counterparts over food security and development aid in the wake of the Ukraine war.

That’s a critical reason that the West had, till now, not pushed for a resolution to suspend Russia, a P5 country, from UNHRC. The devastating images from the Ukrainian town of Bucha, with civilian dead lying on the street, changed the calculations. The momentum of the worldwide outrage persuaded the West that there might be enough numbers to pass the resolution.

There are two likely scenarios. One is obviously, which the West hopes, is that there will be enough ‘yes’ votes for the resolution to be approved without any controversy.

The second one is messier.

According to the UNGA’s rules on the method of voting, the General assembly shall vote by replying “yes”, “no”, or “abstention” when the country’s name is called out in a roll-call. Usually, the voting is by show of hands or by standing, but a representative can request a roll-call. Therefore, according to Rule 87, abstentions are counted as a ‘vote’.

(a) The General Assembly shall normally vote by show of hands or by standing, but any representative may request a roll-call. The roll-call shall be taken in the English alphabetical order of the names of the members, beginning with the member whose name is drawn by lot by the President. The name of each member shall be called in any roll-call, and one of its representatives shall reply “yes”, “no” or “abstention”. The result of the voting shall be inserted in the record in the English alphabetical order of the names of the members.

But, Rule 86 muddies the water by stating that “present and voting” does not include abstentions.

For the purposes of these rules, the phrase “members present and voting” means members casting an affirmative or negative vote. Members who abstain from voting are considered as not voting.

It means that even if higher than the number of yes votes, abstentions will not be counted as ‘votes’ under Rule 86. This rule is undoubtedly likely to be invoked by Western countries if the number of ‘yes’ votes is less than required for two-thirds of the countries present at the General Assembly. Then the argument would be that the number of ‘yes’ votes is two-thirds of the total number of ‘affirmative’ and ‘negative’ votes.

Has any country been thrown out of Human Rights Council?

In March 2011, the UN General Assembly suspended Libya from the Human Rights Council using the provisions of resolution 60/251. Until now, it is the first and only time that a country was removed from the UNHRC.

The move began after the government of Moammar Qaddafi cracked down on anti-government protests as the Arab spring movement spread across the region.

On February 25, 2011, the UNHRC’s one-day special session passed a resolution that recommended that the General Assembly “consider the application of the measures foreseen in paragraph 8 of General Assembly resolution 60/251”, that is, suspend Libya from its membership of the Council.

Taking note of the UNHRC’s resolution, General Assembly suspended Libya from Council membership on March 1. A month after Qaddafi was killed, Libya’s suspension was lifted in November 2011.

The critical difference between the past and the current scenario is that both the resolutions at the UNHRC and UNGA suspending Libya were passed by consensus, that is, there was no voting. This was a result of the resolution being supported technically by Libya. The entire Libyan permanent missions in New York and Geneva had ‘defected’ and expressed support for the resolutions in both the UN bodies. Therefore, the Libya precedent cannot be applied to the latest move to throw out Russia in the wake of reported human rights violations during the Ukraine war.

What will be India’s position?

India has, so far, cast abstention votes at all the resolutions condemning Russia for invading Ukraine, passed in the UN General Assembly, UN Security Council and UN Human Rights Council.

At the UNSC meeting on April 5, India condemned the civilian killings in Bucha and called for an independent investigation. Indian official sources stressed that India’s call for a probe echoed the suggestion of UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres for an international investigation. In New Delhi, the statement was not perceived as a significant shift, especially since the statement did not name Russia as the perpetrator of the Bucha killings.

Unlike the previous resolutions on Ukraine, the move to throw out Russia from Human Rights Council is viewed by South Block officials to have repercussions that go beyond the current crisis.

India has a long-standing position that it does not support a specific resolution criticising a country for human rights violations. Therefore, it will undoubtedly be difficult to vote in favour of a resolution to throw out Russia from UNHRC. While it has a long-standing technical stance, India will take a call based on political considerations, just like other countries.

A negative vote by India will be challenging to explain to Western capitals, most of whom had been persuading New Delhi to not dilute the economic pressure on Moscow by increasing the purchase of Russian fuel.

At the end of previous UNGA votes on March 2 and March 24, Russia had commended countries who had voted against the resolution, as well as those who had abstained, for staving off US pressure. This time, Russia has made it clear that abstention or non-participation in the voting will be “seen as an unfriendly gesture” since the West is largely aiming to get two-thirds among the counted ‘yes’ and ‘no’ votes.

When the UNHRC recommended the suspension of Libya in 2011, there was no vote, but India did make a statement.

While India stated that it had taken note of the concerns of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights on violations, the statement also said that the Council should not take a “politicised decision”.

“The credibility and legitimacy of the Council will be enhanced when the council is seen to be dealing with similar situations in a similar manner, and not sacrificing concern for human rights at the altar of political expediency and strategic opportunism,” said India at UNHRC’s special session on February 25, 2011.",https://thewire.in/world/explainer-un-vote-russia-hrc-remove

Russia is only the second nation after Libya whose membership has been suspended

In a big blow to Russia, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) voted to suspend Moscow from the world organisation’s leading human rights body, the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC), over allegations that its soldiers in Ukraine engaged in rights violations.

US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield called the vote “a historic moment,” telling the assembly: “We have collectively sent a strong message that the suffering of victims and survivors will not be ignored” and that Russia must be held accountable “for this unprovoked, unjust, unconscionable war”, according to a report by the Associated Press.

What is the UNHRC?

First off, let’s understand the role of the world organisation’s leading human rights body and how it functions.

The UNHRC is defined as an inter-governmental body within the United Nations system, which is responsible for the promotion and protection of all human rights around the globe.

The Council also investigates allegations of breaches of human rights in United Nations member states and addresses thematic human rights issues.

The Council was established by the United Nations General Assembly on 15 March 2006to replace the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.

The UNHRC has 47 Member States, who serve for three years and are not eligible for immediate re-election after serving two consecutive terms.

Currently, Federico Villegas from Argentina is the president of the body. He was elected president of the Human Rights Council for 2022 in December 2021.

How is a country removed from UNHRC?

As per the rules, the UNGA can suspend the rights and privileges of any Council member that it decides has persistently committed gross and systematic violations of human rights during its term of membership.

To suspend a member, one needs a two-thirds majority vote by the General Assembly.

But, why was Russia suspended?

The resolution to suspend Russia was first moved by the United States over Moscow's military aggression in the east European nation.

The resolution titled ‘Suspension of the rights of membership of the Russian Federation in the Human Rights Council’. It expressed grave concern regarding reports of gross and systematic violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law committed by Russia during its aggression against Ukraine.

US Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield launched the campaign to suspend Russia from the UN Human Rights Council in the wake of videos and photos showing streets in the town of Bucha on the outskirts of the capital, Kyiv, strewn with the bodies of civilians after Russian soldiers retreated. The deaths have sparked global revulsion and calls for tougher sanctions on Russia, which has vehemently denied its troops were responsible.

How did the nations vote in the Russia case?

On Thursday, in the 193-member UNGA, 93 nations voted in favour of the resolution, while 24 were against it. Russia, China, Cuba, North Korea, Iran, Syria, Vietnam, were among those who voted against.

Fifty-eight, including India, abstained from the process.

India’s abstention from the vote has been in line with its neutral stance on the war, ever since it broke out 44 days ago.

India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti asserted that if it has “chosen” any side, it is the side of “peace and it is for an immediate end to violence”.

“India has abstained on the resolution with regard to suspension of the Russian Federation from the Human Rights Council adopted in the General Assembly today. We do so for reasons of both substance and process,” he said in the Explanation of Vote after the voting.

“Since the inception of the Ukrainian conflict, India has stood for peace, dialogue and diplomacy. We believe that no solution can be arrived at by shedding blood and at the cost of innocent lives. If India has chosen any side, it is the side of peace and it is for an immediate end to violence,” he added.

Since January this year, India has abstained on at least eight occasions on procedural votes and draft resolutions in the UN Security Council, the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council that deplored Russian aggression against Ukraine.

New Delhi had on Tuesday unequivocally condemned the deeply disturbing reports of civilian killings in the Ukrainian city of Bucha and supported the call for an independent investigation, as it underlined that when innocent human lives are at stake, diplomacy must prevail as the only viable option.

Tirumurti said India continues to remain deeply concerned at the worsening situation and reiterates its call for end to all hostilities. When innocent human lives are at stake, diplomacy must prevail as the only viable option, he said. He reiterated that recent reports of civilian killings in Bucha are deeply disturbing.

""We have unequivocally condemned these killings and support the call for an independent investigation,"" he said.

Has any other country been suspended?

Russia isn’t the only country that has been suspended from the UN Human Rights Council. In March 2011, the UN General Assembly suspended Libya from the Human Rights Council using the provisions of resolution 60/251. The move was in response to the crackdown on anti-government protests by the Moammar Gaddafi government.

How did countries react?

Ukraine's representative to the UN said the suspension of rights of membership of Russian Federation was not an option, but a duty.

The US welcomed the move, with President Joe Biden describing it as a meaningful step by the international community.

“This is a meaningful step by the international community further demonstrating how Putin's war has made Russia an international pariah, Biden said.

On Russia's suspension from UNHRC, US Secretary of State Tony Blinken, in a separate statement, said a wrong has been righted.

""Today a wrong has been righted. The world is sending another clear signal that Russia must immediately and unconditionally cease its war of aggression against Ukraine and honour the principles enshrined in the UN Charter,"" Blinken said after the UNGA suspended Russia from UNHRC.

Russia's deputy ambassador Gennady Kuzmin said after the vote that Russia had already withdrawn from the council before the assembly took action, apparently in expectation of the result. By withdrawing, council spokesman Rolando Gomez said Russia avoided being deprived of observer status at the rights body.

Kuzmin said Russia considers adoption of the resolution “an illegitimate and politically motivated step” by a group of countries with “short-term political and economic interests” that he accused of “blatant and massive violations of human rights.”

For the European Union (EU), the scale and gravity of Russia’s violations in Ukraine, and of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the country, call for a strong, united international response.

“The rare decision this Assembly has taken today sends a strong signal of accountability and hopefully will help preventing and discouraging more violations of human rights,” said Ambassador Olaf Skoog, head of the EU delegation.

How does this affect Russia?

Russia’s removal from the UNHRC is significant in symbolic terms. It shows that the West and its allies are against Moscow’s war of Ukraine and helps to isolate the country on a global stage.

As Biden and the European Union stated, the suspension gives a clear message to the Vladimir Putin-led country that its actions in Ukraine don’t have any merit.

The suspension is the latest in measures adopted by the West and its allies against Russia. A large number of sanctions, including against Vladimir Putin’s daughters, have already put Moscow on the backfoot.

Moreover, the EU on Thursday said it had approved an embargo on Russian coal and the closing of the bloc's ports to Russian vessels over the Ukraine war.

An official from the French presidency of the European Council said the moves spearhead a ""very substantial"" fifth round of sanctions against Moscow.
