After more than four weeks of conflict, Russia has failed to seize any major Ukrainian city and on Friday, Moscow signalled it was scaling back its military ambitions to focus on territory claimed by Russian-backed separatists in the east.

However, intense fighting was reported in a number of places on Saturday, suggesting there would be no swift let-up in the conflict, which has killed thousands of people, sent some 3.7 million abroad and driven more than half of Ukraine's children from their homes, according to the United Nations.

Russian troops seized the town of Slavutych, which is close to the border with Belarus and is where workers at the Chernobyl plant live, the governor of Kyiv region, Mr Oleksandr Pavlyuk, said.

Three people were killed, Interfax Ukraine news agency quoted the local mayor as saying.

""Slavutych has been under occupation since today. We steadfastly defended our city... three deaths have been confirmed so far,” Interfax quoted mayor Yuri Fomichev as saying in a Facebook post.

The report did not give details on the casualties.

Mr Pavlyuk said some residents had unfurled a large Ukrainian flag and shouted “Glory to Ukraine” in protest.

He also said the Russians fired into the air to disperse the pro-Ukraine protest in the centre of the town and had thrown stun grenades into the crowd.

He added that the soldiers had occupied the hospital.

Slavutych sits just outside the so-called exclusion zone around Chernobyl - which in 1986 was the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster - where Ukrainian staff have continued to work even after the plant itself was seized by Russian forces soon after the start of the Feb 24 invasion.

Presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said the town had become a new hot spot of the war. “The inhabitants are carrying out heroic civil resistance to the invader,” he said in a televised address, referring to Saturday’s protest.

On the other side of the country, in Mariupol, Mayor Vadym Boichenko said the situation in the encircled city remained critical, with street fighting taking place in the centre.

It was unclear how officials had arrived at that estimate. Russian advances in the southern port city have hindered efforts to find survivors in the rubble since the building was largely destroyed in the attack, which occurred on March 16.

The city, one of Ukraine’s largest, has also been cut off from water, electricity and communications during the fighting, although Ukrainian officials have said that about 130 people were rescued from the theater. Ukrainian officials have attributed the damage to a Russian strike.

Russia says its troops have cleared the urban area of the key city of Mariupol and only a small contingent of Ukrainian fighters remained inside a steel factory in the besieged southern port.

Russia’s claim to have all but taken control of Mariupol – the scene of the war’s heaviest fighting and worst humanitarian catastrophe – could not be independently verified.

It would be the first major city to have fallen to Russian forces since Moscow claimed to have total control of Kherson last month.

“The entire urban area of ​​Mariupol has been completely cleared … remnants of the Ukrainian group are currently completely blockaded on the territory of the Azovstal metallurgical plant,” said Igor Konashenkov, the Russian defence ministry’s chief spokesman.

“Their only chance to save their lives is to voluntarily lay down their arms and surrender.”

Konashenkov said 1,464 Ukrainian servicemen have already surrendered “in the course of liberation of Mariupol”.

The remaining fighters in Mariupol are blockaded in the Azovstal steelworks plant.

Russia’s defence ministry said if Ukrainian forces still fighting in Mariupol lay down their arms starting at 6am Moscow time (03:00 GMT) their lives will be spared.

“Taking into account the catastrophic situation that has developed at the Azovstal metallurgical plant, as well as being guided by purely humane principles, the Russian Armed Forces offer the militants of nationalist battalions and foreign mercenaries from 06:00 (Moscow time) on April 17, 2022, to stop any hostilities and lay down their arms,” the defence ministry said in a statement.

“All who lay down their arms are guaranteed that their lives will be spared.”

Under the terms of deal proposed by Russia on Saturday, the remaining defenders in the Azovstal plant would leave between 6 am and 1pm Moscow time, without weapons or ammunition.

The start of the surrender would be indicated by raising flags, the ministry said: “From the Russian side – red; from the Ukrainian side – white, around the whole perimeter of Azovstal.”

‘Absolutely hate them’

There was no immediate reaction from Kyiv to the offer.

“The situation is very difficult” in Mariupol, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the Ukrayinska Pravda news portal. “Our soldiers are blocked, the wounded are blocked. There is a humanitarian crisis … Nevertheless, the guys are defending themselves.”

Speaking in an online address, he accused Russia of trying to wipe out the city’s inhabitants but did not address Moscow’s claim of seizing Mariupol.

Zelenskyy threatened to withdraw from the continuing peace negotiations with Russia if Ukrainian fighters trapped in the port city are killed.

“What they are doing right now … could put a stop to any form of negotiation,” Zelenskyy said in an interview with a Ukrainian news website.

“There are troops there who absolutely hate them, and I don’t think they will let them live,” the Ukrainian leader said, referring to the fact many of the fighters in Mariupol are part of the far-right Azov Batallion.

In the key port city, journalists in Russian-held districts reached the steel factory, one of two metals plants where defenders have held out in underground tunnels and bunkers.

The factory was reduced to a ruin of twisted steel and blasted concrete, with no sign of defenders present. Several bodies of civilians lay scattered on nearby streets, including a woman in a pink parka and white shoes.

Someone had spray-painted “mined” on a fence by an obliterated filling station. In a rare sign of life, one red car drove slowly down an otherwise empty street, the word “children” scrawled on a card taped to the windshield.

‘23,367 irreplaceable losses’

Zelenskyy has said about 2,500-3,000 Ukrainian troops have been killed so far and as many as 20,000 Russian troops.

But Konashenkov gave a significantly higher death toll on Saturday.

“As of 16 April, the Ukrainian contingent’s casualties in Mariupol alone amounted to over 4,000 people … The Russian defence ministry possesses credible data on real losses suffered by the Ukrainian army, national guard, and foreign mercenaries, which Zelenskyy is afraid of voicing to the people of Ukraine.

“As of today, the irreplaceable losses amount to 23,367 people.”

A month and a half into President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, Russia is trying to capture territory in the south and east after withdrawing from the north following an assault on Kyiv that was repelled at the capital’s outskirts.

Russian troops that pulled out of the north left behind towns littered with bodies of civilians.

Putin appears determined to capture more Donbas territory to claim victory in a war that has left Russia subject to increasingly punitive Western sanctions and with few allies.

Zelenskyy told Ukrainian reporters the world should prepare “in a number of ways” for the possibility Russia might use nuclear weapons. He did not give evidence for the assertion.

Last month, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia would resort to nuclear weapons only in the case of a “threat to the existence” of the country – and not as a result of the Ukraine conflict.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/4/16/mariupol-entirely-taken-russia-says-urging-ukraine-surrender

More than six weeks after the Russian siege began, Ukrainian troops are continuing to fight the vastly superior Russian forces in ferocious battles amid the ruins of what once was a bustling city on the Sea of Azov coast.

WATCH: Russian forces enter Mariupol as outgunned Ukrainians prepare for renewed assault

The city’s mayor says that an estimated 120,000 people remain in the city, of Mariupol’s pre-war population of about 450,000.

The Ukrainians’ fight against all odds has scuttled Moscow’s designs, tying up significant Russian forces and delaying the start of a planned Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine’s industrial heartland, Donbas. The Kremlin hopes that an attack in the east could reverse the battlefield fortunes for Russia after a humiliating failure of its attempt to quickly storm the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv.

Mariupol has been a key objective for Russia since the start of its invasion on Feb. 24. Capturing the city would allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula that Russia annexed in 2014 and deprive Ukraine of a major port and prized industrial assets.

The giant Azovstal steel mill and other industrial plants have been heavily damaged by the ferocious Russian bombardment that has flattened much of Mariupol, indiscriminately hitting homes, hospitals and other public buildings and killing thousands.

The victims include about 300 people killed in last month’s Russian airstrike on the Mariupol Drama Theater that was being used as a shelter and had the word “CHILDREN” printed in Russian in huge white letters on the pavement outside to ward off aerial attack.

Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko told The Associated Press that at least 21,000 people were killed in Mariupol with bodies “carpeted through the streets.” He said that the Russians deployed mobile cremation equipment to Mariupol to methodically dispose of the victims’ bodies in order to hide the evidence of the massacre and prevent international organizations from documenting “the horror the Russian army is responsible for.”

The discovery of hundreds of bodies of civilians apparently executed by Russian forces in Kyiv’s suburbs after the Russian retreat from the area has fueled global outrage and accusations from Ukrainians and the West that Russia is committing war crimes in Ukraine.

Moscow has deployed fighters from Chechnya, known for their ferocity, to wage street battles in Mariupol. Chechnya’s Moscow-backed leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, has repeatedly boasted on his messaging app channel about defeating Ukrainians in Mariupol, but the fight has continued.

Boychenko said that several Ukrainian units are still fighting the Russians in Mariupol, including the 36th Marine Brigade, the Azov Regiment, some Interior Ministry troops and border guards.

The Azov Regiment, a seasoned volunteer force that is widely considered one of the country’s most capable units, is defending the mammoth Azovstal steel plant that covers an area of nearly 11 square kilometers (over 4.2 square miles). It has taken advantage of the plant’s sprawling network of concrete buildings and underground facilities to repel continuous Russian attacks.

The 36th Marine Brigade was maintaining defensive positions at the Azovmash and Zavod Ilyicha factories until it ran out of supplies and ammunition and made a desperate attempt to break through the Russian blockade earlier this week.

In a post on the brigade’s Facebook page, one of its officers described the unit’s heroic resistance, saying that “for more than a month, the marines have been fighting without replenishing amunition, food and water supplies.” “The wounded accounted for nearly a half of the brigade’s strength, but those who still had their limbs and were capable of walking reported back to duty,” the post said.

Boychenko said that some of the marines managed to join the Azov regiment, while others were captured by the Russians. He didn’t give any numbers.

The Russian military said Thursday that a total of 1,160 Ukrainian marines surrendered this week, a claim that couldn’t be independently verified.

As the Ukrainian troops continue to offer fierce resistance in Mariupol, fears have grown that the exasperated Russians could resort to chemical weapons to deal with the remaining pockets of resistance at the Azovstal plant and other areas of the city.

Eduard Basurin, a Russia-allied separatist official in eastern Ukraine, appeared to call for that Monday, telling Russian state TV that the Russia-backed forces should block all the exits out of the factory and then “use chemical troops to smoke them out of there.” He later said that no chemical weapons were used.

WATCH: What the Biden administration learned from past presidents about military aid in Ukraine

The Azov Regiment claimed Monday, without providing evidence, that a drone had dropped a poisonous substance on its positions but inflicted no serious injuries. A Ukrainian defense official said the attack possibly involved phosphorus munitions.

Ukrainian authorities have said that the Russians have blocked humanitarian convoys from reaching Mariupol, keeping it without food, water and power since the siege started. The Russian troops have turned back buses sent to evacuate residents, but about 150,000 have been able to flee the city in their own vehicles.

Boychenko said that at least 33,500, and, possibly, up to 50,000 Mariupol residents have been taken to “filtration camps” in the separatist-controlled east before being forcibly sent to distant, economically depressed areas in Russia.

Mariupol has seen communications cut since the start of the siege, and as the Russians moved to capture sections of the city they launched radio broadcasts to brainwash the population.

“They unleashed propaganda, telling people that Kyiv and other cities have been captured and they have been abandoned,” Boychenko said.

The continuing fighting in Mariupol has forced the Russian military to keep a significant number of troops in the city, delaying the start of the planned new offensive in eastern Ukraine.

“As long as the street fighting is going on, Russia can’t remove troops from Mariupol and deploy them to other areas, including Donbas,” Oleh Zhdanov, an independent military expert, told the AP.

“The Ukrainian troops in Mariupol are still fulfilling their main task by diverting the Russian forces from other areas. Mariupol remains a major symbol of the Ukrainian resistance.”",https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/mariupol-holds-out-against-russias-siege-a-symbol-of-ukrainian-resistance

The horror inflicted on civilians sheltering inside a Mariupol theatre that was bombed by Russian jets last week has been laid bare as the first footage from inside the destroyed building emerged today.

Never-before-seen video shows injured civilians covered with dust filing out of the Donetsk Regional Drama Theatre after it was near-totally destroyed in Russian bombs aimed at building on March 16 despite a large inscription saying 'children' being clearly visible on the pavement outside.

It came as city councillors said accounts they had been given from survivors of the bombing suggested that at least 300 people had died in the attack. If confirmed, it would mark the single largest losses of innocent life during the month-long war to date.

'From eyewitnesses, information is emerging that about 300 people died in the Drama Theatre of Mariupol following strikes by a Russian aircraft,' Mariupol city hall wrote on Telegram.

'I do not want to believe in this horror. Until the last moment I want to believe that everyone managed to escape. But the words of those who were inside the building at the time of this terrorist act say the opposite,' officials said.

Petr Andryuschenko, advisor to deputy mayor of Mariupol, said in a separate interview with the BBC that 600 people had been sheltering in the theatre at the time it was struck and that the 300 who are now presumed dead were in a bomb shelter underneath it which got buried in the rubble.

The exact death toll is still uncertain because rescuers have not yet been able to get into the shelter because Russia continues shelling the area. However, it is presumed that all those inside have now died.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said last week following the strike that hundreds of people, believed mostly to be women and children, had taken in the building at the time of the attack.

The leader of Russia's southern republic of Chechnya said Thursday that forces from his region had taken control of Mariupol city hall and hoisted the Russian flag.

Mariupol has been the scene of some of the worst devastation of the war, which has seen Russia relentlessly besiege and pummel Ukraine's cities.

The misery inside them is such that nearly anyone who can is trying to leave and those left behind face desperate food shortages in a country once known as the breadbasket for the world.

In the shelled city of Kharkiv, mostly elderly women came to collect food and other urgent supplies. In the capital of Kyiv, ashes of the dead are piling up at the main crematorium because so many relatives have left, leaving urns unclaimed.

For civilians unable to join the flood of refugees from Ukraine, the days of plenty in the country are becoming just a fading memory, as the war grinds into a second month.

With Ukrainian soldiers battling Russia's invasion force to a near stalemate in many places and the president urging people to remain steadfast, the U.S. and the European Union announced a move to further squeeze Russia: a new partnership to reduce Europe's reliance on Russian energy and slowly squeeze off the billions of dollars the Kremlin gets from sales of fossil fuels.

In Ukraine, the war for hungry civilians is increasingly being counted in precious portions of food, and block of cheese now goes a very long way.

Fidgeting with anticipation, a young girl in Kharkiv watched intently this week as a volunteer's knife cut through a giant slab of cheese, carving out thick slices - one for each hungry person waiting stoically in line.

Hanna Spitsyna took charge of divvying up the delivery of food aid from the Ukrainian Red Cross, handing it out to her neighbors. Each got a lump of the cheese that was cut under the child's watchful gaze, dropped chunk by chunk into plastic bags that people in line held open like hungry mouths.

UN identifies mass grave in besieged city of Mariupol The United Nations said today it was looking into reports of mass graves inside Mariupol, including one with at least 200 corpses. The head of the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, Matilda Bogner, said her investigative team was working to determine the full scale of civilian casualties. 'One mass grave we've been able to get satellite information on, and we estimate that one of those mass graves holds about 200 people,' she said. However, 'that does not mean all those people are civilian casualties', she added. The UN's figures do not include the deaths of military personnel, or those who have died from other causes during a war. Bogner noted that council leaders in Mariupol have estimated more than 2,000 civilian deaths in the city following Russia's military invasion on Feb. 24. Overall, the rights office has counted at least 1,035 civilians killed in Ukraine and 1,650 injured but Bogner said it doesn't have a 'the full picture of locations that have seen intense fighting, in particular Mariupol and Volnovakha.' The office has acknowledged that its tally is likely to underestimate the actual toll. She went on to say that the Mission's strict methodology in counting casualties in Ukraine's conflict has yielded 'very few' confirmed casualties in Mariupol, largely because of difficulties getting access in and information out of the besieged port city. The cities of Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy in the east have also endured devastating bombardment. Chernihiv was effectively surrounded by Russian forces, its governor said. In Kharkiv, officials said six people had been killed by the shelling of an aid distribution site. Video showed a blast striking a car park where scores of people were queuing. Reuters was able to confirm it was filmed outside a supermarket in Kharkiv. Advertisement

'They brought us aid, brought us aid for the elderly women that stayed here,' Spitsyna said. 'All these people need diapers, swaddle blankets and food.'

Unable to sweep with lightning-quick speed into Kyiv, their apparent aim on Feb. 24 when the Kremlin launched the war, Russian forces are instead raining down shells and missiles on cities from afar.

The outskirts of Kharkiv were shrouded by foggy smoke Friday, with shelling constant since early in the morning. In a city hospital, several wounded soldiers arrived, with bullet and shrapnel wounds, a day after doctors treated a dozen civilians. Even as doctors stabilized the direst case, the sound of shelling could be heard in the surgery ward.

Russia's military claimed Friday that it destroyed a massive Ukrainian fuel base used to supply the Kyiv region's defenses, with ships firing a salvo of cruise missiles, according to the Interfax news agency. Videos on social media showed an enormous fireball explosion near the capital.

For civilians, the misery has become unrelenting. Kyiv, like other cities, has seen its population dramatically reduced in the vast refugee crisis that has seen more than 10 million displaced and at least 3.5 million fleeing the country entirely. In the capital, over 260 civilians have died and more than 80 buildings been destroyed since the start of the war.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged his country to keep up its military defense and not stop 'even for a minute.' Zelenskyy used his nightly video address on Thursday to rally Ukrainians to 'move toward peace, move forward.'

'With every day of our defense, we are getting closer to the peace that we need so much. . We can't stop even for a minute, for every minute determines our fate, our future, whether we will live.' He said thousands of people, including 128 children, died in the first month of the war. Across the country, 230 schools and 155 kindergartens have been destroyed. Cities and villages 'lie in ashes,' he said.

At an emergency NATO summit in Brussels Thursday, Zelenskyy pleaded with the Western allies via video for planes, tanks, rockets, air defense systems and other weapons, saying his country is 'defending our common values.'

In a video address to EU leaders, meanwhile, Zelenskyy thanked them for working together to support Ukraine and impose sanctions on Russia, including Germany's decision to block Russia from delivering natural gas to Europe through the new Nord Stream 2 pipeline. But he lamented that these steps were not taken earlier, saying there was a chance Russia would have thought twice about invading.

While millions of Ukrainians have fled west, Ukraine accused Moscow of forcibly removing hundreds of thousands of civilians from shattered cities to Russia to pressure Kyiv to give up. Lyudmyla Denisova, Ukraine's ombudsperson, said 402,000 people, including 84,000 children, had been taken against their will into Russia, where some may be used as 'hostages' to pressure Kyiv to surrender.

The Kremlin gave nearly identical numbers for those who have been relocated, but said they were from predominantly Russian-speaking regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine and wanted to go to Russia. Pro-Moscow separatists have been fighting for control for nearly eight years in those regions, where many people have supported close ties to Russia.

In Chernihiv, where an airstrike this week destroyed a crucial bridge, a city official, Olexander Lomako, said a 'humanitarian catastrophe' is unfolding as Russian forces target food storage places. He said about 130,000 people are left in the besieged city, about half its prewar population.

Russia said it will offer safe passage starting Friday to 67 ships from 15 foreign countries that are stranded in Ukrainian ports because of the danger of shelling and mines.

Russian forces fired two missiles late Thursday at a Ukrainian military unit on the outskirts of Dnipro, the fourth-largest city in the country, the regional emergency services said. The strikes destroyed buildings and set off two fires, it said. The number of dead and wounded was unclear.

With the U.S. and others expanding sanctions on Russia, Moscow sent a signal that the measures have not brought it to its knees, reopening its stock market but only allowing limited trading to prevent mass sell-offs. Foreigners were barred from selling, and traders were prohibited from short selling, or betting prices would fall.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said it has been told by Ukrainian authorities that Russian shelling is preventing worker rotations in and out of the Chernobyl nuclear plant. It said Russian forces have shelled Ukrainian checkpoints in the city of Slavutych, home to many Chernobyl nuclear workers, 'putting them at risk and preventing further rotation of personnel to and from the site.'

Meanwhile, Kyiv and Moscow gave conflicting accounts about the people being relocated to Russia and whether they were going willingly - as Russia claimed - or were being coerced or lied to.

Russian Col. Gen. Mikhail Mizintsev said the roughly 400,000 people evacuated to Russia were being provided with accommodations and payments and had voluntarily left eastern Ukraine.

But Donetsk Region Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko said that 'people are being forcibly moved into the territory of the aggressor state.'

Among those taken, Ukraine's Foreign Ministry charged, were 6,000 residents of Mariupol, the devastated port city in the country's east.

Kyrylenko said that Mariupol's residents have been long deprived of information and that the Russians feed them false claims about Ukraine's defeats to persuade them to move to Russia.

Capture of the port city will give Russia a land route to connect Crimea with the separatist-held regions of Donbass. It will also boost the morale of Putin’s troops, who are facing unexpected resistance.

As the Russian attacks on Ukraine enter the second month, the eastern port city of Mariupol has emerged as the centrepiece in this theatre of heavy clashes—a besieged landscape reduced to rubble by continuous airstrikes over the past few weeks.

Street fighting continues between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian forces and volunteers in Mariupol where thousands of civilians are believed to be trapped inside bombed buildings.

""There is nothing left there,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told Italy's parliament about Mariupol in a video address.

Almost 80 percent of the city’s infrastructure has been reportedly destroyed and some of the damages are beyond repair.

Russian blockade and heavy bombardments have led to a dire humanitarian crisis in the city as people suffer from a lack of water, food, power and heat.

""The city is under continuous bombing, from 50 bombs to 100 bombs Russian aircraft drops each day... A lot of death, a lot of crying, a lot of awful war crimes,"" Mariupol Deputy Mayor Sergei Orlov told CNN.

The number of deaths remains unaccounted.

But why is Mariupol the main target of Russia?

Geostrategic importance

Despite being a tiny area on the map, Mariupol is located between the Crimean Peninsula, annexed by Russia in 2014, and the Donbass region where Russian-backed separatists’ self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics lie in southeastern Ukraine.

""Taking control of the highway from Crimea to Mariupol... will reliably connect the peninsula with Donbas by a transport corridor,"" said Kirill Stepanov, a government adviser for Russia's Southern Federal District.

Turkish security expert Abdullah Agar told TRT World that Mariupol is vital for Russia during this time and for the future.

Agar said Crimea would be connected to Russia by a land route if Mariupol falls.

Being a coastal city on the Sea of Azov, “it is very important for Russia in terms of supply and logistic advantages feeding its army,” Agar said.

In 2014, Russian-backed separatists entered Mariupol but they were pushed back by Ukrainian troops after heavy fighting.

Then President Petro Poroshenko declared the port city as the temporary capital of Donbass, replacing Donetsk city where rebels are largely in control.

Agar said that Ukrainians are now engaged in a very effective urban warfare and the city has become the symbol of resistance against Russians.

Economy and maritime

Mariupol is home to one of the largest ports of Ukraine and a metallurgical centre for iron and steelworks. Heavy machinery manufacturing and ship repairs are carried out in this industrial zone.

The headquarters of the country’s largest steel plant, Metinvest, is also located in Mariupol. The multi-national metallurgical group’s Azovstal plant was heavily damaged by Russian shelling.

Despite Russia's tight inspections in Kerch Strait since 2014, almost a fifth of Ukraine’s ferrous metals are exported by sea from Mariupol.

“Mariupol’s destruction is a strong blow to the economy of Ukraine,” Andrii Ianitskyi, the head of the Centre for Excellence in Economic Journalism at the Kiev School of Economics, told TRT World.

If Mariupol falls, control of the Sea of Azov will completely change hands and Russia will be able to cut off Ukraine’s maritime trade.

According to British military intelligence, the fall of Mariupol will boost morale of Russian forces.

Symbolism and propaganda

Russian President Vladimir Putin, who as a young man served as a Soviet intelligence agent in then-Communist East Germany, said eight years ago that under tsarist rule, large parts of eastern Ukraine—including the cities of Mariupol, Odessa, Kharkiv, Kherson, Donetsk and Luhansk—were once part of Russia.

He described those areas using the historical term “Novorossiya” - which literally translates as “New Russia”. It has fallen out of common usage.

The city has been a base of the Azov Battalion. This neo-Nazi former paramilitary group is now a unit of the National Guard of Ukraine, which the Kremlin cites to justify its attacks as “de-Nazification”.

Ianitskyi said: “Russian propaganda has demonised the Azov Battalion to justify the brutality of Russian soldiers.”

But, “their real goal is first the fall of Ukraine, and then Europe. Mariupol for Russia is a small episode in a big geopolitical game” he added.

Asked if Russians will capture Mariupol, Ianitskyi said Ukrainians react to military failures only with even “greater exertion of forces”.

“I am sure that no one will lay down their hands if Mariupol is occupied,” Ianitskyi said.

TRT World spoke to Professor Andrey Makarychev from the University of Tartu’s Regional Political Studies in Estonia, who underlined that Russia has already destroyed the entire city of Mariupol, and dropped a powerful bomb over the local theatre where 1,500 people were hiding, and killed hundreds of urban residents.

“For Ukraine Mariupol has become an analogue of Srebrenica, a symbol of animality of the aggressor, which will keep boosting the spirit of resistance all across Ukraine,” Makarychev said.

The US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan called the Russian operation a “failure”.

""Russia intended to accomplish three basic objectives in launching its unprovoked attacks against Ukraine — first, to subjugate Ukraine. Second, to enhance Russian power and prestige. And third, to divide and weaken the West,"" Sullivan said.

""Russia has thus far manifestly failed to accomplish all three objectives. In fact, it has thus far achieved the opposite,"" he add
