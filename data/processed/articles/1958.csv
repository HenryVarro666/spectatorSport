Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country’s forces had defeated Russian troops and recaptured Irpin, a town on the northwestern edge of Kyiv that has seen fierce street battles. But he warned that the struggle for the capital was not over.

“Our defenders are advancing in the Kyiv region, regaining control over Ukrainian territory,” Zelensky said Monday night. “Irpin was liberated. Well done! ... However, it is too early to talk about security in this part of our region.”

Russian troops continued to control the region north of Kyiv and had significant resources and manpower, Zelensky said, even if Ukraine’s forces had destroyed or forced them to abandon a large amount of equipment.

“The situation everywhere remains tense,” Zelensky said. “This is a ruthless war against our nation, against our people, against our children.”

Ukraine’s deputy defense minister, Hanna Maliar, warned that Russia was still trying to build a corridor around Kyiv to block supply routes that bring in arms, ammunition and food.

“We must speak honestly: The enemy is not letting up attempts to seize Kyiv after all,” Maliar said on Ukrainian television. “Taking Kyiv essentially means taking Ukraine. So that is their goal.”

As Russian and Ukrainian officials assembled in Turkey for a fresh round of negotiations set to begin Tuesday, Zelensky said his nation was ready to declare its neutrality, one of Russia’s core demands.

But even as Zelensky signaled he was willing to let go of aspirations to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization — a key concession considering pursuit of membership is enshrined in the country’s constitution — he stressed that any deal must be voted on by Ukrainians in a national referendum held without Russian troops in Ukraine.

In a separate video address ahead of negotiations, to be held in person in Istanbul, Zelensky said his nation was seeking peace and “the restoration of normal life.”

After four prior rounds of negotiations — the last one via video — the path to peace or even a cease-fire was unclear in a war that has killed more than 1,150 civilians, displaced millions of Ukrainians and made Russia an international pariah.

Ukrainian presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak, who has been part of negotiations and spoken optimistically about them, struck a more somber tone Monday.

“Again, total missile strikes at Ukraine. Lutsk, Kharkiv, Zhytomyr, Rivne. Every day, more and more rockets. Mariupol under carpet bombing,” he tweeted. “Russia no longer has a language, humanism, civilization. Only rockets, bombs and attempts to wipe Ukraine off the face of the earth. Does Europe really like it?”

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that, from Moscow’s point of view at least, “no significant progress” had been made in peace talks thus far. He said in-person talks would allow the two sides to move forward “in a more concentrated way.”

President Biden, questioned at the White House about his comment over the weekend that Russian President Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power,” said he was speaking in a personal capacity, not articulating any official change in U.S. policy.

“I’m not walking anything back,” he said. “I was expressing the moral outrage that I felt toward this man. I wasn’t then, nor am I now, articulating a policy change.”

In a news briefing, Peskov said that Biden’s statement “makes us worry” and that Russian officials would continue to closely monitor the U.S. president’s statements.

Biden, who criticized President Trump’s careless rhetoric during the 2020 campaign and argued that the words of a president matter, bristled at the “ridiculous” suggestion that his own comment in Warsaw could be seen as a statement of policy given how careful his administration has been to avoid a direct confrontation with Putin.

“Nobody believes I was talking about taking down [Putin],” he said. “The last thing I want to do is engage in a land war, a nuclear war with Russia.”

In the last week, U.S. and British intelligence have said that Russia has scaled back its forces on the outskirts of Kyiv in the face of fierce fighting from Ukrainian defenses.

“Russian forces have not only ceased to make any advances toward the city, but ... are making really no efforts on the ground to advance on the city,” a senior U.S. Defense official said Monday.

The British Ministry of Defense said in a daily report Monday that logistical shortages have been compounded by a continued lack of momentum and low morale among the Russian military.

Still, the Kyiv regional military administration said Monday that the western suburbs of Bucha, Irpin, Hostomel and Makariv had been pounded by constant attacks from Russian forces, with multiple shellings of housing estates and social infrastructure over the last 24 hours.

The mayor of Irpin said Monday that Ukrainians had defeated Russian troops. “Our Irpin has been liberated from Moscow’s evil!!!” Mayor Oleksandr Markushyn posted on Telegram. “Glory to Ukraine! Glory to her defenders!”

He also urged residents not to return, noting that the situation was still dangerous with shelling and mines.

“We understand that there will be more attacks on our town and we will defend it courageously,” he said.

Analysts at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War assessed in a report Monday that the Kremlin had not redeployed Russian combat power away from Kyiv to support operations in eastern Ukraine. At the same time, Russian conscription efforts, which Ukrainian intelligence expects to begin Friday, are unlikely to provide enough combat power to relaunch major offensive operations any time soon.

“Russia’s pool of available well-trained replacements remains low and new conscripts will require months to reach even a minimum standard of readiness,” the report said.

In the south and east, British intelligence said Russia had gained ground as it continued its all-out assault and attempt to capture the strategic southern port of Mariupol. Conquering the city would help Russian forces establish a corridor across Ukraine’s south to the Crimean peninsula, which Moscow annexed in 2014 but which has no land connection to Russia.

In an interview with independent Russian journalists Sunday, Zelensky singled out the city as the site of some of the most horrific consequences of Russia’s invasion. Still under Ukrainian control, it has seen the majority of its 430,000 residents flee while those who remain struggle to find food and water in neighborhoods of rubble. How much longer the city can continue to hold out against relentless shelling and lack of humanitarian relief is increasingly open to question.

Mariupol is “littered with corpses — no one is removing them — Russian soldiers and Ukrainian citizens,” Zelensky said in the interview. It was conducted in Russian with three journalists based outside Russia and one in Moscow.

He also held out the possibility of neutrality for Ukraine, a concession he has previously broached but addressed more emphatically this time.

“Security guarantees and neutrality, non-nuclear status of our state — we are ready to go for it. This is the most important point,” Zelensky said, adding that the neutrality move would require a national referendum. He said negotiators would refuse Russian demands for the demilitarization and “de-Nazification” of Ukraine, ideas Zelensky called “incomprehensible.”

The Kremlin, which has banned media in Russia from describing its invasion as a “war,” warned news outlets not to publish Zelensky’s remarks.

Putin’s stranglehold of Russian news outlets tightened Monday as the nation’s last major independent newspaper critical of the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine announced it was suspending publication after receiving a second warning from government censors.

The Novaya Gazeta, whose editor in chief, Dmitry Muratov, was awarded the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize for his “efforts to safeguard freedom of expression,” said that it would cease publishing in print and online until the end of the “special operation in Ukraine.”

Amid the ongoing stalemate, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Monday that there would be no safe passage via negotiated humanitarian corridors for civilians seeking to flee battered cities.

Vereshchuk, who typically announces evacuation routes daily, blamed Russian “provocations” for the closing of safe corridors. Ukraine has accused Russia of blocking routes and abducting humanitarian volunteers, including members of the Red Cross.

In total, the war has created 3.8 million Ukrainian refugees and displaced millions more internally since Russia launched its invasion Feb. 24.

Russian forces have since been stuck outside Kyiv, without a single breakthrough in penetrating the heart of the capital. But they have kept up a steady assault by air, with more explosions reported on the city’s outskirts Monday morning and air-raid sirens sounding in the afternoon. It was unknown if missiles hit targets or if they were intercepted by Ukrainian forces.

In a sign of the city’s struggle to prevail, schools in Kyiv reopened Monday for online instruction but with what municipal official Valentyn Mondryivsky said was a new goal of providing kids with “psychological support” amid the war. Mondryivsky said homework was being limited in order to avoid putting additional stress upon students.

In the northeast, local officials said Ukraine had regained control of the towns of Trostyanets and Boromlya. The towns are about 35 miles south of the city of Sumy, which has been surrounded and shelled by Russian troops.

In hard-hit Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said Monday that 1,410 structures, the vast majority of them residential buildings, had been destroyed in the war.

Loud booms were heard overnight. Attacks appeared to target Kharkiv’s outskirts.

Terekhov said one-third of Kharkiv’s prewar population of 1.5 million had left. Many more remain huddled in subway stations that have become bomb shelters.

Most evacuees around the country make their way to western Ukraine, which has suffered less violence than the south and east. Many eventually land here in Lviv before crossing the western border into Poland.

The Lviv area has been largely free from Russian assault, despite near-daily air-raid alarms, frequent funerals for soldiers and military checkpoints on roads leading to and from the city.

But it hasn’t been fully out of the crosshairs. Russian missiles have targeted western Ukraine four times since March 13, hitting military or fuel depots, including a strike on fuel tanks Saturday that was the closest attack to Lviv since the war began. Fires raged at the site for more than 14 hours before being extinguished. Authorities reported no fatalities and a handful of minor injuries.

World & Nation Full coverage of the war in Ukraine Russia’s war in Ukraine is causing a European refugee crisis on a scale not seen since World War II and raising fears of a return to Cold War-era dynamics.

On Monday, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres announced that the United Nations had asked Martin Griffiths, its undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, to immediately explore with Ukrainian and Russian authorities “possible agreements and arrangements for a humanitarian cease-fire.”

“A cessation of hostilities will allow essential humanitarian aid to be delivered and enable civilians to move around safely,” Guterres said at a news conference outside the Security Council in New York. “It will save lives, prevent suffering and protect civilians.”

The mayor of the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol said Monday his city was ""in the hands of the occupiers"" after a weekslong siege by Russian forces that flattened the city, left an unknown number of civilians dead and forced hundreds of thousands of people from their homes.

""Not everything is in our power,"" said Vadym Boichenko, the pro-government mayor of Mariupol, in a live television interview. ""Unfortunately, we are in the hands of hands of the occupiers today.""

Boichenko called for a ""complete evacuation"" of the remaining population of Mariupol, which had a population of over 400,000 before Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.

""According to our estimates, about 160,000 people are in the besieged city of Mariupol today, where it is impossible to live because there is no water, no electricity, no heat, no connection,"" he said. ""And it's really scary.""

It was unclear if there was still active fighting inside the city.

Ukrainian officials have alleged that Russian forces have prevented humanitarian convoys from safely approaching or exiting the city. A pro-Russian separatist leader on Sunday said about 1,700 Mariupol residents were being ""evacuated"" daily from the city and its surroundings, but Ukrainian officials say the Russians have in fact been carrying out what they describe as the forcible deportation of thousands to Russia.

“We need a complete evacuation from Mariupol,"" Boichenko said. ""Our most important mission today is to save every life... And there are hopes that we will succeed. For example, there are 26 buses that have to go to Mariupol to evacuate, but unfortunately, they haven't received permission to move. And this game is played every day. A cynical game like, 'Yes, we are ready. You can drive there,' but in fact it does not work. Our heroic drivers under the fire are trying to reach the places where Mariupol residents can be picked up, and they are waiting with the hope that they will have such an opportunity. But the Russian Federation has been playing with us since day one.""

Statistics released by Ukrainian officials on Sunday paint a grim picture of the result of weeks of shelling and urban combat in Mariupol.

According to those figures, 90% of residential buildings in the city were damaged, of which 60% were hit directly and 40% were destroyed.

Seven of the city's hospitals — 90% of the city's hospital capacity — were damaged, of which three were destroyed. Also damaged were three maternity hospitals (with one destroyed), seven institutes of higher education (with three destroyed), and 57 schools and 70 kindergartens, with 23 and 28 destroyed, respectively.

A number of factories were damaged and the city's port sustained damage.

According to those official statistics, up to 140,000 people left the city before it was surrounded, and around 150,000 managed to leave during the blockade. During the height of the siege, around 170,000 people remained in the city, and Ukrainian officials claim 30,000 people from Mariupol were deported to Russia.",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-28-22/h_f62ca209205442fdc3a392226a1df3e1

Russian forces continued missile strikes across Ukraine Sunday evening, including the cities of Lutsk, Kharkiv, Zhytomyr and Rivne, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said, while shelling has been reported around the outskirts of Kyiv.

Meanwhile, Zelensky said he is ready to accept a neutral, non-nuclear status as part of a peace deal with Russia.

Here are the latest developments:

Russian forces attempting 'corridor' around Kyiv, officials say: Ukraine's deputy defense minister said Monday that Russian forces were attempting to establish a ""corridor"" around the Ukrainian capital to block supply routes, amid continued fighting around Kyiv's suburbs.

Russian strikes continue: Ukrainian presidential adviser Mikhail Podoliak said the cities of Lutsk, Kharkiv, Zhytomyr and Rivne were among the locations hit by Russian missiles on Sunday. ""More and more missiles every day. Mariupol under the 'carpet' bombing,"" he said. ""Russia no longer has a language, humanism, civilization. Only missiles, bombs and attempts to wipe Ukraine off the face of the earth."" A loud explosion followed by sirens were also heard in Kyiv early Monday, according to CNN teams on the ground.

Most Russian gains in Mariupol area are in the south: Most of Russia’s military gains near the port city of Mariupol are in the southern areas, according to the UK’s latest intelligence update. Further to its report, the UK's Ministry of Defence said there was ""no significant change to Russian Forces dispositions in occupied Ukraine.""

Kremlin concerned by Biden's remarks: The Kremlin is concerned by US President Joe Biden’s comments about Russian President Vladimir Putin, spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday, adding that Biden's comments would continue to be monitored. Biden said on Saturday that Putin ""cannot remain in power."" Biden and White House officials later sought to walk back and clarify the President's comments, adding that he was not calling for regime change in Russia.

Peace talks will resume Tuesday: Russia-Ukraine negotiations are set to resume in-person in Istanbul, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Monday. Zelensky said in a video posted to social media that peace and the restoration of normal life are the ""obvious"" goals of Ukraine. ""Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity are beyond doubt. Effective security guarantees for our state are mandatory,"" he said. Zelensky also told journalists Sunday that a neutral, non-nuclear status for Ukraine in the form of a ""serious treaty"" was acceptable as part of a deal with Russia, but any agreement would have to be put to a referendum.

Ukraine promises ""immediate investigation"" after video surfaces: An almost six-minute-long video shows what appear to be Ukrainian soldiers shooting men who are apparently Russian prisoners in the knees during an operation in the Kharkiv region. Asked about the video, a senior presidential advisor, Oleksiy Arestovych, said: ""The government is taking this very seriously, and there will be an immediate investigation. We are a European army, and we do not mock our prisoners. If this turns out to be real, this is absolutely unacceptable behavior."" CNN is not showing the video.

Putin eyeing ""Korean scenario"": Ukraine’s military intelligence head said Putin could be looking to carve Ukraine in two – like North and South Korea. Brig. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov said Russia’s operations around Kyiv had failed and it was now impossible for the Russian army to overthrow the Ukrainian government. Putin’s war was now focused on the south and the east of the country, he said. ""[Russian forces] will try to impose a dividing line between the unoccupied and occupied regions of our country. In fact, it is an attempt to create North and South Korea in Ukraine,"" he said.",https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-28-22/h_7ca190d6024566b865877e4e6c198eaa

Today, March 28, Russia's military attack on Ukraine has been going on for thirty-three days. We're reporting on all the current news. The article will be constantly updated.

Key points?

Головне.

17,000 Russian servicemen have already been killed in Ukraine!

During the week, Allied forces repulsed 63 enemy attacks

Thanks to the skillful actions and skill of the servicemen of the Joint Forces, 5 enemy attacks have been successfully repulsed so far, according to the Joint Forces Operation.

In the past day alone, Ukrainian defenders destroyed two tanks, an infantry fighting vehicle, and an enemy car, and the Ukrainian Armed Forces shot down four Russian military planes, two drones, two cruise missiles, and a helicopter.

In one week, our troops destroyed 80 tanks, 72 armored units, 48 vehicles, 19 artillery systems, 7 unmanned aerial vehicles, 14 aircraft, a helicopter, and an enemy patrol boat. Also, the Joint forces destroyed the modern Russian electronic warfare system Leer-3 and captured five BMP-3 occupiers.

Yesterday, Russians launched new missile strikes on Lutsk, Kharkiv, Zhytomyr, Rivne, and didn't stop the carpet bombing of Mariupol. ""Russians have no more language, humanism, civilization. Only rockets, bombs and attempts to wipe Ukraine off the face of the earth. Does Europe really like it?"" Mykhailo Podoliak asks, reporting on the shelling.

Russian hostages include community leaders, activists, priests, volunteers, officials, and other Ukrainians who refuse to cooperate with the occupiers. As of March 26, there are 36 people on the list.

1119 civilians have fallen victim to the Russian occupiers since the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Another 1,790 were wounded, the UN said. 3.8 million Ukrainians left the country, another 6.5 million became internally displaced. 13 million people are ""stuck"" in combat zones, they can not leave.

143 children died due to the armed aggression of the Russian Federation in Ukraine, another 216 were injured.

Putin underestimated Ukraine's response to the invasion. Russian troops will be depleted in the next 7-8 days; this forecast was given by the former commander of the US Army in Europe, General Ben Hodges. According to him, the Russians have problems, and they know about it, so they are asking for help from China and Syria. However, if they lose strength, they will still be able to fire missiles at cities.

Also, according to British intelligence, after the destruction of the Saratov ship, Russia is no longer sure about the possibility of operations off the coast of Ukraine. The morale of the occupiers is low, and Ukrainian troops are aggressively resisting the enemy.

Humanitarian corridors

On March 27, both declared humanitarian corridors in Ukraine worked, and 1,100 people were evacuated. More than half a thousand of them are from Mariupol, who reached Zaporizhzhia by their personal transport.

Seven humanitarian corridors were planned for March 28, but intelligence reported possible provocations by the occupiers along the routes. Therefore, for reasons of security of citizens, today we do not open humanitarian corridors, Iryna Vereshchuk informed.

French President Macron has found himself on a humanitarian mission. He said he planned to hold talks with Putin on the evacuation of Mariupol residents. Earlier, he announced the intention of France with the participation of Greece and Turkey to remove civilians from the city.

22:00 – A convoy of 15 buses from Berdiansk arrived in Zaporizhzhia. Another 881 people were evacuated.

Peaceful atom

Ukraine demands that the UN Security Council take immediate measures to demilitarize the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone captured by the Russian occupiers and establish a special mission there.

Energoatom said that according to the Russians, the occupiers seized the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant using heavy weapons to ""save the station from the Ukrainian Nazis, who were going to commit a terrorist attack."" This delusion was said by them during the International Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material.

Ukraine's talks with Russia

""A new round of talks is ahead because we are looking for peace. Our priorities are known. Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity are beyond doubt. Effective security guarantees for our state are mandatory. Our goal is obvious: peace and the restoration of normal life in Ukraine as soon as possible,"" said President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in his address on the 32nd day of the war.

European Council President Charles Michel said it was necessary to continue dialogue with Russia on the situation in Ukraine. According to him, Russia has committed war crimes in Ukraine, but a dialogue with Putin is necessary, ""like it or not.""

20:00 – The President of Turkey will hold talks with the delegations of Ukraine and Russia before their meeting in Istanbul. This was stated by the President of Turkey following a meeting of the Turkish Cabinet. He noted that telephone talks with Presidents Zelenskyy and Putin ""continue in a positive light.""

Who's coming to Ukraine?

About financial aid, weapons, and volunteer fighters

Media support is also important. The stars of world cinema wore badges or ribbons at the Oscar ceremony in support of Ukraine. A moment of silence in honor of Ukraine was also held at the ceremony. A text was launched on the screen stating that millions of families in Ukraine now need food, blood, and medicine. It is a pity that the Oscars ""forgot"" to mention that Russia is guilty of war crimes.

As part of the international strategic initiative Help East, a humanitarian cargo of medical supplies arrived in Ukraine from France. This time, the National Military Medical Clinical Center in Kyiv and the Military Medical Clinical Center of the Eastern Region received assistance. The cargo consists of disinfectants, medicines, medical supplies, dressings, and hygiene products.

American actor Sean Penn and his NGO CORE will help IDPs in Lviv. This was reported in the press service of the Lviv Regional State Administration. ""Our organization wants to establish a partnership right here in Ukraine. We know how important it is to support the population in the struggle for freedom, so we will help everyone we can. Your experience is an example for the whole world,"" said Sean Penn.

After talking with the President of Azerbaijan, Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Azerbaijan was ready to provide Ukraine with fuel for sowing.

An auction for the sale of Banksy's CND Soldiers anti-war painting has ended in London. The auction brought in more than 100 thousand dollars; this money is intended for the Kyiv Children's Hospital Okhmatdyt.

The G7 countries have said they will not pay for rubles in Russian gas, stressing that it is ""a unilateral and blatant breach of existing contracts."" In response, Peskov threatened that Russia would cut off gas to Europe in such a case. This threat is not equal to closing the valve in the kitchen. If Russia dares to do so, it will simply have to burn the extracted gas in the air.

What's in Russia?

After the end of the war, Russia will pay contributions and reparations to Ukraine for decades. This was announced during the All-Ukrainian TV Marathon by Presidential Adviser Oleh Ustenko. ""It is clear that the seized funds in Russia may not be enough for our full recovery. Plus, there will be additional lawsuits against Russia. Contributions and reparations will come into force here, which will be paid by Russia according to the international court, but this will happen over a long period,"" said Ustenko.

Bringing the enterprises of the Russian defense-industrial complex involved in the production of missiles to round-the-clock operation indicates a significant reduction in the arsenal of missile weapons. Moreover, the prospects for self-manufacturing of high-tech electronic equipment, which is an important component of the technological process of manufacturing missiles, are far from bright. Glory to the sanctions!

In Moscow, a girl who threw a bottle of the incendiary mixture at a police officer during a rally against the war with Ukraine on February 24 was sentenced to two years in prison.

Russian lies

Another fake from Russia: the occupiers are shooting stage videos where the Ukrainian military allegedly mocks Russian prisoners. This was announced by the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valerii Zaluzhnyi: Servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other legitimate military formations strictly adhere to the norms of international humanitarian law,"" Zaluzhnyi stressed.

""Russian humanitarian cargo"" means stealing Ukrainian products and a Ukrainian car and drawing a Russian z-swastika. Lies and theft in everything!

Sanctions on the aggressor!

The Czech Republic froze the property of Russian oligarchs for hundreds of millions of korunas. The Czech Financial Analytical Unit (FAU), which is responsible for enforcing sanctions, said some companies were trying to circumvent the sanctions, so the office froze accounts and opened a criminal case.

Foreign companies that continue to operate in Russia will pay 50% more taxes in Ukraine. Such an initiative was developed in the government and parliament.

South Korea has banned the export of 57 types of non-strategic goods to Russia and Belarus. It is a ban on the export of semiconductors and parts to computer equipment.

Nokia and Lexmark have suspended supplies to Russia. ""Companies have not only suspended the supply of their goods to the aggressor country but also donate to international organizations that support humanitarian work in Ukraine,"" said First Deputy Minister of Digital Transformation Oleksandr Borniakov.

Germany is against the deployment of NATO peacekeeping forces in Ukraine and the creation of a no-fly zone, said German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. According to him, the main tool in the fight against Russia is now sanctions. Sanctions are, of course, good, but because of Germany's unwillingness to take risks, living people continue to die in Ukraine.

However, Germany itself does not rely on sanctions but plans to purchase a missile defense system, such as the Israeli Iron Dome. ""We need to understand that we have a neighbor who is willing to use violence to defend his interests,"" Scholz said. Some kind of double German morality.

Google has stopped licensing Russian Android smartphones.

There will be no money either. The UAE investment fund Mubadala Investment Company will suspend investments in Russia, said the chairman of the fund.

Kyiv and region

In Kyiv, as a result of the remains of a downed missile, a fire broke out on the territory of a private estate. Were it not for the work of the air defense, many Kyiv residents could have been affected by the shelling.

Near Kyiv, the enemy is trying to break through the defenses of the Armed Forces in the southwest and east of the capital to cut key transport arteries.

22:30 – The shelling in Makariv does not stop. There are wounded and two dead.

According to the village head Vadym Tokar, the Russians cover the streets of the village with Grad missiles and mines all day.

Donetsk and Luhansk regions

French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian called for a solution to the situation in Mariupol and compared the situation in the city to the destruction of Aleppo, Syria. According to the Minister, if the West does nothing to help the civilians of besieged Mariupol, it will be a collective fault.

""During the last night, houses in Severodonetsk and Rubizhne were shelled. A child died and another was injured in Borovske. Yesterday, the Armed Forces expelled the enemy from one of the districts of Rubizhne. In total, in the Luhansk region and Donbas, we repulsed 5 massive attacks by the Russian army in one day; tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, and enemy vehicles were destroyed,"" said Haidai, head of the Luhansk region.

Luhansk Regional Military Administration: In the morning the Russians fired on Severodonetsk. There are victims; an 86-year-old woman died.
