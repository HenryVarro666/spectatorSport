Ukraine says humanitarian corridors threatened

EU to impose new sanctions on Russia

LVIV, Ukraine, March 12 (Reuters) - Ukraine accused Russian forces on Saturday of killing seven civilians in an attack on women and children trying to flee fighting near Kyiv, and France said Russian President Vladimir Putin had shown he was not ready to make peace.

With Russia's invasion in its third week, the Ukrainian intelligence service said the seven, including one child, were killed as they fled the village of Peremoha and that ""the occupiers forced the remnants of the column to turn back."" read more

Ukrainian officials later said the convoy was not traveling along a ""green corridor"" agreed with Russia when it was struck on Friday, correcting their earlier assertion that it was on such a designated route.

Reuters was unable immediately to verify the report and Russia offered no immediate comment.

Moscow denies targeting civilians since invading Ukraine on Feb. 24. It blames Ukraine for failed attempts to evacuate civilians from encircled cities, an accusation Ukraine and its Western allies strongly reject.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Moscow was sending in new troops after Ukrainian forces put 31 of Russia's battalion tactical groups out of action in what he called Russia's largest army losses in decades. It was not possible to verify his statements.

""We still need to hold on. We still have to fight,"" Zelenskiy said in a video address late on Saturday, his second of the day.

He said earlier that about 1,300 Ukrainian troops had been killed so far and urged the West to get more involved in peace negotiations. The president suggested Russian forces would face a fight to the death if they sought to enter the capital.

""If they decide to carpet bomb (Kyiv), and simply erase the history of this region ... and destroy all of us, then they will enter Kyiv. If that's their goal, let them come in, but they will have to live on this land by themselves,"" he said.

Zelenskiy discussed the war with Chancellor Olaf Scholz and President Emmanuel Macron, and the German and French leaders then spoke to Putin by phone and urged him to order an immediate ceasefire.

A Kremlin statement on the 75-minute call made no mention of a ceasefire and a French presidency official said: ""We did not detect a willingness on Putin's part to end the war"".

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov accused the United States of escalating tensions and said the situation had been complicated by convoys of Western arms shipments to Ukraine that Russian forces considered ""legitimate targets"".

In comments reported by the Tass news agency, Ryabkov made no specific threat, but any attack on such convoys before they reached Ukraine would risk widening the war.

Crisis talks between Moscow and Kyiv have been continuing via a video link, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying by Russia's RIA news agency. He gave no details but Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Kyiv would not surrender or accept any ultimatums. read more

Zelenskiy later on Saturday said he had spoken to Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett about the prospects for peace talks. Bennett met with Putin and previously talked by phone to Zelenskiy, but the diplomatic efforts so far have appeared fruitless.

HUMANITARIAN CORRIDORS

Russian rocket attacks destroyed a Ukrainian airbase and hit an ammunition depot near the town of Vasylkiv in the Kyiv region, Interfax Ukraine quoted its mayor as saying.

The exhausted-looking governor of Chernihiv, around 150 km (100 miles) northeast of Kyiv, gave a video update in front of the ruins of the city's Ukraine Hotel.

""There is no such hotel any more,"" Viacheslav Chaus said, wiping tears from his eyes. ""But Ukraine itself still exists, and it will prevail.""

Britain's defence ministry said fighting northwest of the capital continued, with the bulk of Russian ground forces 25 km (16 miles) from the centre of Kyiv, which it has said Russia could attack within days.

Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Mariupol remained encircled under heavy Russian shelling, it said.

But the general staff of the Ukraine armed forces said later on Saturday that Russia had slowed its offensive and in many places its forces had been stopped. The military's Facebook post did not give details.

Russia's invasion has been almost universally condemned around the world and Moscow has drawn tough Western sanctions.

The Russian bombardment has trapped thousands of people in besieged cities and sent 2.5 million Ukrainians fleeing to neighbouring countries. Zelenskiy said the conflict meant some small Ukrainian towns no longer existed.

The United States said it would rush up to $200 million in additional small arms, anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons to Ukraine, where officials have pleaded for more military aid. read more

Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its neighbour's military capabilities and ""de-Nazify"" the country.

Ukrainian officials had planned to use humanitarian corridors from Mariupol as well as towns and villages in the regions of Kyiv, Sumy and some other areas on Saturday.

But Russian shelling threatened attempts to evacuate trapped civilians, they said.

Still, around 13,000 people were evacuated from Ukrainian cities on Saturday, said Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk. It was almost twice the number who got out the previous day but far fewer than on the two days prior to that.

A senior Russian defence ministry official said the humanitarian situation in Ukraine continued to decline rapidly and blamed Ukrainian fighters, accusing them of mining neighbourhoods and destroying bridges and roads, the RIA news agency reported.

Russian officials have previously accused Ukrainian forces of shelling their own people and then seeking to blame Moscow, allegations that Kyiv and Western nations dismissed as lies.

The governor of the Kyiv region, Oleksiy Kuleba, said fighting and threats of Russian air attacks were continuing on Saturday morning though some evacuations were proceeding.

The Donetsk region's governor said constant shelling was complicating bringing aid into the southern city of Mariupol.

Images taken on Saturday by private U.S. satellite firm Maxar showed fires burning in the western section of Mariupol and dozens of apartment buildings heavily damaged. read more

""There are reports of looting and violent confrontations among civilians over what little basic supplies remain in the city,"" the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said.

MAKESHIFT BURIALS

People were boiling ground water for drinking, using wood to cook food and burying their dead near where they lay, a staff member for Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors without Borders) in Mariupol said.

At least 1,582 civilians in Mariupol have been killed as a result of Russian shelling and a 12-day blockade, the city council said on Friday. It was not possible to verify casualty figures.

Efforts to isolate Russia economically have stepped up, with the United States imposing new sanctions on senior Kremlin officials and Russian oligarchs on Friday.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU on Saturday would suspend Moscow's privileged trade and economic treatment, crack down on its use of crypto-assets, and ban the import of iron and steel goods from Russia, as well as the export of luxury goods in the other direction. read more

Security camera footage verified by The New York Times showed a building ablaze inside the Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex near a line of military vehicles. The videos appeared to show people in the vehicles firing at buildings in the power plant. Ukraine’s state emergency service later said the blaze went out after 6 a.m.

The fire did not affect essential equipment at the plant, the International Atomic Energy Agency said on Twitter, citing its communication with the Ukrainian government.

About an hour after dawn, Ukraine’s nuclear regulatory inspectorate said in a statement that Russian military forces were now occupying the complex. It said that all of the site’s power units remained intact and that no changes in radiation levels had been observed.

The fire broke out after a Russian attack on a training building outside the perimeter of the plant, according to a statement by Ukraine’s state emergency service. A spokesman for the nuclear plant, Andriy Tuz, was quoted by The Associated Press as telling Ukrainian television that shells had set fire to one of the plant’s six reactors that was under renovation and not operating.

Ukraine’s nuclear inspectorate later said in its statement that one unit of the six units was operating, another was in “outage,” two were being cooled down, and two others had been disconnected from the grid.

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine had accused the Russian military of deliberately attacking the complex and said an explosion there would have been “the end for everybody, the end of Europe.”

“Only immediate actions by Europe could stop the Russian army,” he added.

President Biden spoke with Mr. Zelensky about the fire and joined him in urging Russia to “cease its military activities in the area and allow firefighters and emergency responders to access the site,” the White House said. Local reports later said that emergency crews had gained access.

Mr. Biden’s energy secretary, Jennifer M. Granholm, said on Twitter that the United States had not detected elevated radiation readings in the area, echoing an earlier assessment by the International Atomic Energy Agency. “The plant’s reactors are protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down,” she said.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain said he would seek an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council about the blaze at the complex, according to his office.

Before the fire was reported by Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, the director general for the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement that “a large number of Russian tanks and infantry” had entered Enerhodar, a town next to the plant. The director general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said that troops were “moving directly” toward the reactor site.

The Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex, on the Dnieper River roughly a hundred miles north of Crimea, is the largest in Europe. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, its six reactors produce a total of 6,000 megawatts of electric power.

In comparison, the Chernobyl plant in northern Ukraine produced 3,800 megawatts — about a third less. (A megawatt, one million watts, is enough power to light 10,000 hundred-watt bulbs.) The four reactors of the Chernobyl complex were shut down after one suffered a catastrophic fire and meltdown in 1986.

The reactors’ cores are full of highly radioactive fuel. But an additional danger at the Zaporizhzhia site is the many acres of open pools of water behind the complex where spent fuel rods have been cooled for years. Experts fear that errant shells or missiles that hit such sites could set off radiological disasters.

For days, social media reports have detailed how the residents of Enerhodar set up a giant barrier of tires, vehicles and metal barricades to try to block a Russian advance into the city and the reactor site. Christoph Koettl, a visual investigator for The New York Times, noted on Twitter that the barricades were so large that they could be seen from outer space by orbiting satellites.

Starting this past Sunday, three days into the invasion, Ukraine’s nuclear regulator began reporting an unusual rate of disconnection: Six of the nation’s 15 reactors were offline. On Tuesday, the Zaporizhzhia facility was the site with the most reactors offline.

MUKACHEVO, Ukraine — Russian forces continued to grind their way toward Ukrainian cities on Saturday, making limited gains in their attempts to surround Kyiv and capturing a minor city in the country’s south. Despite mounting losses and stiff resistance from Ukrainian forces, Russia showed no signs of letting up, and President Vladimir Putin rejected direct appeals from French and German leaders to de-escalate attacks.

The humanitarian crisis is deepening across the country, with convoys of food and medicine still unable to reach hundreds of thousands of civilians trapped behind Russian lines in the southern city of Mariupol. Polish officials warned that they are running out of capacity to care for the over 1.5 million refugees who have streamed across their borders.

Russian forces captured the city of Volnovakha, a key strategic point on their advance toward Mariupol, with the city’s mayor saying on the Telegram social media app that the city “no longer exists” after withering Russian bombardments. Missiles, bombs and artillery continued to pound Ukrainian cities from Kyiv, the capital, to Kharkiv in the east and Mykolaiv in the south.

As thousands protested the alleged abduction of Melitopol's mayor on March 12, Russian forces also reportedly captured the town of Volnovakha. (Video: The Washington Post)

As the war continued into its third week, the fighting grew only more intense. Despite losing several thousand troops according to U.S. estimates, Russia is still battering Ukraine’s cities, flattening apartment buildings and hampering efforts to address the humanitarian catastrophe. The dire situation is prompting stronger calls from Ukrainian officials for the United States to do more, even as it considers sending more sophisticated anti-air weapons to Ukraine.

Russian attacks have damaged at least nine medical facilities, according to a visual investigation by The Washington Post that looked at over 500 images and videos from the conflict and interviewed experts and witnesses on the ground.

Russian forces are still attempting to surround and seize Kyiv, making “limited but notable” progress in the capital’s northwest suburbs recently, said a senior NATO official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss security matters.

“It really does look like the battle for the capital is going to continue to be very drawn out unless the Russians can launch a more concentrated and coherent attack than they’ve yet shown the ability to conduct,” the NATO official said.

In a video message on Saturday night intended to uplift Ukrainians, President Volodymyr Zelensky assured citizens that the Western world is behind Ukraine. Russia “is an even bigger enemy, bigger evil than North Korea. That’s what Americans think, for example,” he said. He also said that humanitarian aid for the port city of Mariupol, which Russia’s war of attrition has hit particularly hard, was due to arrive Sunday afternoon.

For the past several days, Russian forces have hammered Mariupol while blocking shipments of food and medicine from getting in and stopping residents from getting out. Video published by the Associated Press showed Russian tanks repeatedly firing at an apartment building. And new satellite images released by Maxar Technologies on Saturday show the growing extent of the destruction.

Before-and-after photos show that clusters of large apartment buildings had been hit. Banks of trees and a sports field that were green in the before photos are now burned brown and obscured by smoke, while the apartment buildings that surround them are damaged and surrounded by debris.

In areas that have come under the control of Russian forces, concerns grew that occupying soldiers were beginning to target individual Ukrainian officials.

Russian soldiers detained Ivan Fedorov, the mayor of Russian-occupied Melitopol in the country’s south. Video footage shared on social media showed soldiers leading a figure with a hood over his head out of a building in the city. The incident prompted residents to gather in protest, chanting, “Bring back the mayor! Bring back the mayor!” and “Freedom to the mayor! Freedom to the mayor!” according to videos posted to social media.

Since Russia took the city two weeks ago, Fedorov had encouraged residents to protest. Russian propaganda has painted Ukrainians as being dominated by a minority of neo-Nazis and nationalists, and Putin has stated one of the goals of his invasion is the “de-Nazification” of Ukraine, prompting fears that individual Ukrainians will be targeted for arrest and attacks under Russian occupation. Fedorov, an ethnic Russian, was accused by Russia of supporting violence against innocent people in eastern Ukraine. Zelensky called the alleged abduction “a crime against democracy” and demanded Russia release him.

World leaders, including Pope Francis, called on Russia to end its invasion. “In the name of God, stop!” the pontiff posted on Twitter Saturday.

“Never war!” he wrote. “Think first about the children, about those who are deprived of the hope for a dignified life: dead or wounded children, orphans, children who play with the remnants of war.”

Putin held a testy phone call with French counterpart Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Saturday regarding the attack on Ukraine, which appears to have yielded little result and hope for de-escalation.

French officials said after the call that the Russian leader showed no desire to stop the war, adding that the conversation was “very frank and difficult.” Macron and Scholz called for an immediate cease-fire and “the end of the siege of Mariupol,” where the situation is “devastating.”

Russia’s version of the call, however, described discussions among the leaders over the humanitarian situation in cities under siege from Russian troops, as officials continued to warn the West against providing added munitions aid to Ukrainians.

Putin “informed the leaders about the real state of affairs,” the statement said, and accused the Ukrainian forces of the “grossest violation of the norms of international humanitarian law” without providing any evidence, including “placing heavy weapons in residential areas, near hospitals.”

But the United States and other NATO countries are readying to step up their efforts to provide Ukraine with more weapons to fend off the invasion. President Biden on Saturday authorized an additional $200 million in military aid, adding to the $350 million sent earlier this month.

U.S. officials said Friday they were also discussing with European allies how to get heavier weapons to Ukraine, including sophisticated surface-to-air missiles capable of knocking Russian planes out of the sky. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is slated to meet in the coming week with NATO allies in Brussels and Slovakia, which possesses the S-300 missile system and has signaled willingness to share weapons with Ukraine.

A top Russian diplomat warned that convoys carrying U.S. and NATO weapons inside Ukraine were “legitimate targets.” Since the invasion began, Ukraine’s allies have flown weapons to air bases in neighboring countries where they are trucked over the border.

There has been a notable decrease in the past few days in the number of Russian military flights and air attacks in Ukraine, potentially signaling that Ukraine’s air defenses are still effectively shooting down enemy planes, the NATO official said.

Russia also admitted that it was deploying conscripts to Ukraine, something it had denied in the early days of the war. Putin claimed the Russian military had recruited 16,000 foreign fighters from the Middle East, according to a Saturday update from the U.K. Defense Ministry. NATO has seen reported appearances of Chechen troops and former private military contractors among the force surrounding Kyiv.

“That may indicate that they’re still struggling to assemble sufficient conventional power to try to launch that assault on the capital,” the NATO official said.

In a notable development, nine of the 14 proposed corridors to provide civilians safe passage out of bombarded cities worked as designed, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said in a video message. She added that nearly 13,000 people were moved Saturday, nearly twice the amount who had made it out of a smaller number of cities the day before. But evacuation attempts from Mariupol remained impeded, she said.

For days, Ukrainian convoys have tried to get into Mariupol, but have been turned back by Russian shelling. In Zaporizhzhia, a Ukrainian city northwest of Mariupol, Yulia Karaulan boarded a truck that would try to get in. Karaulan was out of the country on a business trip when the invasion began, and is desperately trying to reunite with her husband, mother and 10-year-old daughter who are in Mariupol, she told The Post.

Local officials have said more than 1,500 civilians have been killed in Mariupol, though the death toll is impossible to verify. Drinking water has been cut off, and there are accounts of looting and lawlessness in the streets. Municipal workers have dug mass graves.

Still, Ukrainian forces are keeping up the fight in the city. A Russian general was killed in fighting around Mariupol, Ukrainian officials said Saturday. The officer was identified as Russian Maj. Gen. Andrei Kolesnikov, according to Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s Interior Ministry.

Russian major generals are roughly equivalent in rank to American one-star or brigadier generals.

Kolesnikov was not identified by name, though a Western official on Friday confirmed that three Russian generals have been killed in Ukraine since Russia’s invasion two weeks ago. The most recent general was a commander of the Eastern Military District. Russian officials have shared few details on the number of casualties among its forces, including ranking officers.

Across the country, more Ukrainians are continuing to flee, while those who remain struggle to find vital medical supplies. Every morning after curfews lift, lines form outside pharmacies across the country. Telegram groups have formed to help people find the medicines they need, but many are coming up short.

In Kyiv, Tetyana Dagadaeva lined up again, hoping to find the insulin her 11-year-old son needs to survive. This time, there was none. “My son’s life depends on this,” she told The Post. “The situation is really bad.”

Russian forces near Kyiv appeared to be cutting off water and food supplies as part of their strategy, the senior NATO official said. That could lead to a desperate situation in the city within two weeks, the official said.

In the nearby village of Peremoha, about 18 miles east of Kyiv, Russian troops fired at civilians attempting to flee, killing seven people, including a child, according to Ukraine’s intelligence service. The incident could not immediately be independently verified.

The group was forced to return to their village.

Russia has repeatedly denied targeting civilians, but a growing number of Western officials are raising questions about possible war crimes. Nearly a week ago, Russian forces fired mortar shells at another town on the outskirts of Kyiv, sending panicked residents running for their lives and killing at least eight people, including three members of a family, according to a local government official.

Those who have been able to leave Ukraine are streaming into the cities of neighboring countries, prompting urgent requests for international help. The mayors of Poland’s two biggest cities — Warsaw and Krakow — said they are struggling to accommodate the influx of hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians who have sought refuge.

More than 2.5 million Ukrainians have left the country since the invasion began Feb. 24, including 1.5 million who have gone to Poland.

In Russia, the government stepped up restrictions on social media, shutting down Instagram, which along with Facebook is owned by tech giant Meta. Instagram is highly popular with young Russians and had been a forum for some dissent against the government, even as the country passed strict new limits on political speech. Google-owned YouTube said it would block Russian state media channels globally, cutting off a key way Russian authorities have spread their message to millions of people around the world.

The exodus of Western businesses from Russia and steep sanctions from the United States and E.U. is continuing to cause economic turmoil inside the country.

On Saturday, Russia’s central bank said on its website that it had decided to put off reopening the country’s stock market on Monday, delaying it to at least March 18, according to Reuters. The market has been closed since the day after Russia began its invasion on Feb. 24.
