Grossi noted on Thursday that Moscow and Kiev are ""ready to work"" with the IAEA to ensure nuclear safety.

The Director General met Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in separate meetings in Antalya, Turkey where talks between Kiev and Moscow were held in a bid to simmer down tensions as the Russian special military operation in Ukraine unfolds.

It is noteworthy that Russia's Defense Ministry had announced that Ukrainian ultra-nationalists had committed a serious provocation by bombing facilities that provide energy to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.

Kramer', 'Mike Ives', 'Alexandra Stevenson', 'John Yoon', 'Azi Paybarah', 'David Moll']",2022-03-03 00:00:00,"A fire broke out early Friday at a complex in southern Ukraine housing Europe’s largest nuclear power plant after Russian troops fired on the area, and the Russian military later took control of the site, Ukrainian officials said.

Security camera footage verified by The New York Times showed a building ablaze inside the Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex near a line of military vehicles. The videos appeared to show people in the vehicles firing at buildings in the power plant. Ukraine’s state emergency service later said the blaze went out after 6 a.m.

The fire did not affect essential equipment at the plant, the International Atomic Energy Agency said on Twitter, citing its communication with the Ukrainian government.

About an hour after dawn, Ukraine’s nuclear regulatory inspectorate said in a statement that Russian military forces were now occupying the complex. It said that all of the site’s power units remained intact and that no changes in radiation levels had been observed.

The fire broke out after a Russian attack on a training building outside the perimeter of the plant, according to a statement by Ukraine’s state emergency service. A spokesman for the nuclear plant, Andriy Tuz, was quoted by The Associated Press as telling Ukrainian television that shells had set fire to one of the plant’s six reactors that was under renovation and not operating.

Ukraine’s nuclear inspectorate later said in its statement that one unit of the six units was operating, another was in “outage,” two were being cooled down, and two others had been disconnected from the grid.

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine had accused the Russian military of deliberately attacking the complex and said an explosion there would have been “the end for everybody, the end of Europe.”

“Only immediate actions by Europe could stop the Russian army,” he added.

President Biden spoke with Mr. Zelensky about the fire and joined him in urging Russia to “cease its military activities in the area and allow firefighters and emergency responders to access the site,” the White House said. Local reports later said that emergency crews had gained access.

Mr. Biden’s energy secretary, Jennifer M. Granholm, said on Twitter that the United States had not detected elevated radiation readings in the area, echoing an earlier assessment by the International Atomic Energy Agency. “The plant’s reactors are protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down,” she said.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain said he would seek an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council about the blaze at the complex, according to his office.

Before the fire was reported by Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, the director general for the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement that “a large number of Russian tanks and infantry” had entered Enerhodar, a town next to the plant. The director general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said that troops were “moving directly” toward the reactor site.

The Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex, on the Dnieper River roughly a hundred miles north of Crimea, is the largest in Europe. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, its six reactors produce a total of 6,000 megawatts of electric power.

In comparison, the Chernobyl plant in northern Ukraine produced 3,800 megawatts — about a third less. (A megawatt, one million watts, is enough power to light 10,000 hundred-watt bulbs.) The four reactors of the Chernobyl complex were shut down after one suffered a catastrophic fire and meltdown in 1986.

The reactors’ cores are full of highly radioactive fuel. But an additional danger at the Zaporizhzhia site is the many acres of open pools of water behind the complex where spent fuel rods have been cooled for years. Experts fear that errant shells or missiles that hit such sites could set off radiological disasters.

For days, social media reports have detailed how the residents of Enerhodar set up a giant barrier of tires, vehicles and metal barricades to try to block a Russian advance into the city and the reactor site. Christoph Koettl, a visual investigator for The New York Times, noted on Twitter that the barricades were so large that they could be seen from outer space by orbiting satellites.

Starting this past Sunday, three days into the invasion, Ukraine’s nuclear regulator began reporting an unusual rate of disconnection: Six of the nation’s 15 reactors were offline. On Tuesday, the Zaporizhzhia facility was the site with the most reactors offline.

The restoration of power at the decommissioned site means that cooling systems will now operate normally and not have to use backup power.

Ukraine's nuclear company Energoatom had earlier warned that radioactive substances could be released if a high-voltage power line to the plant were not repaired after it was damaged in fighting.

'Today, thanks to the incredible efforts of Ukrainian energy specialists, our nuclear power engineers and electricians managed to return the power supply to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, which was seized by the Russian occupiers,' Ukraine's Energy Minister German Galushchenko said in a statement.

'Our Ukrainian energy engineers, by risking their own health and lives, were able to avert the risk of a possible nuclear catastrophe that threatened the whole of Europe,' he added.

On February 24, Russia invaded Ukraine and seized the defunct Chernobyl plant, site of a 1986 disaster that killed hundreds and spread radioactive contamination west across Europe.

Russian tanks and armoured vehicles are parked just in front of the destroyed reactor in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone on the day the plant was taken over

The Russian forces cut the power to the plant, and the site was forced to run on emergency back-up generators that are powered by diesel, though the UN's atomic watchdog said there was 'no critical impact to safety'.

Staff at the site have been working under Russian guard since they took control of the nuclear plant.

The UN atomic watchdog, The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), warned earlier this week that the situation for the staff 'was worsening'.

The defunct plant sits inside an exclusion zone that houses decommissioned reactors as well as radioactive waste facilities.

In 2016, the Chernobyl New Safe Confinement was put in place to cover the reactor. It was designed to prevent further release of radioactive contaminants for 100 years.

More than 2,000 staff still work at the plant as it requires constant management to prevent another nuclear disaster.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Grossi on Tuesday called on 'on the forces in effective control of the site to urgently facilitate the safe rotation of personnel there.'

He also repeated his offer to travel to Chernobyl or elsewhere to secure 'the commitment to the safety and security' of Ukraine's power plants from all parties.

'The Director General indicated that remote data transmission from safeguards monitoring systems installed at the Chernobyl NPP had been lost,' the IAEA said in a statement.

A sudden power surge at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant resulted in a massive reactor explosion, exposing the core and blanketing the western Soviet Union and Europe with radiation in 1986. Pictured, the Chernobyl plant three days after the explosion on April 29, 1986

Russia took control of the defunct atomic plant on the first day of the invasion and later captured a second nuclear site - Zaporizhzhia - the biggest in Europe - on March 4, causing a fire that raised alarm in Europe over a possible nuclear catastrophe.

Last week staff at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant were captured on video pleading with Russian soldiers directing fire on the building before they overtook it.

The nuclear power plant, which creates around 20 percent of Ukraine's electricity, was captured after a fierce gun battle between Russian President Vladimir Putin's men and Ukrainian defenders that sparked a fire in a six-story training building.

Eventually, emergency crews were allowed to go in and douse the flames at the Zaporizhzhia plant before Russian troops moved in and occupied the site.

The United Nation's nuclear monitoring agency said that, fortunately, none of the site's six reactors had been directly damaged and radiation levels remained normal.

Russian engineers arrived at Zaporizhzhia earlier this week to check radiation levels.

Safeguards keep track of nuclear material and waste products generated by nuclear power plants.

The IAEA urged Russian authorities to allow the 210 staff members who are being held captive at Chernobyl to leave, arguing that although radiation levels in the area are relatively low, it is necessary to ensure a 'safe rotation' of staff.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10608481/Electricity-supply-Ukraines-retired-Chernobyl-nuclear-power-plant.html

13 Mar 2022 23.14 Moldova’s foreign minister Nicu Popescu has said his country is approaching a “breaking point” in its ability to shelter those fleeing the conflict in Ukraine. The number of refugees staying in Moldova is around 100,000 but represents a 4% increase in the national population and would be equivalent in proportion to 2.5 million refugees arriving in the UK in a fortnight, the BBC reports.

Popescu told the BBC that Moldova was “Ukraine’s most fragile neighbour” with fewer financial resources, and less resilience in security, health care and education. A full Russian assault on Ukraine’s third largest city of Odesa, 48km from Moldova’s border, would likely trigger an “overwhelming” influx of refugees and would be a “complete catastrophe for the humanitarian situation”.

Humanitarian situation in Ukraine 'catastrophic' — Russian army

The humanitarian situation in Ukraine is deteriorating quickly and has become catastrophic in a number of cities, the Russian military said, speaking on the 17th day of what Moscow has termed a ""special military operation.""

""Unfortunately, the humanitarian situation in Ukraine is continuing to deteriorate rapidly, and in some cities it has reached catastrophic proportions,"" said the head of the Russian National Defence Control Centre Mikhail Mizintsev.

He accused Ukrainian ""nationalists"" of laying mines in residential areas and destroying key infrastructure, including roads and bridges, leaving civilians with no access to electricity, water, food and medicine.

Mizintsev said that an especially dire humanitarian situation was developing in the southeastern port city of Mariupol, accusing Ukraine's ""nationalists"" of trapping hundreds of thousands of people in the besieged city.

Fitch downgrades Russia oil, gas firms on default risk

Another major rating agency, Moodys, also downgraded Gazprom and Lukoil this week. Three major raters have classed Russia as at risk of defaulting on its long-term sovereign debt due to sanctions.
