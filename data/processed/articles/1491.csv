“The family contacted me yesterday and I am turning to Israeli authorities to use their abilities vis-a-vis the authorities in Dubai. The last prime minister brought on an Israeli plane [a woman] convicted in Russia and so the state has the ability to intervene,” attorney Tammy Ulman says to Kan, referring to Naama Issachar, an Israeli woman sentenced to jail for carrying a small amount of marijuana during a layover in Moscow. Former PM Benjamin Netanyahu used Issachar’s plight to showcase his diplomatic abilities to voters, even making an unscheduled stop in Moscow to bring her home on his plane, after the Israeli media turned her into a cause celebre.

Fidaa Kiwan, a 43-year-old Haifa resident who owns a photography studio, reportedly came to Dubai for work at the invitation of a Palestinian acquaintance a year ago. She was arrested a short while later, on March 17, 2021, after a search of her apartment turned up the drugs, the Ynet news site reported. She has claimed that the drugs were not hers, and her local lawyer is expected to appeal the decision.

An unnamed friend speaking to Ynet also compares her case to Issachar’s.

“For Fidaa we haven’t heard any condemnation, there hasn’t been any help. They abandoned her until she got a death sentence,” the friend says.

Issachar’s family had also complained of little help from the government until it turned to the media.

UK freezes Russian 'war chest'

The British Foreign Ministry said that the UK had frozen some $350 billion (€321 billion) in assets of what she called Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""war chest.""

""So far, our sanctions have had a crippling impact on those who feed and fund Putin's war machine. This week we will announce that we've frozen over $350 billion of Putin's war chest,"" British Foreign Minister Liz Truss said.

This made up over 60% of Moscow's $604 billion (€554 billion) foreign currency reserves, Truss said.

Britain's foreign minister said that ""coordinated sanctions are pushing the Russian economy back to the Soviet era.""

Truss also called for a ban on Russian ships docking in Western ports and urged for curbs on the gold trade and on other industries that are ""filling Putin's war chest.""

International criminal lawyer: Genocidal intent 'is a high threshold to prove under international law'

""There's strong evidence to believe that war crimes have been perpetrated in Bucha and allegedly in other areas,"" lawyer Kateryna Busol told DW Tuesday. ""There's also a possibility to claim the perpetration of crimes against humanity, which is a widespread or systematic attack against the civilian population. And indeed, there have been discussions about possible genocidal intent, which is a high threshold to prove under international law,"" she said.

Specialized in international criminal law, Busol, a Ukrainian who is currently an associate at the London-based think tank Chatham House, said: ""Given certain statements by Russia's top leadership, one could derive, or at least one could start thinking about, such intention. And of course, in law, the presumption of innocence in criminal law is paramount. But certain images are deeply disturbing in terms of, you know, the civilians seen with burned bodies and tied hands and shot from behind.""

'No safe place' for children in Ukraine

Amanda Brydon, global head of child protection policy and advocacy at Save the Children, told DW that there is ""no safe place for children in Ukraine.""

""For those in cities like Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol, explosive weapons have devastated vital infrastructure,"" Brydon said.

""Children and their families are struggling to get food, heat their homes, find safety.""

She went on to say that the ""intensity"" is lower in Western Ukraine, but that ""hotels are booked out"" and ""air raid alarms are going off daily.""

""Children who are separated and unaccompanied are at a significantly increased risk of violence, trafficking and abuse,"" Brydon said, referring to children displaced by the conflict.

""The risks also increase at border crossing and transit points,"" Brydon said.

""It's been very difficult to track how many children there are,"" she added.

Asked on what mechanisms are in place to protect children, Brydon said that ""efforts are now being made to be coordinating between UN agencies and NGOs like Save the Children, as well as the authorities at border crossing points to set up a registration mechanism.""

""We're lucky that some of these neighboring countries have very strong child protection services,"" Brydon said.

""The key for this mechanism is to be identifying those children and then making sure that they're linked up so that they get the support that they need.""

European countries expel nearly 200 Russian diplomats

Italy, Spain and Slovenia were the latest countries in Europe to expel Russian diplomats from their soil, in response to the atrocities in the city of Bucha, Ukraine.

They follow the likes of Germany, Italy, Denmark and France, bringing the total number of expelled Russian embassy and consulate staff to almost 200.

European nations have said the expulsions had to do with alleged spying or ""national security reasons.""

Russia has rejected accusations that its forces were responsible for what happened in Bucha, saying the images are fake or the deaths occurred after they left the area.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that the mass expulsions of its diplomats was ""a short-sighted move."" ""Narrowing down opportunities for diplomatic communication in such an unprecedentedly difficult crisis environment is a short-sighted move that will further complicate our communication, which is necessary to find a solution,"" Peskov said.

Doctors Without Borders (MSF) witnessed bombings

The medical charity group Doctors Without Borders, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), said in a statement that its team had witnessed bombings in Mykolaiv, Ukraine.

The incident ocurred during a hospital visit on April 4, where the staff managed to take cover and escape unharmed. MSF's team was there to help support people displaced by the war, working in concert with a local organization.

""Several explosions took place in close proximity to our staff over the course of about 10 minutes,"" said Michel-Olivier Lacharité, MSF head of mission in Ukraine.

""As they were leaving the area, the MSF team saw injured people and at least one dead body,"" he added.

MSF reported that the regional paediatric hospital was also hit.

""Bombing such a large area within a residential neighborhood in the middle of the afternoon cannot but cause civilian casualties and hit public buildings,"" Lacharité said.

US envoy in Berlin praises Germany's policy turnaround

Amy Gutmann, the new US ambassador to Germany, said she understood why Berlin was hesitant to approve an immediate Russian energy embargo.

""I see Germany as doing everything it can, short of harming itself more than it harms Mr Putin,"" the ambassador said at one of her first official appearances, during a panel discussion at the Free University in Berlin.

Gutmann, a former professor of politics with German roots, has been ambassador to Berlin for just under two months.

She praised Germany's recent effort to become less dependent on Russian energy, which she said was happening ""more rapidly than anyone thought was possible previously.""

Her remarks come as Germany has been under pressure to increase sanctions on the Kremlin and its politicians have been under fire for being too close to Russia in the past years.

Zelenskyy addresses UN Security Council

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke via video link to a special meeting of the UN Security Council, urging for tougher measures against Moscow over alleged killings of civilians, as his country expects continued Russian bombardments in the east and south.

It was Zelenskyy's first speech to the UN Security Council since Russia's invasion and it comes after he traveled to Bucha to assess the severity of the situation.

""Yesterday I returned from Bucha,"" the Ukrainian president said during his address. ""There is not a single crime they would not commit there.""

""They killed entire families, adults and children, and they tried to burn the bodies,"" Zelenskyy added.

""The massacre in our city of Bucha is only one, unfortunately only one example of what the occupiers have been doing on our territory for the past 41 days,"" he added.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned during the Security Council meeting that Russia's invasion of Ukraine represented one of the greatest challenges ever to the international order ""because of its nature, intensity, and consequences.""

Blinken: Bucha war crimes 'deliberate campaign'

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the killings in Bucha had not been a random act of a rogue unit but instead, it was a part of a deliberate Russian campaign to commit atrocities.

Blinken made the remarks prior to departing for the NATO foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels.

""What we've seen in Bucha is not the random act of a rogue unit,"" he said. ""It's a deliberate campaign to kill, to torture, to rape, to commit atrocities. The reports are more than credible, the evidence is there for the world to see,"" the US top diplomat explained.

European Commission proposes new sanctions, including coal embargo

The European Commission has announced that it is planning a new raft of sanctions against Russia, in light of mounting evidence of atrocities committed against civilians by the Russian army.

German leaders have signaled that they will back the coal ban, which is likely to increase already skyrocketing energy prices in Europe.

Spain to expel Russian embassy officials

Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said ""at least 25"" people working at the Russian embassy in Madrid would be affected, as Spain becomes the latest country to react to allegations of Russian human rights atrocities in Bucha, Ukraine. Germany, France and Italy have also expelled Russians working at the embassies in their respective capitals.

NATO's Stoltenberg responds to Bucha deaths

NATO's Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg addressed the current events in Ukraine during a press conference, saying that the pictures from Bucha were of an ""unbearable brutality that Europe has not witnessed in many decades.""

The remarks come a day before NATO foreign ministers are to gather in Brussels to discuss more financial, military and humanitarian support for Ukraine

Stoltenberg warned that the findings in Bucha would likely not be the last, implying that such atrocities could be happenings in other areas that are still under Russian occupation.

""But when and if they withdraw their troops and Ukrainian troops take over, I'm afraid they will see more mass graves, more atrocities and more examples of of war crimes,'' he added.

The NATO chief rejected Russian claims that the evidence of the atrocities had been staged.

""These atrocities have taken place during a period in which Russia controlled these areas. So they are responsible. Second, we have information from many different sources,'' he said.

Stoltenberg also answered questions about the alliance's defense capability and even regarding the possibility of Finland and Sweden joining the group. Stoltenberg said it was those counties' decision, but that if they were to choose to do so, he expected members to welcome them.

French President Emmanuel Macron said there were clear indications that Russian forces were responsible for the killings in Bucha.

""There are very clear clues pointing to war crimes. It is more or less established that the Russian army is responsible (for the Bucha killings),"" Macron told France Inter radio.

'Victory' for Ukraine would be Russian forces back behind separatist lines

Speaking on Ukrainian television, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that he would consider it a victory if Russian troops returned behind the ""line of contact"" in the Donbas region, which has separated Moscow-backed militias from the rest of Ukraine since 2014.

Zelenskyy said that if Ukraine tried to retake the occupied territories in Luhansk and Donetsk by force today, it would cost Ukrainians hundreds of thousands of lives.

However, the president stressed that Ukraine maintains sovereignty over the territory occupied by Russia.

""There should be no talk of calling Crimea as something other than Ukrainian. Donbas is also Ukraine, and as for the temporarily occupied territories following February 24, it is not even discussed.""

Zelenskyy says talks with Russia after Bucha challenging but necessary

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said the possibility of holding more talks with Russia was very challenging, but there was no other option.

Speaking on Ukrainian television, Zelenskyy added that a face-to-face meeting between him and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin does not look likely.

The Ukrainian leader said the killings in Bucha showed the phrase ""needing denazification,"" which Putin used as justification for the invasion, applies more to Russia than to Ukraine.

He repeated that his country would need security guarantees as part of any peace settlement.

Zelenskyy said the Ukraine and Russia would not be able to agree on all points over Donbas at once but should work on it.

Zaporizhzhia is about 200 kilometers (120 miles) away from Mariupol.

Six persons, two men, three women and one children were killed and burned at that place alledgedly by Russian troops when city was under occupation.

KYIV, Ukraine - Ukraine's president showed a harrowing video of dead civilians to the UN Security Council Tuesday and called for ""accountability"" for apparent Russian atrocities, as fears grow that Moscow is preparing new offensives.

With global revulsion solidifying over civilian killings in the town of Bucha, President Volodymyr Zelensky likened Russia's assault to Nazi war crimes and Western nations ramped up sanctions against the Kremlin.

The United States is expected Wednesday to ban all new investment in Russia, while Britain announced it has frozen some $350 billion in assets from President Vladimir Putin's ""war chest"" so far.

Despite the pressure, bombardments rocked the Kyiv area villages of Velyka Dymerka and Bogdanivka, where 12 people were killed by Russian firearms and artillery, Ukraine's prosecutor general's office said on Telegram.

And new warnings emerged from Ukraine that other shattered communities, notably the town of Borodianka, may have suffered even worse fates than Bucha.

Zelensky, in an impassioned speech by videolink from Kyiv to the 15-member Security Council, demanded stronger action as he delivered a chilling account of Putin's six-week-old war.

This video was shown by @ZelenskyyUa at a meeting of UN Security Council, which was convened because of #BuchaMasacre.

He showed the genocide of the Ukrainians committed by russian army.

He said: #russia is turning the right of veto into the right of murders.

People ""were killed in their apartments, houses... civilians were crushed by tanks while sitting in their cars in the middle of the road,"" Zelensky said.

""They cut off limbs, slashed their throats, women were raped and killed in front of their children.""

""Accountability must be inevitable,"" he added, calling for Russia's exclusion from the Security Council -- on which it holds veto power.

""Are you ready to close the UN"" and abandon international law, the president asked. ""If your answer is no, then you need to act immediately.""

Zelensky's plea follows the harrowing discovery of civilian victims in Bucha and other towns near Kyiv following Russian troop withdrawals, which he and other officials have denounced as war crimes and attempted genocide.

'DELIBERATE CAMPAIGN TO KILL'

In a subsequent address to Spanish lawmakers, Zelensky compared Russia's devastating assault to the Nazis' 1937 bombing of the town of Guernica.

During a grim cleanup Tuesday in Bucha, local workers placed the remains of partially burned bodies into black bags and lifted them into a van.

After touring the devastation, Interior Minister Denys Monastyrsky told journalists that ""dozens of bodies"" remain in Bucha apartments and in nearby woods.

""What we've seen in Bucha is not the random act of a rogue unit. It's a deliberate campaign to kill, to torture, to rape, to commit atrocities,"" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.

Looking ahead, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance expects a Russian push in ""coming weeks"" to try to seize Ukraine's entire eastern region of Donbas, and create a land bridge to occupied Crimea.

Both Washington and the EU have vowed to squeeze Russia's economy until Putin is forced to halt the war he launched.

European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, who said she would travel to Kyiv this week, has offered the bloc's assistance in documenting proof of war crimes.

The Kremlin has denied any civilian killings, claiming the images emerging from Bucha and other sites are fakes produced by Ukrainian forces, or that the deaths occurred after Russian soldiers pulled out.

But one Bucha resident named Olena told AFP she saw Russian soldiers shoot a man in cold blood after ""brutal"" troop units moved in.

""Right in front of my eyes, they fired on a man who was going to get food at the supermarket,"" said the 43-year-old, who did not wish to give her family name.

Despite Olena's and other firsthand accounts, Moscow's UN ambassador Vassily Nebenzia rejected Zelensky's claims of Russian atrocities, telling the Security Council that the ""ungrounded accusations... are not confirmed by any eye witnesses.""

Zelensky delivered a forceful rebuttal, airing a graphic, 90-second video of what he said were images from towns including Bucha, Irpin, Dymerka, and the besieged southern port of Mariupol.

The footage showed partially uncovered dead people, including children, in shallow graves, bodies in a courtyard, burned corpses in the streets, and slumped victims with hands tied behind their back.

In the push to isolate Moscow, Spain, Italy, Denmark and Slovenia expelled dozens of its diplomats suspected of being intelligence operatives, after France and Germany did the same Monday, for a total of some 180 expulsions in 48 hours.

The Kremlin called it a ""short-sighted move"" that would complicate efforts to negotiate an end to the hostilities.

Putin warned of ""reprisals"" for recent European measures targeting Russian gas giant Gazprom -- and said Moscow would ""monitor"" its food exports to ""hostile"" nations, raising the spectre of further inflation surges worldwide.

WORSE THAN BUCHA?

Europe's worst conflict in decades has killed as many as 20,000 people, according to Ukrainian estimates, and 4.25 million have fled the country.

Many in Ukraine are bracing for further Russian bombardments.

Ukrainian officials say over 400 civilian bodies have been recovered from the wider Kyiv region, many buried in mass graves.

But Zelensky said he had information of worse atrocities in places such as Borodianka.

""Bucha is not the worst,"" Ukrainian presidential advisor Oleksiy Arestovych said on a Russian lawyer's YouTube channel. ""Everyone who managed to visit Borodianka says that it is much, much worse.""

AFP reporters who briefly visited the Borodianka area saw no bodies in the streets, but locals reported many deaths, and buildings were ravaged and blown open.

""I know five civilians were killed,"" said 58-year-old Rafik Azimov. ""But we don't know how many more are left in the basements of the ruined buildings after the bombardments.""

""I buried six people,"" another resident, Volodymyr Nahornyi, said. ""More people are under the ruins.""

A CHANCE OF TALKS

Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov meanwhile said Tuesday on Russian television that Russia was ""ready"" to continue the negotiations.

Ukraine has proposed an international agreement with other countries guaranteeing its security in return for accepting a neutral and non-nuclear status, not joining NATO and refusing to host foreign military bases.

According to the Ukrainian proposal, Russia would not oppose Kyiv's admission to the European Union.
