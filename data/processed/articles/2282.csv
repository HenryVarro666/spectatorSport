0,b66daff8-8990-40b3-a8c0-def47a4e2e52,[],,"Mr. President,

Excellencies,

Ladies and gentlemen,



We meet in the face of the most serious global peace and security crisis in recent years – and certainly in my time as Secretary-General.



Our world is facing a moment of peril. I truly hoped it would not come.



The latest developments regarding Ukraine are a cause of grave concern.



They include reports of increased ceasefire violations across the contact line and the real risk of further escalation on the ground.



My thoughts are with all those who have already suffered so much death, destruction and displacement.



The history of this conflict is complex with at least two permanently opposing narratives.

I know that their authors will never agree on what happened in the past.



But in the present situation one thing is clear: the decision of the Russian Federation to recognize the so-called “independence” of Donetsk and Luhansk regions – and the follow-up – are violations of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and inconsistent with the principlesof the Charter of the United Nations.



And here in this hallowed hall, I must emphasize that this action is also inconsistent with a landmark resolution adopted by the General Assembly more than half a century ago.



I refer to the Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation Among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.



This so-called ""Friendly Relations Declaration"" was adopted during the General Assembly session marking the 25th Anniversary of the United Nations.



The Friendly Relations Declaration – which has been cited repeatedly by the International Court of Justice as representing international law – sets out several vital principles that are highly relevant to today’s session.



In particular, I would note the principle of sovereign equality of States, and the affirmation that ""the territorial integrity and political independence of the State are inviolable"".



Other resolutions of the General Assembly are also fully behind the sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine, within its internationally recognized borders.



Mr. President,



The Minsk Agreements – approved by the Security Council and that I strongly supported from the beginning -- were surviving in an intensive care unit thanks to a number of life support devices.



But now those devices have been disconnected.



We must also be concerned about preserving the integrity of peacekeeping.



The United Nations has a long and recognized experience deploying peacekeeping operations -- which only take place with the consent of the host country.



Mr. President,



It is time for restraint, reason and de-escalation.



There is no place for actions and statements that would take this dangerous situation over the abyss.



It is time to establish a ceasefire and return to the path of dialogue and negotiations to save the people in Ukraine and beyond from the scourge of war.



I urge all parties to make full use of Article 33 of the Charter and its diverse instruments of pacific settlement of disputes.



Mr. President,



The United Nations system is continuing to support the people in Ukraine through our human rights and humanitarian work.



Our Human Rights Monitoring Mission has seven offices throughout the country -- on both sides of the contact line -- documenting civilian casualties, monitoring freedom of movement, and reporting on allegations of human rights violations.



Our humanitarian operations are independent of whoever might control the territory where people are living.



Even before this latest escalation, two million people in Ukraine needed humanitarian assistance.



Since the start of 2022 alone, we and our partners have delivered 140 metric tons of life-saving aid across the contact line.



Here again, our actions are based entirely on humanitarian principles endorsed by the General Assembly.



United Nations humanitarian assistance is guided by four humanitarian principles: humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence.



And these principles are central to establishing and maintaining access to affected people, including those in the context of an armed conflict.



The General Assembly has repeatedly underscored the importance of promoting and respecting these principles within theframework of humanitarian assistance.



Our humanitarian agencies are committing to staying and delivering to support the people in Ukraine, and are ready to adjust and reprioritize their operations as necessary.



As we sadly know all too well, in conflict, civilians, including women and children, always suffer first and suffer most.



If the conflict in Ukraine expands, the world could see a scale and severity of need unseen for many years.



I urge all sides to allow safe and unimpeded access by humanitarian agencies, including in non-Government controlled areas of eastern Ukraine.



All parties must uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law.



Mr. President,



I am fully committed to support all efforts to resolve this crisis without further bloodshed.



My good offices remain available.



We cannot and will not relent in the search for a peaceful solution.



Thank you.",https://www.un.org/sg/en/node/262019

UNITED NATIONS: The world is facing the ""biggest global peace and security crisis"" in recent years, UN chief Antonio Guterres has said as he slammed Russian President Vladimir Putin for sending troops into eastern Ukraine, describing the move as a violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and a ""death blow"" to the Minsk Agreements.

The Secretary-General, who cancelled a scheduled visit to the Democratic Republic of the Congo in light of the deteriorating situation in Ukraine, said that he was deeply troubled by the latest developments in Ukraine, including reports of increased ceasefire violations across the contact line and the real risk of further escalation on the ground.

""Our world is facing the biggest global peace and security crisis in recent years - certainly in my tenure as Secretary-General. We face a moment that I sincerely hoped would not come,"" Guterres told reporters here on Tuesday.

He reiterated that Russia's decision to recognise the so-called ""independence"" of certain areas of Donetsk and Luhansk regions is a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine.

""Such a unilateral measure conflicts directly with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations - and is inconsistent with the so-called Friendly Relations Declaration of the General Assembly which the International Court of Justice has repeatedly cited as representing international law,"" he said, adding that it is also a ""death blow"" to the Minsk Agreements endorsed by the Security Council.

The Minsk agreements were a series of international agreements which sought to end the war in the Donbas region of Ukraine.

The first agreement, known as the Minsk Protocol, was drafted in 2014 by the Trilateral Contact Group on Ukraine, consisting of Ukraine, the Russian Federation, and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), with mediation by the leaders of France and Germany.

After extensive talks in Minsk, Belarus, the agreement was signed on September 5, 2014. Guterres also strongly criticised Putin's decision to send troops into eastern Ukraine and his use of the term peacekeepers to describe those troops.

""I am also concerned about the perversion of the concept of peacekeeping. I am proud of the achievements of UN Peacekeeping operations in which so many Blue Helmets have sacrificed their lives to protect civilians. When troops of one country enter the territory of another country without its consent, they are not impartial peacekeepers. They are not peacekeepers at all,"" he said.

In an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council late Monday night, western powers strongly condemned Russia's actions with the US saying that an attack on Ukraine is an ""attack on the sovereignty of every UN Member State and the UN Charter - and that it will be met with swift and severe consequences.

US Ambassador to UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield described as ""non-sense"" Putin's reference of Russian troops to be deployed to the regions as peacekeepers. ""We know what they really are,"" the US ambassador said.

Describing the moment as ""critical"", Guterres said the United Nations and the entire international system are being ""tested and we must pass this test"". The UN chief called for an immediate ceasefire and the re-establishment of the rule of law, urging all to refrain from actions and statements that would take this dangerous situation over the brink. ""We need restraint and reason. We need de-escalation now. It is high time to return to the path of dialogue and negotiations,"" he said.

Guterres said that Russia's decision to recognise Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine as ""independent"" is inconsistent with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. He said the principles of the UN Charter are ""not an a la carte menu"". ""They cannot be applied selectively. Member States have accepted them all and they must apply them all,"" he said.

He stressed that the United Nations, in line with the relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, stands fully behind the sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine, within its internationally recognised borders.

The UN chief called on the international community to rally and meet this challenge together for peace, and to save the people of Ukraine and beyond from the scourge of war.

""I am fully committed to all efforts to resolve this crisis without further bloodshed,"" he said, adding that, ""We will not relent in the search for a peaceful solution."" In response to questions, Guterres said the present crisis will be ""in the end terribly detrimental"" both to Ukraine and Russia.

On Putin's assertion that actions Kyiv is conducting against Donetsk and Luhansk are genocide, he said: ""Genocide is a crime that is clearly defined and whose application must be done in line with international law. I do not think it is the case.""",https://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2022/feb/23/world-is-facing-biggest-global-security-crisis-in-recent-years-un-chief-on-ukraine-issue-2422851.html

GUYANA’S government, on Thursday, issued a statement denouncing the recent military intervention against the sovereignty of Ukraine, and called for a return to diplomacy in the eastern European Bloc.

“Government of Guyana deplores the treat or use of force in the conduct of international relations and urges a peaceful resolution of the differences that currently exist, in consonance with the rule of intentional law and the provisions of the United Nations Charter,” the statement, conveyed through Guyana’s Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Ministry, read.

Takuba Lodge said the threat against Ukraine “is a threat to the region and countries everywhere.

“The Government of Guyana supports the efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General to bring a speedy resolution to the situation in Ukraine and cease the threat to international peace and security.”

“The current military action in Ukraine,” the statement continued, “is contrary to the principles of respect for territorial integrity, sovereignty and the non-interference in the internal affairs of another sovereign state.”

The foreign ministry also endorsed statements issued by the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) on February 14, 2022 and February 24, 2022.

In a recent statement, CARICOM, through its Georgetown-based Secretariat, said: “[the bloc] strongly condemns the military attacks and invasion of Ukraine by The Russian Federation and calls for the immediate and complete withdrawal of the military presence and cessation of any further actions that may intensify the current perilous situation in that country.”

Meanwhile, United Nations (UN) Secretary-General, António Guterres addressed the media following a meeting on Wednesday evening of the UN Security Council.

He cited the UN Charter which mandates that member nations must refrain from threat or use of force against territorial integrity or political independence of other states.

“The use of force by one country against another is the repudiation of the principles that every country has committed to uphold, and this applies to the present military offences.

“It is wrong, it is against the Charter, it is unacceptable, but it is not irreversible,” Secretary-General Guterres said.",https://guyanachronicle.com/2022/02/25/cease-hostilities-return-to-diplomacy/

The latest on the Russia-Ukraine crisis :

___

UNITED NATIONS — U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres says Russia’s attack on Ukraine — as he appealed for President Vladimir Putin to stop his troops — was “the saddest moment” of his five-year tenure.

The U.N. chief opened the emergency Security Council meeting late Wednesday by urgently appealing to Putin: “In the name of humanity, bring your troops back to Russia.”

But during the meeting, Putin announced that he was launching a “special military operation” in eastern Ukraine.

Guterres later urged the Russian president to withdraw his troops and added: “In the name of humanity do not allow to start in Europe what could be the worst war since the beginning of the century, with consequences not only devastating for Ukraine, not only tragic for the Russian Federation, but with an impact we cannot even foresee in relation to the consequences for the global economy.”

A war would cause deaths and displacement and people will lose hope in the future, Guterres said, adding Russia’s actions would harm the global economy.

“What is clear for me is that this war doesn’t make any sense,” Guterres said, stressing that it violates the U.N. Charter and will cause a level of suffering if it doesn’t stop that Europe hasn’t know since at least the 1990s Balkans crisis.

BEIJING — Asian stock markets have plunged and oil prices surged after President Vladimir Putin announced Russian military action in Ukraine.

Market benchmarks in Tokyo and Seoul fell 2% and Hong Kong and Sydney lost more than 3% Thursday. Oil prices jumped nearly $3 per barrel on unease about possible disruption of Russian supplies.

Earlier, Wall Street’s benchmark S&P 500 index fell 1.8% to an eight-month low after the Kremlin said rebels in eastern Ukraine asked for military assistance.

Investors already were uneasy about the possible impact of the Federal Reserve’s plans to try to cool inflation by withdrawing ultra-low interest rates and other stimulus that boosted share prices.

___

UNITED NATIONS — Ukraine’s ambassador at the United Nations has told the Security Council that Russian President Vladimir Putin has “declared war on Ukraine.” He also pressed his Russian counterpart to state that Russia will not shell and bomb Ukrainian cities.

Ukrainian Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya said Wednesday night that if Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia was not in a position to give a positive answer, he should relinquish the presidency of the Security Council, which Russia holds this month.

The Ukrainian then asked for another emergency meeting of the Security Council, calling on the U.N. body “to stop the war because it’s too late to talk about de-escalation.”

Kyslytsya then asked if he should play the video of Putin announcing military operations being launched in Ukraine.

Nebenzia replied: “This isn’t called a war. This is called a special military operation in Donbas.”

WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden is condemning Russia for an “unprovoked and unjustified attack” on Ukraine. He promises that the U.S. and its allies “will hold Russia accountable.”

Biden says he plans to speak to the American people Thursday after a meeting of the Group of Seven leaders. More sanctions against Russia are expected to be announced Thursday.

In a written statement, Biden adds: “President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering. Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way. The world will hold Russia accountable.”

___

MOSCOW — Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced a military operation in eastern Ukraine, claiming it’s intended to protect civilians.

In a televised address early Thursday, Putin says the action comes in response to threats coming from Ukraine.

He adds that Russia doesn’t have a goal to occupy Ukraine. Putin says the responsibility for bloodshed lies with the Ukrainian “regime.”

Putin also is warning other countries that any attempt to interfere with the Russian action will lead to “consequences they have never seen.”

___

UNITED NATIONS — U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is telling Russian President Vladimir Putin to not send Russian troops against Ukraine and “give peace a chance.”

Guterres opened an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council late Wednesday saying the day was full of rumors and indications that an offensive against Ukraine is imminent.

In the recent past, Guterres says, he never believed rumors that Russia would invade Ukraine and was “convinced that nothing serious would happen.”

But, he adds: ”I was wrong, and I like not to be wrong again. So if indeed an operation is being prepared I have only one thing to say from the bottom of my heart: Stop your troops from attacking Ukraine. Give peace a chance. Too many people have already died.”

WASHINGTON — Airspace over all of Ukraine has been shut down to civilian air traffic, according to a notice posted to air crews early Thursday.

A commercial flight tracking website shows that an Israeli El Al Boeing 787 from Tel Aviv to Toronto turned abruptly out of Ukrainian airspace before detouring over Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Poland.

The only other aircraft tracked over Ukraine is a U.S. RQ-4B Global Hawk unmanned surveillance plane that began flying westward out of Ukraine after Russia put in place flight restrictions over Ukrainian territory

___

WASHINGTON — The Ukrainian government is closing airports in eastern Ukraine from midnight through 7 a.m. because of the confrontation with Russia.

Ukrainian aviation authorities also have declared some airspace in the east to be “danger areas” because of attempts by Russian aviation authorities to seize control of the airspace.

Ukraine acted after Russia issued a ban on civilian air traffic in airspace over eastern Ukraine.

The announcement Wednesday night establishes buffer zones for traffic controlled by Ukrainian authorities to avoid coming into potentially hazardous conflict with air traffic controlled by Russian authorities.

Last week, Ukrainian aviation officials warned pilots in the region to be on the lookout for Russian authorities trying to take control of the airspace and to only recognize Ukraine’s controllers.

___

UNITED NATIONS — The U.N. Security Council has scheduled an emergency meeting Wednesday night at the request of Ukraine, which says there is an immediate threat of a Russian invasion.

The meeting comes two days after the 15-member council held an emergency open meeting also requested by Ukraine. That session saw no support for Russian President Vladimir Putin’s declaration of independence for two separatist areas in Ukraine’s east and his announcement that Russian troops would be heading there to keep the peace.

The meeting Wednesday night comes as council diplomats are finalizing a draft resolution that they say would make clear that Russia is violating the U.N. Charter, international law and a 2015 council resolution endorsing the Minsk agreements aimed at restoring peace in eastern Ukraine.

They say the resolution would urge Russia to get back into compliance immediately,.

CANBERRA, Australia — Australia’s prime minister says Ukrainians in Australia whose Australian visas will expire by the end of June will be allowed to stay an additional six months.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison also said Thursday that Ukrainians applying for Australian visas will be given priority over other nationalities, Morrison said.

Morrison made the announcement a day after Australia imposed sanctions on eight members of Russia’s Security Council in response to Russia’s actions against Ukraine.

Sanctions have also been placed on a series of banks and financial institution. Sanctions that have existed since 2014 on the transport, energy, minerals and telecommunications sectors have been extended to rebel-held areas of Ukraine that Russia recognizes as independent.

___

KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine’s president is rejecting Moscow’s claim that his country poses a threat to Russia and warns that a looming Russian invasion could cause tens of thousands of deaths.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made the comments in a video address early Thursday.

Speaking emotionally in Russia, he said: “The people of Ukraine and the government of Ukraine want peace. But if we come under attack that threaten our freedom and lives of our people we will fight back.”

Zelenskyy says he tried to call Russian President Vladimir Putin late Wednesday but the Kremlin remained silent.

___

WASHINGTON — The White House says the request by Ukrainian separatists for Russian military assistance in the face of supposed “aggression” by Ukraine’s government is an example of the “false flag” operations the West has consistently warned against.

The U.S. and allies have alleged for weeks that Russia would try to create a pretext for an invasion of Ukraine through the use of such operations.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki says the Kremlin’s announcement Wednesday that the separatists are seeking help ”is an example” of such an operation.

Psaki adds that “we’ll continue to call out what we see as false flag operations or efforts to spread misinformation about what the actual status is on the ground.”

MOSCOW — The Kremlin says the rebel leaders in eastern Ukraine have asked Russia for military assistance to fend off the Ukrainian “aggression.”

The appeal raises the prospect of Russia’s direct military involvement in eastern Ukraine amid Western fears that Moscow is poised to launch an all-out invasion of its neighbor.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that the rebel chiefs wrote to Russian President Vladimir Putin to tell him that shelling by the Ukrainian military has caused civilian deaths and forced many people to flee.

The move comes after Putin recognized the independence of Russia-backed rebel regions in eastern Ukraine and signed friendship treaties with them. On Tuesday, Russian lawmakers gave Putin permission to use military forces outside the country.

KYIV, Ukraine — Lawmakers in Ukraine have approved a nationwide state of emergency amid fears of an all-out Russian invasion.

The parliament approved Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s decree that imposes the measure for 30 days starting Thursday. The state of emergency allows authorities to impose restrictions on movement, block rallies and ban political parties and organizations “in the interests of national security and public order.”

The move follows Russian President Vladimir Putin’s move Monday to recognize the independence of two rebel regions in eastern Ukraine, where a nearly eight-year conflict with the pro-Russia rebels has left over 14,000 dead. Putin has sanctioned the deployment of Russian troops there to “maintain peace” and received a parliamentary approval to use military force outside the country.

Ukrainian authorities have repeatedly voiced concerns that Russia could try destabilize Ukraine by relying on Moscow supporters inside the country, including a pro-Russia political party in parliament.

WASHINGTON — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday that Russian aggression toward Ukraine is “an attack on democracy,” vowing that the U.S. will stand united with its allies around the world in swiftly imposing sanctions on Russia and ensuring financial and political support for an independent Ukraine.

Pelosi, who returned to the Capitol from a diplomatic overseas trip, compared the aggression to Russia’s intervention in the United States’ own democratic process during the 2016 election.

“There will be a price to pay for Vladimir Putin,” she said, flanked by lawmakers who had joined her delegation at the annual security conference in Munich.

Pelosi said the Russian president is one of the richest men in the world and warned that the sanctions being imposed by the U.S. and its allies are only the start of what is possible to inflict financial pain on his regime. “We’re doing this together,” she said.

___

WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden is allowing sanctions to move forward against the company that built the Russia-to-Germany Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline and against the company’s CEO for its actions against Ukraine.

Biden said Wednesday “I have directed my administration to impose sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG and its corporate officers. These steps are another piece of our initial tranche of sanctions in response to Russia’s actions in Ukraine. As I have made clear, we will not hesitate to take further steps if Russia continues to escalate.”

Germany said Tuesday that it was indefinitely suspending the project, after Biden charged that Russia President Vladimir Putin had launched “the beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine” by sending troops into two separatist regions of eastern Ukraine.

The pipeline is completed but had not yet begun operating. Critics, including the U.S., have said the pipeline is a geopolitical move that will only increase Europe’s dependency on Russian natural gas.

___

WASHINGTON — There’s little support among Americans for a major U.S. role in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, according to a new poll, even as President Joe Biden imposes new sanctions and threatens a stronger response that could provoke retaliation from Moscow.

Biden has acknowledged a growing likelihood that war in Eastern Europe would affect Americans, though he has ruled out sending troops to Ukraine. Gas prices in the U.S. could rise in the short term. And Russian President Vladimir Putin has a range of tools he could use against the U.S., including cyberattacks hitting critical infrastructure and industries.

“Defending freedom will have costs for us as well, here at home,” Biden said. “We need to be honest about that.”

Just 26% of Americans polled say the U.S. should have a major role in the conflict, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Fifty-two percent say a minor role; 20% say none at all.

The findings are a reminder for Biden and fellow Democrats that while the Ukraine crisis may consume Washington in the coming months, pocketbook issues are likely to be a bigger priority for voters heading into the midterm elections.

WASHINGTON — A senior U.S. defense official in Washington says the Russian forces arrayed along Ukraine’s borders are “as ready as they can be” for an invasion, if ordered to launch it.

U.S. authorities have estimated that Russia has more than 150,000 troops along Ukraine’s borders with Russia and Belarus.

About 80% of those forces are now in “what we would consider forward positions, ready to go,” the official said, adding that they are within 5 to 50 kilometers (3 to 31 miles) of the border. The official spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the information.

The official said the U.S. has indications — based on intelligence as well as visual evidence — that “they (Russian forces) have advanced their readiness to a point where they are literally ready to go now, if they get the order to go.”

UNITED NATIONS -- China’s United Nations ambassador is urging a diplomatic and peaceful solution to the Ukraine crisis, stressing Beijing’s “consistent” position “on safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states” and upholding the U.N. Charter.

In brief remarks to the U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday, Ambassador Zhang Jun, whose country is usually allied with Russia at the United Nations, did not mention Russia by name or in any way endorse President Vladimir Putin’s declaration of independence for Ukraine’s separatist areas or Putin’s decision to send Russian forces there as what he called “peacekeepers.”

The Chinese ambassador noted that the current situation in Ukraine “is rooted in a complex web of historical and present day factors” and said “all parties concerned should exercise restraint and avoid taking any action that may aggravate tensions.”

“China calls on all parties to recognize the importance of implementing the principle of indivisible security, to continue to engage in dialogue and consultation and to seek reasonable solutions that address each other’s concerns. through peaceful means on the basis of equality and mutual respect,” Zhang said.

BUDAPEST — Hungary’s prime minister said Wednesday that his country would seek to “stay out” of the worsening conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

In a video on his Facebook page, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said “we must do everything we can to avoid war.”

He added that “Hungary must stay out of this conflict ... Because Hungary’s security is the most important interest.”

Orban reiterated an earlier announcement from Hungary’s defense minister that Hungarian soldiers would be deployed to the country’s border with Ukraine to prepare for the possible arrival of Ukrainian refugees. Orban is a fierce opponent of migration.

Orban went to visit Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this month and lobbied for larger shipments of Russia gas.

Earlier Wednesday, Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that Hungary supports Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and would back European Union sanctions against Russia.

___

GENEVA — The Swiss government is condemning Russia’s recognition of two regions of eastern Ukraine as independent states and is vowing to make sure that Switzerland isn’t used to evade European Union and other international sanctions.

The executive Federal Council, a seven-member body, said Wednesday it decided not to adopt the EU sanctions — as it often does — but criticized the “violation of international law and Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty.” Switzerland is not among the members of the 27-country EU, but is all but surrounded by four of them: Austria, France, Germany and Italy.

The Swiss government does not recognize the independence of the two territories, Donetsk and Luhansk.

Switzerland is a major international banking center, and its generally stable hard currency — the Swiss franc — and high-tech financial institutions have lured many international investors and elites, including those from Russia.

UNITED NATIONS — Russia’s U.N. ambassador is urging the world’s nations to rein in what he called Ukraine’s ongoing violence and “blatant genocide” in eastern separatist regions of the country that Moscow has declared independent.

The eastern Donbas region of Ukraine is a flashpoint in the tensions between Russia and Ukraine, as the United States warns Moscow is seeking a pretext to invade its neighbor. Ukraine has denied any aggression against pro-Russian forces in the eastern area, including Luhansk and Donetsk, which borders Russia.

Russian President Vladmir Putin has declared those republics independent and plans to send Russia troops there as what he called “peacekeepers.”

Vassily Nebenzia, Russia’s U.N. ambassador, warned the 193-member U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday that “no one intends to go softly, softly with any violators” of the peace in those eastern areas of Ukraine.

He said the departure of tens of thousands of people from Luhansk and Donetsk to Russia -- including 96,000 people on Wednesday -- shows Ukraine’s disparaging treatment of people there, including dubbing them “terrorists.”

___

UNITED NATIONS — U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield is telling countries around the world that “now is the time to get off the sidelines” and speak out against Russia’s actions toward Ukraine.

“There is no middle ground here. Calling for both sides to de-escalate only gives Russia a pass. Russia is the aggressor here,” Thomas-Greenfield said at a U.N. General Assembly meeting Wednesday.

She called on Russia “to come back to the negotiating table and to work toward peace.”

___

BERLIN — The head of the German parliament’s foreign policy committee says the government is considering providing further protective equipment to Ukraine.

Michael Roth said after a special meeting of the committee Wednesday with Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock that there are talks with the Ukrainian government on delivering night-vision devices, for example, German news agency dpa reported.

He said it’s also possible that protective equipment no longer needed after the German military withdrew from Afghanistan last year could be provided.

Germany has refused to deliver lethal weapons to Ukraine, a stance that has irked some allies, but has said it would deliver 5,000 helmets.

___

BOSTON — Ukrainian government and banking websites have been knocked offline with another wave of distributed-denial-of-service attacks.

The targets Wednesday included the defense, foreign and interior ministries, as well as Privatbank, the country’s largest commercial bank.

Many of the same sites were similarly hit in Feb.13-14 attacks that the U.S. and U.K. governments quickly blamed on Russia’s GRU military intelligence agency. Such attacks barrage websites with junk traffic, rendering them unreachable.

Wednesday’s DDoS attacks appeared to be less impactful than the previous onslaught, with targeted sites soon reachable again as emergency responders blunted them.

Cyberattacks have been a key tool of Russian aggression in Ukraine since 2014, when the Kremlin annexed Crimea and hackers tried to thwart elections.

___

BRUSSELS — European Union sanctions against Russia have taken effect.

They are the first steps in a planned series of retaliatory measures devised to be cranked up if Russian President Vladimir Putin orders an attack or pushes his troops deeper into Ukraine.

The sanctions that took effect Wednesday targeted senior Russian government officials, several companies and hundreds of lawmakers who voted in favor of recognizing the independence of separatist parts of southeast Ukraine.

The sanctions are mostly a freeze on the assets of those listed and a ban on them traveling in the 27-nation EU.

The measures come on top of a slew of economic and other sanctions slapped on Russia since it annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014.

Those sanctions already targeted Russia’s financial, energy and defense sectors, as well as goods that can be used for both civilian and military purposes.

___

UNITED NATIONS — Ukraine’s foreign minister wants the world to stand together against Russia, arguing that Moscow’s aggression toward his country will have wider repercussions for the international order.

Dmytro Kuleba told the U.N. General Assembly that the deployment of Russian troops in rebel-held parts of eastern Ukraine and Moscow’s recognition of the rebel regions as independent amounts to an “attack on the United Nations.”

He said: “If Russia does not get a severe swift and decisive response now, this will mean a total bankruptcy of the international security system and international institutions.”

Kuleba urged countries to use tough economic sanctions, strong messages and “active diplomacy” to get Russia to back off from Ukraine.

“We are at a critical juncture of world history, and our actions today define it for years to come,” he said, drawing parallels with the leadups to the last century’s two world wars.

___

BRUSSELS — European leaders plan an in-person emergency summit on Thursday evening in Brussels to discuss the tensions between Russia and Ukraine.

European Union Council president Charles Michel said in his invitation letter to the 27 leaders that the “use of force and coercion to change borders has no place in the 21st century.”

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz had already planned to hold a 90-minute virtual meeting of Group of Seven leaders on Thursday afternoon. That meeting was announced last week.

Michel praised the heads of states and government for the unity shown by the bloc in recent days to ensure the adoption of sanctions against Russia and deter its suspected plans to invade Ukraine.

MOSCOW -- Russia has started evacuating its embassy in Kyiv, as fears mount that Russian President Vladimir Putin might be about to order an invasion of Ukraine.

Russian state news agency Tass reported that Russia began pulling personnel from its diplomatic posts in Ukraine on Wednesday.

The move came a day after the Russian Foreign Ministry announced a plan to evacuate, citing threats against Russians in Ukraine.

At the same time, Ukraine urged its citizens to leave Russia as the region braced for a military confrontation, with some 150,000 Russian troops deployed around Ukraine’s borders.

Putin on Tuesday received authorization to use military force outside his country and the West responded with sanctions.

BRUSSELS -- The deputy chairman of Russia’s State Duma claims Russians are unimpressed by the sanctions slapped on their country by the European Union.

Pyotr Tolstoy, who is a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said Wednesday that Moscow is planning a response to the sanctions. He did not give details.

Tolstoy told Belgian broadcaster RTBF the EU sanctions were “worthless.”

The EU on Tuesday announced sanctions against the 351 Duma legislators who voted in favor of formally recognizing pro-Russian separatist regions in Ukraine, among others.

MOSCOW — Ukraine’s top diplomat wants to see tougher sanctions slapped on Russia over its aggressive posture toward his country.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Wednesday on Twitter: “To stop Putin from further aggression, we call on partners to impose more sanctions on Russia now.”

He expressed thanks for international sanctions imposed on Moscow the previous day. But he asked countries to crank up the pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Kuleba wrote: “Hit his economy and cronies. Hit more. Hit hard. Hit now.”

5,b66daff8-8990-40b3-a8c0-def47a4e2e52,[],,"Ukraine: Vote on Draft Resolution*

This afternoon (25 February), the Security Council is expected to vote on a draft resolution condemning Russia’s aggression against Ukraine. Today’s vote follows a severe escalation in violence since 24 February, when Russia launched a large-scale attack targeting numerous cities in Ukraine. The attacks, which involve aerial and ground operations, have thus far resulted in at least 25 civilian deaths and injured approximately 100 people, according to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR).

The US and Albania, co-penholders on Ukraine, circulated a draft resolution addressing the recent developments to Council members yesterday morning (24 February). Following bilateral negotiations with some members, the co-penholders placed a revised draft in blue yesterday (24 February) evening. The draft text is open for co-sponsorship by the wider UN membership. At the time of writing, at least 59 member states are expected to co-sponsor the draft resolution.

Background

On 23 February, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a “special military operation” in the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. Shortly after the announcement, explosions were heard across several cities in central and eastern Ukraine, including the capital, Kyiv, and Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. Since 24 February, Russia has been attacking Ukraine on multiple fronts—including western cities such as Lviv and the southern city of Kherson—from the land, air and sea. The Russian military has been carrying out rocket attacks targeting airports and military installations and ground forces are reportedly using missiles and long-range artillery as they advance into mainland Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that 137 civilians and military personnel were killed yesterday. An OHCHR spokesperson said today (25 February) that its count of 25 civilian deaths may be an underestimate because of difficulty corroborating data on the ground.

According to media reports, Russian forces began advancing into Kyiv this morning, with heavy fighting reported in the city’s northern districts. Zelenskyy has warned that Russia seeks to target him in a bid to topple his administration and install a pro-Russian government. In a video address today, Zelenskyy noted that Ukraine is willing to hold talks on “security guarantees for our country and its neutral status”. In response, Russian spokesperson Dmitry Peskov reportedly said that Putin is willing to send a Russian delegation to Minsk to negotiate with a Ukrainian delegation.

The Russian aggression against Ukraine has been met with widespread international opprobrium. In a 24 February statement, Secretary-General António Guterres called the Russian military offensive “unacceptable” and asserted that it violates the UN Charter. He appealed to Putin to stop the military operation and withdraw the Russian troops from Ukrainian territory. On the same day, the EU issued a statement which strongly condemned the “unprovoked invasion of Ukraine by armed forces of the Russian Federation”, calling it a violation of international law. It further condemned Belarus’ involvement in the aggression against Ukraine and called for an immediate cessation of hostilities. The AU expressed extreme concern about the “dangerous situation created in Ukraine” in a 24 February statement. It called on Russia and any other international actor to respect international law and Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty. Numerous international actors—including Australia, Japan, the UK, the US, and the EU—have announced new sanctions on Russia. In addition, Germany has announced the suspension of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project.

The aggression against Ukraine follows several months of heightened tensions resulting from Russia’s build-up of military forces near Ukraine’s borders. The Security Council held four meetings on the situation in Ukraine in the past month. The Council met on 31 January at the request of the US. On 17 February, Russia organised a briefing to mark the seventh anniversary of the Minsk II agreement of 12 February 2015, which outlined steps for ending the conflict in eastern Ukraine through a political settlement. On 21 February, the Council convened for an open meeting at the request of Ukraine, with support from several Council members, including Albania, France, Ireland, Norway, the UK, and the US. That meeting followed Russia’s decision to recognise the independence of the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine and an escalation of fighting in and around those areas. (For more information, see our 31 January, 16 February and 22 February What’s in Blue stories.)

In the evening of 23 February, the Council again held an extraordinary meeting at the request of Ukraine, after the authorities of the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics requested military assistance from Russia. At that meeting, the US announced that it would table a draft resolution on Ukraine. While the Council was in session, Putin announced the commencement of the “special military operation” in the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine.

Earlier on 23 February, the General Assembly held a regular session on the agenda item, “The situation in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine”. At that meeting, Guterres reiterated that Russia’s actions constituted a violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and were inconsistent with the principles of the UN Charter. Russia expressed regret regarding the Secretary-General’s views and argued that his statements “do not meet his status and authorities as defined by the UN Charter”. Ukrainian Minister for Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba said that Putin is trying to “prove that the UN is weak, indecisive and unable to defend its core principles” and warned that, if member states fail to hold Russia accountable, Russia’s acts of aggression will inspire others to follow suit.

Draft Resolution

The draft resolution in blue condemns Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, calling it a violation of article 2 in paragraph 4 of the UN Charter, which states that all member states shall refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the UN.

Acting under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, the draft text determines that the situation in Ukraine constitutes a breach of international peace and security, and that Russia has committed acts of aggression against Ukraine. It appears that during the negotiations, China expressed a preference for a Chapter VI resolution. (Chapter VI addresses the pacific settlement of disputes and Chapter VII deals with threats to the peace, breaches of the peace, and acts of aggression. Chapter VII allows the Council, once it determines a threat to the peace, a breach of the peace or an act of aggression, to take measures, including the use of force.)

The draft resolution also reaffirms the Council’s commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity and condemns Russia’s military operation. In this regard, the text decides that Russia shall immediately cease its use of force against Ukraine and completely withdraw its military forces from within Ukraine’s internationally recognised borders. Condemning Russia’s decision to recognise the independence of the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, the draft resolution decides that Russia should unconditionally reverse its decision and work towards the full implementation of the Minsk agreements.

In addition, the draft text in blue expresses concern regarding reports of civilian casualties; calls for ensuring humanitarian access and respect for the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law and human rights; and encourages continued engagement by the Secretary-General, member states and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).

At the time of writing, it seems that the resolution has the support of 11 Council members. While Russia is expected to use its veto, China’s position remains unclear. Its statements at Security Council meetings on Ukraine indicate that it shares Russia’s concerns over NATO’s expansion. During the 17 February briefing on Ukraine, China argued that “regional security should not rely on muscling up or even expanding military blocs” and that this applied as much to Europe as to other regions of the world. In its statement, China complained of a certain country that has been “ganging up in the Asia Pacific region, creating trilateral and quadrilateral small cliques, and bent on provoking confrontation”. These reservations may lead China to use its veto or abstain on the resolution.

A Russian veto will prevent the resolution from being adopted. If this happens, members are anticipating a possible vote on a similar resolution in the General Assembly. Ukraine has asked for an “emergency special session” of the General Assembly pursuant to General Assembly resolution 377 (V) of 3 November 1950, also known as “Uniting for Peace”. This resolution states that “in any cases where the Security Council, because of a lack of unanimity among its five permanent members (P5), fails to act as required to maintain international peace and security, the General Assembly shall consider the matter immediately and may issue appropriate recommendations to UN members for collective measures, including the use of armed force when necessary, in order to maintain or restore international peace and security”. This action can be triggered either by a resolution from the Security Council, or the General Assembly.

There have been seven instances when following a veto, the Council then adopted a resolution referring the situation to the General Assembly. The period of time for the Council to vote on such a resolution in these seven cases, which cover the period from 1956 to 1982, ranged from adoption on the same day as the vetoed resolution, to two weeks later. (A Council resolution referring the issue to the General Assembly is considered procedural and as such not subject to a veto.) In several instances, the General Assembly requested a meeting under Uniting for Peace to consider a matter that the Council had not been able to address. Such a resolution needs the votes of the majority of General Assembly members to pass.

6,b66daff8-8990-40b3-a8c0-def47a4e2e52,[],,"NEW YORK (AP) — The UN Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting on Ukraine for Wednesday night, just hours after diplomats from dozens of countries took the floor at the General Assembly to deplore Russia’s actions toward the country and plead for diplomacy as fears of a new war in Europe grew.

Citing an “immediate threat of Russian offensive,” Ukraine requested the council session after Russia said that rebels in eastern Ukraine had asked Moscow for military assistance.

The council, where Russia holds the rotating presidency this month, was meeting just two days after another emergency session saw no support for Russia’s decision to recognize two rebel regions of Ukraine as independent and to order Russian troops there for “peacekeeping.”

Council diplomats are now finalizing a draft of a resolution that would declare that Russia is violating the UN Charter, international law, and a 2015 council resolution on Ukraine, a diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the discussions were private. The resolution would urge Russia to come back into compliance immediately, the diplomat said.

With Russia holding veto power in the council, though, the resolution is doomed to achieve little more than a symbolic show of contempt for Moscow’s moves.

At the General Assembly meeting earlier Wednesday, Russia and ally Syria defended the Kremlin. But even China, which usually takes Russia’s side at the UN, spoke up for the world body’s longstanding principle of respecting countries’ sovereignty and internationally recognized borders, while not mentioning Russia by name.

Meeting a day after Western powers and some other countries imposed new sanctions on Russia, the 193-member General Assembly didn’t take any collective action. But the comments from nearly 70 nations, with more scheduled for Monday, represented the broadest forum of global sentiment since the crisis dramatically escalated this week.

Countries from Guatemala to Turkey to Japan condemned Russia’s embrace of the separatist regions’ independence claims or voiced support for Ukraine.

“Ukraine, you’re not alone,” Bulgarian Ambassador Lachezara Stoeva said.

US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield exhorted countries “to get off the sidelines.”

“There is no middle ground here. Calling for both sides to de-escalate only gives Russia a pass. Russia is the aggressor here,” she said.

Thomas-Greenfield warned that the confrontation could spiral into a refugee crisis, estimating that as 5 million people could be displaced and could make food prices spike in developing countries where Ukraine supplies wheat.

Echoing a narrative being broadcast to Russians at home, Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia portrayed his country as responding to the plight of beleaguered people in the breakaway areas. Russia claims Ukraine is engaging in violence and oppression, which Ukraine denies.

“We urge you today to focus on reining in Kyiv,” Nebenzia said.

Syria accused the West of using the assembly to pressure Moscow.

“The Ukrainian crisis was created by the Western states, led by the United States, to divide people and to undermine Russian security,” Ambassador Bassam al-Sabbagh said.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba implored countries to use tough economic sanctions, strong messages and “active diplomacy” to get Russia to back off. A lackluster response would jeopardize not only Ukraine but the concept of international law and global security, he warned.

“We need to use this last chance for action and stop Russia where it is,” Kuleba said.

Russia seized Ukraine’s Crimea Peninsula in 2014, and pro-Russia rebels have since been fighting Ukrainian forces in the eastern areas of Donetsk and Luhansk. More than 14,000 people have been killed in the conflict.

After weeks of rising tension as Moscow massed over 150,000 troops on Ukraine’s borders, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday recognized the two regions’ independence and ordered Russian forces there as what he called “peacekeepers.”

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres disputed that, saying they are troops entering another country without its consent.

“Our world is facing a moment of peril,” Guterres told the assembly.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/un-security-council-calls-emergency-meeting-to-denounce-moscow/
