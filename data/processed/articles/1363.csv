“This is the first time in recent history that Denmark has donated weapons to a country at war,” she said.

Exact type unconfirmed

Neither she nor the defence minister, Morten Bødskov, revealed the exact type of armament.

Kristian Lindhardt, a military researcher at the Defence Academy, told TV2 the missiles could be armoured rockets of the type M72 EC LAW (Enhanced Capability Light Antitank Weapon).

It is also the assessment of DR’s defence analyst Mads Korsager Nielsen.

Easy to use missiles

These missiles are extremely easy to handle. They are carried on the shoulder and only weigh a few kilos.

It is a weapon particularly suited to short-range firing at lightly armoured vehicles, such as the personnel carriers used by the Russians in Ukraine. Special training is not required to operate them.

Nevertheless, some of the more recent tanks would not be destroyed by them, claims Nielsen.

“You might be able to force the tank to stop by, for example, shooting off its belts,” he said.

A bit more than that

Apart from the 2,700 missiles, Denmark is also sending components taken from 300 Stinger missiles that were to be disposed of.

A few weeks ago, Bødskov said he would investigate whether Denmark could help Ukraine with the weapons. Shortly afterwards, it was confirmed the Stinger missiles were so old they could not be used in their current state.

“Denmark is ready to supply components of the approximately 300 Stinger missiles so that the US can make its own Stinger missiles operational,” explained Bødskov.

You can go if you want

The government has also announced that Denmark will send body armour, first aid bags, and a mobile hospital to Ukraine, as well as 50 million kroner in humanitarian aid.

It will not officially send personnel, but in response to a call for help from Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, Frederiksen has confirmed that people in Denmark – Ukrainians or not – are welcome to travel to the warzone to help the Ukrainian army.

“Anyone who wants to join the defence of Ukraine, Europe, and the world can come and fight alongside the Ukrainians against the Russian war criminals,” said Zelensky.

In response, Frederiksen said: “It is a choice each individual can make. This applies both to Ukrainians living here and to others who believe they have something to contribute directly to the conflict.”",https://cphpost.dk/?p=131676

“Right now we are seeing a completely unique heroic effort by the Ukrainian people to beat back a superior power, and that is what we want to help Ukraine with, and that is why we are doing this with open eyes and a straight back,” said Frederiksen, referring to the 2,700 shoulder-launched anti-tank missiles being sent to Ukraine.

Only a few weeks ago, she said she would investigate whether Denmark could help Ukraine with weapons – specifically the much-publicised Stinger missiles.

“Denmark is ready to supply parts of the approximately 300 Stinger missiles that the Defence Force has itself put up for disposal”, said Bødskov, adding that a broad majority in parliament was behind the decision.

As Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has called on ‘all citizens around the world, friends of Ukraine, peace and democracy’ to fight, Frederiksen said Danes were free to go and fight in Ukraine.

“It is a choice each individual can make. This applies both to Ukrainians living here and to others who believe they can contribute directly to the conflict,” she said.

Earlier on Sunday, Jakob Ellemann-Jensen, leader of the liberal party Venstre, said that people who want to fight on Ukraine’s side should be able to do so without losing their Danish residence permits, according to Ekstrabladet.

The government already announced earlier that Denmark would send body armour, first aid bags and a mobile hospital to Ukraine, as well as 50 million kroner in humanitarian aid.",https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/short_news/denmark-to-send-weapons-allow-nationals-to-fight-in-ukraine/
