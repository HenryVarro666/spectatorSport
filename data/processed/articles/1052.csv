The Russian Ministry of Defence claims to have information about plans of the Ukrainian special services to carry out a chemical attack in Pervomaiskyi (a town in the Lozova district, Kharkiv oblast). This may indicate that the Russians are actually preparing such an operation themselves.

Igor Konashenkov, Verbatim: ""According to confirmed information, Ukrainian special services are preparing a major provocation using toxic substances in the town of Pervomaiskyi, Kharkiv oblast.

A warehouse containing 120 tons of chlorine on the territory of the Khimprom production association has been mined by the Security Service of Ukraine.

The plan is to blow up this warehouse so that Russia can be accused of causing a chemical catastrophe that will kill local residents.""

Details: Igor Konashenkov failed to provide any evidence of any such planning or preparation by the Ukrainian special services.

The Russian aggressors have repeatedly resorted to information provocation, accusing the other side in advance to conceal their own involvement in the use of prohibited weapons or war crimes.

The most recent example is when the Russian authorities accused the Ukrainian military and Western journalists of allegedly carrying out the massacre in Bucha, rather than the Russian aggressors who were based there throughout March.

Background:

On 10 March, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned the Russian aggressors that any use of chemical weapons would be severely punished. He added, ""If you want to know Russian plans, look at what Russia is accusing others of doing.""

In March, Ukraine's Western partners said they had intelligence that Russia was considering using chemical weapons against civilians with a provocation set up in advance.

And in mid-March, the Russian military command eagerly distributed reports about the development of secret biological weapons and the deployment of ""secret American biolaboratories"" in Ukraine.

The UN responded that there was no evidence that Ukraine had developed biological weapons or had secret laboratories on its territory.",https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2022/04/6/7337683/

“This is another Russian war crime for which everyone involved will be held accountable,” Zelenskyy said in a video message, referring to Friday’s missile strike, whose victims included five children.

EU accuses Russia of train attack as von der Leyen, Borrell head to Kyiv The EU accused Russia of a deadly attack on a train station in eastern Ukraine on Friday (8 April) as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen headed to Kyiv.

“World powers have already condemned Russia’s attack on Kramatorsk. We expect a firm global response to this war crime,” he continued.

World leaders condemned the attack in the Donetsk capital, with US President Joe Biden accusing Russia of being behind a “horrific atrocity” that the French condemned as a “crime against humanity.”

At least 52 people including five children were killed, the regional government said, while Zelenskyy reported 300 wounded, saying the strike showed “evil with no limits”.

Zelenskyy said the bombing had been reported in Russia before the missiles had even landed and called for more weaponry to counter Moscow’s aggression.

“I am sure that the victory of Ukraine is just a matter of time, and I will do everything to reduce this time,” he added.

AFP journalists saw the bodies of at least 30 people under plastic sheets next to the station.

Body parts, packed bags and stuffed animals were flung across the floor.

On the station forecourt, the remains of a missile were still visible.

It was tagged with white paint with the words “for our children” in Russian, an expression frequently used by pro-Russian separatists in reference to their losses since the start of the first Donbas war in 2014.

“I was in the station. I heard, like, a double explosion. I rushed to the wall for protection,” said Natalia, searching for her passport among the abandoned belongings.

Another woman in a state of shock told AFP: “I saw people covered in blood entering the station and bodies everywhere on the ground.”

Russia denied being behind the missile strike, which came with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell in Kyiv for talks with Zelenskyy and to visit the scene of civilian killings in the town of Bucha.

Russia faces “decay” because of ever tougher sanctions and Ukraine had a “European future”, Von der Leyen said at a news conference with Zelenskyy.

Six weeks into President Vladimir Putin’s invasion, Moscow has shifted its focus to eastern and southern Ukraine after stiff resistance ended plans to swiftly capture the capital Kyiv.

‘All this horror’

Russian troops appear set on creating a long-sought land link between occupied Crimea and the Moscow-backed separatist statelets of Donetsk and Lugansk in the Donbas region, where civilians have been urged to flee heavy shelling that has laid waste to towns and complicated evacuation efforts.

“There is no secret — the battle for Donbas will be decisive. What we have already experienced — all this horror — it can multiply,” warned Lugansk regional governor Sergiy Gaiday.

In the city of Lozova west of Kramatorsk, more than 15,000 people have fled, Oleg Sinegubov, head of the Kharkiv regional military administration, said on Telegram.

“There are still about 50 thousand [people]. A large number of people will leave. Departures are organized both by rail and own vehicles,” he said, adding that fighting was taking place nearby.

In the south, the Black Sea port city of Odessa girded for rocket attacks, imposing a weekend curfew.

Residents and Ukrainian officials returning after a Russian withdrawal from an area near Kyiv, meanwhile, were taking stock of the scale of the devastation.

Bucha, where authorities say hundreds were killed — some with their hands bound — has become a byword for the brutality allegedly inflicted under Russian occupation.

But Zelenskyy warned worse was being uncovered.

“They have started sorting through the ruins in Borodianka,” northwest of Kyiv, he said in his nightly address. “It is much more horrific there. There are even more victims of Russian occupiers.”

Conflict in the area has wrought massive destruction and bodies are only now being retrieved, with 27 recovered from two destroyed buildings, according to Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova.

Fresh allegations also emerged from Obukhovychi, northwest of Kyiv, where villagers told AFP they were used as human shields.

Regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said the station was hit by a Tochka U short-range ballistic missile containing cluster munitions, which explode in mid-air, spraying lethal bomblets over a wider area.

Cluster munitions are banned under a 2008 convention. Russia has not signed it but has previously denied using such armaments in Ukraine.

The Russian defence ministry was quoted by RIA news agency as saying the missiles said to have struck the station were used only by Ukraine’s military and that Russia’s armed forces had no targets assigned in Kramatorsk on Friday.

Russian television showed graphics of the presumed trajectory of the missile, suggesting it came from a zone controlled by the Ukrainian army. Commentators on the Russian First channel TV said this was a “false flag” operation by Kyiv.

Bloggers however contradict Russia’s thesis that the country no longer has Tochka U missiles and posted footage of what apparently is a Russian convoy of such weaponry.

Pro-Russian journalists filmed a Tochka missile launch today from near Donetsk that was apparently heading towards Kramatorsk. Like with MH-17, the most damning evidence of this war crime comes from pro-Russian sources before they knew what they filmed. https://t.co/VVgPNwIYZI — Nathan Ruser (@Nrg8000) April 8, 2022

‘Help us now’

Moscow has denied targeting civilians, but growing evidence of atrocities has galvanised Ukraine’s allies in the EU, which has approved an embargo on Russian coal and the closure of its ports to Russian vessels.

The bloc has frozen €30 billion in assets from blacklisted Russian and Belarusian individuals and companies, it said Friday.

It also blacklisted Putin’s two adult daughters and more than 200 others as part of its latest sanctions package, according to an official list published late Friday.

The United States and Britain had already sanctioned the Russian leader’s daughters.

US is targeting Putin's daughters Katerina and Maria The United States’ latest round of sanctions on Russia includes two new targets: Russian President Vladimir Putin’s two adult daughters, Katerina and Maria, who US officials believe are hiding Putin’s wealth.

En route to Kyiv, Borrell told journalists the EU would supply 7.5 million euros to train Ukrainian prosecutors to investigate war crimes, which Russia is accused of committing.

At the United Nations General Assembly, 93 nations voted Thursday to suspend Russia from the body’s human rights council, prompting accusations from Moscow that the move was “illegal and politically motivated.”

“Russia’s lies are no match for the undeniable evidence of what is happening in Ukraine,” Biden said, calling the invasion “an outrage to our common humanity”.

Ukraine has welcomed new pressure on Moscow, but it continues to push for harsher sanctions and more heavy weaponry.

“Either you help us now — and I’m speaking about days, not weeks — or your help will come too late and many people will die, many civilians will lose their homes, many villages will be destroyed,” foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said after meeting NATO foreign ministers in Brussels.

Britain said Friday it was sending Ukraine more “high-grade military equipment” including Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles and 800 anti-tank missiles, while Slovakia said it had given Ukraine an S-300 air defence system.

Spurred by reports of Russian atrocities outside Ukraine’s capital, and alarmed at signs that Russia’s invasion force is about to escalate assaults in eastern Ukraine, many civilians in that region are fleeing while they can, officials said Wednesday.

“The cities of the Luhansk region are in ruins,” warned one eastern governor. “Thousands of residents have not yet left. Get out of the way!”

The exodus accelerated as Western nations moved to provide more weapons to Ukraine’s military and further ostracize Russia economically with new sanctions, including restrictions on its leading banks and on the assets of President Vladimir V. Putin’s children.

The new sanctions are a response to outrage and revulsion over the atrocities, including executions and torture, that appear to have been carried out by Russian forces before they retreated from areas outside Kyiv in the past few weeks. Russia has denied responsibility, saying the atrocities were fabricated or were committed by the Ukrainians themselves.

The European Union also was weighing a ban on coal from Russia, the leading provider of fossil-fuel energy to Europe, and Russia appeared to move closer to default on its foreign debt because of U.S. currency restrictions.

“Together with our allies and our partners, we’re going to keep raising the economic costs and ratchet up the pain for Putin, and further increase Russia’s economic isolation,” said President Biden, who has described Mr. Putin as a war criminal and suggested he should not remain in power.

More than 11 million Ukrainians — roughly one in four — have fled their homes since the Feb. 24 invasion, according to the United Nations, including more than four million who have fled the country. It is the biggest refugee crisis in Europe since World War II.

The Russian military announced last week that it would focus its campaign on eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting for eight years. The redeployment came as the Russians, hampered by botched planning and fierce Ukrainian military resistance, retreated from the Kyiv area and apparently abandoned — at least for now — any effort to capture the capital in their war to subjugate the former Soviet republic.

Western military analysts have said the Russians vastly underestimated the challenges in Ukraine and that their initial invasion force of more than 150,000 has been weakened by losses, exhaustion and low morale. But that does not mean Russia’s military cannot undertake a powerful new assault in eastern Ukraine.

The shift has accelerated civilian displacement in the east. Thousands of people have been leaving, according to Ukrainian officials, and photos and videos posted online. Ukrainian officials say Russian troops have been massing in the Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv regions.

In Kramatorsk, a city in the north of the Donetsk region, photos showed crowds of people huddled at a platform in a central train station.

At least two people were killed and five injured when Russian forces launched a strike on a humanitarian aid site in the town of Vugledar in the Donetsk region, according to Pavlo Kyrylenko, the Donetsk governor.

Russian forces now control 60 percent of the town of Rubizhne, in the Luhansk region, according to the governor there, Serhiy Haidai, who said the attackers had scaled up their offensive this week.

“Evacuations are taking place under the roar of enemy guns,” Mr. Haidai wrote in a Facebook post on Wednesday, saying that approximately 30,000 people had left the region since Russia invaded. He urged remaining residents to flee before Russia scaled up attacks.

Oleg Synegubov, the state administrator for the Kharkiv military region, said Wednesday in a post on Telegram that the army would evacuate two towns in the eastern part of the country because fighting was escalating there.

The towns, Lozova and Barvinkove, are southwest of Izium, a city Russian forces seized as part of an apparent drive toward Sloviansk, which military analysts say is strategically critical to Russia’s plan to gain full control of eastern Ukraine.

Earlier this week, Oleksiy Danilov, the head of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, speaking on national television, said “large groupings of Russian troops” had been massing in the region.

“They are not going to stop,” he said. “They have a great desire to create big problems for our armed forces in this direction, and we also expect that fierce battles will be fought there for our territory in the near future.”

The Pentagon’s assessment of Russian deployments appeared to corroborate what Ukrainian officials were saying. Pentagon officials said Russia had withdrawn all of its troops arrayed against Kyiv and another city in the north, Chernihiv, and sent them back to Russia or to its ally Belarus to rearm, resupply and possibly redeploy in eastern Ukraine.

The Pentagon officials said those forces included as many as 40,000 troops that, in many cases, had departed under fierce attack from the Ukrainian military units that retook the territory.

“We believe they are all out,” one senior Pentagon official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential operational issues.

Russia now has about 30 battalion tactical groups — as many as 30,000 troops — in the east, the senior Pentagon official said. Earlier this week, Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden’s national security adviser, said Russia would most likely send “tens of thousands of soldiers to the front line in Ukraine’s east” in the coming weeks.

Largely in anticipation of this next major phase of the war, the Pentagon announced late Tuesday that it was sending $100 million worth of Javelin anti-tank missiles — roughly several hundred missiles — to Ukraine, where the weapon has been used with high success in destroying Russian tanks and other armored vehicles.

NATO foreign ministers, meeting this week, have been discussing how to further help Ukraine prosecute the war without entangling the alliance in direct combat with Russian forces.

The war, they said, is far from over, noting that however badly Russia’s forces have performed, and their retreat from areas around Kyiv notwithstanding, they are making slow and brutal progress in the east.

“Moscow is not giving up its ambitions in Ukraine,” said Jens Stoltenberg, NATO’s secretary general.

Ukrainian officials in a number of areas, including Mykolayiv in the south and the Luhansk and Donetsk regions in the east, have been sharing schedules of planned evacuations or links to online portals for people to sign up to join buses and trains that are transporting residents to safer places.

But in some besieged cities in the south, like Mariupol, it is already nearly impossible to leave, making evacuations sporadic and risky.

Attempts by the Red Cross to enter Mariupol to supervise civilian departures have repeatedly been scrubbed, leaving fearful residents to fend for themselves. On Wednesday, 500 people who had escaped Mariupol to join a Red Cross convoy in the nearby city of Berdyansk arrived in Zaporizhzhia, about 100 miles away.

The climate of fear gripping Mariupol has spread to the region of Kherson, near the Black Sea, where people have lived under occupation by Russian forces since they encircled and entered the city and its suburbs on March 2.

“Anyone who did not leave early is now stuck here,” said Evgeniya Selivantseva, a doctor from Velyka Lepetyka, a village on the Dnipro River, in the Kherson region.

Dr. Selivantseva, 38, described a deepening humanitarian crisis in the village: Gasoline stations have run out of fuel, and food and medical supplies are running low. Food is so scarce that local leaders have started a makeshift flour mill.

“We feel helpless and totally defenseless,” she said. “People are afraid to leave their homes.”

The proposed European Union ban on Russian coal, part of the bloc’s effort to further penalize Russia over atrocities in Ukraine, reflected a choice of an imported energy source that would be the easiest to replace.

Deliberations over the ban and other sanctions were set to continue into Thursday, and European Union officials and diplomats anticipated that the measures would be approved. The process reflected the challenges of reaching agreement among all 27 member nations on the penalties, which would also include banning Russian ships from E.U. ports.

If approved, the sanctions would be the harshest enforced by the bloc since the invasion.

Though the European Union depends on Russian coal, the bloc could find substitute imports more easily than for natural gas and oil.

But banning coal from Russia could send energy prices soaring for European consumers, given the existing shortages in the bloc, according to Rystad Energy, a consulting firm. Carlos Torres Diaz, a senior vice president at Rystad, called the potential sanctions “a double-edged sword.”

The chairman of the Russian metals firm Rusal has called for an impartial investigation into the killing of civilians in Bucha.

What happened? Shocking images of the carnage in Bucha were captured by Agence France-Presse on Saturday, the same day Ukraine declared the town liberated from Russian troops. Accounts of alleged Russian atrocities are emerging as its forces retreat from areas near Kyiv following a failed bid to encircle the capital.

The town of Bucha has endured five weeks of near-constant firefights. Now officials and human rights groups are blaming the civilian deaths on the departed Russian forces.

“Reports from the Ukrainian city of Bucha shocked us. We believe that this crime should be thoroughly investigated. We support an objective and impartial investigation of this crime and call for severe punishment for the perpetrators. No matter how hard it may seem in the context of ongoing information war,” Rusal Chairman Bernard Zonneveld said in a statement earlier this week.

Zonneveld’s statement did not address who may be responsible for the atrocities but went on to say that “such incidents make this terrible tragedy all the more traumatic.”

“We all wish an early end to this fratricidal conflict, which destroys lives, families and entire cities. And we want those responsible for such crimes to be punished appropriately,” the statement reads.

Zonneveld, a Dutch citizen, added that Rusal is calling for an early peaceful resolution of this conflict “to preserve priceless human lives and return to normalcy.”

The founder of Rusal, Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska, who has called for peace in the past, said on Telegram last week that the war is “madness” and could have already been resolved through negotiations.

Author of the mural Sasha Korban

Today is April 6. Russia's military attack on Ukraine has been going on for six weeks. We're reporting on all the current news.

What about today?

Key points

The Air Force Command notes that the territory of the russian horde has changed the tactics of combat operations in the air; the russians are trying not to enter the zone of the defeat of our air defense and don't come into direct contact with the fighter jets. Instead, the enemy strikes missiles from the air, in particular from the airspace of Belarus.

Given this, our air defense is working non-stop; on Tuesday, April 5, the Air Force shot down eight cruise missiles of the russian occupiers.

Already 18,600 russian occupiers have died on Ukrainian land. The other day the jubilee 150th enemy plane was shot down!

The Security Service of Ukraine has obtained secret maps and lists of russian occupiers who were destroyed by the Ukrainian army in the Donetsk region. ""The maps were registered on February 22 and contain the occupiers' plans to seize the entire territory of Donetsk region,"" the SBU said in a statement. All documents will be included in the materials of criminal proceedings as evidence of the crimes of russians and putin personally for international courts.

""We are aware that the occupiers outnumber us. That they have more equipment. But we have no other choice, the fate of our people is being decided. We know what we are fighting for. And we are doing everything to win,"" Zelenskyy said in a new video message.

The UN confirms 1,500 victims since the start of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine. In fact, there are many more who have been killed and maimed by the occupiers.

The only way to prevent the expansion of the russian war outside Ukraine is to give us the fullest support, said Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. ""Maximum sanctions. All weapons. The policy of 'not provoking putin' has failed in recent years. Help us curb this evil now or risk putin checking Article 5 (NATO article that an attack on one member of the bloc is an attack on the whole bloc) later,"" Kuleba wrote.

Deputy Head of the Office of the President, Oleh Tatarov, allowed viktor medvedchuk, andrii portnov, and portnov's son to escape. This was stated by the Center for Combating Corruption. In addition, according to the CCC, tatarov is trying to unlock the accounts of the company of putin's oligarch Deripaska frozen in Ukraine (Mykolaiv Alumina Plant). How many more traitors will we learn about?

The Verkhovna Rada registered a draft resolution recognizing russia's actions in Ukraine as genocide.

The commander of the Georgian Legion fighting for Ukraine, Mamuk Mamulashvili, has stated that his unit will not take russian soldiers captive.

Humanitarian corridors

Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said she intended to evacuate Mariupol residents by a water corridor on a Turkish ship: ""There's a preliminary agreement between Erdogan and putin about opening a sea corridor for the Turkish ship to enter the Berdiansk port and take away about 100 wounded civilians, women, children, and Turkish citizens. Turkey wants to save its citizens and help us agree on a humanitarian corridor,"" Vereshchuk explained. According to her, negotiations on this corridor continue. She added that all routes and logistics are ready, but russia is pulling back.

As of April 6, 2022, 11 humanitarian corridors have been agreed upon:

From Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia by personal transport.

From Berdyansk to Zaporizhzhia by personal transport and buses.

From Tokmak to Zaporizhzhia by personal transport and buses.

From the city of Energodar to Zaporizhzhia by personal transport.

From the city of Gulyaypole to Zaporizhzhia by personal transport. Buses from the city of Zaporizhzhia with humanitarian aid will also be sent.

From the city of Melitopol to Zaporizhzhia by personal transport. Buses from the city of Zaporizhzhia with humanitarian aid will also be sent.

From Severodonetsk to Bakhmut. Meeting place: 28 Khimikiv Avenue.

From Lysychansk to Bakhmut. Meeting place: RTI, 40 Rokiv Peremohy, 324 Sosiury Street

From Popasna to Bakhmut. Meeting place: 42 Pervomaiska Street.

From the village of Hirske to the town of Bakhmut. Meeting place: 13 Haharina Street.

From Rubizhne to Bakhmut.

Residents of the Luhansk region are asked to evacuate from the region as much as possible. There will be five ""humanitarian corridors"" for evacuation today. Meeting places:

Severodonetsk: 28 Khimikiv Avenue;

Lysychansk: RTI, 40 Rokiv Peremohy, 324 Sosiury Street

Popasna: 42 Pervomaiska Street;

Hirske: 13a Haharina Street;

Nyzhne: 13 Parova Street;

Rubizhne: 11 Chekhova Street.

Authorities are urging people from Donetsk and Luhansk regions to evacuate immediately. After the start of a new offensive by the occupiers, it will be almost impossible to do it later, Minister of Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories, Iryna Vereshchuk, emphasizes.

The Kharkiv region is subject to partial evacuation, the Ministry of Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories clarified. Authorities in Kharkiv are advising residents of Lozova and Barvinkove ​​to evacuate.

The enemy plans to focus on eastern Ukraine, as the withdrawal of occupier troops from Kyiv and Chernihiv regions was by no means a ""gesture of goodwill"" before the next round of talks, as the russian authorities are trying to convey.

23:00 – During the day, almost 5,000 people were evacuated through humanitarian corridors, more than 1,200 of them from the Luhansk region, said Minister Vereshchuk.

Who's coming to Ukraine?

About financial aid, weapons, and volunteer fighters

Estonia handed over to Ukraine a batch of D-30 howitzers, ammunition for small arms, and bulletproof vests.

And the United States will allocate an additional $100 million for the purchase of anti-tank systems for Ukraine. This was announced by Secretary of State Blinken.

Thanks to concerts in different countries around the world, people managed to raise more than 83 million euros in support of Ukraine.

And the National Health Service of Great Britain will provide Ukraine with 20 ambulances. It is noted that the cars are not new, but will be able to replace cars destroyed as a result of hostilities in Ukraine. The first batch of ambulances will arrive in Lviv this week. From there, they will be sent to regions where hostilities continue.

The European Union does not want Ukraine to lose in the war and will therefore continue to arm it. This was stated by the head of the EU diplomatic corps Josep Borrell in a new statement on russia's invasion. At the same time, the representative of European diplomacy says that the European Union should avoid a direct conflict with russia.

In addition, German Chancellor Scholz said that Germany is sending all weapons from the Bundeswehr's reserves to Ukraine, which can be delivered quickly. What exactly this weapon is not yet disclosed.

20:30 – Biden said that today he signed a new package of defense assistance to Ukraine, which includes Javelin missiles.

Candles are lit in Stockholm in memory of those killed in Ukraine.

Yesterday, the European Union's executive body launched a new disciplinary procedure against Hungary, which could freeze Prime Minister Viktor Orban's funding for undermining liberal democratic rights. It seems that Orban rubbed the wrong way not only Ukraine with his commitment to the ""russian world.""

The United States will ban Russia from using frozen foreign currency accounts in US banks to repay sovereign debt, as was previously possible, the White House said.

Pope Francis unfurls a Ukrainian flag sent from Bucha.

In Romania, a car crashed into the gates of the russian embassy. The incident took place in Bucharest. According to local media, after the collision the car caught fire, and the driver died at the scene. It is still unknown whether this is a coincidence or a planned action.

Europe is proposing to discuss asylum for russian soldiers who refuse to fight against Ukraine; European Council President Charles Michel reported on the intention to provide protection to those who do not want to kill.

After winning the election, Hungarian Prime Minister Orban reaffirmed Hungary's intention to pay for russian gas in rubles. ""If Russia asks to pay in rubles, we will pay in rubles,"" Orban said. Apparently, he sincerely believes that putin will never ask Hungary to ""denazify.""

Anonymous said they had gained access to the Kremlin's video surveillance system. ""Now we are inside the Kremlin,"" hackers say.

In Vilnius, the lake near the Russian embassy was painted in the color of blood. This is an artistic performance to draw the world's attention to the war crimes of Russia. The red color symbolizes the blood of murdered Ukrainians. Water-based paint is not harmful to animals and plants.

And the Prime Minister of Slovenia Janez Janša published a picture of how, in his opinion, the symbol of the Russian occupiers Z was born:

russia's war against Ukraine is entering a critical phase, and NATO allies are ready to provide Kyiv with all necessary assistance to counter the possible next invasion of the invaders. This was stated by NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg before the meeting of the North Atlantic Council at the level of foreign ministers.

The United States will not participate in G20 meetings attended by Russia, said US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.

Reaction to the atrocities of the russian army in Ukraine

Israeli Foreign Minister Jair Lapid has accused russians of war crimes. This is the first sharp comment from Israeli officials regarding the genocide in Bucha.

India has condemned the killings in Ukraine's Bucha and backed calls for an independent investigation.

moscow knew and deliberately conducted a campaign of atrocities in Bucha near Kyiv. This was emphasized by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken last night before leaving for a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels. ""What we saw in Bucha is not an accidental act of a criminal unit. This is a deliberate campaign: to kill, torture, rape, commit atrocities,"" Blinken said.

Ukraine already has a list of names of non-humans involved in atrocities in the Kyiv region, said Interior Minister Denys Monastyrskyi. During reconnaissance near one of the settlements of the former Borodianka district, the Ukrainian military found the headquarters of one of the battalion tactical groups (BTG) of the horde. Among the documents found is a book of staff records, a list of personnel, combat and numerical calculation, as well as a table of call signs.

What's in Russia?

russia, through its permanent representative to the UN, Vasily Nebenzyu, has admitted that it is waging a war in Ukraine, not a ""special operation."" Nebenzya used the word ""war"" instead of ""special operation"" at the UN press conference several times and admitted that the russian army was killing civilians.

And zakharova said that russian diplomats expelled from Western countries would be employed. Will everyone be accommodated in Eritrea?

Civilian personnel of the russian army is complaining about inflation, trade unions are threatening to sue. Today, the russian military-industrial complex is beginning to experience social unrest because of a sharp decline in wages and living standards. This is a logical consequence of the astronomical costs of the war and the inability to ensure stable budget revenues because of international sanctions and economic downturns, the Defense Intelligence said.

""Finland's accession to NATO would make it a target for Russian retaliation,"" said Vladimir Dzabarov, first deputy chairman of the International Committee of the Federation Council. Earlier, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that Finland and Sweden can count on NATO membership under the accelerated procedure.

What about Belarus?

Belarus is losing its human rights: Human Rights Watch has been blocked.

Like belarus, the russian occupiers can use the territory of unrecognized Transnistria to attack Ukraine. The airfield of Tiraspol is already being prepared for the reception of aircraft. In response to such assumptions, Moldovan President Maia Sandu said that the authorities had no information about the alleged preparation of Tiraspol airport for the reception of Russian aircraft, but such a risk can not be ruled out.

In belarus, three residents of Bobruisk were detained who, according to the authorities, were trying to prevent trains with russian equipment from moving towards Ukraine.

Two Belarusian citizens were detained in Poland. They are suspected of espionage for the benefit of the belarusian secret services, according to a statement from the Polish National Prosecutor's Office. Among other things, they collected data on military and civilian facilities that are crucial for Poland's defense.

Russian lies

Belgorod residents have started poisoning pigeons because of a television lie about Ukrainian biolabs. But there's really nothing funny here: it shows the depth of the disease of the society created by television.

russian businessmen are trying to circumvent anti-russian sanctions; they are transferring business and capital to Turkey, which has not joined the sanctions against russia. For example, about 1,000 companies with 100% Russian capital have recently been opened in Turkey, said Izzet Ekmekcibashi, head of the Turkish-russian Business Council.

Trophies of the Ukrainian Armed Forces

The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine has allowed the territorial defense to use artillery and missile systems. This is stated in resolution №403. Previously, the Territorial Defense was allowed to use only small arms. Now our defenders will have many more battle trophies.

Kyiv and region

There is still a high probability that the enemy will launch missile strikes on elements of Kyiv's military and civilian infrastructure. The Head of the Kyiv city military administration Mykola Zhyrnov warned about it.

During the 35 days of russian occupation in Hostomel, Kyiv region, more than 400 people went missing.

In Borodianka, the occupiers bombed high-rise buildings and forbade getting people buried alive from under the rubble,"" the mayor said.

The mayor of Bucha, Anatolii Fedoruk, said that he had witnessed the execution of several people by russians. ""I myself saw several episodes. There were three civilian cars trying to evacuate towards Kyiv and they brutally shot them. There was a pregnant woman, her husband crying and begging not to shoot her, but they took and simply brutally shot them,"" the mayor reports.

russian General Vitalii Shkolenko, who ordered the shelling of Bucha and Irpin, turned out to be Ukrainian. He is a native of the Uman district of the Cherkasy region. He used to visit relatives from Bucha and Irpin many times. For such, hell must begin in life.

In Vorzel, the occupiers hung the heads of chickens on clothespins on clotheslines… The civilized world will never understand the purpose of such actions, but only one thing is clear, in the russian hinterland, where people who now destroy all life on our earth come from psychopathy is the norm. The russian army is implementing everything that only a sick human psyche can imagine.

Also Vorzel. These are corgi paws. There is a ladder behind the house. To which russian fascist villains nailed dogs with self-tapping screws and then flayed them here. And then ate! What they didn't eat, they put in a bag to warm the pieces up. What words to describe all the atrocities of the rabid horde?

""After Bucha, Irpin, Hostomel, we thought we were ready for anything. But Borodianka. This is the most horrible thing I've ever seen,"" said Oleksiy Kuleba, head of the Kyiv Regional Office. ""Rescuers from all over Ukraine are going to dismantle the blockages in Borodianka. The occupiers wiped the village from the face of the earth,"" Kuleba said.

Donetsk and Luhansk regions

One person died in Rubizhne last night. Five more were injured. This was announced by the head of the Luhansk Regional State Administration Serhii Haidai.

In addition, 11 residential buildings were destroyed in the region. Such are the consequences of yesterday's shelling by the russian army of the residential districts of Rubizhne, Lysychansk, Popasna, Severodonetsk, and Toshkivka. ""In the old part of Severodonetsk, garages caught fire; in Rubizhne, tanks with nitric acid are burning. Preliminary, without consequences. Three floors of the residential building in Popasna burned down at once. During the russian shelling, one Rubizhne resident died. 5 locals are wounded. Seven were taken out of the rubble alive,"" the statement said.

Heavy fighting and airstrikes by russian aircraft continue in besieged Mariupol. The humanitarian situation in the city is deteriorating. More than 160,000 people have no electricity, communications, access to medicine, heat, or water.

Former mayor of Rubizhne Serhii Hortov did not just side with the russian invaders; he passed on information about people with a pro-Ukrainian position to the occupiers. This was announced by the head of the Luhansk Regional State Administration Serhii Haidai. ""Apart from joining the occupiers, the mayor is also actively cooperating with them in identifying Ukrainian activists. He is simply betraying them. He is such a traitor who betrays people with a pro-Ukrainian position to the occupiers,"" the head of the region said.

At the same time, according to Haidai, Ukraine was able to ""slightly break the plans of the occupiers, who wanted to create a picture of how the mayor hands over the keys to the occupiers, and how they are welcomed."" He submitted a petition, and the president signed a decree establishing a military-civil administration in Rubizhne. This means that ""the mayor is now nobody,"" and even the russian occupiers no longer need this traitor.

Also today, the 503rd Marine Battalion refuted the statements of the russian media about the capture of personnel in Mariupol.

After the widespread international genocide in Bucha, Russia's top leadership ordered the destruction of any evidence of crimes committed by its army in Mariupol. The russians left all the dirty work to the collaborationists. Eyewitnesses report that the russians recruited local and DPR terrorists to special brigades.

Zaporizhzhia region

Five deputies from the OPZZh party in Mariupol were informants and fire adjustors of the occupiers. They helped the Russians quickly paralyze the city and create a humanitarian catastrophe, said the Mariupol City Council. Now the supporters of genocide in Mariupol are actively promoting the establishment of the occupation administration. All materials on collaborationists have already been submitted to the SBU.

In Vasylivka, Zaporizhzhia region, occupation forces looted a communal building housing the Department of Social Protection and the Service Center for Educational Institutions. They stole all computer equipment, including the one where databases with residents were stored. As a result of the russians' actions, it will be impossible to transfer pensions and other social benefits. Now local authorities have blocked the entrance to the premises so that the occupiers can no longer steal community property.

Red Cross brings Mariupol refugees to safety

A convoy of seven buses and at least 40 private cars carrying Ukrainian evacuees led by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) arrived in Zaporizhzhia, a city in southeast Ukraine.

The convoy had attempted to reach the besieged city of Mariupol 200 kilometers (120 miles) southeast but was unable to make it that far.

The ICRC said on Twitter that around 1,000 evacuees in total were escorted to Zaporizhzhia in the operation.

Most of them had been able to flee Mariupol on their own and were evacuated from nearby Berdiansk, where they had hunkered down after being internally displaced.

ICRC spokesperson Lucile Marbeau said, "" These people have really gone through the worst.""

""This convoy's arrival to Zaporizhzhia is a huge relief for hundreds of people who have suffered immensely and are now in a safer location. It's clear, though, that thousands more civilians trapped inside Mariupol need safe passage out and aid to come in,"" Pascal Hundt, the ICRC's head of delegation in Ukraine, said in a statement.

NATO expects Ukraine war could last 'years'

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said Russian President Vladimir Putin is unlikely to give up on his ambition to control Ukraine, and warned that the war could ""for many months, for even years.""

Stoltenberg added that NATO intelligence indicates Russia is preparing for a major offensive in eastern Ukraine with the aim of capturing the entire Donbas region to create a land bridge between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula.

""We need to support Ukraine, sustain our sanctions and strengthen our defenses and our deterrence,"" he told reporters in Brussels at the opening of a two-day meeting of NATO foreign ministers.

Liana Fix, a historian and political scientist with the Körber Foundation in Germany, told DW that it is clear NATO is trying to establish a ""red line"" when responding to extreme escalation by Russia, including deployment of chemical or tactical nuclear weapons.

""There are no details given on what a strong response would look like,"" she said. ""The only difficulty there is that, for instance, President Obama established a red line in Syria which was crossed and there were no significant consequences,"" she added.

US sanctions Putin's daughters and top Russian banks

The US has said it will impose ""severe and immediate economic costs on the Putin regime for its atrocities in Ukraine, including in Bucha.""

This includes freezing the US assets of Putin's daughters, Mariya Vorontsova and Katerina Tikhonova, and cutting them off from the US financial system.

Washington also said it will apply ""full blocking"" sanctions on Sberbank and Alfa Bank, Russia's largest public and private financial institutions.

This will block exposure of the bank's assets to the US financial system and prohibit US persons from doing business with them.

Other Russian elite targeted are Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, the wife and children of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, and members of Russia's Security Council, including former President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev.

""These individuals have enriched themselves at the expense of the Russian people. Some of them are responsible for providing the support necessary to underpin Putin’s war on Ukraine,"" a White House statement said.

Washington said the new sanctions were in response to ""war crimes"" committed by Russian forces in Ukraine.

On Tuesday, the European Commission proposed its next raft of Russia sanctions, with officials in Brussels saying a decision is expected by the end of this week.

EU has spent €35 billion on Russian energy since start of Ukraine war

Speaking to the European Parliament, EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said that the bloc had spent €35 billion ($38 million) on Russian gas, oil and coal since the Ukraine war began in late February.

Borrell cited the number to reemphasize the importance of reducing the EU's dependence on Russian energy imports.

""A billion euro is what we pay Putin every day for the energy he provides us since the beginning of the war. We have given him €35 billion. Compare that to the €1 billion that we have given to the Ukraine in arms and weapons,'' Borrell said.

He added the EU would need to expand renewable energy to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, and that the fight against climate change now goes hand in hand with geopolitics.

Speaking to the Irish parliament, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused some Western leaders of considering financial losses to be worse than war crimes.

""When we are hearing new rhetoric about sanctions ... I can't tolerate any indecisiveness after everything that Russian troops have done,"" he said referring to the atrocities revealed recently in Bucha.

""The only thing that we are lacking is the principled approach of some leaders — political leaders, business leaders — who still think that war and war crimes are not something as horrific as financial losses,"" added Zelenskyy.

The Ukrainian president also called on Ireland to convince its European Union partners to introduce ""more rigid"" measures against Russia.

Pope Francis kissed a battered Ukrainian flag that was brought to him from Bucha.

""This flag comes from the war, from that martyred city Bucha ... Let us not forget them. Let us not forget the people of Ukraine,"" he said during his weekly audience.

""Cruelty that is increasingly horrendous, even against civilians, defenseless women and children. They are victims whose innocent blood cries out up to heaven and implores: 'Stop this war!'"" he said.

The pontiff has criticized Russia's invasion of Ukraine several times and said last week he was considering a trip to Ukraine.

EU leaders consider more energy sanctions on Russia

The European Union will have to ban oil and gas imports from Russia to put pressure on Moscow to stop its war in Ukraine, EU Council President Charles Michel said on Wednesday.

""I think that measures on oil and even gas will also be needed sooner or later,"" Michel told the European Parliament.

So far, EU leaders are considering a ban on Russian coal — but not oil or gas — as part of a new package of sanctions in response to possible war crimes in Bucha.

""Now we have to look into oil and revenues Russia gets from fossil fuels,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the European lawmakers.

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said Tuesday the EU was working on a plan to end purchases of Russian fossil fuels altogether.

Austria and Hungary, however, were opposed to Russian oil and gas sanctions.

According to the International Energy Agency, Russian natural gas accounted for almost 40% of European Union gas demand in 2021.

The EU is the second-largest importer of Russian oil after China.

Ukraine's minister for foreign affairs, Dmytro Kuleba, has called on the EU to go further, saying ""difficult times require difficult decisions.""

Milley added that the US and other countries supporting Ukraine will be ""involved in this for quite some time.""

The general said that the US should establish ""permanent bases"" in eastern Europe, but with ""rotational"" rather than permanently stationed troops.

""My advice would be to create permanent bases but don't permanently station (forces), so you get the effect of permanence by rotational forces cycling through permanent bases,"" Milley said, adding that the Baltic States, Romania and Poland would be willing to pay for such bases.
