KYIV, Ukraine — From what was left of her fourth-floor balcony, an elderly woman tossed piece after piece of debris to the grass below. Out went heaps of glass, insulation and wood. She occasionally paused to survey the damage around her. She is among the scores of Ukrainian civilians displaced from their homes in Kyiv on Friday after an unidentified projectile struck just outside their apartment block before dawn, severely damaging the building and wounding several residents, including at least one in critical condition. The apparent Russian strike left behind a large crater that now sits just a few yards from a playground, which remained empty Friday except for one young boy digging in the dirt.

Total numbers of civilian casualties in Ukraine remain unclear with no comprehensive figures released by Ukraine’s government. Early Friday, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said at least 137 people — civilians and military personnel — had been killed in the Russian attacks.

But Russia is facing growing accusations that its barrages are hitting civilian areas, and the tally of Ukrainians killed or injured could climb sharply as Russian forces push into Kyiv and other major cities, many now surrounded by Russian forces.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov claimed Friday that “no strikes are being made on civilian infrastructure.”

But across the country, Ukrainians are huddled in bunkers and basements as the Russian advance into Ukraine deepens. Under international humanitarian law, warring parties are required to be able to justify their targets and avoid civilian infrastructure. Intentionally targeting civilian infrastructure can be factors in possible war crime charges.

On Friday, Amnesty International said Russia is carrying out “indiscriminate attacks on civilian areas and strikes on protected objects such as hospitals.”

Russian forces have used “explosive weapons with wide area effects in densely populated areas,” Agnès Callamard, the group’s secretary general, said in a statement, noting that some of these attacks may qualify as war crimes.

The International Committee of the Red Cross said in a statement Friday that four people were killed when a hospital in Donetsk was attacked on Thursday, in what it called a “direct contravention of international humanitarian law.”

Andriy Zablotskiy, 37, was asleep in one room and his wife and 5-year-old son were in another when the blast struck just outside their windows early Friday in Kyiv. They ran to their bathroom, but then, fearing the building might collapse, fled to the street in their pajamas. Despite the scale of the damage in their apartment, which is on the second floor, no one in the family was injured.

They later returned — and made sure to rescue their gray cat, Anatoly — before relocating to a friend’s house. Much of what was left in their apartment was covered in shards of glass that crunched under Zablotskiy’s feet as he gestured to the damage: Windows blown out. Their electric fireplace destroyed. Books, bottles of champagne and clothes strewn about.

To rebuild, he said, he will essentially have to start from scratch.

His family has lived in the apartment since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. His parents later moved to a village 30 miles from Kyiv, where they are now surrounded by Russian forces.

Despite his sadness, he said: “There’s nothing I can do, so I can’t really be worried.”

Outside, civilians and some uniformed cleanup crews plucked through the massive pile of debris, transferring it bit by bit to a wagon connected to a tractor that periodically hauled it away. Others gathered around to gape at the scene. Some filmed it on their phones and expressed gratitude that they themselves were not the ones wounded or displaced.

Crumpled air conditioners and satellite dishes hung off the building. A winter parka dangled from one of the top floors. A blown-out window revealed a glimpse into someone’s closet, where a fur coat hung from a hanger. Through another, there was a poster of the famous Ukrainian poet known as Kobzar Taras.

In one neighborhood in Kharkiv, in the country’s east, the target was probably the Academy of the National Guard. But what appeared to be a motor from a 300-millimeter Smerch artillery rocket apparently missed its intended target, landing instead in the middle of a crosswalk in a civilian area that includes apartment buildings, a large market and a KFC. It was eventually removed from the street and an orange barrier was placed around the crater it left behind.

It was unclear if the rocket carried a single warhead or cluster munitions, the latter of which are banned by most countries, with the exception of Russia, the United States and some others.

In another district just three miles away, the booster section of a Russian multiple-launch rocket system landed in the middle of the street, like an arrow lodged in the asphalt. It narrowly missed a produce store.

The Friday afternoon shelling was so close to Kharkiv’s city center that four men walking by the main square at that time started running for shelter at the sound of the loud booming. A group of people standing in line at the pharmacy promptly dispersed. The air smelled of sulfur.

An upscale hotel told its guests to shelter in the underground parking garage. One young girl started crying at the sound of bombardment.

About 45 minutes outside Kharkiv, the Russians targeted a military airfield in Chuhuiv, but the strike hit a residential apartment building, leading to multiple casualties that included a teenage boy.

The assault in Ukraine’s second-largest city, just 25 miles from the Russian border, has been largely kept to the outskirts. But Friday’s sporadic shelling could be heard as some locals waited in a long line at one of the few gas stations still open.

As people waited more than an hour for fuel, they wondered if they should leave Kharkiv and go west. But that would put them on a road going through Kyiv. Many planned to stay put — and just stock up on food, alcohol and cigarettes.

When a new series of explosions could be heard in the distance, people casually looked up to the gray winter sky. They didn’t get out of line, resorting to dark humor.

“We’re all going to get blown up while waiting to buy gas,” one man said.

In the shadow of giant blue and yellow letters spelling Kharkiv, army carriers were stopped at the entrance to the city. Nearby, the body of a Russian soldier, dressed in a green uniform, lay by the side of the road, wrapped in a light layer of snow that had fallen overnight.

Troops sent to capture the position had few details of the fighting, saying only that it happened on Thursday morning, with Russian President Vladimir V. Soon after Putin ordered the attack.

But strikes occasionally hit close enough to the city to elicit shrieks of terror from pedestrians, sending them fleeing into metro stations for cover.

Inside an underground station in central Kharkiv, terrified residents have been holed up for two days with their babies, pets and the few belongings — blankets, yoga mats and spare clothing — they could grab in short dashes to home and back, during breaks in the shelling. The city has parked trains in the station and allowed people to sleep in them.

Lidiya Burlina and her son, Mark, work in Kharkiv and were cut off from their home village, a two-hour train ride away, when the Russians moved in. They’ve been living in the metro station ever since. The stores in town are working only in the morning, Ms. Burlina said, and there is very little bread, which has dramatically increased in price in the two days since the war started. They cannot reach anyone in their village because the local power station was blown up.

“They’re sitting there in the cold, they can’t buy anything, and there’s no heat,” Ms. Burlina said. “And we’re here in the metro.”

Kramer']",2022-02-25 00:00:00,"KYIV, Ukraine — The Ukrainian defense forces, outmanned and outgunned, waged a ferocious resistance to the Russian invasion on Saturday, battling to keep control of the capital, Kyiv, and other cities around the country.

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine posted a video on Twitter, telling the public not to believe false reports.

He was alive. Kyiv had not fallen. Any reports of Ukraine laying down its arms was a lie, Mr. Zelensky said.

“I’m here,” he said. “We are not putting down any arms. We will protect our country, because our weapons are our truth. The truth is that this is our land, our country, our children, and we will protect them all.”

“That is it. That’s what I wanted to tell you. Glory to Ukraine.”

His comments, released before 9 a.m., came as fighting intensified in Kyiv. What until three days ago had been a thriving European metropolis has been transformed into a battle zone. Russian troops pressed in from all directions.

There was intense street fighting, and bursts of gunfire and explosions could be heard across the city, including its heart, Maidan square, where in 2014 Ukrainian protests led to the toppling of a pro-Moscow government.

The Russian military has a decisive edge in cyberwarfare, tanks, heavy weaponry, missiles, fighter planes and warships. In sheer numbers, its military dwarfs that of Ukraine.

Russia has established attack lines into three cities — Kyiv in the north, Kharkiv in the northeast and Kherson in the south — and Ukrainian troops are fighting to hold all three. The Pentagon reported late Friday that the Russians did not appear to be in control of a single major population center. Significantly, a senior U.S. defense official said, Ukrainian command and control remains intact.

The Ukrainian government reported that hundreds of Russian soldiers had been killed in the war, along with scores of their own soldiers, while the Russian defense ministry issued a statement on Saturday morning that made no mention of any casualties or anything about the fight for Kyiv.

The Russian invasion started with targeted airstrikes before dawn on Thursday, but on the third day of the war, bloody battles were often being waged in close quarters. Ukrainska Pravda, a Ukrainian news site, citing witnesses, reported combat 400 yards from Maidan Square in central Kyiv.

All Ukrainian men of fighting are being drafted into service, and tens of thousands are signing up. Ukrainians were asked to make Molotov cocktails. And there were tearful scenes at airports in western Ukraine as wives kissed their husbands goodbye before they headed to front.

The nation has rallied around its president, Mr. Zelensky, a former comedian.

To him and other officials, the objective of the Russian invasion of a neighboring country that possessed no military threat is to topple the government.

Mr. Zelensky has said that he is “target no. 1.”

As battles were waged around the city on Saturday morning, there were reports of clashes near the city’s train station and along a central thoroughfare, Bohdan Khmelnitsky Street, leading from Victory Square toward the city center, according to the witness accounts. Along that street, closer to the city center, bursts of gunfire could be heard through the night.

“We are stopping the horde, so far as we can,” the secretary of the Ukrainian Security and Defense Council, Oleksy Danilov, said around 7 a.m. “The situation is under control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and citizens of Kyiv.”

In dozens of interviews in the tense hours before the invasion and in the days after, Ukrainians struggled to understand how a country at peace so suddenly found itself at war. For many Ukrainians, the answer was found in Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin.

This is Mr. Putin’s war. But what frightened people perhaps as much as the threat of missiles and bombs was that they did not know what he wanted.

The fear was evident in the drive from Kyiv to a small village outside the city. Military convoys had replaced families going on vacation or visiting friends. Where once Kyiv was known as a city where the music played a touch too loud in its cafes, the incessant wail of air raid sirens drowned out all joy.

The fear was evident in the faces of the people seeking safety in Western Ukraine, after they emerged from 20-hour train rides in packed carriages that were kept pitch-black to avoid being targeting by Russian rockets.

From Lviv in the west to Odessa in the south and Kharkiv and nearly all points in between, people huddled in air raid shelters and lined up and bank machines and stocked up on essentials.

While the Russians, for the moment, were not in control of any city, it was only the first phase of a conflict that could stretch into weeks or longer.",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/02/25/world/russia-ukraine-war

Macron told reporters that Vladimir Putin had launched “massive” military attacks rather than the “targeted” ones that the Russian president had claimed he was undertaking.



Macron’s subsequent comments then reflected the concerns of some member states that the EU is not going far enough on sanctions.



He said: “It is an initial response, we have decided to inflict severe costs upon Moscow in different sectors, further measures at a government level will be taken”.



Despite calls from Kyiv, EU has not cut Russia off from the Swift international payments system.



The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (Swift) is used by over 11,000 financial institutions to send secure payment orders and is key to the movement of funds to Russia’s oil and gas sector.



Removing Russia from the system, it is argued, would make it close to impossible for financial institutions to send money in or out of the country, with consequences for both the country’s oil and gas sector and its European customers.

With reports of hundreds of casualties from the warfare — including shelling that sliced through a Kyiv apartment building and pummeled bridges and schools — there also were growing signs that Vladimir Putin’s Russia may be seeking to overthrow Ukraine’s government in his boldest effort yet to redraw the world map and revive Moscow’s Cold War-era influence.

In the fog of war, it was unclear how much of Ukraine remains under Ukrainian control and how much Russian forces have seized. The Kremlin accepted Kyiv's offer to hold talks, but with Russia in the driver's seat, it appeared to be an effort to squeeze concessions out of Ukraine's embattled president instead of a gesture toward a diplomatic solution.

The U.S. and other global powers slapped ever-tougher sanctions on Russia as the invasion reverberated through the world’s economy and energy supplies, threatening to further hit ordinary households. U.N. officials said they were preparing for millions to flee Ukraine. Sports leagues moved to punish Russia on global playing fields. And NATO leaders held an urgent meeting to discuss how far they can go to challenge Putin without engaging Russian forces in direct war.

Day 2 of Russia’s invasion focused on the Ukrainian capital, where Associated Press reporters heard explosions starting before dawn and gunfire was reported in several areas.

Russia’s military said it had seized a strategic airport outside Kyiv that allows it to quickly build up forces to take the capital. It claimed to have already cut the city off from the west — the direction many of those escaping the invasion are heading in, with lines of cars snaking toward the Polish border.

Intense fire broke out on a bridge across the Dneiper River dividing the eastern and western sides of Kyiv, with about 200 Ukrainian forces establishing defensive positions and taking shelter behind their armored vehicles and later under the bridge. Another key bridge leading toward the capital was blown away, with smoke rising from it.

Ukrainian officials reported at least 137 deaths on the Ukrainian side and claimed hundreds on the Russian one. Russian authorities released no casualty figures, and it was not possible to verify the tolls.

U.N. officials reported 25 civilian deaths, mostly from shelling and airstrikes, and said that 100,000 people were believed to have left their homes, estimating up to 4 million could flee if the fighting escalates.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pleaded with Russia’s government to hold talks, and with Western powers to act faster to cut off Russia's economy and provide Ukraine military help.

“When bombs fall on Kyiv, it happens in Europe, not just in Ukraine,” he said. “When missiles kill our people, they kill all Europeans.”

Zelenskyy’s whereabouts were kept secret, after he told European leaders that he was Russia's No. 1 target.

He also offered to negotiate on one of Putin's key demands: that Ukraine declare itself neutral and abandon its ambition of joining NATO. And the Kremlin responded that Russia was ready to send a delegation to Belarus to discuss that. But Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov suggested it was too late, saying Zelenskyy should have agreed to talks earlier on.

After denying for weeks he planned to invade, Putin argued that the West left him no other choice by refusing to negotiate on Russia’s security demands.

The autocratic leader hasn’t said what his ultimate plans for Ukraine are. Lavrov gave a hint, saying Friday: “We want to allow the Ukrainian people to determine its own fate.” His spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia recognizes Zelenskyy as Ukraine's president, but wouldn’t say how long the Russian military operation could last.

Ukrainians, meanwhile, had to abruptly adjust to life under fire, after Russian forces started moving in to their country from three sides in an invasion telegraphed for weeks, as they massed an estimated 150,000 troops nearby.

In a Kyiv apartment building, residents woke to screaming, smoke and flying dust. What the mayor identified as Russian shelling tore off part of the building and ignited a fire.

“What are you doing? What is this?” resident Yurii Zhyhanov asked — a question directed at Russian forces. Like countless other Ukrainians, he grabbed what belongings he could, took his mother, and set out to flee, car alarms wailing behind him.

Elsewhere in Kyiv, the body of a dead soldier lay near an underpass. Fragments of a downed aircraft smoked amid the brick homes of a residential area. Black plastic was draped over body parts found beside them. And people climbed out of bomb shelters, basements and subways to face another day of upheaval.

As air raids sirens sounded in the capital early Friday, guests of a hotel in the city center were directed to a makeshift basement shelter, lined with piles of mattresses.

“We’re all scared and worried. We don’t know what to do then, what’s going to happen in a few days,” said one of the workers, Lucy Vashaka, 20.

The Ukrainian military reported significant fighting near Ivankiv, about 60 kilometers (40 miles) northwest of Kyiv, as Russian forces apparently tried to advance on the capital from the north. Russian troops also entered the city of Sumy, near the border with Russia that sits on a highway leading to Kyiv from the east.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Kyiv “could well be under siege"" in what U.S. officials believe is a brazen attempt by Putin to install his own regime.

With social media amplifying a torrent of military claims and counter-claims, it was difficult to determine exactly what was happening on the ground.

The assault, anticipated for weeks by the U.S. and Western allies, amounts to the largest ground war in Europe since World War II. After repeatedly denying plans to invade, the autocratic Putin launched his attack on the country, which has increasingly tilted toward the democratic West and away from Moscow’s sway.

Zelenskyy, whose grasp on power was increasingly tenuous, appealed to global leaders for even more severe sanctions than the ones imposed by Western allies and for defense assistance.

“If you don’t help us now, if you fail to offer a powerful assistance to Ukraine, tomorrow the war will knock on your door,” said Zelenskyy, who cut diplomatic ties with Moscow, declared martial law and ordered a full military mobilization that would last 90 days.

The invasion began early Thursday with missile strikes on cities and military bases, followed by a multipronged ground assault that rolled troops in from areas in the east; from the southern region of Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014; and from Belarus to the north.

After Ukrainian officials said they lost control of the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear power plant, scene of the world’s worst nuclear disaster, Russia said Friday it was working with the Ukrainians to secure the plant. There was no corroboration of such cooperation from the Ukrainian side.

As Western leaders rushed to condemn and punish Russia, U.S. President Joe Biden announced new sanctions that will target Russian banks, oligarchs, state-controlled companies and high-tech sectors, saying Putin “chose this war."" He said the measures were designed not to disrupt global energy markets. Russian oil and natural gas exports are vital energy sources for Europe.

The European Union neared an agreement to slap asset freezes on Putin and Lavrov themselves, in addition to other sanctions. Britain is freezing the assets of all large Russian banks and planning to bar Russian companies and the Kremlin from raising money on British markets.

“Now we see him for what he is — a bloodstained aggressor who believes in imperial conquest,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson said of Putin.

Desperate Ukrainians fleeing the war became so crushed at the border with Poland that several people fainted and one woman is believed to have died, a British man has said.

Jeremy Myers became caught up in the crush with his Ukrainian girlfriend as people queued for 25 hours, with temperatures plummeting to minus four degrees at night, to escape bombs in the war-torn country.

Mancunian Jeremy, 44, described the 'crush' as 'beyond unsafe' and said one person was rumoured to have died in the 'pandemonium'.

'It was absolute pandemonium,' says business consultant Jeremy, speaking safely from Poland.

'There was very little organisation and the closer you got to the front, the more people were pushing and shoving.

'Every so often there would be these big surges and people would be screaming.

'There were lots of young children and it felt very dangerous. Terrifying.

'Fights broke out as people accused others of pushing in or of hurting them. People had blood running down their faces. We saw a couple of women fainting and being carried above the crowd.

'And there was a strong rumour that someone had been crushed to death – the Polish border guards confirmed they had heard it was true.

'It was beyond unsafe. I have got bruises on me from all the pushing and I am just pleased that we finally managed to make it to Poland.'

Tens of thousands of Ukrainians rushed to the borders on Saturday as invading Russian troops pressed on with their march toward Ukraine's capital of Kyiv.

At least 150,000 people have fled Ukraine into Poland and other neighbouring countries in the wake of the Russian invasion, the UN refugee agency said Saturday.

It comes after dramatic video on Saturday showed a destroyed Russian convoy with Z-markings near Kherson in the south of the country on the third day of fighting after Ukraine's army held control of Kyiv and last night successfully repelled Russian advances on the capital.

In addition to the video of the destroyed convoy, another video purportedly showed the destruction of a 20-vehicle Russia military column in Kharkiv.

Images of the carnage is the snow - from which it is suspected there were no survivors - appear to show Putin's invasion suffering brutal losses.

Kyiv's defence ministry has so far put Russia's losses at around 2,800 troops, 80 tanks, 516 armoured vehicles, and 10 airplanes and seven helicopters so far.

As the war continues to rage on in Ukraine, Mancunian Jeremy Myers told of the 'pandemonium' at the Polish border as tens of thousands Ukrainians desperately tried to flee the country.

Jeremy had flown to Ukraine to spend Valentine's Day with his girlfriend of two years, Maria Romanenko, 29, a journalist and anti-Putin activist.

Her Kyiv-based family were convinced that Putin would not invade and that it was safe for the pair to stay in the country.

But on Thursday morning, they woke up to the news that the invasion had started.

Maria, who is a well-known Putin critic, reluctantly agreed to leave the country.

A few weeks ago, a photo of her wearing a bracelet which said 'f**k Putin' went viral in Ukraine – and she could be liable for arrest if the Russian army reached Kyiv.

A friend agreed to drive the couple to the border, where they joined huge convoys making the journey from Kyiv to the small border crossing of Shehyni.

Policemen were turning back cars ten miles from the border to ensure men under 60, who have been called up to defend the country, didn't try and escape.

But when the policemen saw Jeremy's passport, they waved him through saying: 'After what the English have done to help us, we will let you through.'

Jeremy said there was a festive atmosphere when they first reached the small village of Shehyni. But that quickly dissipated once people realised how slow the queue was moving.

'There were probably about 2,000 people queuing in the first bit,' he said.

'It was mainly women and children with some older people. There were also a few overseas students.

'After that initial queue we headed towards a rectangle space, which also had thousands of people, and then into a smaller cage-like pen. At each stage people were getting closer and closer together.

'No one was keeping any order. There were just a couple of soldiers with guns and when anyone went up to them and asked if they could organise the people they just glared back really menacingly.

'At certain times a chant would go up that they needed to set up a separate queue – a corridor for women with young children – but that was ignored.

'People were trying to help each other if they could, but everyone was in the same miserable position.

'The scariest part was when we got close to the booths – we'd been standing up for about 12 hours by then – as that's when it really felt like we were in a dangerous crush.

'There were only three people working in the booths – they were meant to be processing people before they reached passport control - and it was painstakingly slow.

'There were no toilets and no place to get food or even water. There wasn't even space to sit down so people had no choice but to stand for hours on end even though they were exhausted.'

Once they had got through the first queue, they were then faced with a second one for passport control, which took another 12 hours.

Once they were through that, the Polish border was a completely different experience.

'It was fully manned and we got through there quickly,' says Jeremy.

'Once we were through, there were hundreds of volunteers who gave us food and drink and even clothes. People were standing there with signs offering to take people wherever they wanted to go for free.

'Some people drove us two and a half hours to Krakow where we have friends and refused any payment.'

Jeremy intends to return home to the UK once Maria, a former student at the University of Leeds, gets a visa which will enable her to join him.

'I feel physically and emotionally wrecked,' said Jeremy. 'But I am pleased to be in a place of safety.'

Tens of thousands of Ukrainians rushed to the borders on Saturday as invading Russian troops pressed on with their march toward Ukraine's capital of Kyiv.

At least 150,000 people have fled Ukraine into Poland and other neighbouring countries in the wake of the Russian invasion, the UN refugee agency said Saturday.

Some walked many miles through the night while others fled by train, car or bus, forming lines miles long at border crossings. They were greeted by waiting relatives and friends or headed on their own to reception centres organised by neighbouring governments.

'The numbers and the situation is changing minute by minute,' said Joung-ah Ghedini-Williams, a spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.

'At least 150,000 people have fled, they are refugees outside of Ukraine. At least 100,000 people - but probably a much larger number - have been displaced inside Ukraine.'

The agency expects up to four million Ukrainians could flee if the situation deteriorates further.

Those arriving were mostly women, children and the elderly after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy banned men of military age from 18 to 60 from leaving.

Some Ukrainian men were heading back into Ukraine from Poland to take up arms against the Russian forces.

In contrast to other conflicts around the globe, Russia's unprovoked attack on the Western-looking democracy has ignited a huge outpouring of support for the fleeing Ukrainians.

This included an unconditional welcome from nations like Poland and Hungary that did not want to accept those fleeing conflict and poverty in the Middle East and Africa.

Regular people were also opening up their homes to refugees and volunteering at welcome centers. In Poland, a Facebook page was formed where people were offered rides in private cars from the border and other help.

Volunteers even came from elsewhere in Europe to pick up refugees, among them a German couple from Hamburg who held up a sign at the Polish border town of Medyka saying they could take three people home with them.

'Our country is not doing anything, and we felt we needed to do something,' said Tanja Schwarz, 51.

Despite the goodwill, the crush of people became a very real ordeal.

One family from Chernivtsi in western Ukraine waited 20 hours before being able to cross the border into Siret in northern Romania. Natalia Murinik, 14, cried as she described saying goodbye to grandparents who couldn't leave the country.

'It really hurt, I want to go home,' she said.

The largest numbers were arriving in Poland, where two million Ukrainians have already settled to work in recent years, driven away by Russia's first incursion into Ukraine when it annexed Crimea in 2014 and seeking opportunities in the booming economy of the European Union neighbor.

Poland's government said Saturday that more than 100,000 Ukrainians had crossed the Polish-Ukrainian border in the past 48 hours alone.

Poland declared its border open to fleeing Ukrainians, even for those without official documents, and dropped its requirement to show a negative COVID-19 test.

The line of vehicles waiting to enter Poland at Medyka stretched many miles into Ukraine.

A woman from Lviv named Lena described seeing toys and heavy bags along the way that people had abandoned. She was bringing her four children to safety in Poland and planned to return to join her husband. Like other Ukrainians returning home as their country fights Russia, she would only give her first name.

Even Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, one of Europe's most anti-migrant leaders, traveled to the border town of Beregsurany, where he said Hungary was accepting all citizens and legal residents of Ukraine.

'We're letting everyone in,' Orban said.

Among those arriving at that point were a Ukrainian-British family with their dogs. 'We can't leave our dogs,' said Vlasta Terasova, arriving from Uzhhorod.

On Saturday, Poland sent a hospital train to pick up those wounded in the war in Mostyska, in western Ukraine, and bring them to the Polish capital of Warsaw for treatment. The hospital train left the border town of Przemysl with five carriages to transport the wounded and four others stocked with humanitarian aid for Ukraine's Lviv district.

The U.N. said said most Ukrainians were heading to neighboring Poland, Moldova, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia but some even fled into Belarus - from which some Russian forces entered Ukraine. Some planned to head further on to other countries in Europe.

The border post in Siret was crowded with Ukrainians on Saturday and humanitarian groups set up tents a few miles in and offered food and drink to those arriving.

Despite the welcome, teenager Natalia Murinik's family didn't know where they were going next.

'We don't have a clue. We're waiting for our friends, and then we'll think,' she said.

Elsewhere, the head of Britain's MI6 Secret Intelligence Service said he believes Russia's war in Ukraine will prove 'unwinnable' because President Vladimir Putin will never attain political victory over the country's people.

Richard Moore, the chief of MI6, wrote how a report suggesting Putin's forces will ultimately fail in Ukraine because it underestimated its neighbour's military strength and fierce determination 'makes sense to me'.

The article Moore, 58, was reacting to was penned by Lawrence Freedman, the Emeritus Professor of War Studies at King's College London.

In the article titled 'A Reckless Gamble', Professor Freedman said Putin had 'become obsessed with Ukraine, and prone to outrageous theories which appear as pretexts for war but which may also reflect his views.'

He wrote that victory for Moscow does not come in the form of a successful invasion that overthrows Ukraine's government, but with winning over the people of Ukraine.

This, the professor writes, is something Russia does not have the strength for.

'Even if the government loses control of the capital and is forced to flee, and the command systems for Ukrainian forces start to break down, that does not mean that Russia has won the war,' he wrote.

In an unusual move for the chief of MI6, Moore shared the article with his over 130,000 Twitter followers, writing: 'Fascinating. Makes sense to me.'

In a rebuke of Putin's human rights record, Moore also wrote around the same time in a separate tweet: 'With the tragedy and destruction unfolding so distressingly in Ukraine, we should remember the values and hard-won freedoms that distinguish us from Putin, none more than LGBT+ rights.'

Moore's endorsement of the article came as other intelligence sources claimed Putin's war with Ukraine is not going to plan due to Kremlin 'overconfidence', poor tactical planning, and 'shock' at the fierce resistance put up by brave Ukrainians fighting for their nation's survival.

Ukraine's military is asking people to remove the names of streets, cities and villages from road signs in their regions in order to 'confuse and disorient the enemy'. In a tweet, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence said: 'We will do everything possible to clear Ukraine of the Russian occupier as soon as possible!'.

A sign over a part of the Boryspil highway triumphantly declared: 'Russian warship, go f**k yourself!', in reference to the killing of a small group of Ukrainian border guards stationed at Snake Island off the coast of Ukraine after they refused to surrender to Kremlin forces.

Estonia's former defence chief Riho Terras has now claimed that Putin's war is not going to plan because Russia is fast running out of money and weapons, and will have to enter negotiations with Volodymyr Zelensky's government if Kyiv holds off the Russians for 10 days.

Russia's tyrant has allegedly convened a meeting with the oligarchs in a bunker in the Ural Mountains, at which it is claimed that he furiously vented that he thought the war would be 'easy' and 'everything would be done in one to four days'.

Citing Ukrainian intelligence sources, Terras claimed that the war is costing Russia around £15billion-per-day, and that they have rockets for three to four days at most, which they are using sparingly.

He claimed that Putin's plan has relied on panicking the country, firing missiles at residential buildings 'at random' to 'intimidate' the Ukrainians, trigger mass army desertions, national surrender, and Zelensky's flight from the country. Terras also alleged that Russian special operations have been near Kyiv since February 18, and had planned to swiftly seize the capital and install a puppet regime.

'The Russians are in shock of the fierce resistance they have encountered. The Ukrainians must avoid panic! ... Ukraine must stay strong and we must provide assistance!', he wrote on Twitter.

However, in a worrying sign for Ukraine, video from Russia's Western border with Ukraine showed TOS-1 heavy flamethrower tanks moving towards its neighbour. The tanks are capable of firing high-power thermobaric weapons - dubbed the 'father of all bombs'.

In Russian, 'TOS' stands for 'heavy flame thrower'. However, what the TOS-1 launches is perhaps even more frightening - fuel-air explosives (FAE) that cause a 'wall of napalm'. As the bomb explodes, it scatters dust that ignites when it meets oxygen, causing the very air around it to appear as if it is bursting into flames.

Russia's Interfax news agency claimed Moscow had captured the southeastern city of Melitopol. Ukrainian officials were not immediately available to comment on the fate of Melitopol. If the Interfax report about Melitopol, which cited Russia's defence ministry, is confirmed, it would be the first significant population centre that the Kremlin has seized.

However, Britain's armed forces minister James Heappey cast doubt on the report, saying the city of some 150,000 people was still in Ukrainian hands and that fighting in the capital was so far confined to 'very isolated pockets of Russian special forces and paratroopers' and that 'the main armoured columns approaching Kyiv are still some way off'.

The Ukrainian health minister said 198 people have been killed and more than 1,000 wounded in the Russian offensive. Viktor Lyashko said there were three children among those killed.

His statement was unclear whether the casualties included military and civilians. He said another 1,115 people, including 33 children, were wounded in the Russian invasion.

It was later reported that a further 19 civilians were killed in shelling in Ukraine's east, while two were reported killed in a strike on a tower block early on Saturday - bringing the civilian death toll to 219.

Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov claimed Saturday that since the start of Moscow's attack, its military had hit 821 Ukrainian military facilities, 87 tanks and other targets.

Konashenkov didn't say how many Ukrainian troops were killed and didn't mention any casualties on the Russian side. Neither his claims nor Ukraine's allegations that its forces killed thousands of Kremlin troops could be independently verified.

HOW IS PUTIN'S WAR NOT GOING TO PLAN?

MONEY

According to Ukrainian intelligence sources, Putin's war with Ukraine is costing the Russian economy around £15billion-per-day alone – meaning the Kremlin will have spent around £45billion by the end of today in fighting Ukraine.

Writing on Twitter, Terras claimed that Russia would be forced to enter negotiations with Ukraine if Kyiv can hold off the Kremlin's advance for 10 days, by which point Russia will have spent around £150billion.

Though it is widely believed that the Russian dictator will have factored Western sanctions into his calculations, the combined effect of punitive measures on Russia's banking system will further squeeze its economy.

The United States, Britain, Japan, Canada, Australia and the European Union unveiled more sanctions on Moscow on top of penalties earlier this week, including a move by Germany to halt a gas pipeline from Russia.

President Joe Biden delivered further measures to target Russian banks, oligarchs and high-tech sectors, while the EU unveiled its own new package including financial, energy and technological sanctions.

WEAPONS AND RESOURCES

Citing Ukrainian intelligence, Terras also claimed that Russia has rockets for 'three to four days at most' which they use 'sparingly'.

He added: 'They lack weapons, the Tula and 2 Rotenberg plants can't physically fulfil the orders for weapons. Rifles and ammo are the most they can do.

'The next Russian weapons can be produced in 3-4 months – if even that. They have no raw materials. What was previously supplied mainly from Slovenia, Finland and Germany is now cut off.

'If Ukraine manages to hold the Russians off for 10 days, then the Russians will have to enter negotiations. Because they have no money, weapons, or resources'.

OVERCONFIDENCE

Terras also claimed that at a meeting of the oligarchs in his lair in the Urals, Putin was 'furious' and ranted about how he thought the war would be 'easily' won in 'one to four days'.

He continued: 'Russia's whole plan relies on panic – that the civilians and armed forces surrender and Zelensky flees.

'They expect Kharkiv to surrender first so the other cities would follow suit to avoid bloodshed. The Russians are in shock of the fierce resistance they have encountered'.

WHAT'S THE STATE OF PLAY TODAY?

HELICOPTERS, JETS AND PLANES

The mayor of a city south of the Ukrainian capital claimed that the country's military has fended off a Russian attempt to take control of a military air base.

Natalia Balansynovych, the mayor of Vasylkiv, about 25 miles south of Kyiv, said on Saturday that Russian airborne forces landed near the city overnight and tried to seize the base. She said fierce fighting also raged on Vasylkiv's central street.

She said that Ukrainian forces repelled the Russian attacks, and that the situation is now calm. Balansynovych claimed there were heavy casualties, but didn't give any numbers.

At around 3am on Saturday, fighting between Russia and Ukraine broke out at Vasylkiv, which is home to a Cold War-era base.

Ukraine's military claimed a Russian IL-76 military transporter planer was brought down, reportedly with 150 paratroopers on board. Sources in the city then claimed that Russian soldiers, allegedly dressed as Ukrainian police, ambushed a checkpoint.

Heavy fighting ensued in Vasylkiv, as Putin's forces tried to gain a foothold in the south from which to launch their attack on Kyiv.

At around 4am, Ukraine's Defence Ministry claimed 'two enemy targets were shot down' – identifying them as a Russian SU-25 helicopter and a military bomber – near the separatist zone in the east.

At around 4am, a second Russian military transport plane was shot down near Bila Tserkva, 50 miles south of Kyiv, according to two American officials with direct knowledge of conditions on the ground in Ukraine. The Russian military did not comment on either plane.

Ukraine's State Security Service (SBU) denied a report earlier on Saturday that Russian helicopters had landed in the Lviv region, a development that would have signalled a widening of the theatre of Moscow's invasion.

The mayor of Lviv, Andriy Sadovyi, said Russia had landed three helicopters near the city of Brody in the western Lviv region and that Ukrainian forces had repelled the attack.

The SBU said the information was false and that no such landing had taken place. It said a Ukrainian helicopter had done a reconnaissance flight in the area.

'We ask residents to remain calm!', the SBU said in a statement posted on Facebook.

Sadovyi's office declined to comment and the SBU declined further comment. The Lviv regional administration said that footage circulating on social media of a helicopter firing rockets in the Lviv region was Ukrainian, not Russian.

GROUND FORCES

Earlier, small arms fire and explosions were heard in the capital's northern district Obolonsky as what appeared to be an advance party of Russia's invasion force left a trail of destruction.

Ukrainian forces reported fighting with Russian armoured units in two locations between 40-80 kilometres north of Kyiv.

Ukraine's military claimed Russia had 'attacked one of the military units on Victory Avenue in Kyiv' but that the assault had been 'repulsed'. It also reported another incident northwest of the capital.

Kyiv said 137 people, including soldiers and civilians, have been killed during the fighting, and claimed that 2,800 Russian service personnel have died.

An adviser to Ukraine's president says that fighting is raging in the capital and in the country's south, and that the Ukrainian military is successfully fending off Russian assaults.

Russian forces were also focusing on the country's south, where intense fighting is underway in Kherson just north of Crimea, and in the Black Sea ports of Mykolaiv, Odesa and around Mariupol, it was claimed.

Mykhailo Podolyak said that Russia considers it a priority to seize the south, but it has failed to make any significant gains.

Britain claimed that Russian forces have not captured the south-eastern Ukrainian city of Melitopol and armoured columns advancing on the capital Kyiv have been held up by Ukrainian resistance.

Armed forces minister James Heappey said on Saturday it was the British assessment that Russia had so far failed to capture any of its day one targets for its invasion of Ukraine, which began on Thursday.

'Even Melitopol, which the Russians are claiming to have taken but we can't see anything to substantiate that, are all still in Ukrainian hands,' Heappey told BBC radio.

'The fighting ... reported on the outskirts of Kyiv overnight, we understand to just be Russian special forces and pockets of paratroopers. The reality is that the armoured columns that were coming down from Belarus and the north that were going to encircle Kyiv are still some way north because they've been held up by this incredible Ukrainian resistance.'

Russian missiles pounded Kyiv on Friday, families cowered in shelters and authorities told residents to prepare Molotov cocktails to defend Ukraine's capital from an assault that the mayor said had already begun with saboteurs in the city.

But an American official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, suggested a mixed picture for the Russian effort to press an offensive that Washington and Kyiv say is aimed at decapitating the government and installing a puppet regime.

'We do assess that there is greater resistance by the Ukrainians than the Russians expected,' the senior defence official said, adding Ukraine's command and control of its military 'remains intact'.

'They are not moving on Kyiv as fast as what we believe they anticipated they would be able to do. That said, they continue to try to move on Kyiv.'

Still, Russia has not yet mobilized the majority of its forces arrayed around Ukraine, the official said, assessing that just about one-third have now been 'committed' to its offensive.

Although most of the Russian targeting has been against Ukrainian military installations, some of the missiles have landed on civilian residential areas, the official said.

Ukraine's military was putting up a fight, the official added.

'They are fighting for the country,' the official said, noting that Russia had yet to establish control of the airspace above Ukraine or used the extent of its electronic warfare capabilities. 'In general, the Russians have lost a little bit of their momentum,' the official said.

RUSSIA'S ACTIONS

Kyiv officials are warning residents that street fighting is underway against Russian forces, and they are urging people to seek shelter.

The warning issued Saturday advised residents to remain in shelters, to avoid going near windows or on balconies, and to take precautions against being hit by debris or bullets.

The Ukrainian military said a battle was underway near a military unit to the west of the city center.

A rescue worker says at least six civilians were injured by a rocket that hit a high-rise apartment building on the outskirts of the Ukrainian capital.

Petro Prokopov, a firefighter who was taking part in rescue efforts, said the building on the southwestern edge of Kyiv near Zhuliany airport was hit between 16 and 21 floors on Saturday. He said at least six people were injured and apartments on two floors were gutted by fire. Emergency responders have evacuated 80 people.

AFP saw a dead man in civilian clothes lying sprawled on the pavement as nearby medics rushed to help another man whose car was crushed by an armoured vehicle.

Separately, Ukraine's Infrastructure Ministry said a Russian missile was shot down before dawn Saturday as it headed for the dam of the sprawling water reservoir that serves Kyiv.

'If the dam is destroyed, the flooding will cause catastrophic casualties and losses – including flooding of residential areas of Kyiv and its suburbs,' the ministry said.

Marine who blew himself up to destroy a bridge and halt advancing Russian troops is made a 'Hero of Ukraine' - the country's highest honour Volodmyr Zelensky has declared a marine who blew himself up along with a bridge near Crimea to repel advancing Russian forces a Hero of Ukraine. According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Vitaly Shakun was manning the Henichesk bridge in the Kherson region when Kremlin troops advanced and the battalion decided the only way to stop them was to blow up the bridge. It was mined, and Shakun had no time to get out. He texted them and told them he was going to blow up the bridge. Seconds later, they heard an explosion, a post on their Facebook page said. Shakun's efforts dramatically slowed down the Russian advance and allowed his comrades to regroup and re-deploy, the Ukrainian General Staff added. Zelensky has now made Shakun a Hero of Ukraine, the highest national title that can be conferred upon an individual citizen by the country's president.

This image was shared by Ukrainian state news agency Ukrinform on Thursday A post on the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine's Facebook page detailed his heroic efforts In an emotional speech to the besieged nation uploaded to Facebook, the Ukrainian President also accused Moscow of attempting to seize Kyiv, overthrow the government and install a 'puppet' regime 'like in Donetsk', one of two separatist regions which warmonger Vladimir Putin officially recognised before launching an all-out invasion. Declaring 'we derailed their idea', Zelensky added: 'The fights are going on in many cities and areas of our state. But we know that we are protecting the country, the land, the future of our children. Kyiv and key cities around the capital are controlled by our army. 'The [Russian] occupants wanted to block the centre of our state and put here their marionette, like in Donetsk. We derailed their idea.' Zelensky pushed for Ukraine's urgent ascension to the European Union, saying he discussed the issue with the EU leaders. He also urged cutting Russia from the SWIFT international electronic bank payment system, noting that Germany and Hungary should show 'courage' and agree to the move. Briefly switching to Russian, he claimed that thousands of Kremlin troops were killed and hundreds of those who were taken prisoner 'can't understand why they were sent into Ukraine to kill and get killed'. Thanking Russians who spoke out against the war and asked them to keep up the pressure on the Kremlin, he said: 'The sooner you say to your government that this war should be immediately stopped, the more of your people will stay alive.'

COULD RUSSIA LOSE THE WAR?

Despite Western fears, American officials believe that Putin's assault and attempted seizure of Kyiv has become bogged down.

While Russian special forces have reached the suburbs of Kyiv, the bulk of Moscow's heavy armour is believed to be still more than 30 miles away from the capital.

Britain claimed that Russia's invasion of Ukraine has been slowed by strong Ukrainian resistance.

Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said fighting in Kyiv was so far confined to 'very isolated pockets of Russian special forces and paratroopers'. He added that 'the main armored columns approaching Kyiv are still some way off'.

Heappey said: 'It looks like the Russian plan is nowhere near running to schedule. I think that will be a great cause of concern for President Putin and rather points to the fact that there was a lot of hubris in the Russian plan and that he may be awfully advised.'

However, Western officials fear that Putin could resort to high-power thermobaric weapons – dubbed the 'father of all bombs' that vaporize bodies and crush internal organs – as brave Ukrainians resist his attempts to take control of Kyiv.

Thermobaric weapons – also known as vacuum bombs – are high-powered explosive that use the atmosphere itself as part of the explosion. They are among the most powerful non-nuclear weapons ever developed.

A thermobaric bomb dropped by the US on Taliban in Afghanistan in 2017 weighed 21,600 pounds and left a crater more than 1,000ft wide after it exploded six feet above the ground.

Thermobaric weapons were developed by both the US and the Soviet Union in the 1960s. In 2007, Russia detonated the largest thermobaric weapon ever made, which created an explosion equivalent to 39.9 tons. The US version of the weapon reportedly costs over $16million each.

The official said: 'My fear would be that if they don't meet their timescale and objectives they would be indiscriminate in their use of violence.

'They don't adhere to the same principles of necessity and proportionality and rule of law that Western forces do.'

'Will we declare war on Russia? No': Armed Forces Minister James Heappey insists NATO troops will not be sent in to Ukraine as he admits 'ultimate economic sanction' of removing Russia from the SWIFT system will require 'further diplomacy' NATO troops will not set foot in the Ukrainian theatre of war as Britain presses ahead with its plans to enact the 'ultimate economic sanction' and boot Russia out of the SWIFT international payment network. Armed Forces Minister James Heappey warned that any further financial penalties were being held up in the courts and reiterated the Government's desire to see Russia expelled from the international SWIFT banking system. Speaking during his media round of interviews on Saturday morning, Mr Heappey also stopped short of committing sending NATO troops to fight in Ukraine. 'You're asking me if we will declare war on Russia? No,' was his answer when pressed by veteran journalist Martha Kearney on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Armed Forces Minister James Heappey reiterated NATO troops will not be entering the Ukrainian theatre of war Pictured: Ukrainian soldiers walk around debris of burning military trucks in a street in Kyiv, Ukraine, Saturday, February 26 In later comments to the BBC, Mr Heappey said the Government's position on removing Russia from the international SWIFT financial servers was clear. 'The reality is that SWIFT is not a unilateral decision the UK can take. If it were, the Government's position is clear and we will push ahead with every means at our disposal. 'Clearly, it's the ultimate economic sanction. It's the one the UK government wants to see enacted.' It was also revealed that the Government will continue to supply arms in its efforts to aid the Ukrainian's attempt to repel the Russian invasion and the Ministry of Defence is working on plans to potentially support a resistance movement and a government in exile if Ukraine was finally overrun. Warning that the Ukrainian conflict could last for months to come, Mr Heappey added: 'Nobody should think that this is anywhere near over. 'What stands in front of Ukraine, its armed forces and very tragically its people, is days, weeks, months more of what we have seen over that last 48 hours'. Advertisement

Ukraine's SECOND Tiananmen moment: Local man climbs on top of Russian tank before kneeling on the ground in bid to stop military convoy as Putin's men face fierce fight back on the streets

Another brave Ukrainian local has been captured on video trying to single-highhandedly block the advance of a Russian military convoy - in scenes reminiscent of Tiananmen Square's 'tank man' blocking Chinese forces in 1989.

The footage emerged as Moscow's forces continued their illegal invasion of the country, where Ukrainian soldiers and citizens alike are putting up a fierce resistance against Vladimir Putin's invading army.

Video of the brave face-off showed a column of Russian tanks passing through a junction in a Ukrainian town.

As the hulking vehicles rumbled through, one man decided to take a stand, heroically climbing on to the front of one of the tanks. It continued forward a few meters, but then came to a halt, blocking the route of those following.

Once the tank was no longer moving, the man can be seen climbing down from the tank and kneeling in the middle of the road, blocking the progress of the Russian convoy.

Recognising the futility of the man's protest, onlookers are seen trying to drag the man away from the tank.

However, defiant in his protest, the man continues to hold on to the front of the tank.

The incident came after a similar confrontation went viral on Friday, which saw another man bravely walk into the middle of the road and into the path of another column of Russian military vehicles passing through Ukraine.

The footage, thought to have been filmed in the south of the country close to Crimea, shows the man bravely waving down the convoy in an attempt to block its path.

Some military vehicles in the procession swerve around the man, but others are shown stopping for him, bringing those behind them to a complete stop as well.

The man has since been dubbed 'Tank Man' on social media, and while his identity is now known, his bravery quickly drew praise from others inspired by his protest which has become emblematic of Ukraine's resistance.

Cargo ship 'belonging to Russian bank that is pivotal' to country's defence sector and among those targeted by UK government sanctions against Moscow is SEIZED in the English Channel

A cargo ship bound for St. Petersburg was intercepted in the English Channel early on Saturday as the latest trade sanctions begin to hit at the Russian economy.

The 416ft commercial boat named the 'Baltic Leader' is understood to belong to Promsvyazbank, one of the five major Russian banks which were hit with crippling EU sanctions this week, and was seized in the English Channel early on Saturday morning.

Promsvyazbank was named in the House of Commons as one of five Russian state-owned financial institutions that would be hit with sanctions.

Meanwhile, a US Treasury document said 'Baltic Leader' was owned by Promsvyazbank, which was described as 'systemically important' to Russia's defence industry.

Maritime officers have been given the power to intercept and seize vessels suspected of contravening EU-backed sanctions of Russia in the wake of the Ukrainian invasion.

In what is understood to be the first instance of Russian assets being frozen while in transit, the boat was intercepted by customs officials near Honfleur, in Normandy, after departing from the French city of Rouen.

French authorities said the ship, which has been loaded with cars, belonged to a company suspected of violating trade sanctions linked to the ongoing war in Ukraine.

'Baltic Leader' had arrived in the French city of Rouen on February 19 and spent almost six days docked there until departing on Friday night.

The vessel had been expected to reach St. Petersburg on Thursday, March 3.

Captain Véronique Magnin, regional communication officer for the maritime prefecture, said the ship was then diverted to the French port of Boulogne-sur-Mer between 3 and 4am (2/3am GMT) and that ongoing checks were being carried out by customs officials.

Those aboard 'Baltic Leader' are said to be co-operating with the investigation. The process could take up to 48 hours.

Captain Magnin said the boat is 'strongly suspected of being linked to Russian interests targeted by the sanctions'.

One official was quoted by the BBC saying: 'It has been taken to the French port after a request by the French government because it is suspected of belonging to a company targeted by EU sanctions against Moscow.

'French boarder forces are currently investigating the cargo ship. Crew aboard the 'Baltic Leader' has been cooperating with French authorities.'

The Russian embassy in France is said to be 'seeking explanations' from French authorities behind the seizure of one of its cargo ships.

A spokesperson in Paris told the Russian TASS news agency the boat's captain had called the embassy, which had then contacted French officials.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10555203/British-man-describes-terrifying-CRUSH-Polish-border-one-woman-believed-DIED.html

KHARKIV, Ukraine — Ukraine’s military was fighting a fierce battle to push back Russian forces from Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, on Friday, a day after a vicious battle that burned down a highway leading to the city. At least one body with and on the carrier.

In the shadow of giant blue and yellow letters spelling Kharkiv, army carriers were stopped at the entrance to the city. Nearby, the body of a Russian soldier, dressed in a green uniform, lay by the side of the road, covered in a light layer of snow that had fallen overnight.

Troops sent to capture the position had few details of that battle, saying only that it took place on Thursday morning, with Russian President Vladimir V. Immediately after Putin, ordered to attack,

“Putin wants us to throw away our weapons,” said a Ukrainian soldier named Andrei, stationed in the ditch, hurriedly dug into the black soil by the side of the road. “I think we can act smarter, assemble our army and launch a counterattack.”

Far in the distance but close enough to be felt, artillery shells were booming. The Russian army, which pushed to the border on Thursday from its staging area near Belgorod, about 40 miles from Kharkiv, has turned mighty north of the city. It was unclear where else they would proceed.

Most of the fighting was taking place near a village called Tsarkuni, a few miles from the city limits. Military and civilian casualties as a result of the fighting were unclear, but on Friday local police said a 14-year-old boy had died in a village near Kharkiv after a shell struck near his home. But the attacks sometimes get close enough to the city, triggering panic screams from pedestrians, forcing them to hide in subway stations.

While Russian officials have said their forces were attempting to escape from civilian areas, the body of a Smerch rocket, fired by Russian forces by Ukrainian authorities, stuck vertically in the middle of the road outside the National Guard headquarters. went. A few kilometers away, the tail section of the rocket was buried in the asphalt in front of the onion-domed Orthodox Church.

A team of emergency services officers wearing jackets and helmets were trying to get the tail off the sidewalk, but were having trouble. A member of the team stated that the tail and body were separate stages of the rocket, possibly as explosive ordnance was fired toward its target near the front lines.

“That’s 200kg of metal,” said the emergency officer, pointing to the rocket’s story. “It could fall through a building or affect people.”

Even though the barrage of artillery intensified, not everyone was ready to hide. Roman Balkaliev was wearing camouflage, with a double-barreled shotgun hanging over his shoulder as he marched towards the source of the artillery boom on the outskirts of Kharkiv.

“I live here, this is my house. I’m going to defend it,” said Mr. Balakaliev, who also took out a large knife, which he had tied to his back as if to show it. “I don’t think Russians understand me like I understand them.”

After a while, Mr. Balakaliev reached the edge of the city, where Ukrainian troops were surrounded by abandoned Russian military transports. They watched as he passed by. No one stepped forward to stop him. One soldier said: “Victory intent.”

Mr. Balakaliev, with his eyes fixed and his gun ready, took to the road in the direction of the boom and saw a tall billboard that read: “Protect the Future: Ukraine-NATO-Europe.”",https://darik.news/newyork/live-updates-russian-troops-enter-kiev-as-moscow-pushes-to-topple-ukraines-government/202202530064.html
