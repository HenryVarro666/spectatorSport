Some odds and ends observations for this Sunday afternoon/evening.

* Twitter and Telegram had an above average number of pictures and videos of destroyed Russian equipment and more dead Russians than I‚Äôve seen all war. Ukraine seems emboldened, and in particular, it appears to be pressing its advantages in northwest Kyiv and in the Mykolaiv region‚Äîthe best evidence yet of continued counter-offensives by the defenders.

More Russian losses in the region here, here, here and here. This last link actually gives us the location of this most of these pictures: Bashtanka. Looking at the map, that‚Äôs actually in the opposite direction of Kherson, northeast of Mykolaiv. This might‚Äôve been a column on that ill-fated under-resourced push toward Kryvyi Rih. I circled Snihurivka, which was the site of a major ambush yesterday. These battles show the ground is contested, but no one has been able to confirm whether Ukraine now occupies the ground, hence the fog of war continues. Some maps treat this entire area as liberated, while other ones do not. I‚Äôve been keeping a close eye on official reports from the Ukraine general staff, but today‚Äôs update was short and light on specifics, and made no claims to this territory. All we know at the moment is that there is fierce fighting in this region, and Ukraine is definitely making Russia bleed.

* Same thing up north, around Kyiv. Check out the pocket of Russian forces suddenly surrounded by hostile territory in northeastern Kyiv:

This are some thin-ass support lines, basically coming down to ‚ÄúRussia holds some towns, but everything in between them is swarming with Ukrainian territorial defense forces. In northwest Kyiv, Russian forces remain stuck, digging into defensive positions as they are unable to push forward. Ukraine is actively trying to expel them from the area, reportedly operating as far north as Poliske, that furthermost red-dot town top-left on this map, near the Ukrainian border.

Russia‚Äôs inability to take Chernihiv, literally on Russia‚Äôs border (like Kherson), is one of the big stories of this war. And while Kherson is mostly surrounded and blockaded (though supplies still seem to be making their way in), Chernihiv is still far from being encircled.

* Russia is running low on soldiers, between dead, wounded, captured, and the first signs of troop rotations as front-line units are rotated out for breathers and reconstitution. Having committed the bulk of its army, there isn‚Äôt much more to draw on, and a general mobilization would betray Moscow‚Äôs insistence that this is just a small military operation. We were promised Syrian troops, but they haven‚Äôt surfaced so far. So the best Russia seems able to do for the moment is pull in their forces from occupied territories in Central Asia and their puppet militias: South Ossetia, Georgia (Russian and Ossetians, troops), Karabakh (Russian troops),

* Belorussian troops are heading toward west Ukraine (also here), making noise about interdicting Western arms supplies, but good luck with that. I didn‚Äôt see it happening last time chatter claimed they were invading, and I still don‚Äôt see it now. Western Ukraine is inhospitable territory for invaders‚Äîhilly, wooded, with few roads. And if you think Russian troops have shit the bed, wait until you see Belorussian conscripts. And how the hell would those troops be resupplied? They can‚Äôt even supply Russian troops on the Russian border. At worst, this is a feint to tie up Ukrainian forces in the west, unable to be pressed into battle at the front. I doubt Ukrainian is sweating it. Local territorial defense forces could handle these.

* There was sporadic night-time gunfire in Kherson the first couple of nights after Russian occupation, but things got relatively quiet. One major reason: Mass daytime protests signaled to Russia and the occupying troops that they weren‚Äôt welcome, and provided Ukraine major propaganda points. However, that looks about to change.

This guy‚Äôs car was shot up.

* Look at this dumbass foreigner who thought war was some kind of adventure, and are more likely to do harm than help. Former military? Okay, sure. I‚Äôm sure Ukraine could use the help. But these idiots with no experience seem to be shocked when death is a thing that can happen in a combat zone.

* This is quite the ambush, somewhere around Kyiv. If I had to guess, it was daisy-chained mines‚Äîthe first vehicle triggers a mine that then sets off mines behind it. I wonder if this the other view of it, the damage patterns seem to match:

No one else has tied those two attacks together, so I‚Äôm probably wrong, but it does show what this kind of mined ambush looks like, and is a new tactic in Ukraine‚Äôs arsenal. Here are two more Russian vehicles felled by land mines. Ukrainians are learning faster than Russia is adjusting.

* Ukrainian artillery showing up more and more in a big way: here, here, here, here, and here. In that last one, you can see the use of drones to help correct artillery fire. One reason we‚Äôre seeing more destroyed Russian artillery could be the presence of American-supplied anti-artillery radar, allowing Ukraine to track where incoming is coming from. Here‚Äôs one such vehicle, unfortunately damaged by the Russians. Here‚Äôs what happens when Ukraine knows where artillery fire is coming from:

Austria‚Äôs Chancellor Karl Nehammer told NBC that he thinks Russia's President Vladimir Putin is ""in his own war logic"" after speaking to him this week.

He said that Mr Putin believes he is winning the war.

Mr Nehammer was the first European leader to meet Putin in Moscow since Russia invaded Ukraine.

He said: ‚ÄúWe have to look in his eyes and we have to confront him with that, what we see in Ukraine.‚Äô‚Äô

Before arriving in Moscow last Monday, Nehammer had visited Bucha, the town outside of Kyiv where graphic evidence of killings and torture has emerged following the withdrawal of Russian forces.

The chancellor said he confronted Mr Putin with what he had seen in Bucha, and ‚Äúit was not a friendly conversation.‚Äù

He added that Mr Putin said ‚Äúhe will cooperate with an international investigation, on one hand, and on the other hand, he told me that he doesn‚Äôt trust the Western world. So this will be the problem now in the future.‚Äù",https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-news-latest-war-putin-russia-skynews-live-12541713?postid=3590932

His bottom line is, as he says near the top of a two hour-talk:

The Russians are grinding down the Ukrainians and they are doing it with flipped math. 200,000 guys are grinding down 600,000 guys. It‚Äôs one of the most amazing things. When this story is finally told, people are going to be stunned. All these people now are saying, ‚ÄúOh, the Russians, they are doing so poorly, the Russians this‚Ä¶‚Äù. Maybe they are. Maybe I‚Äôm getting this all wrong. But you know, I‚Äôve studied military history, I think I know how to read a map, I think I know how to look at the balance of forces, I think I know how to study logistics and stuff, and I think I‚Äôm reading this right‚Ä¶.This war is closer to being over than many people think.

Ritter also argues, interestingly, that it is of paramount importance that Zelensky surrenders to Russia, or the functional equivalent by signing a peace on Russian terms. Ritter argues that at this juncture, that means Russians cannot win too quickly. Ukraine has to look like it has exhausted its options.

Not that this is factoring into how Russia proceeds on the field, but a slower tempo favors Russia politically. Whether Zelensky accedes to Russia‚Äôs demands is ultimately a US call, unless he has found a way to go rogue. The West is at present unprepared to accept that, given that they believe their own/Ukraine‚Äôs propaganda that Russia is losing the war and that Russia‚Äôs economy is collapsing under the sanctions.

Western leaders and pundits appear not to have worked out that the rouble falling (so far much less than in the 1998 crisis) is not the same as a domestic economic seize-up. Aside from Western goods being hoovered up after the sanctions hit, we have yet to hear of domestic shortages. Admittedly, new hardships could kick in starting in a few months as important speciality items from the West like car parts become unattainable.

But the US and Europe are about to see energy price pain kick in in April, and that may soften them up with respect to a Ukraine settlement. We linked to this story on Saturday, but it‚Äôs important to keep in mind. From the Financial Times, IEA calls for driving restrictions and air travel curbs to reduce oil demand:

The International Energy Agency has called for member countries to adopt ‚Äúemergency measures‚Äù to cut oil demand in the wake of Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine, including driving restrictions, lower speed limits and curbs on air travel‚Ä¶ As much as 2.5mn barrels a day of Russian oil exports could cease from next month due to the impact of the war and consumer boycotts of Russian crude, he said. Russia is one of the world‚Äôs largest oil producers. The IEA has proposed 10 measures to reduce oil demand by 2.7m b/d within the next four months, which it said would help balance potential loss from the Russian market.

I don‚Äôt see the US as willing or able to adopt any of these measures to enough of a degree to make a difference. And I see the US as politically and practically fragile to another leg up of gas price increases, even more so if and when they add to our food price inflation (which is also set to get worse due to Russian fertilizer and Russian and Ukrainian wheat going missing in action).

The Wall Street Journal has just published an odd story, Russia, Failing to Achieve Early Victory in Ukraine, Is Seen Shifting to ‚ÄòPlan B‚Äô, that it deemed important to be a News Alert, as in deserving of an e-mail. ReaderChigal‚Äôs reaction was similar to ours:

World‚Äôs dumbest article. Putin having failed to take Kiev is falling back on ‚ÄúPlan B‚Äù‚Äìdemanding Ukranian neutrality. Forgive me, but isn‚Äôt that what he said he wanted from the start?

Upon further reflection, this article is a very good thing. It depicts conceding to one of Russia‚Äôs central demands as somehow a partial failure by Russia. That look like the West trying to face save when it has to relent. It does so by depicting Russia as wanting to take Kiev and not succeeding, when as Scott Ritter explains, that was never one of Russia‚Äôs aims.

As readers likely know, Biden is going to Europe this week, meeting first in Brussels and then in Poland to discuss how to make things even more painful for Russia as well as how to provide humanitarian relief to refugees.

I can‚Äôt verify the accuracy of this translated snippet from Aftershock,news, a Russian language newsfeed of sorts focused on the war, but this would fall in the category of ‚Äúmaking things more painful for Russia‚Äù:

Now to Scott Ritter. Ritter is a Marine who spent substantial time on the ground in Russia (as a weapons controller) and in Iraq. Keep in mind that in the early phases of the war in Ukraine, Ritter over-estimated how quickly Russia would be able to wind up the conflict. He is still very firmly of the view not only that Russia is winning but makes the strong-form claim that Russia will succeed in getting NATO to withdraw to its fall of the USSR boundaries, based on some moves Russia is making with Belarus (more on that shortly).

As you‚Äôll also see through the key points highlighted below, and even more so if you watch the entire video, Ritter stresses that the ‚ÄúRussia is bogged down‚Äù assertions are based on either miscomprehension or misrepresentation of how Russia is conducting its campaign. For instance, it has not taken Kiev because it does not intend to take Kiev.

I strongly urge you to listen to the entire video‚Ä¶but I still took the liberty of identifying key points.

I‚Äôll parse out ‚Äúconduct of the war‚Äù from ‚Äúwhere this may wind up‚Äù issues.

Conduct of the War

Ritter argues that the Ukrainians can‚Äôt win, that it‚Äôs only a matter of time and he thinks the time is at most a month. Russian has pinned down the Ukrainian forces around Kiev and in the east, there in what are becoming multiple cauldrons. Russia has been systematically destroying Ukrainian fuel depots and munitions caches. They are running out of supplies, including food and water. He describes this process as ‚Äúgrinding them down‚Äù.

Ritter contends that Russia has been running an extremely effective campaign with its narrow aims. He points out that in a conquest, the aggressor normally has to have at least 3x the forces of the defender. Russia has deployed about 200,000 troops, with more across the border, while Ritter counts all of the Ukrainian forces, including reservists, at roughly 600,000. (Ritter not having a full Ukraine manpower count may explain his initial over-estimation of how quickly Russia could wrap its incursion up).

Ritter explains that the Russians do not want or need to capture Kiev. They simply need to present enough of a threat to the city to keep the Kiev army tied down there. Had Russia intended to take Kiev, they would need over a million troops and would need to fight house to house, and they clearly have not and are not mobilizing to do that.

Ritter also contends that the Russians clearly have been avoiding civilian casualties. In war, the usual ratio of civilian casualties to military is 1:1. He uses the Ukrainian estimates of their military casualties at 6,000 and the Russian estimates of their own military deaths at about 1,000 (Ritter notes that armed forces tend to be accurate in estimates of their own deaths; the coffins go home).

The Ukraine estimates of civilian deaths are according to Ritter, only 800, less than 1/10th of total military losses.

Ritter similarly does not believe the Russians have targeted civilians. He dismisses the idea that they attacked the notorious theater in Mariupol. The Russians claim they specifically identified it as a building to be avoided, and that they had no aircraft over the city the day the theater blew up. Ritter effectively says NATO should provide the evidence of Russian overflight that day or shut up.

He thinks it is possible that the Russians hit the square on which the similarly-notorious maternity hospital in Kiev. Lavrov has made inconsistent statements, first saying no planes were nearby, then saying that Russia thought the hospital was empty. However, Ritter said the West is accusing Russia of committing a war crime here. NATO tracks every Russian plane flying in Ukraine. The onus is on NATO to substantiate the war crimes allegation.

How the West Helped Putin With Sanctions

Ritter is amped up on the topic of sanctions. He argues that Saddam Hussein would have been shot by his own generals after the loss of the 1991 war save for Western sanctions, which unified the country behind him.

As for Putin, Ritter contends that Putin, who was originally pro-Western, became convinced of the time of the need to distance Russia from Europe, but was hampered by the roughly 20% of Russians who are middle class, normally politically indifferent, but would turn on Putin if he threatened their access to European goods and vacations. Per Ritter:

The West just did Putin the greatest favor in the world. They don‚Äôt even realize how stupid they were. The West divorced itself from Russia. Putin said, ‚ÄúThank you. Thanks you very much! You‚Äôve now allowed me to do what I needed to do.‚Äù

Where the War Might Wind Up

Ritter unintentionally points how Russia can (and probably will) get trapped even if it succeeds in all of its military objectives. Ritter contends that the West made a huge mistake in letting Zelensky become the face of the Ukrainian government by speaking before Congress and parliaments around the world. Russia tried to negotiate with the West before but is no longer negotiating. It has certain demand that it wants met, and it warned that it will add to those demands if Ukraine does not agree to them (mind you, I am sure Russia would negotiate around the margin but it is not going to cede much ground).

Ritter describes at length how the Russians have gone fairly light to avoid civilian casualties, and until the last couple of days, were even avoiding hitting convoys and Ukrainian barracks. He said that the Russians had been waiting until convoys were unloaded before striking to take out the materiel only, but too much was leaking through and they‚Äôve gotten tired of it. Ritter mentions an account I also heard from Gonzalo Lira, that Russia struck a barracks with over 200 soldiers in it near the Polish border. Lira said it was for officers and opined that Russia had to have inside intel to have targeted it.

By showcasing Zelensky as the legitimate head of the Ukrainian government, if Zelensky agrees to a deal with Russia, the West cannot depict it as illegitimate.

Therefore Russia has every reason to wand Zelensky alive.

What Ritter does not add is therefore every Banderite fascist and the US have every reason to want Zelensky dead if he looks to be coming to terms with Russia.

Ritter does say the worst thing for the Russia would be if Zelensky were killed and the US set up a government in exile in Poland to continue to destabilize Ukraine.

I have said in comments that if Zelensky wants to stay alive, the best thing for him would be to flee to Poland. It‚Äôs much harder to dispose of him there.

Ritter thinks Russia will obtain its ultimate aim of getting NATO to withdraw to its 1997. This strikes me as wildly optimistic. But Ritter argues (around 20 of his talk) that Russia is on its way to permanently deploying major offensive military formations combined with nuclear forces in Belarus. Ritter argues that this will completely change NATO dynamics and they will climb down to get Russia to climb down.

Ritter contends like Belarus, the West has ignored another important development. On February 4, Russia and China issued a joint statement about their friendship, which they depicted as closer than an alliance. Ritter described a key portion that the English language press ignored:

‚ÄúWe are done with the rules based international order.‚Äù That of course is the cornerstone of American foreign policy, NATO foreign policy‚Ä¶It put America at the top of the pyramid and was designed to keep America at the top of the pyramid. Russia and China have said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre now part of the law-based international order and we‚Äôre leaning more toward the United Nations charter and the concept of a multi-polar world.‚Äù

Needless to say, the war has rapidly accelerated the move to a new world order, and one not of America‚Äôa making.",https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2022/03/ukraine-updates-and-scott-ritter-on-russia-military-strategy-and-progress.html
