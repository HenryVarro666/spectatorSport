""We need you right now,"" Zelensky told US members of Congress in one of his latest pleas for assistance before a friendly government.

The US and other NATO member nations have fulfilled a number of Zelensky's requests, while stopping short of certain measures they say could risk an escalation in the war.

Weapons assistance

The military aid provided to Ukraine so far includes weapons that range from portable drones to complex, long-range missile systems.

Switchblade drones. Small, portable, so-called kamikaze drones that carry warheads and detonate on impact. The smallest model can hit a target up to six miles away, according to the company that produces the drones, AeroVironment. It's unclear which size model the US will send to Ukraine.

Stinger anti-aircraft missiles. These heat-seeking, anti-aircraft missiles have a range of about five miles and 11,000 feet. Critically, Stinger missiles can distinguish between enemy and friendly aircraft.

Javelin anti-tank weapons. This guided missile system can be shoulder-fired by a single solider and has a range of up to 8,200 feet.

AT-4 anti-armor systems. These Swedish anti-armor weapons are ""lightweight, single-shot and fully disposable,"" according to the company that produces them, These Swedish anti-armor weapons are ""lightweight, single-shot and fully disposable,"" according to the company that produces them, Saab Bofors Dynamics

Patriot air defense missile system. The US also delivered two missile defense systems to Poland this month intended to deter Russia and boost Poland's security amid Western concerns that the Ukraine conflict could spill into NATO-aligned nations.

The Patriot air defense missile system -- Patriot stands for "" Phased Array Tracking Radar to Intercept of Target "" -- is designed to counter and destroy incoming short-range ballistic missiles, advanced aircraft and cruise missiles.

The battery includes missiles and launching stations, a radar set that detects and tracks targets, and an engagement control station, according to the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance.

Other actions

Beyond military aid to Ukraine, the US and its NATO allies have issued a slew of sanctions against Russia.

Putin. The United States, European Union, United Kingdom and Canada have announced they would introduce sanctions targeting Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

SWIFT. The US, EU, UK and Canada have banned certain Russian banks from SWIFT, the high-security network that facilitates payments among 11,000 financial institutions in 200 countries.

'Most favored nation' status. The House of Representatives has passed a bill to The House of Representatives has passed a bill to suspend normal trade relations with Russia. The final vote was 424-8 with strong bipartisan support for the legislation, which next heads to the Senate.

Energy and oil. EU officials EU officials said the bloc would slash imports of Russian natural gas by two-thirds this year, and the EU announced a plan to achieve energy independence from Moscow ""well before 2030."" That would separate Europe from its single biggest energy supplier.

Separately, President Joe Biden announced a ban on Russian oil , natural gas and coal imports to the United States. And the UK government said Tuesday it would phase out Russian oil imports by the end of 2022 and explore ways of ending natural gas imports as well.

Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. Germany has halted certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline following Moscow's actions.

Unfulfilled Ukrainian requests

As Russia's deadly invasion has continued, Zelensky has requested some actions that Western allies fear would put them in direct conflict with the Kremlin and escalate the war.

No-fly zone. Zelensky has repeatedly called on Ukraine's allies to establish a Zelensky has repeatedly called on Ukraine's allies to establish a no-fly zone over the country. A no-fly zone is an area where certain aircraft cannot fly for any number of reasons. In the context of a conflict such as the one in Ukraine, it would probably mean a zone in which Russian planes were not allowed to fly, to prevent them from carrying out airstrikes against Ukraine.

The problem with military no-fly zones is that they have to be enforced by a military power. If a Russian aircraft flew into a NATO no-fly zone, then NATO forces would have to take action against that aircraft. Those measures could include shooting the plane from the sky. That would, in Russia's eyes, be an act of war by NATO and would likely escalate the conflict.

S-300 missile defense systems. This surface-to-air missile system can strike targets that are both higher in altitude and farther away than Stinger missiles are designed for.

Slovakia has preliminarily agreed to provide Ukraine with a key Soviet-era air defense system to help defend against Russian airstrikes, according to three sources familiar with the matter. But the US and NATO are still grappling with how to backfill that country's own defensive capabilities, and the transfer is not yet assured.

MiG fighter jets. Earlier this month, the US dismissed Earlier this month, the US dismissed a proposal from Poland to transfer its MiG-29 fighter jets to the United States for delivery to Ukraine.

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said in a statement that the US did not believe Poland's proposal was ""tenable"" and that it was too risky.

While the United States and other NATO member nations have fulfilled a number of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's requests to help hinder Russian forces, they have stopped short of certain measures they say could risk an escalation in the war.

These are some of Zelensky's asks left unfulfilled:

No-fly zone: Zelensky has repeatedly called on Ukraine's allies to establish a no-fly zone over the country. A no-fly zone is an area where certain aircraft cannot fly for any number of reasons. In the context of a conflict such as the one in Ukraine, it would probably mean a zone in which Russian planes were not allowed to fly, to prevent them from carrying out airstrikes against Ukraine.

Russia says it used its newest Kinzhal hypersonic missiles for the first time in Ukraine to destroy a weapons storage site in the country’s west.

Russia’s Interfax news agency said it was the first time Russia had deployed the hypersonic Kinzhal system since it sent its troops into Ukraine on February 24.

“The Kinzhal aviation missile system with hypersonic aeroballistic missiles destroyed a large underground warehouse containing missiles and aviation ammunition in the village of Deliatyn in the Ivano-Frankivsk region,” defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said on Saturday.

The region of Ivano-Frankivsk shares a 50km (30 miles) long border with NATO member Romania.

The ministry also said Russian forces used the anti-ship missile system Bastion to destroy Ukrainian military facilities near the Black Sea port of Odesa.

Al Jazeera was not able to independently verify Konashenkov’s statements.

The office of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

‘Kamikaze drones’

Russia prides itself on its advanced weaponry, and President Vladimir Putin said in December that Russia was the global leader in hypersonic missiles, whose speed, manoeuvrability and altitude make them difficult to track and intercept.

The Kinzhal missiles are part of an array of weapons unveiled in 2018.

Al Jazeera’s Imran Khan said because of the nature of war, new weapons systems are often used.

“In the past few days in Kyiv we’ve seen cruise missiles shot from Russian territory that have been intercepted by Ukrainian air defence systems as well,” Khan said, speaking from the Ukrainian capital.

“We’re also hearing about the fact that Russia is introducing kamikaze drones into the conflict. This is the first time we are hearing confirmation about the use of hypersonic missiles.”

Russia first used the hypersonic missile during its military campaign in Syria in 2016.

Putin has called the Kinzhal (Dagger) missile “an ideal weapon” that flies at 10 times the speed of sound and can overcome air-defence systems.

“This is a missile capable of carrying nuclear warheads and is believed to be undetectable by western air defence systems,” said Al Jazeera’s Dorsa Jabbari, speaking from Moscow. “Therefore it is being called an unstoppable ballistic missile.”

Putin announced an array of new hypersonic weapons in 2018 in one of his most bellicose speeches in years, saying they could hit almost any point in the world and evade a United States-built missile shield.

The following year, he threatened to deploy hypersonic missiles on ships and submarines that could lurk outside US territorial waters if Washington moved to deploy intermediate-range nuclear weapons in Europe.

The United States has actively pursued the development of hypersonic weapons – manoeuvering weapons that fly at speeds of at least Mach 5 – as a part of its conventional prompt global strike programme since the early 2000s, according to a new congressional report.

These weapons could enable “responsive, long-range, strike options against distant, defended, and/or time-critical threats [such as road-mobile missiles] when other forces are unavailable, denied access, or not preferred”, said former Commander of US Strategic Command General John Hyten.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/19/russia-uses-advanced-hypersonic-missiles-in-ukraine-for-first-tim

5,ee8a66cd-2510-4b54-9741-06bd06292ff5,['Michael Jacobson'],2022-04-15 07:50:53+00:00,"While the Russian military is on the back foot in Ukraine, its shifting operations reveal severe shortcoming in Ukraine’s arsenal and capabilities — one that NATO member states could fix. Washington has recognized this and President Joe Biden has approved a new arms package for Ukraine that includes artillery and more sophisticated anti-air systems, including more sophisticated and heavier weapons and platforms than have been provided thus far. As a defense professional who has focused on artillery for most of his career, I am encouraged by this decision. These systems will allow Ukrainian forces to continue to press the fight against Russia’s military.

After failing in the first phase of the war, Russian forces seem intent on using artillery and air-delivered munitions to create a zone of destruction in the Donbas. While Ukraine has extensive Soviet-era field and air defense artillery, augmented by shoulder-launched capabilities from NATO member states, it lacks the logistical resilience and range necessary to stand toe-to-toe with Russia in this next phase of the war. The integration of air-defense artillery with surface-to-surface artillery would enable Ukrainian forces to take out the most effective remaining weaponry in Russia’s arsenal: artillery.

Destroying Russian artillery is the key to Ukrainian success in the next phase of the war. There are readily available artillery systems in NATO member and partner arsenals that would allow Ukraine to thwart Russian objectives. Some might be concerned that Ukraine will be unable to field and maintain such weapon systems, but these concerns should not be overstated. While supplying these weapons would require a short period of time for training and equipping, upgraded Ukrainian batteries and battalions could begin taking the field as early as May — if Western policymakers act with urgency, which they seem to be interested in doing.

A Shifting Campaign

Russian forces have all but withdrawn from areas in northern Ukraine. Russian ground offensives are concentrated in the south and east of Ukraine. The next phase of the war will likely be a war of attrition focused on the Donbas, with the possibility of Russia re-opening its front north of Kyiv. Withdrawing Russian forces have left a path of destruction in their wake. As Russia shifts its posture, it has conducted a relentless bombardment of built-up areas, most notably in Mariupol. Artillery is the weapon of choice in Russia’s campaign of destruction, which seems intended to denude areas of the basic infrastructure necessary to sustain a viable population. Artillery, precision aircraft strikes, and long-range missiles continue to target Ukrainian infrastructure.

Ukrainian forces have done an outstanding job denying air superiority to the Russian air force using man-portable air-defense systems provided by NATO. They have also succeeded in using Javelins to stop tanks in their tracks. However, Ukraine has no effective options to counter a prolonged Russian artillery offensive. This should trouble those who want to see Ukraine prevail as Russia can rely upon an extensive supply of artillery platforms and munitions that it will likely use to lay waste to large swaths of eastern Ukraine and thwart a Ukrainian counter-offensive to retake the country.

The State of Ukrainian Artillery and Air Defense

The Ukrainian army has made good use of its legacy equipment over the past eight years of combat in the Donbas and during the first seven weeks of the Russian invasion, but that equipment is largely destroyed, run-down, ineffective, or outdated. As the campaign goes on, this legacy equipment will continue to breakdown and be destroyed in combat. Logistics and maintenance for this equipment will become ever more difficult as Ukraine’s supply of lethal munitions for equipment on hand dries up. The Ukrainian army lacks sufficient counter rocket, artillery, and mortar capabilities, which is particularly critical in defending its own counter-fire radar systems. Perhaps the most effective capabilities the Ukrainians do have in their inventory are Russian air-defense systems. The S-300, gifted to Ukraine by Slovakia, is an effective long-range system, but even with outside help provided thus far, Ukraine does not have the right systems and missile magazine depth for this to be a viable long-term option.

Ukrainian artillery such as BM-21, 2S1, and D-30, as well as air-defense capabilities such as the SA-6 and the SA-13, stem primarily from lower-tech Soviet, domestic, or regional production. Ukraine does not have the latest technology in self-propelled howitzers. While older systems are useful for imprecise area fires, the latest NATO systems and their munitions are faster, more lethal, and more survivable. They would allow Ukraine to do things it cannot currently do well: quickly determine locations of enemy artillery and target them with counter-battery fire, and destroy tanks and other armored vehicles with artillery, rather than only with anti-tank guided missiles and other tanks.

Further, these newer artillery systems are fully digitized and integrated with precision equipment based on internal, gyroscopic, self-locating devices supplemented by GPS updating. They also have modular components that can be swapped out, thus simplifying repairs. This is important because Ukraine currently lacks the ability to produce munitions and repair parts, especially as Russian forces bombard Ukrainian industrial facilities. Most newer systems require a relatively brief period of training on individual weapon systems and munitions. They are easy to use and employ for artillerymen already trained in basic field craft.

More Western Kit for Ukraine

As Russia reconstitutes its combat-ineffective maneuver units, most of its artillery units remain operational and in the fight. Russian artillery is engaging hundreds of targets a day in the Donbas and more than a thousand long-range missiles have been fired over the course of the campaign.

What specific systems should be considered for provision to Ukraine?

Sweden produces the Archer, a wheeled self-propelled howitzer with a range of 30 kilometers. The system is in production and a battalion’s worth of guns (12 to 18) could probably be provided immediately. It has on-board fire control computation, auto-loading and resupply, and requires only a three-man crew. France produces a similar howitzer, the CAESAR II. This is an extremely capable, wheeled, self-propelled, 155-milimeter howitzer that can integrate with NATO command and control systems.

These two howitzer systems are arguably the best in the world today. They are fully digitized and boast fully automated unmanned cannon turrets, power-assisted resupply systems, and onboard fire-solution computation systems. That means they can quickly receive and integrate all the data needed for counter-battery fire. These individual howitzers can fire a platoon’s worth of projectiles in a single fire mission and then drive to another location less than five minutes later to avoid Russian counter-battery fire. Both of these systems can fire the latest sensor-fuzed munitions, meaning each projectile can kill a vehicle that might be a tank, a self-propelled howitzer, and enemy radar system, or a logistics vehicle. In artillery, the ability to shoot, move, and shoot again is key to survivability. Both systems are highly mobile wheeled systems built on common truck chassis from Volvo and Tatra that can move quickly across road systems and have sufficient range to reach equivalent Russian cannon artillery systems from relative safety behind the forward line of troops. They are equipped with auto-loader systems and emplacement/displacement times measured in a handful of minutes. That gives them high rates of fires that enable them to do something called “multiple rounds, simultaneous impact” — one howitzer can have three to six rounds it fires land on a target area at the same time.

The U.S.-produced High Mobility Artillery Rocket System is also one of the best in the world. In addition to being highly mobile and digitized like the Archer and CAESAR, it can fire the full suite of sophisticated Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System rockets and eventually the long-range Precision Strike Missile, when it comes online. This system and the associated rockets and missiles require minimal train-up for basic artillerymen to employ. To complete the Ukrainian artillery kill-chain, the United States currently produces a long-range, highly accurate, counter-fire radar, the Q-53, which the Ukrainian army is already somewhat familiar with.

Outfitting with NATO howitzers and rocket launchers provides Ukrainian forces with the ability to employ NATO projectiles, rockets, and missiles, which include the best in sensor-fused weapons (such as the German SMArt155mm and the Swedish BONUS), GPS-guided precision rockets, and high-yield precision missiles. Integrating multi-mission radars and the counter-battery Q-53 radar would allow Ukrainian forces to identify Russian artillery systems, defeat incoming rounds by blasting them out of the sky using NATO or Russian counter-rocket systems, and provide counter-battery fire using sensor-fused munitions and area effects rockets to decimate Russian artillery forces. Finally, the United States should consider providing Ukraine with the Patriot Air Defense system to complete an integrated air-defense complex.

How to Set Ukraine Up for Cannon-Fed Success

The United States and its allies should also support Ukraine’s artillery arsenal with the necessary doctrine, materiel, and training, as well as logistical support in terms of maintenance and supply. Those NATO countries that produce many of the artillery systems have the industrial base to continue to supply repair parts and munitions for the foreseeable future. The United States and its NATO allies often use contracted logistics support as a stop-gap measure. This essentially involves personnel from Western defense firms going into theater, including forward positions in a conflict zone, in order to perform important maintenance and logistics activities for newly fielded weapons systems. Due to recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, there are many professionals and technicians from Western defense companies who have experience working in war zones. While this happens, Ukrainian military personnel can train and become familiar with the new equipment both at forward locations and in the rear. For major repairs and overhauls, the systems would be transported back to neighboring NATO countries.

Adapting and integrating NATO techniques and systems will enable the Ukrainian army to benefit from speed and data already enjoyed by its NATO partners. Training on many of the tactical systems can be completed in as little as a month since many of the fire-control complexities are accomplished by onboard computers. Training on sustaining and repairing these complex systems will take longer but can be supplemented by contracted logistics support while sustainers are in training. Fielding NATO-developed and integrated equipment will enable NATO member states to aid with targeting and battle-damage assessments from outside the combat zone. The secure nature of much of the NATO equipment will also stymie Russian efforts to gather intelligence on Ukrainian tactical activity.

As time goes on, individual NATO countries have begun considerations to supply various advanced western weapon systems on their own. Rumors have been circulating that Slovakia is considering sending Zuzana II howitzers, while the German arms consortium Krauss-Maffei Wegmann has flown trial balloons regarding the Panzerhaubitze 2000. Both systems represent advances over current Ukrainian systems, but the initiatives are disjointed and don’t take into account the important aspect of counter-battery radar, digital input to firing data, and the lethal munitions associated with the platforms.

The Artillery Fight is Here

Much has been written and said in recent weeks about the need to field weapons to the Ukrainians that can be immediately employed to stop the Russian offensive. That was wise counsel and has achieved its ends. Those weapons should continue to flow. The argument that more sophisticated weapons aren’t viable because of the associated training and follow-on logistics support simply isn’t correct given where Ukraine now finds itself in the fight. As the war settles in for a longer-term artillery duel, more appropriate and sustainable weapons systems should be brought to bear. The training to use those systems is not overly complex and can be accomplished in neighboring NATO countries in relatively brief periods of time. The maintenance and other tasks above the operator level can be performed by contracted logistics support in the operational environment as well as in neighboring countries for depot-level maintenance. Most importantly, the precision, lethality, and efficiency to be successful against Russian artillery systems is best provided by the more sophisticated capabilities available from NATO. Just as NATO has provided sophisticated systems — such as the Javelin, the Next generation Light Anti-tank Weapon, Stinger, Starstreak, and Panzerfaust 3 — NATO should provide similar levels of sophistication for Ukraine to succeed in this next phase and mitigate the human suffering there as much as possible.

Now is the time to transition to NATO artillery and air-defense systems before Ukraine loses the momentum it has gained.

Recently the Russian Ministry of Defence announced that it used the hypersonic missile for the first time in the conflict with Ukraine. These ultra-fast “hypersonic” missiles are capable of hitting targets anywhere on earth within a short span of an hour.

Wars/conflicts are often used by top arms exports to test their new platforms and the importing countries are also looking out for such weapons which will help in knocking down their enemies. Weapons like hypersonic missiles, are the new age technologies that are in the process of being perfected by various countries like China, the US, India and these considered to be ‘unstoppable’.

In the never-ending quest to have weapons which will provide a country more power it needs to knock out its adversaries, a different type of weapon has emerged: ultra-fast ‘hypersonic’ missiles which will hit targets anywhere on Earth within an hour.

Cutting edge technology used by Russia against Ukraine

Last weekend, Russia announced that it had launched a hypersonic missile for the first time in the ongoing conflict with Ukraine. Russia became the first country in the world to ever test this missile in a conflict.

Defence Ministry Spokesperson of that country Igor Konashenkov has been quoted in reports, “The Kinzhal (Dagger) aviation missile system with hypersonic aero-ballistic missiles destroyed a large underground warehouse containing missiles. This missile also destroyed aviation ammunition in the village of Deliatyn in the Ivano-Frankivsk region,” defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov had said.

What are hypersonic missiles/weapons?

These are next generation missiles and the technology involved is very complicated. Financial Express Online has reported earlier that countries including the UK, China, and Russia have made a lot of investment in hypersonic weapons. India entered the field of hypersonics way back in 2004. And in recent years, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has carried out successful trials, though the India programme is smaller in scale. Hypersonic Technology Demonstrator Vehicle (HSTDV) has been tested successfully and is critical for India’s programme for development of a hypersonic cruise missile system.

Technically a hypersonic weapon is supposed to be extremely fast; this means it is five times faster than the speed of sound – around 3,836 mph. And with this kind of a speed the enemy has less time to respond.

Ballistic Vs Hypersonic

According to reports, the ballistic missiles already move fast, almost the same speed as the hypersonic, though these new age hypersonic missiles are highly maneuverable and can glide in the upper atmosphere.

And once the ballistic missiles are launched they cannot alter their course.

Hypersonic missiles are in two forms

In 2021, China had launched a rocket and it had carried a hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV). According to a report in the Financial Times, the Chinese HGV before moving towards its target had flown through low-orbit space and at a speed which was five times the speed of sound.

The HGV, according to information available in the public domain, leaves the Earth’s atmosphere and then plunges back into it. To fool the enemy’s radar, this hypersonic vehicle glides through the upper layers of the atmosphere, through a random series of curves and turns.

The other type is hypersonic cruise missile (HCM). It is not as fast as HGV, but is designed to fly low and at extremely high speed. This is to take the enemy by surprise. And there is hardly any time for the enemy to hit back.

Challenges

Friction is the key challenge as the temperatures go up to as high as 2,200 degrees Celsius (3,990 degrees Fahrenheit). And these missiles have to be designed from highly advanced materials which have the capability of withstanding such high temperatures.

Communication is another issue, as it becomes difficult to connect in these hypersonic weapons as the heat builds up a cloud of super-charged particles known as plasma, according to reports. And it is difficult for the normal radio communications to connect. To explain it easily: there is a blackout moment in communications when a spacecraft is re-entering the atmosphere.

Another challenge faced is maneuverability at high speeds, as it puts a lot of pressure on the structure of the missile.

However, the Russian military has successfully used Kinzhal hypersonic missiles, and became the first in the world to use this in the conflict.

Why did Russia use this instead of the traditional ballistic missile?

According to reports, the missile used by Russia during the Ukraine conflict is said to be a modification of its Iskander missile. And this was the first test fired in 2018 from a MiG-31 aircraft and it hit a target which was 500 miles away.

Russian media reports have said that the Kinzhal has a top speed of Mach 10 and has a capability of hitting targets up to 1200 miles when launched from a MiG-31. The Russian side is also planning to fire this missile from Su-34 long range fighter and it is also planning to mount it on Tu-22 M 3 strategic bombers.

Advantages of using hypersonic weapons

Testifying before the US Congressional Committee on armed services, a former Commander of US Strategic Command, General John Hyten, hypersonic weapons can enable responsive, long range strike options against distant, defended or time critical threats (such as road mobile missiles) when other forces are unavailable, denied access or not preferred. According to him these conventional hypersonic weapons use only kinetic energy to destroy unhardened targets or even underground facilities.

Financial Express Online has reported earlier details on Hypersonic Cruise Missiles globally:

3M22 Zircon – Hypersonic anti-ship cruise missile by Russia.

14-X – hypersonic glide vehicle mounted on a VSB-30 rocket by Brazil.

Kh-90 – Hypersonic air-to-surface cruise missile, this was developed in 1990 by the Soviet Union/Russia.

DF-ZF – DF-17 mounted hypersonic glide vehicle by China.

BrahMos-II – Hypersonic missile by India and Russia.

Hypersonic Technology Demonstrator Vehicle – Hypersonic scramjet demonstration by India.

High-Speed Strike Weapon – Boeing X-51 based missile by the United States.

More about Chinese & US programme

There are reports suggesting that China may use this hypersonic weapon system by mating conventionally armed HGVs with the DF-21 and DF-26 missiles in its arsenal. In 2020, it extensively tested the DF-ZF HGV with a range of 1200 miles.

In 2018, a nuclear capable hypersonic vehicle prototype Starry Sky-2 (Xing Kong-2), was tested by China according to US defence officials quoted in the Congressional report.

Hypersonic weapons are being developed by the US under its Navy’s conventional Prompt Strike Programme as well as through Army, Air Force and Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). While the US, Russia and China are in advanced stages of hypersonic missile programmes, India, France, Germany, Japan and Australia too are developing hypersonic weapons.",https://www.financialexpress.com/defence/russia-becomes-the-first-country-to-use-hypersonic-missiles-in-ukraine-know-more/2469354/
7,ee8a66cd-2510-4b54-9741-06bd06292ff5,['Richard Stone'],,"High in the sky over northwestern China, a wedge-shaped unmanned vehicle separated from a rocket. Coasting along at up to Mach 6, or six times the speed of sound, the Xingkong-2 ""waverider"" hypersonic cruise missile (HCM) bobbed and weaved through the stratosphere, surfing on its own shock waves. At least that's how the weapon's developer, the China Academy of Aerospace Aerodynamics, described the August 2018 test. (China did not release any video footage.) The HCM's speed and maneuverability, crowed the Communist Party's Global Times, would enable the new weapon to ""break through any current generation anti-missile defense system.""

For decades, the U.S. military—and its adversaries—have coveted missiles that travel at hypersonic speed, generally defined as Mach 5 or greater. Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) meet that definition when they re-enter the atmosphere from space. But because they arc along a predictable ballistic path, like a bullet, they lack the element of surprise. In contrast, hypersonic weapons such as China's waverider maneuver aerodynamically, enabling them to dodge defenses and keep an adversary guessing about the target.

Since the dawn of the Cold War, the Pentagon has periodically thrown its weight behind the development of maneuverable hypersonic weapons, only to shy away when technological hurdles such as propulsion, control, and heat resistance proved daunting. ""You see a flurry of activity, a lot of investment, and then we conclude it's a bridge too far,"" says aerospace engineer Mark Lewis, director of defense research and engineering for modernization at the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD). ""The community was underfunded and largely forgotten for many years,"" adds Daniel DeLaurentis, director of Purdue University's Institute for Global Security and Defense Innovation.

Now, DOD is leading a new charge, pouring more than $1 billion annually into hypersonic research. Competition from ambitious programs in China and Russia is a key motivator. Although hype and secrecy muddy the picture, all three nations appear to have made substantial progress in overcoming key obstacles, such as protecting hypersonic craft from savage frictional heating. Russia recently unveiled a weapon called the Kinzhal, said to reach Mach 10 under its own power, and another that is boosted by a rocket to an astonishing Mach 27. China showed off a rocket-boosted hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV) of its own, the Dongfeng-17, in a recent military parade. The United States, meanwhile, is testing several hypersonic weapons. ""It's a race to the Moon sort of thing,"" says Iain Boyd, an aerospace engineer at the University of Colorado, Boulder. ""National pride is at stake.""

This new arms race promises to upend strategic calculations. Russian officials have cast nuclear-armed hypersonic craft as a hedge against future U.S. prowess at shooting down ICBMs, which could undermine nuclear deterrence.

China's military, in contrast, sees hypersonic weapons (as well as cyberwarfare and electromagnetic pulse strikes) as an ""assassin's mace"": a folklore term for a weapon that gives an advantage against a better-armed foe, says Larry Wortzel, a senior fellow at the American Foreign Policy Council who serves on the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission. If tensions were to spike over Taiwan or the South China Sea, for instance, China might be tempted to launch preemptive strikes with conventional hypersonic weapons that could cripple U.S. forces in the Pacific Ocean, Wortzel says. China's hypersonic weapons, he warns, ""seem deliberately targeted at upending the tenuous strategic stability that has been in place since the end of the Cold War.""

For now, maneuverability at hypersonic speeds makes the weapons nearly impossible to shoot down—""unstoppable,"" as a headline in The New York Times put it last summer. But, ""Unstoppable today does not mean unstoppable tomorrow,"" says Shari Feth, a materials engineer at the U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA). She's at the vanguard of U.S. efforts to field countermeasures against hypersonic weapons. ""There are technologies that could be developed that could be used for a more robust defense,"" Feth says. ""But we have more work to do to get there.""

The United States has spent decades trying to get hypersonic flight right. The first vehicle to exceed Mach 5 was a two-stage rocket, dubbed Project Bumper, launched in 1949. After four failed tests, the V-2 rocket lifted off from a missile range in New Mexico, releasing a second-stage sounding rocket that attained Mach 6.7.

Project Bumper and subsequent efforts laid bare the daunting challenges. ""This is a very unforgiving realm,"" says Lewis, who served as chief scientist of the U.S. Air Force from 2004 to 2008. ""You're flying under extraordinary conditions""—extreme velocities, forces, and temperatures. The hypersonic threshold of Mach 5 is arbitrary, but at those speeds, he says, ""temperatures start to get high enough to worry about.""

C. BICKEL/ SCIENCE

The heating depends on factors such as the vehicle's speed and contours. When a space shuttle returning from orbit hit the upper atmosphere at Mach 25, its blunt leading edges heated to 1400°C, which a skin of carbon-carbon composites helped it withstand. Newer hypersonic craft tend to have sharper edges—in part to assist with maneuverability—that can exceed 2000°C. Turbulence can make things worse. At hypersonic speeds, the boundary layer around the vehicle thickens, and a smooth, laminar flow can suddenly break up into eddies and swirls that cause temperature spikes on the vehicle's skin. ""We've devoted a lot of fundamental research to figure out when that occurs,"" Lewis says. A vehicle's survival, he says, requires resilient superalloys and ultra–high-temperature ceramics. And perhaps novel coolants. For example, a team at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory has devised a liquid sodium system that drains heat from a leading edge through continuous evaporation and condensation.

High air speeds also pose challenges for engines on HCMs, which unlike HGVs have their own power plants. HCMs use a supersonic combustion ramjet, or ""scramjet,"" to accelerate. ""It's the simplest type of jet engine you could ever imagine … just an open tube"" in which air mixes with fuel, Lewis says. ""It's also perhaps the most complicated type you can imagine because of the extreme conditions under which it operates.""

At hypersonic speeds, air molecules spend milliseconds in the engine tube—scant time for fuel and air to mix properly. And when a vehicle pitches and yaws, airflow into the engine changes, which can result in uneven combustion and thrust. Tweaks to get a better burn have ramifications for, say, how the aircraft withstands shock waves. ""Everything is incredibly coupled. You are designing a fully integrated vehicle,"" Lewis says. It took the United States 46 years to realize its first working scramjet: NASA's $230 million X-43a, an uncrewed vehicle that flew in 2004.

HGVs pose other challenges. The rocket that carries the glider reaches speeds far greater than those of an HCM, meaning engineers must use materials that are even more resistant to heat. Still, HGVs are easier to maneuver because they lack a scramjet, with its acute sensitivity to pitch and yaw. ""It almost becomes a religious discussion—rockets versus air breathing,"" Lewis says. ""The ultimate answer is we probably want both.""

The United States has not yet fielded either. After decades of fits and starts, any advantage that U.S. hypersonic R&D once held has largely eroded away. Its wind tunnels and other testing infrastructure are aging. And challenges such as tweaking designs to ensure engine walls don't melt have slowed progress on scramjets, Lewis says. ""Today we are further away from routine scramjet flight than we were 10 years ago.""

From a base in the Ural Mountains on 26 December 2018, Russia's armed forces launched a ballistic missile carrying an HGV called Avangard. After separating from its carrier in the stratosphere, the HGV zigzagged 6000 kilometers across Siberia at a searing Mach 27, Russian officials claimed, then smashed into a target on the Kamchatka Peninsula. Afterward, a beaming Russian President Vladimir Putin called Avangard ""the perfect New Year's gift for the country."" Russia's defense ministry announced last month that it has put the nuclear-armed HGV into combat duty—allowing Putin to claim that Russia is the first country armed with hypersonic weapons.

Russian boasts along with Chinese advances have sounded the alarm in the United States. Congress will pour more than $1 billion into military hypersonic research this year and has created a new university consortium to do basic studies. ""Our work on hypersonics has really ramped up,"" says Jonathan Poggie, an aerospace engineer at Purdue. His team models low-frequency shock waves ""that pound on a vehicle like a hammer.""

The rising military stakes have prompted the Pentagon to consider classifying some basic hypersonic research. DOD ""is very concerned about educating our enemies,"" Poggie says. ""They are in the middle of trying to draw these red lines,"" Boyd adds. But, ""If we overclassify,"" he warns, ""there are a number of domino effects. You'd be stifling innovation. Inevitably, that means fewer new ideas.""

A veil of secrecy is also descending in Russia, which has produced ""a rich body of hypersonic literature,"" Lewis says. Security officials there recently charged two scientists with treason for sharing findings with European collaborators; the data had been approved for release but then declared secret 5 years later (see sidebar).

China, in contrast, has been surprisingly open about its research. ""The Chinese are trying to establish prestige in the field,"" Lewis says. The nation has invested heavily in facilities, including sophisticated wind tunnels and shock tubes that use blast waves to study hypersonic flows. ""Ten years ago, they were duplicating what others had done,"" Boyd says. ""Now, they're publishing innovative ideas."" At a 2017 hypersonic conference in Xiamen, China, Chinese scientists presented more than 250 papers—about 10 times the number presented by U.S. researchers.

""You see papers you'd think they wouldn't publish in the open literature,"" Poggie says. One is a recent analysis from the China Aerodynamics Research and Development Center showing that the plume of ionized gas, or plasma, left by a hypersonic vehicle is more visible on radar than the vehicle itself. That implies radar could give early warning of an incoming weapon.

Other nations are chasing the trio of leaders—or teaming up with them. Australia is collaborating with the United States on a Mach 8 HGV, and India with Russia on a Mach 7 HCM. France intends to field an HCM by 2022, and Japan is aiming for an HGV in 2026, the U.S. Congressional Research Service noted in a July 2019 report.

The United States is largely defenseless against such weapons, at least for now, in part because it can't track them. U.S. military satellites are vigilant for flashes that reveal launches of ICBMs and cruise missiles. But they would probably lose track of even a rocket-boosted hypersonic weapon soon after it detaches from its booster, analysts say. To avoid ""shooting blindly … you need to continue to track it when it starts doing these maneuvers in the atmosphere,"" says Thomas Karako, director of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic & International Studies.

To remedy that shortcoming, the Pentagon plans to launch hundreds of small satellites with sensors capable of tracking heat sources an order of magnitude cooler than rocket boosters. ""By proliferating them, you make it impossible to take them all out,"" Karako says. The full Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor network could be up and running by 2030, he adds. (The satellites would also be used to help guide U.S. hypersonic weapons.)

Once you have such sensors, ""we can find a way to build the interceptors,"" Karako says. Current missile defense interceptors aim to destroy ICBMs near their apex in the upper atmosphere, much higher than a hypersonic weapon flies, and they aren't maneuverable enough to hit a swerving target. ""You'll need interceptors with more divert capability than we have,"" Karako says.

MDA is exploring various approaches that would enable interceptors to ""overmatch"" incoming weapons, Feth says. One possibility, she says, is to fly faster—a tall order that would demand new lightweight, heat-resistant composites and alloys.

Interceptors could destroy a hypersonic vehicle either by colliding with it or by detonating a warhead nearby. But MDA is also exploring using directed energy: lasers, neutral particle beams, and microwaves or radio waves. Directed-energy countermeasures were floated in the 1980s as elements of the United States's ""Star Wars"" missile defense shield—then abandoned. Four decades later, ""They are more plausible,"" Karako says. Still, MDA recently scrapped plans to test a prototype 500-kilowatt airborne laser by 2025 and to develop a space-based neutral particle beam.

Even as defense scientists search for ways to thwart a hypersonic attack, diplomats and nonproliferation experts are discussing how to limit—or even outlaw—the disruptive technology. ""Hypersonic weapons are primed for arms control,"" argues Ankit Panda, senior fellow on the Defense Posture Project at the Federation of American Scientists, a think tank. The United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs weighed in last year with a report exploring arms control scenarios, blasting what it called a ""blinkered pursuit of a novel technology with as-yet-unproven military utility,""

Arms control treaties, however, are hardly in vogue these days. And with China, Russia, and the United States egging each other on with one high-profile test after another, the hypersonic arms race seems likely to accelerate.",https://www.science.org/content/article/national-pride-stake-russia-china-united-states-race-build-hypersonic-weapons

BBC News Published 18 March

Image source, Getty Images Image caption, A Ukrainian soldier holding a Javelin anti-tank missile system during exercises in 2021

The burnt-up wreckage of a Russian tank lies in the dirt, while in an accompanying photo next to it, a Ukrainian soldier carries the armaments said to have caused the destruction.

The images posted to Twitter by the Ukrainian Armed Forces are labelled with a triumphant caption, declaring that this was the result of ""hits from Javelins on [Russian] military equipment"".

The Javelin, a shoulder-held anti-tank weapon that shoots heat-seeking rockets hurtling towards targets up to 4km (2.5 miles) away, can be controlled by a portable unit that doesn't look much different from a video game console - but can send a metre-long projectile straight through the side or top of an armoured tank.

The very presence of the American-made weapons ""causes panic"" among Russian troops, the Ukrainian military claims - and it is about to get 2,000 more of them.

Javelin missiles are among the items promised to Ukraine by the US in a new $800m (£608.3m) military assistance package announced by President Joe Biden on Wednesday.

Other armaments include drones that can be turned into flying bombs and anti-aircraft weapons that can shoot helicopters from the sky.

But will these shipments help Ukraine overcome Russia's more numerous - and better equipped - invasion force?

What will the US send to Ukraine?

The new US aid for Ukraine includes a wide range of military equipment, ranging from 25,000 sets each of body armour and helmets to rifles and grenade launchers, thousands of other anti-tank weapons and more than 20m rounds of ammunition.

Besides Javelin missiles, the most powerful weapons include 800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems, once famously used to shoot down Soviet planes in Afghanistan.

The US also plans to ship 100 ""tactical unmanned aerial systems"" - small drones - which are often hand-launched and small enough to fit into rucksacks.

Soldiers can use them to scope out the battlefield or, in some cases, to attack, essentially creating flying bombs that can be flown into targets from a distance.

Mr Biden's announcement on Wednesday brings the total amount of US military aid pledged for Ukraine to $1bn in the past week alone - a huge acceleration when compared to the $2.7bn provided between 2014 and the start of 2022.

It is a ""significant development"" and addresses previous shortfalls, according to John Herbst, a former US ambassador in Kyiv.

""There's no question that [Biden] and his team have been too timid in providing support for Ukraine,"" Mr Herbst said. ""And they have responded to that pressure.""

What will this mean against Russian ground and air offensives?

Military experts say that the US-supplied anti-tank weapons are likely to have the most impact in Ukraine.

The invading Russian forces ""are primarily mechanised forces"" - meaning armoured convoys - so ""the best thing you can do is take them [vehicles] out"", said former US Army Colonel Christopher Mayer.

Ukraine has received a variety of anti-tank systems from several countries, which helps increase the ""lethality"" of Ukraine's forces against Russian vehicles, Mr Mayer said.

""If you give them a variety of anti-tank systems, it provides them with multiple opportunities to punch through whatever particular defensive armour protection systems that tank has,"" he said.

And while their claims can't be independently verified, Ukrainian officials say they are putting the weapons to good effect. As of 16 March, they claim to have destroyed more than 400 tanks and over 2,000 other Russian vehicles.

Anti-tank weapons, however, do nothing to help Ukraine combat Russia's air force, which for three weeks has been striking targets across the country.

The man-portable, shoulder-fired Stinger system is the only anti-aircraft weapon included in the US aid package.

The system has been seen in conflicts around the world since 1981. It was most famously used in Afghanistan, where US-supplied Stingers helped bring down hundreds of Russian aircraft and helicopters during the Soviet occupation.

Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Ukrainian Ministry of Defence image of a Russian helicopter being shot down by its forces early in March.

It is effective against low-flying helicopters or aircraft at up to about 3,800m (12,400ft), making it relatively useless against higher-flying Russian bombers.

Mr Herbst said that the administration's mention of Stingers as part of the aid package to Ukraine is a ""sign of weakness"".

""They do need more Stingers, there's no doubt about that,"" he said. ""But they need higher altitude anti-aircraft weapons as well…that's a serious omission.""

What has the US not sent?

While the White House has hinted that higher-altitude weapons - such as the Soviet-era S-300 anti-aircraft missile - might be headed to Ukraine via third countries, no formal announcement has been made.

Officials in Slovakia have expressed a willingness to send the systems to Ukraine, provided they receive replacements. Two other Nato allies - Greece and Bulgaria - also reportedly have the systems.

The US has also dismissed proposals to have Poland transfer its Mig-29 fighter jets to Ukraine to allow them to do more to contest the skies.

US officials have described the plan as not ""tenable"" due to the increased risk of open conflict between Nato and Russia.

Mr Mayer, however, said that the transfer of Mig-29 or similar jets by US allies - with the administration's blessing - would be an effective way of helping Ukraine fight for control of its skies.

He noted that the Soviet Union provided both aircraft and pilots to North Vietnam to operate against US aircraft without starting a wider confrontation.

What have other countries done?

The US isn't alone in providing military aid to Ukraine. At least 30 other countries have provided help, including €500m ($551m) from the European Union, a historic first.

After the US announced the new assistance package, however, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that ""more support"" was urgently needed.

""Even more than we get now,"" he said, calling for ""air defence systems, aircraft [and] enough lethal weapons and ammunition to stop the Russian occupiers"".

Mr Mayer said he believes that the US weapon supplies pledged to date are perhaps only enough to allow the Ukrainians to ""die heroically"".

""We must be more aggressive about giving them what we have,"" he said. ""We should at least give them the same quality, and quantity, of stuff as the Soviet Union gave to North Vietnam during our war with them.""

Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Ukrainian soldiers unloading US-made Javelin anti-tank weapons just weeks before Russia's invasion on 24 February

Mr Herbst said that additional assistance packages will ""probably"" be needed in the future - and that they'll only be effective if they allow Ukraine to challenge Russia's air force.

""The key to me is whether or not we're sending something that hits Russian air assets at 30,000 feet or above,"" he said.

While no firm announcements have been made thus far, President Biden vowed that more help will be on the way - and that the US is working to help Ukraine acquire the longer-range air defence systems it needs, without providing details.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-60774098

The White House will commit no U.S. or NATO planes to the skies above Ukraine, a move U.S. officials fear could risk turning a regional war into a global conflagration, but it is providing Ukraine with missiles that could accomplish the same task of destroying Russian aircraft.

Such is the tenuous balance the Biden administration has tried to maintain as it seeks to help Ukraine lock Russia in a quagmire without inciting a broader conflict with a nuclear-armed adversary or cutting off potential paths to de-escalation.

Navigating this path has led to a tangle of decisions and sometimes tortured distinctions when it comes to what kinds of assistance Washington should provide, even as the situation on the ground evolves, pictures of dead civilians circulate around the globe, and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine pleads with Congress and President Joe Biden to do more to help.

In the White House and the Pentagon, there have been active debates over which lethal weapons delivered to Ukraine meet the nuanced interpretations of what international law allows. U.S. officials acknowledge that the judgments of government lawyers are valuable only up to a point and that all that really matters is the judgment of one person: Putin.

The Russian president has his own complex calculus about when the military support to Ukraine from the United States and its NATO allies crosses the line. He has his own reasons not to escalate, given the combined power of the NATO members and his own military’s evident difficulties against Ukrainian forces. But he is also unlikely to accept defeat or a stalemate in Ukraine without further testing U.S. resolve, despite explicit public warnings from Washington against the use of chemical, biological or even nuclear weapons.

U.S. intelligence about Putin’s decision-making is maddeningly imprecise, and the West does not have a strong track record predicting what he might consider an aggression that cannot be tolerated. CIA Director William Burns told Congress this month that Putin’s views had “hardened over the years.”

The Russian threshold could also be changing by the day or even the hour. On Friday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov suggested that his country was prepared to raise the costs for any nation helping the Ukrainians in their struggle, declaring that all vehicles shuttling weapons into Ukraine would be considered legitimate military targets.

A clash over fighter planes

On Wednesday, the task of articulating the intricacies of the U.S.’s military policy toward Ukraine fell to a group of generals under a barrage of questions from top members of the House and Senate Armed Services committees.

Biden has made clear that he will not accede to Zelenskyy’s insistent pleas that NATO impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine. Clearing hostile aircraft from the skies would put the United States and its allies in combat with Russian forces. And a required step for a no-fly zone — suppressing enemy anti-aircraft weaponry — would mean attacking Russian air defense installations inside Russian territory.

But during the closed-door session, lawmakers pressed members of the Pentagon’s Joint Staff about another flash point: the administration’s decision not to help supply Ukraine with the MiG-29 fighter jets that Poland has offered and that Zelenskyy has said his forces desperately need.

Administration officials have said the move would be “escalatory,” and, according to people briefed on the exchanges, the lawmakers asked the generals if there was any hard intelligence that the jets might push Putin toward intensifying the conflict by treating the United States as a “co-belligerent” in the war.

Intelligence officials have, in fact, told the administration that the MiGs could trigger a Russian move against NATO. During the congressional briefing, the generals said that the main issue was the capability of a MiG-29 to threaten Russian soil.

In contrast to a Javelin anti-tank missile that has only limited range on the battlefield, a MiG-29 could fly from Kyiv to Moscow in a matter of minutes, the generals said, a capability that the Kremlin might see as a direct threat.

The same day, the White House put forth another consideration: that to be delivered to Ukraine, the MiGs would have to take off from an air base in a NATO country, possibly inviting retaliation on NATO territory by the Russians.

Some U.S. officials assert that as a matter of international law, the provision of weaponry and intelligence to the Ukrainian Army has made the United States a co-belligerent, an argument that some legal experts dispute. But while Putin has made threats about launching attacks to impede the military assistance, he has not yet acted to stop it by attacking bases in neighboring countries — NATO allies — where the equipment originates.

That could change, U.S. officials said, especially if Putin thinks he is cornered or in danger of losing.

“It is a fine line the administration is still walking in every dimension of its support for Ukraine,” said Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a former senior intelligence official who specialized in Russia and is now at the Center for a New American Security. “They are trying to figure out, how do you get right up to the line without crossing over in a way that would risk direct confrontation with Russia?”

Planes with pilots might be off the table, but armed drones are not. This past week, Biden announced that the United States would ship small Switchblade drones to Ukraine that could be used to blow up Russian armored vehicles. The single-use kamikaze drones have bladelike wings; do not require either a long runway or a complex satellite uplink; and can be controlled to dive-bomb tanks or troops, self-destructing when they explode.

Unlike the large Predator and Reaper drones used for decades in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and other countries, the portable drones pose no threat to Russian soil. Still, the White House authorized an initial shipment of only 100 of them to Ukraine — a small batch that could be intended to see how Putin reacts to their deployment on the Ukrainian front lines. Depending on the response, hundreds or thousands more could be on the way.

The proposal for Turkey to supply Ukraine with Russian-made S-400 anti-aircraft systems would also test what Putin is willing to accept from NATO — and how far a NATO ally that in recent years often appeared to be building bridges to Moscow is willing to go in reiterating its commitment to the alliance and backing Ukraine.

The idea came up when Wendy Sherman, the deputy secretary of state, visited Turkey two weeks ago. Sherman declined to talk about her discussions.

A different senior U.S. official said the United States knew the proposal would anger Putin. Ukraine already uses Turkish-made drones, but Turkey is worried that providing the anti-aircraft systems could make the country a target of Russia’s wrath.

At the same time, the upside for Turkey could be substantial: It was suspended by the Trump administration from the F-35 fighter program — in which it was a buyer and a manufacturer of parts for the advanced aircraft — after its purchase of the Russian S-400s. A deal to send the anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine could open the door to reentry into the F-35 program.

The conflict of the future, delayed

The Ukraine war features tank columns and trenches, all features of Europe’s bloody conflicts of the past century. Thus far, there is little evidence that the United States — or Russia — is eager to escalate the conflict in the 21st century battleground of cyberspace.

Days before the war began, there was a flurry of cyberattacks on Ukrainian financial institutions and government ministries, including one that was found and partly neutralized by Microsoft. A European satellite system sometimes used by the Ukrainian military was also hit, knocking out service, although it is still unclear whether the Russians carried out the attack.

What has been missing thus far is a large-scale Russian cyberattack that disables the power grid or communications systems inside Ukraine, which for the most part continue to operate despite the withering Russian barrage of artillery and airstrikes.

Until the invasion began, U.S. Cyber Command had a unit based in Kyiv that was helping the government fend off attacks. It is now operating from a nearby NATO country. There is fragmentary evidence that the United States and its allies worked to counter some of the attacks and to prevent others from being launched. But action seems to have been limited.

Inside the Biden administration, there is a view that Putin could be choosing his moment to launch a cyberattack against the U.S. financial system in retaliation for the devastating financial sanctions imposed on his country by the United States and its allies. Unless and until that happens, the administration appears resolved not to launch a significant first strike and invite retaliation — especially given the risks to the U.S. economy and financial system if Russia were to target them.

Keeping the temperature down

“The water in Afghanistan must boil at the right temperature,” Pakistan’s then-president, Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, told his intelligence chief as Pakistan began supplying the mujahedeen in their grueling battle against Soviet troops in neighboring Afghanistan.

In other words, hot enough to convince the Russians that the country was not worth the struggle but not so hot as to provoke a broader war in the region.

The weapons that helped turn the tide of that conflict, shoulder-fired Stinger surface-to-air missiles, are now being unloaded from cargo planes in NATO countries and delivered to Ukrainian troops on the front lines to help keep Russia from controlling the skies.

U.S. officials are divided on how much the lessons from Cold War proxy wars, like the Soviet Union’s war in Afghanistan, can be applied to the ongoing war in Ukraine. Some officials say those conflicts established that the great powers could ship small arms and missiles to proxy forces without triggering a wider war.

At the same time, Ukraine is far more important to Putin than Afghanistan was to Soviet leaders.

Given Russia’s bloody history with Stinger missiles, U.S. officials have been wary of advertising their use in Ukraine. This month, when Gen. Mark Milley, chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, visited an airfield near Ukraine’s border where Stingers were being unloaded, reporters traveling with him were barred from disclosing the whereabouts of the base.

Even after two senior U.S. officials told the House Armed Services Committee during a public hearing that Stinger missiles were among the munitions being sent to Ukraine, spokespeople avoided using the S-word from the lecterns at the White House and Pentagon.

Until this past week. On Wednesday, the White House released a detailed list of the weapons it was providing as part of an $800 million package of arms to Ukraine.

At the top of the list: “800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems.”
