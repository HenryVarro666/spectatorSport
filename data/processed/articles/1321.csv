Russia said earlier that the first phase of its military operation was mostly complete and it would focus on completely “liberating” Ukraine’s breakaway eastern Donbas region.

Ukraine, Russia voice pessimism over talks

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba says negotiations with Russia aimed at ending the conflict are “very difficult” and vowed Kyiv would not back down on its demands.

“The Ukrainian delegation has taken a strong position and does not relinquish its demands. We insist, first of all, on a ceasefire, security guarantees, and [the] territorial integrity of Ukraine,” Kuleba said.

Meanwhile, Russia’s Interfax news agency quoted Russian negotiator Vladimir Medinsky as saying the two sides were making little progress on key issues.

Medinsky also said Moscow believed Kyiv was trying to stretch out the negotiations.

Earlier, Turkish broadcaster NTV and others cited President Recep Tayyip Erdogan as saying progress had been made on several key points. Ankara, which enjoys good relations with both Moscow and Kyiv, has been attempting to position itself as a mediator between the two sides.

Switzerland adopts more EU sanctions against Russia

Switzerland’s government says it has adopted more EU sanctions against Russia after pledging to act in step with the bloc as it moves to financially punish Moscow.

“This means that all measures contained in the EU’s fourth package of sanctions have been implemented,” the country’s cabinet said in a statement.

However, the cabinet said it had decided not to implement the EU measure of March 1 suspending the broadcasting of Russian media outlets Sputnik and Russia Today.

“Despite the fact that these outlets are used to spread targeted propaganda and disinformation by the Russian Federation, the Federal Council is of the opinion that it is more effective to counter untrue and harmful statements with facts instead of preventing them from being broadcast,” it added.

Dozens of Ukrainian officials, journalists detained, disappeared: UN

Dozens of Ukrainian officials, journalists and activists have been detained or forcibly disappeared by invading Russian forces, the UN has warned, saying that some cases resembled “hostage-taking”.

The UN’s human rights office (OHCHR) said it had documented the arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance of 22 local Ukrainian officials, 13 of whom had subsequently been released, since Moscow launched its attack.

At least 15 journalists and civil society activists “who vocally opposed the invasion” in several regions had also been taken, Matilda Bogner, OHCHR’s representative in Ukraine, said in a statement.

“This does seem to be a pattern that is occurring in areas that are occupied by the Russian Federation,” she said.

“Forces of the Russian Federation are going specifically to detain, and do not inform relatives and others where they are taking people … That does in some cases appear to be a form of hostage-taking.”

Moscow updates troop death toll, says 1,351 killed

Russia’s army has updated its troop death toll, saying 1,351 soldiers have been killed and 3,825 others wounded since the start of its offensive in Ukraine.

The new toll, announced at a Moscow briefing delivered by senior military officials, came several weeks after Moscow gave its first assessment of losses in the conflict on March 2.

At the time, Russia put the number of its forces killed at 498.

Kyiv says more than 16,000 Russian troops have been killed, while NATO officials have told Al Jazeera they believe the death toll on the Russian side amounts to between 7,000-15,000 personnel.

Russia says first phase of Ukraine ‘operation’ mostly complete

Russia has said the first phase of its “military operation” in Ukraine is mostly complete and that it will now focus on completely “liberating” eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region.

The Russian defence ministry said Russian-backed separatists now controlled 93 percent of Ukraine’s Luhansk region and 54 percent of the Donetsk region – the two areas that jointly make up the Donbas.

“The combat potential of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has been considerably reduced, which … makes it possible to focus our core efforts on achieving the main goal, the liberation of Donbas,” Sergei Rudskoi, head of the Russian General Staff’s Main Operational Directorate, said.

The defence ministry added that it did not rule out storming Ukrainian cities that had been blockaded and said that Russia would react immediately to any attempt to close the airspace over Ukraine – something Kyiv has asked NATO to do, but NATO has resisted.

It said that Moscow’s offensive would continue until Russian forces had completed the tasks that had been set by Russian President Vladimir Putin, without saying what those tasks were.

Russia’s military had considered two options for its operation in Ukraine, one confined to the Donbas and the other on the whole territory of Ukraine, before opting for the latter, according to Rudskoi.

“We will do everything in our power so that buses filled with Mariupol residents reach Zaporizhzhia today,” she added.

Mariupol, which is normally home to about 400,000 people, has been under heavy bombardment from Russian forces for weeks. Those trapped there have been sheltering in basements with little food, power or running water.

The US and EU have announced a new deal on liquefied natural gas (LNG) aimed at reducing Europe’s reliance on Russian energy imports.

The agreement, unveiled by Biden and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at a news conference in Brussels, will see the US supply the bloc with at least 15 billion additional cubic metres of the fuel this year.

“This will replace the LNG supply we currently receive from Russia,” von der Leyen said.

She added the EU will work with member states to also ensure they can receive at least 50 bcm of additional LNG until 2030.

About 10 percent of the EU’s gas needs are met by production within the bloc. Russia typically supplies about 41 percent of the rest of the LNG used by its member states.

59 percent of Russian missiles malfunctioned, downed or missed: Ukraine

Russia has launched some 1,200 cruise missiles since its invasion began, but 59 percent of them did not explode, were shot down or missed, Ukraine’s General Staff of the Armed Forces has said.

“Others were either shot down by air defence forces, or hit wrong targets – mountains, forests, rivers,” it added. “They have imprecise missiles and crooked hands.”

A part of Luhansk has been controlled by pro-Russian separatists since 2014, and their “People’s Republic” became a springboard for the Russian invasion that began on February 24.

Russian state media has shown Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu attending a meeting of top officials amid speculation about his whereabouts after he dropped out of public view weeks into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Shoigu, who is overseeing the war in Ukraine, had not been seen in public since March 11.

But the RIA state-owned news agency on Thursday showed Shoigu on a televised split screen of top officials as Putin spoke to his Security Council by video conference.

The Pentagon official also said an upcoming Pentagon defence strategy document would declare Russia an “acute threat”.

US assesses up to 60% failure rate for some Russian missiles: Report

Three US officials have told the Reuters news agency that Russia is suffering failure rates as high as 60 percent for some of the precision-guided missiles it is using to attack Ukraine.

Reuters said the US officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, did not provide evidence to support the assessment and did not disclose what precisely was driving high missile failure rates.

If true, the agency said, it could help explain why Russia has failed to achieve what most could consider basic objectives since its invasion a month ago, such as neutralizing Ukraine’s air force, despite the apparent strength of its military against Ukraine’s much smaller armed forces.

A government official in the northern city of Chernihiv has told The Associated Press news agency that a “catastrophe” is unfolding for the local population with Russian troops deliberately targeting food stores in a near-month-long siege.

An air attack this week destroyed a bridge over the Desna River, which was a crucial route to bring in food and other aid from Ukraine-controlled territory further south.

“Humanitarian help, medicines and food used to be delivered into the city via this bridge,” City Council Secretary Olexander Lomako told AP in an audio message.

He estimated that more than 130,000 people are left in the city out of a pre-war population of 285,000, but that Ukraine remains in full control.

Ukraine forces striking ‘high value’ Russian targets: UK

The UK’s defence ministry says Ukrainian forces have launched raids against “high-value targets in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, including a landing ship and ammunition storage depots at Berdyansk”.

In its latest intelligence update, the ministry said such attacks will force the Russian military to “prioritise the defence of their supply chain and deprive them of much-needed resupply for forces”.

“This will reduce Russia’s ability to conduct offensive operations and further damage already dwindling morale,” it added.

Ukraine says Moscow forcibly taking civilians to Russia

Ukraine says Moscow has forcibly taken 402,000 civilians from shattered Ukrainian cities to Russia, where some may be used as “hostages” to pressure Kyiv to give up.

Lyudmyla Denisova, Ukraine’s ombudsperson, said the figure included 84,000 children.

She said they were being held in primitive conditions with little food and water.

The Kremlin gave nearly identical numbers for those who have been relocated but said they wanted to go to Russia.

Ukraine’s rebel-controlled eastern regions are predominantly Russian-speaking, and many people there have supported close ties to Moscow.

Legislation removing “most-favoured-nation” trade status for Russia has been delayed in the US Senate at least until next week, after some Republicans raised concerns that its human rights provisions might be too broad.

The bill was blocked despite legislators’ insistence that they wanted to show a united front in supporting the government in Kyiv, a month after Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine.

Western officials say 7 Russian generals killed in Ukraine

Western officials said they are aware of seven Russian generals who have been killed in Ukraine since the war began last month and are aware of another general who was dismissed.

Lt. Gen. Yakov Rezanstev, commander of Russia's 49th Combined Arms Army in the southern military district, was killed most recently.

Army Commander General Vlaislav Yershov was allegedly fired this week by the Kremlin. He was reportedly sacked because of the heavy casualties and strategic failures the Russian army is suffering.

General Magomed Tushaev of the Chechen Special Forces was also reportedly killed in Ukraine.

Ukraine says Russian missiles hit its air force headquarters

Ukraine's air force said the headquarters in Vinnytsia in the western part of the country was hit by numerous Russian cruise missiles Friday afternoon.

Six missiles were blocked by the country's air defense systems, it added.

Zelenskyy asks for peace talks again

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reiterated his call for peace talks with Russia to end the war. But he stressed that Ukraine would not give up territory.

In his nightly video address to the Ukrainan people, Zelenskyy may have been responding to Russian Colonel General Sergei Rudskoi, the deputy chief of the Russian general staff. Rudskoi said Russian forces would focus on ""the main goal, the liberation of Donbas.""

Russia has said its invasion of Ukraine has entered a new phase, one signal it may be scaling back its ambitions due to a series of setbacks and defeats at the hands of the Ukrainian army and Ukrainians fighting against the Russian invasion.

Pentagon says Ukraine fighting to retake Kherson

The Pentagon said the Ukrainian military has launched a counteroffensive to retake the city of Kherson, located at the mouth of the Dnieper River.

""We would argue Kherson is actually contested territory again,"" a senior US defense official briefed reporters.

The official added, ""We can't corroborate exactly who is in control of Kherson but the point is, it doesn't appear to be as solidly in Russian control as it was before.""

If Ukraine's forces can manage to retake the strategic city, it could cut off Russian troops around Mykolaiv, which ""would make it very, very difficult for them to make any kind of ground movement on Odessa,"" the Pentagon official noted.

The Pentagon also said it had observed Russia trying to recruit fighters from the Russian-backed separatist enclaves of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in northern Georgia.

France plans Mariupol evacuation

He addressed US troops who are stationed there as part of a NATO mission to protect its eastern flank. NATO yesterday agreed to bolster its defenses in the wake of the invasion.

Biden honored the bravery of the Ukrainian people.

""The Ukrainian people have a lot of backbone. They have a lot of guts. And I'm sure you are observing it. And I don't just mean the military ... but also the average citizen,"" he told US soldiers. ""Look at how they are stepping up ... Women, young people, standing in front of a damn tank saying 'I'm not leaving.'""

Biden was due to meet with Polish President Andrzej Duda and visit Poland’s humanitarian operation for the millions of refugees it has taken in. However, Duda’s airplane was forced to make an emergency landing, delaying plans.

Biden stressed that he had wanted to visit Poland to underscore that its efforts to take in refugees are of ""enormous consequence.""

UN: Several Ukrainian officials, reporters, activists held by Russian troops

Dozens of Ukrainian officials, journalists and activists have been detained or kidnapped by Russian forces, the United Nations has warned.

The UN human rights office (OHCHR) in Kyiv said it had documented the arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance of 22 Ukrainian officials. It said 13 were later released.

The UN body's representative in Ukraine Matilda Bogner said some of the cases resembled ""hostage-taking.""

She said 15 journalists and civil society activists are among those taken, along with the mayor of Ukraine's southern city of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov.

Fedorov was held for several days by occupying Russian forces before being freed.

Seven journalists have been killed since the invasion began on February 24, the OHCHR said.

Ukraine: Cease-fire talks with Russia still 'difficult'

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba says peace talks with Russia remain difficult, denying reports that four out of six key issues were close to being resolved.

""There is no consensus with Russia on the four points,"" he said in a post on Facebook, adding that the Ukrainian delegation has ""taken a strong position and does not relinquish its demands. We insist, first of all, on a cease-fire, security guarantees and territorial integrity of Ukraine.""

Russian negotiator Vladimir Medinsky earlier said that the two countries were coming closer to an understanding on secondary questions, but that there has been limited progress on the key matters.

""Negotiations have been going on all week, from Monday to Friday, in video conference format, and will continue tomorrow,"" Russian news agency Interfax quoted Medinsky as saying. ""On secondary issues, positions are converging. However on the main political issues, we are in fact treading water.""

He said that he believed Ukraine was deliberately stalling the talks.

Russia says it is seeking a comprehensive deal on a range of issues, and if that is not achieved then an agreement is unlikely.

Earlier Friday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said progress had been made in negotiations and called on his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to make an “honorable exit” from Ukraine.

Ankara sees itself as a mediator in the conflict and Erdogan has mooted the idea of talks between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Prague renames Russian embassy address to 'Ukrainian heroes' street'

The Czech capital of Prague has said it will rename the street where the Russian embassy sits to ""Ukrainian heroes' street."" A nearby bridge will also be named after Ukrainian soldier Vitaly Skakun, who is said to have delayed the Russian advance by blowing up a bridge in southern Ukraine, losing his own life in the process.

This is not the first time the city has used names to criticize Russian policy. Two years ago, Prague also renamed a square on the other side of the embassy grounds after murdered Russian opposition politician Boris Nemtsov.

At the same time, the Czech government said that so far it had handed out 226,000 resident permits to Ukrainian refugees, though it estimates that a total of 300,000 are in the country. However, some observers working for Czech aid organizations said that the country needed clear procedures for housing refugees and better distribution throughout the country or it would not be able to handle the influx.

Eyewitness accounts from inside Mariupol

The besieged city of Mariupol in southeastern Ukraine had over 400,000 inhabitants before the war. Many are still there and making do with little food and water. Those who can are leaving, but even this is dangerous.

DW spoke to three eyewitnesses to the destruction of Mariupol.

Russia claims main objectives of first stage completed

The Russian Defense Ministry claims it has achieved the primary objectives of the first phase of its invasion of Ukraine.

It says its forces in Ukraine will now focus on the ""liberation"" of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, both breakaway provinces in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas.

The ministry claims it has ""liberated"" 93% of the territory in Luhansk and 54% of the Donetsk region.

In comments carried by Russian news agency Interfax, the ministry claimed it had been considering two options for its ""special operation"" in Ukraine. The first option focused solely on the “liberation” of those provinces, and the other focused on whole territory of Ukraine.

""In general, the main tasks of the first stage of the operation have been accomplished. The combat potential of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has been significantly reduced, which allows us, once again, to concentrate our main efforts on achieving the main goal — the liberation of Donbass,"" Sergey Rudskoy, head of the Main Operational Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces was quoted as saying.

The ministry says that its military operation will continue until Russian forces have completed the (unspecified) tasks that had been set.

The ministry claimed just 1,351 Russian soldiers had died in the invasion and 3,825 had been injured. That compares to a NATO estimate of up to 40,000 total Russian casualties, including up to 15,000 dead.

Russia also claimed that 14,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed, and 16,000 injured.

It claimed that the Ukrainian air force, its air defense forces and navy has been completely destroyed.

Putin says Russian greats falling victim to West's 'cancel culture'

Russian President Vladimir Putin has said the West is trying to erase Russian culture, including the works of great composers such as Pyotr Tchaikovsky, Dmitry Shostakovich and Sergei Rachmaninov.

Speaking at a meeting of winners of presidential literature and art awards for works for children and young people, Putin accused the West of ""discrimination of everything connected with Russia with the full connivance and sometimes encouragement of the ruling elites.""

He said that ""Tchaikovsky, Shostakovich and Rachmaninov are being erased from concert posters, and Russian writers and their books are being banned,"" adding that such art censorship had last been carried out by the Nazis in Germany.

Russian domestic culture prevented such acts from being carried out in Russia, he said.

Putin did not cite any concrete instances to back his claims that Russian culture was being ""canceled"" abroad.

India, China urge 'immediate cease-fire' in Ukraine

The foreign ministers of India and China have called for a return to diplomacy in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

""Both of us agreed on the importance of an immediate cease-fire, as well as a return to diplomacy,"" India's Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said after the meeting with his counterpart Wang Yi.

The two ministers met in the Indian capital on Friday for what was the first high level meeting in nearly two years after relations deteriorated following deadly border clashes in June 2020.

India and China are both allied with Moscow and have rejected Western calls for condemnation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Erdogan: Putin needs to be an 'architect of peace'

Turkey's president has called on his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to ""make an honorable exit"" from Ukraine.

""We need to tell Putin 'now, you should be the architect of a step for peace,'"" Recep Tayyip Erdogan said to reporters on his return flight from the NATO summit in Brussels.

Erdogan recently invited Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for talks on Turkish soil.

He said while a compromise is possible, the two sides are at odds over territorial issues.

Erdogan also said he was hesitant to cut Turkey's dependence on Russian energy unlike other countries, saying he couldn't ""leave my citizens out in the cold.""

Athlete who fled Ukraine wins Jerusalem marathon

The 31-year-old Ukrainian athlete Valentyna Veretska has won the Jerusalem marathon four weeks after fleeing Russia's invasion of her country to come to Israel, race organizers said.

Veretska fled Ukraine with her 11-year-old daughter, crossing into neighboring Poland before traveling to Israel. Her husband stayed in their homeland where he is serving in the army, the organizers said.

Since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, more than 16,800 Ukrainians have arrived in Israel, according to the Interior Ministry.

Growing reports of mass graves in Mariupol: UN

Human rights monitors have been receiving ever more information on mass graves in the besieged port city of Mariupol, the head of the UN rights team in Ukraine has said.

""We have got increasing information on mass graves that are there,"" Matilda Bogner told journalists by video link from Ukraine, adding that one of them appeared to hold 200 bodies.

She said more than 1,035 civilians had so far been killed during Russia's invasion and that her team was investigating what seemed to be indiscriminate attacks both by Russian and Ukrainian forces.

Last major Russia-EU transport link to close

The Finnish rail company VR says it will shut down its 400-kilometer (249-mile) St. Petersburg-Helsinki route at the weekend.

The so-called Allegro line has been one of the last main ways of getting from Russia to the EU since both closed their airspace to each other amid Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.

VR said its trains had continued to run over the last few weeks at the request of authorities to allow any Finns in Russia who wished to do so to get home.

Trains from Russia to Helsinki have been full of Russians since the invasion of Ukraine began on February 24, leading to airspace closures both by the EU and Moscow.

Kremlin says military to advise Putin on combating NATO buildup

The Russian military will present proposals to President Vladimir Putin on how best to counter NATO's announced strengthening of its eastern flank, according to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as cited by Reuters.

In his weekly conference call with reporters, Peskov also said the expulsion of Russia from the Group of Twenty (G20) major economies that has been proposed by the US and allies would not have serious repercussions for the country.

""The G20 format is important, but in the current circumstances, when most of the participants are in a state of economic war with us, nothing terrible will happen,"" Peskov said, adding that US efforts to isolate Moscow had been only partially effective and would anyway fail.

He said some countries were taking a ""more sober"" approach to Moscow, allowing it to build new policy directions.

After Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Moscow of using phosphorus bombs during the conflict, Peskov insisted that Russia had ""never"" violated international law.

He also declined to say whether Russia would rebuild Ukrainian towns and cities such as Mariupol, which has been devastated by Russian bombardment.

300 believed dead in Russian strike on Mariupol theater: City officials

Ukrainian officials have said around 300 people might have died after last week's Russian strike on a theater in the port city of Mariupol being used as a shelter by many hundreds of people.

""From eyewitnesses, information is emerging that about 300 people died in the Drama Theatre of Mariupol following strikes by a Russian aircraft,"" Mariupol city hall wrote on Telegram.

It described the attack as ""cynical"" and claimed that Russia knew civilians were taking refuge in the building.

Ukrainian officials reported in the past days that attempts to rescue those trapped in the basement of the theater had been hampered by a lack of emergency services and constant bombardment by Russian forces.

New attempt to evacuate Mariupol: Ukrainian deputy PM

Ukraine hopes that some civilians currently trapped in the southern port city of Mariupol will be able to leave in private cars on Friday, according to Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk.

Several attempts to create humanitarian corridors out of the city, which has been under constant attack from surrounding Russian forces, have failed. Civilians in the city are reportedly suffering for food, power and water shortages.

Vereshchuk said buses would be waiting in the nearby city of Berdiansk to take those who succeeded in leaving Mariupol to the city of Zaporizhzhia.

""We will do everything in our power so that buses filled with Mariupol residents reach Zaporizhzhia today,"" she said.

Germany plans to halve Russian oil imports by summer

German Economy Minister Robert Habeck says Germany will be able to greatly reduce its dependence of Russian coal, gas and oil in the coming weeks.

He said Russian oil would drop to 25% from 35% of oil imports and those of Russian coal would fall by a current 50% of Germany's total to 25%.

He also said that Germany expects to become independent of Russian gas by mid-2024.

To this end, he said the government had secured the use of three ""floating'' terminals capable of regasifying liquefied natural gas (LNG) brought in by ship and is involved in building permanent LNG terminals for long-term imports.

US to supply additional LNG to Europe

The United States and the European Union have announced a plan to reduce the bloc's reliance on Russian fossil fuels.

Under the deal, the US will increase its liquified natural gas (LNG) exports to Europe by 15 billion cubic meters this year, the White House said.

The initiative was unveiled by US President Joe Biden and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

Global food prices could keep rising: Ukraine's agriculture minister

Ukraine's new agriculture minister has said global food prices would continue to rise if the situation in Ukraine following Russia's invasion did not change.

Mykola Solskyi, who was appointed on Thursday after the sudden resignation of his predecessor, said Ukraine's grain stocks for export amount to $7.5 billion (€6.8 billion). He did not say what the volume of grains for export was.

Ukraine is one of the world's biggest grain exporters.

The former agriculture minister, Roman Leshchenko, stepped down on Thursday, citing health reasons. Two days previously, he said he expected Ukraine's spring crop area might be halved this year to only 7 million hectares (17.3 million acres).

Russian forces pushed back up to 35 km east from Kyiv: UK intelligence

According to British intelligence, Ukrainian forces have succeeded in recapturing towns and defensive positions from invading Russian forces up to 35 kilometers (22 miles) east of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv.

A report from the British Defense Ministry on Friday said Ukrainian troops were also likely to continue pushing back Russian forces on the northwestern axis from Kyiv toward the Hostomel Airfield, some 26 kilometers from the capital. It was captured by Russian forces on February 25 at the start of Moscow's invasion.

Russian forces in the south of Ukraine were still seeking to circumvent the city of Mykolaiv as they try to move in on Odesa, with fierce Ukrainian resistance and supply issues impeding their progress, according to the report.

Almost half of people in Germany want Ukraine in the EU: Survey

The number of people in Germany who are in favor of Ukraine joining the EU has risen by 16% since 2018, a YouGov survey has shown.

Forty-six percent of those asked would now like to see Ukraine in the bloc.

The survey also showed a clear reduction in the number of people opposed to the country's EU membership, with just 30% against compared with 47% in 2018.

Other countries are showing similar trends, with 42% of people in France in favor of Ukraine's EU accession (2018: 22%), 60% in Spain and 45% in Italy. The percentage of those who are undecided remains fairly high in all the countries included in the survey at 24-29%.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urged that his country be quickly accepted into the bloc amid Russia's invasion and has signed a formal application. But several EU countries, including Germany, have spoken out against fast-tracking Ukraine's bid for membership.

Ex-President Medvedev says sanctions will 'consolidate' Russian society

Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia's security council and former president, said that it is ""foolish"" to believe that Western sanctions could have an effect on the Kremlin.

Sanctions on Russian businesses will not cause popular discontent with the authorities, he told the RIA news agency, adding that they will instead lead citizens to support the government.

""It seems to me that those who make these decisions [to impose sanctions] don't understand our mentality; they don't understand the Russian worldview,"" Medvedev said.

""This isn't pressure on big business and entrepreneurs, but pressure on absolutely everyone [in Russia],"" he underlined, adding that this will lead to the ""consolidation of Russian society.""

The Kremlin has described Western sanctions as an ""economic war"" against Russia.

Medvedev served as Russia's president from 2008 to 2012 and as prime minister from 2012 to 2020.

Summary of events in Ukraine-Russia crisis on Thursday

During a press conference in Brussels on Thursday, US President Joe Biden asserted that NATO is more united than ever amid Russia's ongoing invasion. He announced over $2 billion (€1.8 billion) military aid for Ukraine and $1 billion in assistance for Ukrainians impacted by the war.

Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on Facebook that a total of 3,343 people were evacuated from Ukrainian cities via humanitarian corridors on Thursday.

The Canadian government said it would increase oil exports by roughly 5% as countries forgo Russian energy due to the attack on Ukraine.

Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya called on Belarusian troops to not get involved in Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Ukrainian lawmakers voted overwhelmingly in support of a measure to punish citizens who help Russian forces. Ukrainian collaborators could face up to 12 years in prison under the new law.

Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said that the battlefront is ""practically frozen."" He said Russian forces are ""practically at a standstill"" and claimed Russian troops lack the resources to advance their offensive.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reportedly told reporters in Brussels that Russia and Ukraine are in agreement on technical issues during peace talks, but said the two countries are divided on territorial issues such as the Crimean Peninsula.

Follow our live news updates on the Russia-Ukraine war.

BRUSSELS — President Biden and leaders of more than 30 nations convened Thursday to demonstrate united opposition to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, announcing new economic sanctions, aid for refugees, deployment of additional forces to Eastern Europe and grim preparations in case Russia uses chemical, biological or nuclear weapons.

But the historic gathering of world leaders in a series of three summits on Thursday underscored how the United States and its allies have in some ways reached their self-imposed limits in crafting a united global response to the largest European conflict in more than a half-century. While they are sharpening the tools they are using against Russia, they appear to have few new ones to reach for.

Mr. Biden and the allies have moved with unexpected speed and authority over the past four weeks, rallying much of the world against President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.

And yet, the sense of stalemate on the battlefield is now also felt in the halls of diplomacy, where taking dramatic new steps to counter Mr. Putin’s aggression is proving difficult. Europeans have said they are not willing to bear the consequences of new limits on the Russian energy that they depend on. And Mr. Biden has said he is not willing to commit troops to Ukraine and risk going to war against Russia.

As the allied leaders met in Brussels, the Ukrainian military, entering the second week of a counteroffensive, claimed on Thursday to have destroyed a Russian military landing ship in the southern port of Berdyansk. In the embattled towns around the capital, Kyiv, intense fighting had set so many fires on Thursday that the city was shrouded in a ghostly haze of white smoke.

Mr. Biden said the United States would accept 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, and he and his counterparts announced a new round of weapons shipments for Ukraine, but not the fighter jets that President Volodymyr Zelensky has pleaded for.

They expressed in one voice their “resolve to counter Russia’s attempts to destroy the foundations of international security and stability.” But they again declined to enforce a no-fly zone in the skies over Ukraine, which would mean readiness to shoot down Russian planes.

They vowed to tighten sanctions on Russia, but the Europeans stopped short of blocking imports of Russian oil and gas, as the United States has done. Europe is hugely dependent on Russian energy, paying Mr. Putin the vast revenues needed to support his military — and giving him the power to wreak havoc on Europe by disrupting supplies.

“I think we’re seeing a coordinated divergence between the European Union and the United States,” said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at Eurasia Group. “There’s no rupture or even a split. Rather, there is an agreement that the U.S. will go more aggressively than the E.U. because they can afford to do so.”

Speaking to reporters Thursday evening, Mr. Biden said that he had requested the emergency meetings — with leaders of NATO, the European Union and the Group of 7 industrialized nations — to show Mr. Putin that the allies will not “crack” in their determination to keep economic pressure on Russia over days, weeks, months and more.

“We have to stay fully, totally, thoroughly united,” he said, adding that he favors ejecting Russia from the Group of 20 industrialized and developing nations.

For Mr. Zelensky, though, none of it was enough. He has become more pointed in his criticism of Western restraint on military aid as Russian forces have savaged Ukrainian cities and towns, especially in the south.

Speaking by video to NATO leaders behind closed doors, Mr. Zelensky thanked them for their support but chided them for not doing more. He described his battered country, which is not a NATO member, as trapped “in the ‘gray zone’ between the West and Russia,” according to a transcript released by the Ukrainian government.

“On Feb. 24, I addressed you with a perfectly clear, logical request to help close our skies,” he said of his request for a no-fly zone over Ukraine to keep Russian planes away. “In any format. Protect our people from Russian bombs and missiles. We did not hear a clear answer.”

“And you see the consequences today,” he added a moment later. “How many people were killed, how many peaceful cities were destroyed?”

He repeated his appeal for warplanes, though the White House and the Pentagon have said that supplying them could give Russia a pretext for drawing NATO into a direct conflict. “You have thousands of fighter jets! But we haven’t been given any yet,” Mr. Zelensky said. “To save people and our cities, Ukraine needs military assistance — without restrictions.”

For NATO leaders, the high stakes of their meeting were evident in the joint statement issued at its conclusion. The 72-year-old alliance warned Russia against deploying “chemical, biological and nuclear weapons” in Ukraine, signaling a growing concern that Mr. Putin is willing to use them to advance his aggression or to falsely implicate Ukraine’s government.

Mr. Biden was cautious Thursday in his response to questions about the warning. He declined to say whether the United States or NATO would respond militarily if Russia used chemical weapons, which are banned by international treaty.

“We would respond if he uses it,” Mr. Biden said. “The nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use.”

But in warning about the threat from weapons of mass destruction, NATO’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said the organization was “enhancing allies’ preparedness and readiness for chemical, biological and nuclear threats.” It will provide detection equipment, protection and medical support to Ukraine, he said, along with training for decontamination and crisis management to deal with the impact of any use of weapons of mass destruction.

The alliance’s top military commander, Gen. Tod D. Wolters, “has activated NATO’s chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defense elements,” Mr. Stoltenberg added, placing on increased alert NATO teams that specialize in detecting and responding to contamination after a chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear attack. Member nations are taking similar steps.

Mr. Stoltenberg noted that the use of such weapons inside Ukraine could contaminate neighboring NATO countries.

“Many people fear that Russia will use such weapons and accuse Ukraine of doing it, so it is important to precisely determine who, where and when did it so there’s no ambiguity,” said Gustav Gressel, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.

The United States hit Russia with a new round of sanctions on Thursday, targeting more than 300 members of its Parliament and dozens of defense companies, while moving to restrict Russia’s ability to use gold reserves to prop up its currency. It also imposed sanctions on Herman Gref, a Putin ally and the president and chairman of Sberbank, one of Russia’s largest banks; the bank itself was sanctioned last month.

The economic actions, which came in conjunction with new sanctions from Western allies, were the latest attempt to inflict economic pain on Mr. Putin. The United States also moved to curtail Russia’s ability to evade existing restrictions on its central bank and major financial institutions, responding to concerns that Russia was finding ways to stabilize the ruble and rebuild its foreign currency reserves.

The Treasury Department is taking aim at alternative assets that Russia could use to support its economy. It issued new guidance on Thursday to make clear that transactions involving Russia’s $130 billion of gold reserves were also subject to U.S. sanctions. Russia built up its gold war chest in recent years to help blunt the impact of earlier sanctions by using the precious metal to buy currency or secure loans.

The U.S. is working to close that loophole by threatening penalties for anyone who facilitates such transactions.

Mr. Biden and European Union leaders are expected to announce an agreement to provide significant amounts of American liquefied natural gas to Europe this year, according to two European diplomats. They said the shipments could limit Europe’s reliance on Russian energy in the near term, and boost confidence in its ability to become less dependent over time.

“The question of course isn’t whether Europe has enough oil and gas for right now, but what happens next winter,” said Jacob F. Kirkegaard, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.

In addition to accepting 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, Mr. Biden announced that the United States would donate $1 billion to help European countries deal with the surge of people fleeing Russia’s invasion, White House officials said on Thursday.

Image A woman looks back toward Ukraine as she waits to cross into Poland, in the town of Medyka on Thursday. Credit... Lynsey Addario for The New York Times

A senior administration official said special efforts were being made to welcome Ukrainians who have family members in the United States.

An estimated four million Ukrainians have poured into Poland and other countries as Mr. Putin’s forces have bombarded civilian areas across Ukraine. Mr. Biden’s commitment would significantly increase the United States’ role in dealing with the unfolding humanitarian crisis.

On the battlefields, Ukrainian fighters have had some success this week in pushing Moscow’s much larger forces farther away from Kyiv and other cities, according to Western intelligence agencies, even as the bloody siege gripping the port of Mariupol has tightened. But many Ukrainian claims of gains have been impossible to verify, and brutal street fighting still echoes through some towns that Ukrainian forces claim to have recaptured.

Russia did not immediately comment on Ukraine’s claim to have destroyed a warship in Berdyansk, whose port Moscow has used to funnel reinforcements to Mariupol and across Ukraine’s eastern front. But British and U.S. officials confirmed that it was a strike by Ukrainian forces, and videos and photos reviewed by The New York Times confirmed that a Russian ship was ablaze in the port, and showed smoke rising from others.

“The destroyed ship in Berdyansk could carry up to 20 tanks, 45 armored personnel carriers and 400 paratroopers,” the Ukrainian deputy defense minister, Anna Malyar, said in a statement on Thursday. “This is a huge target that was hit by our military.”

The United Nations says that the war has forced more than 10 million Ukrainians, about one-fourth of the population, from their homes, including the “internally displaced” who have fled to safer parts of the country — Europe’s largest refugee crisis since World War II. The U.N. children’s agency reported on Thursday that they include 4.3 million children, more than half the children in Ukraine.

On Friday, Mr. Biden is expected to travel to Poland, in part to witness the surge of people taking refuge there. In his remarks to reporters, Mr. Biden hinted that he might travel to the border with Ukraine — something that officials have been unwilling to confirm.

“I’m not supposed to say, but anyway,” he said. “I hope I get to see a lot of people.”

2:35 a.m. One of the Kremlin's faces to the world, Russian President Vladimir Putin's special climate envoy Anatoly Chubais, has resigned.

6:00 p.m. The number of people fleeing Ukraine since the Russian invasion began has probably now reached 2.1 million to 2.2 million people, according to the head of the UNHCR, the United Nation's refugee agency. United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi says in a news conference during a visit to Stockholm that ""the time is now to try to help at the border"" rather than discuss how to distribute refugees between countries. Grandi added that Moldova, which is not a member of the European Union, in particular is facing a tide of refugees.

4:24 p.m. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says the bloc has bought enough liquefied natural gas that it should be independent of Russian imports up until the end of the winter.

5,2e23f853-0396-41e5-a43d-c56c84e5c073,"['Abc News', 'Patrick Reevell', 'March']",,"Ukraine's lead negotiator in peace talks with Russia has said he believes the negotiations with Moscow are ""absolutely real,"" but has warned it may take months to reach a deal to end the war.

Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior aide to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, spoke to ABC News inside the heavily guarded compound of the presidential office in central Kyiv. ABC News reporters were brought through several rings of security into the building's darkened corridors, piled with sandbags to protect against shelling and empty except for Ukrainian special forces soldiers armed with assault rifles standing every few yards.

Podolyak has been leading Ukraine's delegation at the talks that began within days after Russia's invasion. The first rounds were held in Belarus but recently the sides have switched to sessions by video link.

Podolyak said the talks are now taking place every day by video, mostly at the level of working groups. Both sides in the last week have said the talks are making progress and that they are moving closer to a compromise, despite intense ongoing fighting. Ukrainian and American officials though have expressed doubts whether Russia is negotiating in good faith or might be using the talks just to buy time for its forces to regroup to press on with its war.

But Podolyak said he was certain Russia was now genuinely negotiating, aware that it has no choice.

""They're absolutely real negotiations,"" Podolyak said. ""There's no attempt to stall for time. That's definitely not there.""

But he warned that reaching an agreement could still take ""months.""

Heavy losses inflicted on Russia, devastating Western sanctions and its failure to take any key cities, including Kyiv, have forced the Kremlin to moderate its demands, Podolyak said, meaning the two sides' positions are now far closer.

""Twenty-eight days of war have shown that Russia is not a country that can dictate conditions,"" he said. ""It seems to me they really do want to resolve some issues in negotiations, because there is the sanctions pressure, military pressure from Ukraine. We have already put them in their place.""

But he said that more pressure from Ukraine's military, as well as international sanctions, was still needed to push Russia into negotiating positions that would allow for an agreement.

Russia's core demand remains that Ukraine renounce its ambition to join NATO. In recent days, Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian officials have signaled they understand Ukraine will not join the alliance but have emphasized Ukraine wants security guarantees from Western countries to protect it from any future Russian aggression.

Last week, the Financial Times and The Washington Post reported Russia and Ukraine were discussing a 15-point peace plan that would see Ukraine give up its NATO ambitions and accept some limits on its military in return for security guarantees from allies like the U.S., U.K. and Turkey.

Russia is also demanding Ukraine recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea and the independence of two Russian-occupied separatist regions in eastern Ukraine, as well as legal provisions protecting the rights for the Russian language in Ukraine.

Podolyak denied there is a 15-point plan as reported, saying it simply represented Russia's proposals. He said both sides had ""several drafts"" outlining their own positions but there was no ""agreed project.""

Podolyak avoided saying whether Ukraine was now ready to give up its NATO ambitions, but stressed Ukraine is now seeking separate guarantees from willing NATO countries rather than membership in the alliance.

He suggested that such guarantees from Western countries were essential to Ukraine if it is to sign any agreement.

Those security guarantees appear a significant obstacle to a deal since it is unclear how any promise from a NATO country to defend Ukraine would differ from Ukraine de facto joining the alliance.

Asked what sort of guarantees Ukraine is seeking, Podolyak suggested as an example that it could be ""legally enshrined"" that a no-fly zone will be imposed over Ukraine in the event of a new Russian attack. He declined to say which NATO countries Ukraine was discussing such guarantees with, since negotiations are ongoing, but he did not deny the U.S. was among them.

Ukraine wants security guarantees so ""that Russia does not attack us in the future,"" he said. ""This requires not amorphous structures returning to the U.N., OSCE [Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe] or NATO, but effective alliances that will make it clear to Russia that it is not necessary to attack Ukraine's borders, as this will have very, very bad consequences.""

The U.S. and other NATO countries have already repeatedly ruled out imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine because it would lead to a direct conflict with Russia.

The Kremlin's spokesman said Tuesday the talks were progressing ""much more slowly and less substantively than we would like"" and Russia has insisted it will still achieve the goals set at the beginning of its operation against Ukraine.

Podolyak said that Russia's positions have already become far more ""appropriate,"" but that it still had ""illusions"" that Ukraine can be made to accept ultimatums.

The danger, he said, was that the two countries were now moving into a phase of bloody stalemate that would see Russia cause heavy civilian casualties before it was finally forced into accepting a compromise.

The timing to end the war, Podolyak said, would depend on how much Western support Ukraine now received. He said Ukraine needs more air defenses and anti-tank weapons and called for Western countries to impose a full embargo on Russian oil and stricter financial sanctions. The U.S. has sent hundreds of millions of dollars in weaponry to Ukraine, including a new $800 million cache now being delivered.

""I think right now they are in a state of shock and are trying to understand how low they might lower their demands so that we will start to agree with them on something,"" said Podolyak. ""It's a difficult process for them. For eight years they lived in illusions -- they thought they were world champions on the level with the United States.""

He said continuing pain inflicted by Ukraine's military and more sanctions would force Russia to come to terms with the reality of its position.

""Russia will become more and more adequate and will come to the negotiating position, which will allow for the signing of an agreement not only with Russia -- for there's no point to a peace agreement with Russia -- but a multilaterally guaranteed agreement, where first of all there will be guarantor countries,"" he said.",https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukraines-lead-negotiator-talks-russia-months/story?id=83626948

They are torn between sympathizing with Ukrainians fleeing their homes and cities destroyed by Russian weapons and remembering how the world looked away as the same weapons were recking havoc on Syria and Libya only a few years ago. Meanwhile, regional governments, including America’s traditional allies, are hedging their bets between Russia and the U.S.-led Western camp, playing on time to better evaluate the impacts of the war and to ease the restraints it is imposing on the fragile economies and social fabrics of the region.

Carnegie experts take a look at how countries across the Middle East and North Africa are responding to Russia’s war in Ukraine.

Egypt

The Russian war in Ukraine has presented the Egyptian government with two major, immediate challenges.

First, Egypt, the world’s top importer of wheat, sources 85 percent of its wheat supplies from Russia and Ukraine combined. Predictably, the disruption in Ukrainian wheat production and export chains, as well as the severe impacts of the sanctions imposed on Russian economic and trading activities, have sent wheat prices soaring. The Egyptian government will need to use more of its financial resources to secure wheat supplies and avoid threats to the country’s food security. This is partially due to the country’s high inflation, which is forecasted to rise 2.3 percentage points to 7.5 percent this year, and to the recent devaluation of the local currency. Another factor is the rising prices of basic goods, including bread, whose price is increasing due to previously announced subsidy reforms. Additional financial resources will probably be devoted to controlling bread prices for a population that suffers from a poverty rate of approximately 30 percent. The recent government announcement to expand wheat cultivation to 2 million acres by the end of 2024 is a viable medium-term strategy to bolster Egypt’s food security. It does not, however, ease the population’s immediate vulnerability resulting from the Ukraine war.

Second, the Egyptian government has developed close ties to Russia in recent years, comprising arms sales, cooperation to build a nuclear power plant in the northwest of Egypt, and growing economic and trade ties. Egypt has also found points of strategic convergence between its policy choices in Syria and Libya and the policy interests of the Russian government. Indeed, the Egyptian government has silently endorsed Russia’s military intervention in Syria and accepted its political objective: the continuation of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s rule. The two governments have furthermore supported General Khalifa Haftar and his allies in Libya and aided them militarily and financially.

However, Egypt’s growing ties with Russia and their policy convergence in Middle Eastern conflict zones have nonetheless not undermined the country’s strategic partnership with the United States and the European Union. The war in Ukraine has forced the Egyptian government to walk a fine line between Russia and the West, and diplomatic maneuvering has been high on the agenda of Egyptian policymakers in recent days. A few hours after its vote in the UN General Assembly to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Egyptian government issued a statement highlighting the urgent need to address the legitimate national security concerns of Russia in relation to Ukraine and criticizing the sanctions that the United States and Europe had imposed on Russia, citing them as illegitimate from an international law perspective. If the confrontation between Russia and the West continues to escalate, the Egyptian government will most likely see its ability to maneuver between the two sides diminish—with the necessity of a binary choice ultimately becoming more imminent.

Iran

The Russian invasion of Ukraine introduced a last-minute plot twist in the negotiations to revive the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.

Given that Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has prohibited Iranian diplomats from negotiating directly with the United States, Moscow has over the last year served as a key intermediary between Washington and Tehran, shepherding the nuclear negotiations to what had appeared to be a conclusion.

Karim Sadjadpour Karim Sadjadpour is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, where he focuses on Iran and U.S. foreign policy toward the Middle East. @ksadjadpour

Amid the sudden and severe global pressure campaign against Russia, however, Moscow reassessed its facilitation role and implicitly threatened to imperil the Iran nuclear deal to secure its own interests.

Russia—which has now eclipsed Iran as the world’s most sanctioned nation—wants the world to feel the economic pain of an embargo against Russian oil. A nuclear deal that ends the embargo against Iranian oil would mitigate the global financial consequences of Russia’s isolation.

Russian President Vladimir Putin also understands that reviving the Iran nuclear deal means much more to U.S. President Joe Biden than it does to him. Putin does not feel threatened by Iran’s nuclear advancement, and Tehran’s isolation has served Russian interests: Iran is dependent on second-rate Russian technology, is an adversary to the United States, is unable to exploit its vast energy resources, and is neglectful of its historic competition with Moscow in Central Asia. Indeed, one of Russia’s top scholars of Iran, Rajab Safarov, said in a recent interview that “a Western-oriented Iran would be worse for Russia than a nuclear-armed Iran, and would lead to Russia’s collapse.”

These Russian machinations have revived the historic mistrust that many Iranian citizens feel toward their predatory Russian neighbor to the north. In the 1800s, imperial Russia forcefully seized vast territories in the Caucasus from Iran. In 1946, Soviet forces occupied and sought to annex Iran’s northwestern province of Azerbaijan, only to be expelled thanks to the efforts of then U.S. president Harry Truman. Indeed, it is an anomaly of history that today Russia and Iran are strategic partners, while the United States and Iran are bitter adversaries.

Despite speculation that mutual mistrust of Russia may foster greater U.S.-Iran cooperation, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has not triggered any major geopolitical realignments but rather has served to strengthen existing global alliances. Absent a change of leadership in Moscow or Tehran, the two countries’ mutual isolation and aggrievement toward the West will ultimately make them more dependent on one another, not less.

—Karim Sadjadpour

Israel

Until Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett’s surprise three-hour meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on March 5, Israel’s reluctance to condemn Russian aggression against Ukraine—and mention Putin by name—had been attributed to its desire to avoid alienating Putin in Syria as well as its concern over the security and well-being of Russia’s 150,000 Jews. Almost since the beginning of the crisis, Israel had sought to hedge its bets. Jerusalem had parried Ukraine’s repeated requests for weapons, refused to join a UN Security Council resolution condemning the invasion (though it later joined an UN General Assembly vote), and refrained from making public statements denouncing Russia. Indeed, Foreign Affairs Minister Yair Lapid, who had been initially critical of Russia, refused to condemn the country by name in the wake of the attack on Kyiv that also damaged the Holocaust Memorial at Babyn Yar. Bennett, on the other hand, hasn’t condemned Russia since the invasion began. Israel, in response to growing U.S. pressure last week, issued more forceful condemnation of Russia and agreed to staunch the parade of Russian oligarchs coming in and out of Israel.

Aaron David Miller Aaron David Miller is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, focusing on U.S. foreign policy. More >

It now seems clear that part of Israel’s fence-sitting has been driven by Bennett’s desire to leave open the possibility of Israel playing a mediating role in the crisis. Indeed, both Zelensky and Putin have met with him numerous times. But if Putin were interested in a deal, it’s highly unlikely he’d allow Israeli officials to deliver it, preferring instead to extract concessions from the United States and NATO. Bennett, moreover, needs to be wary of becoming a pawn in Putin’s game of lies and fabrications. Nonetheless, Israel’s interest in straddling the Putin-West divide is likely to continue. Syria remains a key interest, and Russia has been a central actor in affording Israel a wide margin for action against Iranian and Hezbollah assets there.

Israel’s balancing act in response to the Ukraine crisis, however, may grow more untenable over time. Several U.S. partners in the Middle East, including the UAE and Saudi Arabia, are also hedging and remain concerned about alienating Putin. But these countries aren’t democracies, nor do they have the history of persecution that has linked the state of Israel and the Jewish people to Europe’s bloody past. As a close U.S. ally, Israel may well be forced to choose—especially if Ukraine should somehow devolve into conflict between a U.S.-led NATO alliance and Russia.

—Aaron David Miller

Libya

In Libya, the Ukraine crisis will have far-reaching geostrategic, political, and humanitarian effects—and it comes at an especially fraught moment in the country’s post-revolutionary era.

The 2019–2020 civil war saw Russian mercenaries from the Kremlin-linked Wagner Group, along with regular military personnel, intervene on behalf of eastern-based militia commander Khalifa Haftar. The war ended with thousands of Russian fighters, along with advanced warplanes and other military equipment, firmly ensconced around oil fields and in air bases across the country.

Frederic Wehrey Frederic Wehrey is a senior fellow in the Middle East Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, where his research focuses on governance, conflict, and security in Libya, North Africa, and the Persian Gulf. More >

In the midst of the Ukraine conflict, these Russian forces—counterbalanced by hundreds of Turkish advisers and thousands of Turkish-backed Syrian mercenaries in western Libya—have not withdrawn in large numbers. For one, they now provide Russia with strategic leverage on NATO’s southern flank, as well as the ability to hold at risk oil production. Moreover, their presence on Libyan territory has given Moscow a springboard for disruptive power projection into the Sahel countries to the south. That said, as Russia’s losses in Ukraine continue to mount, it will likely be compelled to transfer Wagner Group personnel and military hardware from Libya to the Ukraine front.

Russian-Turkish coordination in Libya has been one of the checks on the eruption of another round of nationwide fighting among Libyan factions. In the short term, this arrangement is likely to endure, as both Moscow and Ankara still have an interest in using diplomatic maneuvering to secure their economic and political goals in Libya. And Turkey, despite its military support to Ukraine, is leery of opening additional theaters of confrontation with Russia and has recently positioned itself as a mediator. Over the long term, however, this restraint could diminish in Libya, especially if Russia decides to escalate, if Turkey takes a harder line due to a reinvigorated NATO, or if competing Libyan camps eventually resort to military force. This latter risk has increased with the recent standoff in Tripoli between two rival claimants to the office of prime minister, though for now jockeying and dealmaking carry the day.

Beyond these strategic effects, the prolongation of the Ukraine war will cause mounting economic hardships for Libyan citizens. This is especially evident in growing food insecurity: Libya imports about 75 percent of its wheat from either Ukraine or Russia and, with limited wheat reserves, it will be forced to pay a premium to lock in alternate suppliers like Brazil and Argentina. The resulting spike in bread prices could put additional public pressure on the already ineffective government in Tripoli.

On the energy front, initial expectations for increased demand for Libyan crude stemming from the war in Ukraine have been offset by the projected slowdown in global economic growth, as well as the periodic weaponization of oil flows by Libyan factions, evident recently in the brief shutdown of two major oil fields by an armed group.

Palestine

Palestinian reactions to events following the Russian invasion of Ukraine have been conflicted.

Certainly, Palestinians experienced a sense of solidarity with Ukrainians. Palestinians in Gaza, in particular, know all too well the horror of watching an occupying army reduce apartment buildings to rubble or what it means to be deprived of water, electricity, and communications infrastructure as collective punishment. And most Palestinian families have either seven decades of experience living as refugees or have experienced repeated forced displacement and the pain of having to flee from homes with children, not knowing when or if they would return.

Zaha Hassan Zaha Hassan is a human rights lawyer and a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. More >

Though Palestinians naturally identified with Ukrainians, they could not relate to the swiftness and clarity with which the international community responded to Russian aggression, not in the affirmation that Ukrainian resistance—in all its forms—was legitimate and heroic nor in the acknowledgment that the international community has a responsibility to take countermeasures. In fact, the United States has actively opposed civil society–led boycotts supporting Palestinian human rights as well as diplomatic and legal initiatives at the UN and the ICC to end Israel’s occupation of Palestinian land.

The incoherency of U.S. policy was illustrated most recently at the UN Human Rights Council when U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken found himself calling on the council to lay off of Israel while also demanding accountability against Russia. Only days into the Russian invasion, the United States imposed export controls over Russian oil refiners, banned Russian airliners from U.S. airspace, made plans to seize assets of Russian oligarchs, and supported ICC action against Russian officials. Some congresspersons also want to deny visa benefits to Russian students. Yet, U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration continues to not only import goods produced in illegal Israeli settlements—effectively contraband—but it does so duty-free with the label “Made in Israel.” The United States also grants tax-exempt status to NGOs that support settlements in the occupied West Bank. Not only does the Biden administration oppose boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) movements against Israel, but it has also embraced a definition of anti-Semitism that treats criticism of Israel’s occupation policies as a form of hate speech.

The politicization of accountability and the exceptionalization of Israel, even while it further entrenches apartheid, has not been lost on Russia. This is likely to challenge Biden’s efforts to restore respect for the rules-based international order and the normative framework upon which it was built.

Saudi Arabia

Saudi Arabia doesn’t want to lose a partner in Moscow for the sake of its friends in Washington. After the launch of the current Russian war in Ukraine, Saudi leadership is more than hedging to send a message to U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration, and it isn’t oblivious to the price of taking sides in this conflict. Although the decision to diversify the kingdom’s group of international partners was made in a period of post–Iraq invasion tensions with the United States, it has become an established policy that concerns the West as well as Russia.

For example, in 2007 Vladimir Putin became the first Russian leader to officially visit Saudi Arabia. Ten years later, King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud became the first Saudi king to officially pay a state visit to Russia. Other visits and bilateral meetings led by his son and crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, followed. When Putin revisited the kingdom in 2019, relations between the two countries were advancing slowly but surely. Noticeably, the visit came at a time when Saudi Arabia’s relations with the West were extremely strained over the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. In 2021, the two countries signed an agreement on military cooperation.

Yasmine Farouk Yasmine Farouk is a nonresident scholar in the Middle East Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. More > @YasFarouk

The progress in Saudi-Russian relations, however, was always in the shadow of the kingdom’s relationship with the United States, as shown by the unfulfillment, at least so far, of Saudi Arabia’s 2017 plan to purchase Russian defense systems. Saudi Arabia shares incomparable vital interests with the United States, yet its political value system is closer to Russia’s, despite the significantly lower density and slower pace of economic, political, and military relations between them. Washington’s reactions to Saudi Arabia’s policies over the past two years, as well as the current identity framing of Russia’s war on Ukraine as “the battle between democracy and autocracies,” put the kingdom in the same camp as Russia.

Beyond a harmony between like-minded authoritarian strongmen in Riyadh and Moscow, the two countries have compatible sovereign national interests and few but significant foreign policy positions, like in Yemen. Most important among those is the OPEC+ agreement that the two governments are leading and that has two significant consequences for Saudi Arabia: First, it is fueling a rebound from the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, it is the foremost Saudi leverage in an uneasy relationship with Biden.

As Saudi Arabia struggles with trust issues in its relationship with the United States, it also can’t completely count on Moscow. Putin has indeed proven to be a reliable ally to his authoritarian friends, such as Syria’s Bashar al-Assad—while the United States let Egypt’s former president Hosni Mubarak, and the shah of Iran before him, fall. But Putin is not willing to sacrifice Russia’s relationship with Iran, Saudi Arabia’s staunchest enemy, and has proved willing to pressure Saudi Arabia in the oil market. If push comes to shove, Saudi Arabia will continue to choose the United States over Russia, but Riyadh is making sure that Washington will no longer take it for granted.

Syria

The war in Ukraine is a deep blow to relations between Russia and the West, and there will be no going back to the way things were. However, its impact on Syria will be very limited in geostrategic and security terms. That said, what is now more certain than before is that Russia’s presence in Syria is not a mere strategic interest for Moscow but an existential necessity.

Russia’s military presence in western Syria should be considered in two contexts: the first is the context of the Syrian war and its regional dimensions, and the second is Syria’s position overlooking the eastern Mediterranean Sea.

In Syria, the Kremlin has played a role as both mediator and negotiator in recent years. The UN-sponsored political process was carried out with Russian facilitation, which Moscow offered in order to persuade Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime to engage in talks with the opposition. Russian officials simultaneously pushed for a new framework for a security settlement between Ankara and Damascus along the Turkish-Syrian border. These two tracks—political and security—have both stopped now, and the Syrian conflict has entered a period of stalemate.

Meanwhile, since 2015, Russian military presence in the Hmeimim air base in Syria, overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, has been highly strategic. Not only does it overlook gas exploration projects in the eastern Mediterranean, but it also allows Russia to exert influence outside the former Soviet republics, representing a break in Russia’s isolation from the international community. This area is also located in the heart of the Middle East and is in direct contact with regional countries, including the Gulf Arab states, Egypt, Israel, and Turkey.

Both the political process in Syria and the Russian military base afford Moscow major importance in the Middle East which cannot be ignored. The Kremlin has become increasingly involved in the Arab region through its protection of the Assad regime and its regional alliances, all of which will have deep consequences in the long term. But at the same time, this involvement comes at a cost. The region is facing a significant transformation in its political order, creating an unstable security environment that will put additional pressure on the Kremlin and compel it to become more engaged on a local level.

Tunisia

Tunisia has felt the impact of Russia’s war in Ukraine in two primary ways: economically and diplomatically. Tunisia, whose economy is already under tremendous strain, receives nearly 80 percent of its wheat from Ukraine. As a result of the conflict, wheat prices in Tunisia are the highest they have been in fourteen years, making it even harder for Tunisian families to afford bread and other staples. Tunisians are also feeling the pain of the global rise in oil prices. The Tunisian government, which subsidizes fuel, planned its budget around an oil price of $75 per barrel. But with oil prices around $100 per barrel, the government was forced to raise fuel prices twice in February in an attempt to rein in the country’s massive budget deficit.

Tunisia is in the midst of negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) over a package that would help address these and myriad other economic challenges facing the country, such as skyrocketing unemployment. But President Kais Saied’s July 25, 2021, power grab and subsequent authoritarian backsliding has put the country on thin ice with Western donors, complicating IMF negotiations. Furthermore, Saied’s relationship with the West has been made worse by Tunisia’s diplomatic response to the Russian invasion. Tunisia, like many of its Arab neighbors, is attempting to walk the fine line between maintaining a good relationship with Russia, upon whom it relies on heavily for tourism as well as trade, and avoiding alienating the United States and Europe, whose financial and diplomatic support will be crucial to keep Tunisia’s economy afloat.

On the diplomatic front, Tunisia’s failure to vociferously oppose the Russian invasion of Ukraine has drawn the ire of the West. On February 28, the EU ambassador to Tunisia called out Tunisia’s attempt at neutrality, stating that “remaining neutral between the aggressor and the victim is taking a stand.” Tunisia did vote in favor of the March 2 UN General Assembly resolution denouncing the Russian invasion of Ukraine. But upon receiving the new Russian ambassador to Tunisia a few days later, Tunisian Foreign Minister Othman Jerandi highlighted the importance of the bilateral relationship between the two countries and Tunisia’s desire to strengthen that relationship—not exactly the cool reception the West is seeking for Russia.

Saied’s government should carefully consider what price it is willing to pay for continuing to cozy up to Russia in the face of a united and strong Western opposition. At such a delicate time, Tunisia’s waffling on Russia might bear a cost the country cannot withstand.

Turkey

As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues, a central feature of its strategy has become clear: controlling the Black Sea coastline. This would landlock Ukraine; establish continuity between Russia and the breakaway Transnistria region in Moldova, where Russian forces are already present; and ultimately tilt the military balance in the Black Sea further in Russia’s favor.

Prior to its invasion of Ukraine, Russia had already fortified its naval presence in the Black Sea and, after annexing Crimea in 2014, deployed anti-access and area denial (A2/AD) capabilities and missile systems there, largely establishing superiority in the maritime and air domains. Now, it is reaching for greater dominance.

As a regional NATO ally, Turkey should be wary of this. Both imperial Russia and the Ottoman Empire have a history of military confrontation. While announcing his decision to invade Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin made his point by referencing Russia’s defeat of the Ottomans and conquest of the lands surrounding the Black Sea.

In 2016, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan complained about the Black Sea turning into a “Russian lake” and cited NATO’s insufficient presence. Turkey’s relations with Russia, however, have warmed considerably since then; nowadays, Ankara prefers to stay mute on the issue.

That said, Russia’s invasion has upset Turkey’s plans to widen its engagement with Ukraine, including in the defense industry. The Turkish economy is in crisis, and Turkey is exposed to Russian antagonism through both its energy dependency and, crucially, Moscow’s ability to pull strings in Syria, handicapping Ankara. Turkey has nevertheless stood firm and called Russia’s invasion an act of war, rejected the premise of its invasion, and even closed the Turkish Straits to naval vessels. It has, however, been careful to stay away from sanctions so as not to burn bridges with Moscow. This is understandable but does not obviate the need for Turkey to strategize against Russia’s extended reach in the Black Sea. It can do so without escalating, in three ways.

Rigorously enforce closing the straits. Russia will test Turkey’s resolve, and Ankara will have to stand by its decision as long as a state of war exists. It could also serve Turkey well to scrutinize Russian attempts to abuse the provisions of the Montreux Convention on submarine transits. Enhance efforts to collate and share data with allies. Maritime and air situational awareness in the Black Sea have become even more critical. Fill in NATO capability shortfalls. Turkey can help fill gaps in NATO’s standing naval forces that patrol the Black Sea and support NATO deployments in the future according to the Montreux Convention.

Regional Implications

The Russian invasion of Ukraine is impacting the Middle East and North Africa region in three principal areas: political negotiations and military action, humanitarian aid and food security, and gas and oil supplies.

Politically, the crisis has not yet forced any significant realignments. Rather, various countries, including the Gulf and Israel, are hedging their bets between the United States and Russia and seeking to maximize gains in key areas of interest. However, long-term sanctions on Russia will be challenging for Middle Eastern countries like Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, all of whom have been diversifying their defense industries and seeking greater cooperation with Russia.

Syria and Libya, the two arenas where U.S.-Russia cooperation is most needed for sustainable political outcomes, are likely to suffer. Today, that cooperation is less probable than ever before. Russia’s considerable military footprint in both countries and its increasing political and economic isolation may drive it to be a disrupter of ongoing efforts to address political divisions in Libya and to be even more supportive of the Syrian and Iranian regimes than it has been in the past. For Europe, a sizable Russian military presence on its southern flank in Libya is worrisome. Meanwhile, both Turkey and Israel are troubled by the prospect of future Russian action in Syria. Turkey is concerned that Russia could increase pressure in the rebel enclave Idlib, triggering an influx of refugees. Syria’s Kurdish population is worried that a U.S.-Turkey trade-off in this larger geopolitical tussle would come at their expense. Israel is concerned with growing Russia-Iran cooperation and possible limits on its aerial bombardments of Iranian targets in Syria.

There are also increasing concerns over humanitarian aid and food security in the region, especially in already fragile countries. The growing number of Ukrainian refugees and the ballooning costs of post-conflict reconstruction are raising concerns that critical humanitarian aid may be diverted from the Middle East and North Africa to address the fallout from the Ukraine conflict. For the millions of Palestinians, Lebanese, Yemenis, Syrians, and others who live in countries experiencing conflict, catastrophic economic meltdowns, and increasing humanitarian needs, this would be equivalent to shutting down critical life support. This crisis is also aggravated by significant concerns around food security, especially in countries like Lebanon and Egypt, which rely on Russia and Ukraine for their wheat supplies (comprising 96 and 85 percent of supplies respectively). This crisis is likely to worsen as food and energy prices skyrocket globally. In time this may drive people back to the streets in protest.

The future of gas and oil supplies is critical. Europe will likely seek to build up alternate gas supplies, and therein lies an opportunity for Gulf and Eastern Mediterranean countries. Gulf countries are currently gaining from the increase in oil prices and are leveraging this situation to renegotiate their strategic relationship with the United States and to pursue political gains in places like Yemen. The question here is: will this drive East Mediterranean countries to speed up some agreements on promising gas supplies with the hope of becoming a key partner for Europe in the future?

Much remains to be seen in this conflict whose trajectory has signaled a long-term shift in global relations. What will Russian President Vladimir Putin’s future actions be if he feels more isolated and maligned internationally—and will he try to leverage various pressure points in the region to get what he wants elsewhere?

Geopolitical Implications

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing embargo of Russian products—which includes its oil exports—have brought oil prices to pre–August 2014 levels, well above $100 a barrel. With other oil producers’ production capacity also hampered for various reasons, oil prices may remain high for some time. This development is perhaps most important geopolitically for countries in the Middle East.

Oil-producing countries in the region, most notably Saudi Arabia, have been forced in recent years to adopt long-needed economic reform measures to move away from rentier economies and a welfare state model. Indeed, the question for them remains whether their newly accumulated financial reserves will turn the clock back on economic reform in favor of short-term political gains—or whether the lesson will be learned that economic reform is a must, regardless of oil prices.

Oil-importing countries will also be severely affected. While high oil prices will pose further risks to already dire economic conditions, some of these challenges were mitigated in the past through grants made possible by oil-producing countries. It is not clear whether such grants will be resumed as political alliances have shifted, plunging some oil-importing countries like Jordan into increased economic peril.

While the official position of most Arab countries at the UN was to condemn the Russian invasion, public reaction has been mixed. Some have justifiably wondered why there have not been equally strong international reactions against the Israeli occupation of Palestinians or the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Some comments made in the West—that Ukrainian refugees are “like us”—have also elicited justified accusations of Western racism. Such reactions from the Middle East, while understandable, have so far ignored the fact that selective condemnation of the use of force to occupy other nations is a two-way street: for example, Israel could use this discrepancy to justify its occupation of Arab land. This reaction also ignores the plight of the Ukrainian people, who are also suffering from war and occupation.

Thus, most countries in the region, including Israel, have attempted to tread carefully and have exhibited a subdued reaction against the invasion. Maintaining such a position will become increasingly difficult as the war and its repercussions continue.

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

How you can help: Here are ways those in the U.S. can help support the Ukrainian people as well as what people around the world have been donating.
